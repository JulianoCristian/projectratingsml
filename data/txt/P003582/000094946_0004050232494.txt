PROJECT
(LOAN 3337-CHA/CREDIT 2256-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Irrigated Agriculture
Intensification Project in China, ifor which a loan in the amount of US$147.1 million and
a credit in the amount of SDR 139 million ($187.9 million equivalent) were approved on
June 4, 1991, and made effective on September 9, 1991.
The loan and credit were fully disbursed, with the final disbursement taking place
on December 28, 1998. Total disbursements amounted to $139 million and SDR 147.1
million.
The ICR was prepared by rnissions comprising Lang S. Tay (Task Manager),
Qun Li (Consultant, Economist), Naoya Fujimoto (Consultant, Irrigation Engineer) and
Peter Ting (Consultant, Agronomist) during 1997. However, completion of the final ICR
was deferred so that Jiangsu could complete its component, which was extended for 18
months. The Anhui and Shandong Components were completed earlier in 1997. The
ICR was reviewed by Geoffrey B. Fox, Sector Manager, EASRD. The Borrower
provided comments, which are included as Annex A to the ICR.
Preparation of the ICR was based on materials in the project files and meetings
with project staff in the field. The Borrower contributed with views and data requested,
its own evaluation of the project's execution, and comments on the draft ICR.

IRRIGATED AG:RICULTURE INTENSIFICATION
PROJECT
(LOAN 3337-CHA/CREDIT 2256-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.  The main objectives of the project were to increase agricultural production and
incomes of some 2.8 million famning households in Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong
provinces. These objectives were achieved through: (a) improvement and expansion of
irrigation and drainage facilities to some 1.17 million hectares (1.14 million ha at
appraisal) of low- and medium-yield cropland covering sections of 76 counties (73
counties at appraisal) in Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces; (b) provision of
agricultural inputs and support services to increase production; (c) provision of
institutional strengthening and development in technical skills, project implementation
and management through technical assistance, operational research and training
programs; and (d) implementation of an environmental monitoring and management
program to sustain the project's agricultural productivity
Implementation Experiences and Results
2.   The whole project was successfully completed by the end of 1998. The Anhui and
Shandong components were completed before the end of 1997 and the Jiangsu
component was completed at the end of 1998 after two extensions of the closing date of
nine months each. The Anhui component and, to a smaller extent, the Jiangsu component
were affected by floods in 1991 and 1996. The total project cost was estimated at $643.7
million at completion compared to $593.1 million at appraisal. The overall economic
rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 26.6 percent at completion compared to 26.5
percent estimated at appraisal.
3.  Irrigation and drainage facilities were provided to a total of 1,166,859 ha (632,449)
ha improvement and 534,410 ha expansion) compared to 1,143,400 ha at appraisal, an
increase of 23,459 ha or 2.0 percent. Four major pumping stations and a computerized
water management monitoring-system were completed to upgrade water transfer and
irrigation management for the Grand Canal under the Jiangsu component.
4.   Each project province completed satisfactorily its package of complementary
agricultural support services, thereby strengthening and expanding the agricultural



- v -
support service systems in the project areas. These included upgrading and new
construction of 96 county centers and 358 township stations for agricultural extension,
quality seed processing facilities for supplying 477,756 tons of seeds for various main
crops, 22,080 sets of agricultural machinery and equipment for county and township
agricultural machinery services centers and stations, leveling of 372,699 ha and deep
plowing of 433,889 ha of existing cropland, and supply of 788,800 tons of Di-ammonium
Phosphate (DAP) and urea fertilizers.
5.    The investment in the irrigated agriculture intensification project has brought
benefits in terms of increased agricultural yields, production and farming household
income. The project was successful in rehabilitating and expanding about 18 main
irrigation schemes in three provinces, improving and expanding irrigation areas totaling
1,166,859 ha (319,942 ha in Anhui, 438,485 ha in Shandong and 408,432ha in Jiangsu).
At project completion, agricultural output and yields for major crops on the newly
irrigated land have exceeded substantially the SAR-projected yields and production at the
full development year 2002. The annual crop output increased by 3,863,400 tons during
1997/1998. The annual net value of incremental production was estimated at about
Y 1,717 million in Anhui, Y 944.5 million in Jiangsu and Y 769.4 million in Shandong.
The increased outputs from various crops resulted in higher incomes for about 2.8 million
farming households in Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong project areas. The average per
capita income of the households engaging in crop production was raised from Y 713 to Y
1,712 in Anhui, Y 603 to Y 2,269 in Jiangsu and Y 684 to Y 1,820 in Shandong,
respectively (the average per capita incomes estimated at appraisal were based on 1990
prices and that at project completion were based on 1998 prices). In real terms (1998
prices) the incomes achieved have exceeded the SAR-projected income for the full
development year by 18 percent in Anhui, 92 percent in Jiangsu and 30 percent in
Shandong. Overall, the project benefits has been achieved or exceeded the anticipated
economic and social benefit targets.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
6.   Overall Finding. The project's overall outcome is considered to be
"Satisfactory" despite the 18-month extension given to the Jiangsu component to
complete its computerized water management system on the Grand Canal, which was
delayed due to the complexity of design, International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
bidding, processing and evaluation. Physical targets projected were achieved and were
exceeded slightly in the irrigation and drainage, and the agricultural support services
subcomponents. The projected agricultural production and farm incomes were also
generally achieved.
7.   Project Impacts. The increased production and incomes from the project areas
have generated great interest and demands for similar project facilities among the
neighboring nonproject counties. This has led to Bank financing of another similar
project (Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Project II, Loan No.4354-CHA) in May
1998, covering some 1.5 million ha of low- and medium-yield cropland in Anhui,
Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei and Henan provinces. The project activities and increased
incomes generated also induced development and growth of the local economy through
various service and supply sectors, increased demands for consumer goods, construction



- vi -
of new and renovation of housing, shops and office buildings. The increased revenue
derived from increased agricultural and production taxes from the project areas enable the
local governments to invest in basic infrastructure and other social amenities, all of which
contributed to the overall improvement of the quality of life of the project beneficiaries.
The improved and expanded irrigation and drainage facilities, land and soil improvement,
and afforestation enhanced the general ecological environment of the project areas.
8    Sustainability. The project is rated as "Likely Sustainable." The project
continues to have the commitment and support of the government at all levels. The
project works were well planned, designed and constructed to the desired standards.
Operation and maintenance (O&M) systems are in place with adequate resources
provided by the governments. Project beneficiaries (farmers) are actively participating in
the operation and maintenance of the lower levels of the irrigation systems through
contribution of labor for undertaking annual communal works. Projected agricultural
yields and production have already been achieved and these would continue to increase
with the strengthened and expanded agricultural support services established under the
project.
9.   Future Operations. The future operations will focus essentially on efficient
operation and maintenance of the completed works and facilities to achieve the project's
full development. The existing project management offices and staff are being
maintained for this purpose and O&M responsibilities will be defined for different levels
of management, including initiating turnover of works and facilities. Agricultural
production will be progressively adapted toward a market-oriented economy with a self-
supporting operation mechanism, responsible for its own profits and losses. Each
province will recover project costs from the project beneficiaries,. mainly through the
collection of appropriate irrigation charges and service fees.
10. Lessons Learned. The key lesson learned are: (a) improvement and expansion of
irrigation and drainage facilities to existing low- and medium-yield cropland proved to be
cost-effective and achieved benefits in a relatively short period; (b) firm commitment and
support by government at all levels, and active participation by stakeholders and project
beneficiaries are essential for the smooth implementation, success and sustainability of
the project; (c) keeping project sub-components to a minimum avoids complexity in
project preparation and implementation, and optimizes use of resources of the Borrower
and the Bank; (d) presetting of investment and unit cost ceilings by government prevents
achievement of greater project benefits; and (e) participating counties should be selected
based on their ability to contribute capital construction funds, and willingness to recover
project cost, repay loans and undertake O&M of completed works and facilities.

IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE INTENSIFICATION
PROJECT
(LOAN 3337-CHA/CREDIT 2256-CHA)
PART 1: PROJEICT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Project Objectives and Description
1.    The principal objective of the project was to assist the Government in increasing
agricultural production and thereby increasing farm incomes for some 2.8 million rural
families in Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces. This was achieved through: (a)
improvement and expansion of irrigation and drainage facilities to some 1.17 million ha
(1. 14 million ha at appraisal) of low- and medium-yield land covering sections of 76
counties' in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong; (b) provision of a
complementary package of integrated agricultural inputs and support services to increase
production; (c) provision of institutional strengthening and development in technical
skills, project implementation arnd management through technical assistance, operational
research and training programs; and (d) implementation of an environmental monitoring
management program to sustain the projected agricultural productivity.
2.    The project concept and objectives were essentially based on the earlier
successful IDA-financed project., the North China Plain Agriculture Project (NCAP)
(Cr. 1261-CHA), which covered three counties each in the provinces of Anhui, Shandong
and Henan. Many of the successful NCAP features were duplicated in the overall project
planning and design of this project.
B. Implementation Experiences and Results
3.    General. The project was implemented without encountering any major
problems and completed according to schedule. The Anhui and Shandong components
were virtually completed by the end of 1997 except for the Jiangsu component. The
Jiangsu component was extended 18 months to enable it to complete its only outstanding
item on the Grand Canal Water Management Monitoring System, which was delayed due
to the complexity in planning and design and protracted procurement, bid evaluation and
award. The project achieved its objectives in the three project provinces with many of
the physical targets exceeding the original estimates. The overall project economic rate
of return (ERR) achieved at completion was re-estimated at 26.6 percent which
Three counties were added to the Jiangsu Component during the Mid-Term Review (MTR), making a
total of 76 counties.



compared favorably to 26.5 percent estimated at appraisal. The respective ERRs for the
three provinces are: Anhui 24.6 percent (SAR 26.4 percent), Jiangsu 28.1 percent (SAR
28.7 percent) and Shandong 29.6 percent (SAR 24 percent). Due primarily to inflation
and devaluation of the local currency Yuan against the Dollar, the total project cost
expressed in Dollar, increased by $50.6 million or 8.5 percent from $593.1 million
estimated at appraisal to $643.7 million at completion.

Physical Results
4.    (a) Irrigation and Drainage. The irrigation and drainage works constructed in
the three provinces under the project resulted in improving 632,449 ha of existing and
expanding 534,410 ha of new irrigation areas, making a total of 1,166,859 ha (compared
to an SAR total estimate of 1,143,400 ha), an increase of 23,459 ha or 2.0 percent. The
breakdown by province is summarized in the following table.

5.    The improved and newly constructed irrigation facilities have improved irrigation
efficiency and water management by reducing the irrigation cycle days through more
positive and assured water supply, reducing seepage losses through canal lining, and
providing more resistance to drought conditions. Notably, under the Jiangsu
component, the upgrading and the new construction of four major pumping stations on
the Grand Canal System reduced the water deficit in northern Jiangsu from about 660 to
200 million cubic meters (m3) per year, with more water being diverted northward from
the Yangtze River. The increased water diversion also improved inland navigation along
the Grand Canal. In Shandong Province, the rehabilitation and new construction of
tubewell irrigation systems benefited about 170,185 ha through more optimum use of
groundwater resources. In surface irrigation, Shandong successfully completed the
Yellow River water diversion schemes for Changkai Irrigation Area (13,300 ha), Xiezhai
Irrigation Area (63,000 ha), Shengli Qu Irrigation Area (32,000 ha) and 160,000 ha
around the Nansi Lake. Anhui Province completed construction of 2,164 stage I and II
pumping stations, 30 million m3 of earthworks excavation for canal networks, 5,400 new
tubewells and rehabilitation of 7,828 existing tubewells, thereby improving a total of
about 93,000 ha of existing irrigation area and expanding another 227,000 ha. In
addition, Anhui also successfully completed the Beifei and the Qian River Subproject and
the Yingshang Zhangou Subproject. During the 1996 flood, the Befei/Qian River Sub-
Projects protected 3,000 ha of cropland from flood inundation and prevented flood
damages estimated at Y 11.5 million, which exceeded the capital investment cost of the
subprojects. Similarly, the Yingshang Zhangou Pumping Scheme completed in 1995
prevented flood damages to about 4,670 ha of cropland during the 1996 flood.
6.   (b) Agricultural Support Services. Each province satisfactorily completed its
package of complementary agricultural support services, thereby strengthening and
expanding the agricultural support services systems in the project areas. In Anhui
Province, the agrotechnical extension services system was strengthened with
construction of 10 new county centers and 44 township stations, rehabilitation of 16
county centers and 91 township stations, provision of 3,222 sets of extension equipment,
including the supply of 48,688 tons of quality seeds and introduction of over 100 new
production technologies. Some 800 sets of machinery and equipment were purchased for
quality seed processing, drying and grading, and 5,670 tractors of various horsepower
were purchased to strengthen the agrimechanization, which resulted in the leveling of
184,000 ha and deep-plowing of 154,000 ha of cropland. In Shandong Province, under
the agrotechnical extension, one provincial center, 28 county centers and 223 township
stations, and 5 city/prefecture agroenvironmental training centers were established. For
agricultural inputs, 28 seed companies, 7 cotton quality seed processing plants, and 5
fertilizer blending plants were constructed. A total of 290,611 tons of quality seeds was
produced. A total of 117,600 tons of Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) and 28,500 tons of
urea were procured and distributed to the project area. Some 6,288 sets of agricultural
machinery and equipment were purchased and operated to raise further the level of farm
mechanization. On land and soil improvement, some 193,919 ha of cultivated land were
deep-plowed and some 75,656 hba leveled. In Jiangsu Province, 12 fertilizer blending
plants were constructed to produce blended fertilizer for different crops, using 343,800
tons of urea as the base fertilizer. Land and soil were improved through land leveling of
112,783 ha and deep plowing of 85,856 ha. The agricultural extension system was
strengthened by upgrading existing and constructing a total of 298 county centers and



- 4 -
township stations with additional facilities and equipment. Some 1,170 new production
technologies were introduced. The quality seed production system was also strengthened
with construction of 161,400 square meters (mi2) of county seed centers, , stores and
drying yards. A total of 112,380 tons quality seeds was produced for major crops. A
total of 61 pest forecasting stations was established and 3.3 tons of agrochemicals
procured. The agrimechanization was expanded with 10,120 sets of machinery and
equipment of various types and sizes. A total of 260 agrimachinery services stations was
constructed and upgraded, including provision of 17,742 sets of equipment for machinery
service and repair.
Agricultural Benefits
7.    Together with Government reform policy (free market, production incentives, and
promotion of market economy) the project has brought significant benefits in terms of
increased agricultural yields and production. The project was successful in rehabilitating
and expanding about 18 main irrigation schemes in three provinces, improving and
expanding irrigation areas totaling 1,166,859 ha (319,942 ha in Anhui, 438,485 ha in
Shandong and 408,432ha in Jiangsu). At project completion major grain crops (wheat,
maize and rice) have generally exceeded the SAR-projected yields and production for the
full development year 2002. Vegetable crops in Anhui and Shandong have substantially
exceeded the SAR targets due to strong domestic market demand.

Table 6 of Part II shows the area cultivated, yields and production achieved for each main
crop in three subproject areas.
9.    The total annual crop oulput increased by 3,863,400 tons during 1997/1998, in
which about 648,300 tons for wheat, 670,500 tons for maize, 3,300 tons for rice, 206,500
tons for rape, 103,300 tons for peanut, and 2,802,300 tons for vegetables. The crop yields
currently achieved in the project area are higher than estimated during appraisal.
Preliminary data show a further increase in yields and production for cash crops as
farmers diversified crop production and increased inputs in response to higher market
prices. The increased outputs from various crops resulted in higher incomes for
beneficiary farm households. The annual net value of incremental production was
estimated at about Y 1,717 million in Anhui, Y 944.5 million in Jiangsu and Y 769.4
million in Shandong.
10.   Overall, agricultural procluction has exceeded the benefit targets and economic
rates of return. ERRs were recalculated for each subproject and component, using
production input costs and output prices provided by each of the project management
offices. The consolidated ERR for the whole project amounted to 26.6 percent, slightly
higher than the estimated 26.5 percent at appraisal. Table 9 of Part II shows the detailed
ERRs for each large irrigation scheme in three provinces.
Rural Income and Poverty Reduction
11.   The project has increased incomes for about 2.8 million farming households in
Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong subproject areas. The financial analyses, based on survey
data from the Rural Socioeconorny Survey Teamn collected from predetermined areas
selected for monitoring from 1991 to 1997, show substantial increases in net income per
capita as follows:
Net Income Per capita (Yuan)

(a) Full Development  () Project Completion
(price in 1990/98)  (price in 1997/98)
Anhui Irrigation Area                  713/1455.7          1,712
Jiangsu Irrigation Area                603/1231.1          2,369
Shandong Irrigation Area               684/1396.7          1,820
12.   The sampled surveys of farm incomes in the Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong
subproject areas indicate that the income of farmers in the project area has surpassed the
poverty line, and the rural per capita income achieved for various farmer groups has
exceeded substantially the SAR-projected income level at full development year (2001).
The agriculture production gains have helped to raise the income level of the farmers.
The average per capita income of the households engaging in crop production was raised

from Y 713 to Y 1,712 in Anhui, Y 603 to Y 2,269 in Jiangsu and Y 684 to Y 1,820 in
Shandong, respectively. Table 6 of Part II summarized the average household income for
each large irrigation schem in three provinces.
Other Socioeconomic Benefits
13.   Beside increasing rural incomes, other socioeconomic benefits accrued include
the following:
(a) Due to improved irrigation efficiency and higher level of farm
mechanization, both of which effectively reduce the number of days farmers
are engaged in irrigation and farning activities, farmers are able to use the
available labor2 to engage in off-farm employment such as sideline
enterprises, family-operated business, rearing of livestock, and working part
time in cities and townships earning extra cash income.
(b) The improved rural incomes brought about changes in consumption patterns,
better housing and more education for farmers' children.
(c) The implementation of the project generated employment opportunities, both
short- and long-term, including employment for women. (Shandong reported
280,000 short-term jobs and 65,000 long-term jobs; Jiangsu reported 240,000
short- and 52,000 long-term jobs, and no figures available from Anhui.
(d) The project has promoted rational changes for cropping patterns and produce
geared for value-added processing and marketing. This has optimized the
production structure for accelerating the overall rural economy in the project
area. For example, abundant supply of wheat stalk and other dry matters
from crops in Mengcheng County, Anhui Province has promoted rearing of
beef cattle by a large number of households and turned the county into one of
the major production bases of beef cattle in China.
(e) The access roads constructed and upgraded in the project areas provided good
access for rapid transportation of agricultural inputs and outputs, resulting in
a reduction in costs and higher margins of return. These access roads (some
of them upgraded to permanent roads by the local governments) also linked
the various villages to the various townships and improved the sociocultural
life of the project farmers.
Institutional Strengthening and Development
14.   The project provided institutional strengthening and development mainly through
staff training in project implementation and management, upgrading of technical skills
and competence through local and overseas technical study tours, and training in the use
of microcomputers for use in project management. In all, 240,246 staffs of training were
2 Roughly estimated at 5 person-days per cultivated mu per season.



completed (Anhui 88,979, Jiangsu 73,884, Shandong 77,091 staff-months). In addition,
project offices at the provincial, prefecture, city and county levels were provided with the
necessary office equipment and vehicles for use during project implementation and in
subsequent operation and maintenance.
Procurement
15.   Project procurement for works and goods was carried out separately by each
province with the assistance of various national tendering companies (China National
Technology Import Corporation (CNTIC), China Machinery Import & Export
Corporation (CMIEC), China Instruments Import & Export Corporation (CIIEC))
acceptable to the Bank Group. Bank procurement guidelines and procedures were
generally conformed to, including the use model bidding documents for International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) prepared by the
Ministry of Finance and reviewed by the World Bank. Contractors for works and
suppliers for goods performed their contracts satisfactorily. The centralized procurement
of basic construction materials (cement, steel and timber) proved to be less efficient and
practicable in coordinating supply and delivery to the numerous counties scattered in
each of the three provinces, not counting the added costs for storage and overland
transportation. Since these basic construction materials are now readily available in the
open market, it is strongly reconimended that, for future similar projects in China, these
materials need not be procured centrally but be included in the unit prices for the relevant
work items for bidding by contractors who will then be responsible for the supply of
these materials. This would also reduce considerably procurement and the associated
financial workload and overheacl costs.
Disbursement
16.   The disbursement of loan and credit for the project was satisfactory and generally
according to schedule (see Table 4), except for the Jiangsu component, which was
slightly delayed due to delay in completing the Grand Canal Water Management
Monitoring System. The loan and credit for Anhui and Shandong were virtually
disbursed by the end of 1996, some six months before the original project closing date.
The loan and credit proceeds were reallocated in 1994 to adjust for underallocation in
some categories due to the increase in work quantities and cost. The disbursement of
project expenditures generally adhered to the World Bank disbursement guidelines and
procedures. The loan and credit were fully disbursed, with the last disbursement for the
project (Jiangsu component) male on December 28, 1998.
C. Project Impact
17.   Based on the sampled household socioeconomic surveys and project office
reports, the project created the following direct and/or induced impacts:
(a) The results and performance of the completed project generated great interest
among the neighboring nonproj ect counties and demands for similar project
facilities. Consequently, the Bank financed a similar project (Irrigated
Agriculture Intensification Project II, Loan 4354-CHA, $300 million) in May



- 8 -
1998 covering 131 counties in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong,
Henan and Hebei for a total area of about 1.5 million ha.
(b) The project activities and improved rural incomes induced further
development and growth of the local economy. This is evidenced from the
expansion of various service and supply sectors, increased demands for
consumer goods, and construction of new and renovation of buildings for
residential homes, shops, stores and offices.
(c) The project benefits contributed to an increase in revenues of local
governments through the collection of agricultural and production taxes
derived from the project areas.3 The local governments, in turn, invested in
infrastructure (roads, electricity, water supply, etc.) and other social
amenities (health clinics, schools, etc.), all of which contributed to the overall
improvement of the quality of life for the project beneficiaries.
(d) The completed irrigation and drainage facilities, land and soil improvements,
and afforestation (forest belts and windbreaks) improved the land
productivity and enhanced the general ecological environment of the project
area.
(e) For the Jiangsu component, the increased water diversion to northern Jiangsu
has not only solved the water shortage problem but it also improved the
water environments for agriculture, aquaculture, urban and rural water supply
and inland navigation.
D. Major Factors Affecting The Project
18.   The following major factors contributed toward the smooth and successful
implementation and perfonnance of the project:
(a) Firm Commitment and Leadership by Government. The three provincial
governments (Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong) provided firm commitment and
leadership to the project by providing timely and adequate funds and policy
guidelines for project implementation. The respective Provincial Project
Leading Groups, under the chairmanship of the Vice Governor in charge of
agriculture, met regularly to review project progress and resolve issues and
problems confronting project implementation. Similar effective leadership
provided by the prefecture/city and county governments also contributed to
the successful implementation of the project.
3 Increase was primnarily due to increase in production of higher-valued crops brought about by change of
cropping pattern to meet market demands and increased prooduction of animal husbandry produce
due to availability of large quantity of crop residues and by-products. However, there are no changes
in the agricultural and production tax rates.



- 9 -
(b) Past Experiences of Similar Project Works. Anhui and Shandong
provinces had participated earlier in the completed North China Plain
Agriculture (NCPA) Project and acquired valuable experience in project
planning, design, implementation and management. Some of the key staff
from NCPA were deployed to form the core staff of the project and help to
guide and train the new project staff. This ensured an earlier start of the
project and subsequent smooth project implementation.
(c) Effective Project Ma nagement Organization of Structure. Each province
established its own project management organization at the provincial,
prefecture/city and county levels. The organizations were effective in
coordinating the various implementing agencies and solving issues and
problems encountered during project implementation. The Provincial Project
Leading Groups also provided effective leadership and clear policies. Various
rules, regulations and guidelines on project management, financial
administration, procurement and disbursement were prepared by the Provincial
Project Management Offices and issued to project staff for guidance. Staff
changes were also kept to a minimum to ensure continuity of staff working on
the project. At the gralssroot level, the county chief or his designated deputy
played an active role in directing and overseeing project implementation in his
county. The quality of the project was ensured through the technical expert
groups set up in each province and periodic supervision by local specialists
organized by the Ministry of Water Resources, including joint workshops to
exchange implementation experience and technical knowledge.
(d) Participation and Ownership by Project Beneficiaries. Project beneficiaries
(farmers) and stakeholders (villages and townships) participated extensively in
the project construction by contributing labor to undertake earthwork
construction of irrigation canals, farm roads, tree planting and other labor-
intensive work. The project beneficiaries and stakeholders are also responsible
for maintenance of the lower levels of the irrigation canal system and irrigation
tubewells. This has induced a great sense of ownership and responsibility for
the success of the project works among the project beneficiaries and
stakeholders. This cornmunal spirit and effort was pivotal in ensuring success
of the project in each project county.
(e) Simple Engineering Designs and Compactness of Project Activities.
Except for the major works on upgrading the water diversion facilities of the
Grand Canal under the Jiangsu component, most of the irrigation works were
for tertiary canals, tubewells and on-farm works, which are relatively simple in
design and easy to construct. Moreover, these irrigation works, together with
the agricultural support services, were compact and planned on a county basis
so that it could be readily implemented by local construction teams or through
force account work. Thus, project benefits accrued within a relatively short
period as each subproject area was completed.
(f) Obligations for Funding and Debt Servicing. One of the unique features
that made project implementation successful was the obligation of



- 10-
governments at different levels to raise the agreed funds for the project and
also to repay the apportioned loan and credit on the principle of "who borrows
who pays", including funds self-raised by project farmers. Agreements on
funding arrangements and repayments were signed and made binding on the
parties concerned. These funding arrangements ensured a smooth flow and
allocation of local counterpart funds for project implementation.
However, the following negative factors also affected project implementation:
(a) Inherent Low Cost and Inflation: At the initial project preparation stage,
the ceiling on investment and the average unit cost (Y 100/mu or Y 1,500/ha) set
by the central government as a norm for investment resulted in a comparatively
lower investment cost, which in turn affected the quality of works and their
subsequent operation and maintenance. This low investment constraint was further
compounded by the price escalation, inflation and local currency depreciation that
occurred during project implementation. Larger project benefits could have been
achieved with optimum investment.
(b) Natural Disasters: The project areas are prone to natural disasters of
periodic flood and drought, which caused much damage and losses to agricultural
production whenever their magnitudes exceeded the design standards. This is
evidenced from the floods that occurred in 1991 and 1996, affecting Anhui and
Jiangsu provinces in particular. The low level of project investment precluded
protection against such major flood and drought events.4
E. Project Sustainability
19.   The project is likely to be sustainable in view of the following:
(a) Continued Government Commitment and Support for the Project The
three project provinces are major grain and commodity production bases in the
North China Plain and the Government, both central and provincial, is firmly
committed to ensuring that the capital works invested in under the project are
yielding the desired results and are sustainable. The Government is also
supporting the project areas with preferential policies to further boost agricultural
production.
(b) Good Quality of Completed Works and Operation and Maintenance
System. Good quality of construction for the irrigation works and other project
facilities have been maintained through adequate supervision during project
implementation. This has ensured that the works and facilities completed would
be durable and sustainable for long-term operation and use. Before handing over
to the relevant departments for operation and maintenance, these works and
facilities were inspected-and tested for final acceptance, with any defects made
good. The existing local O&M departments have also strengthened and/or

Shandong and flood protection of 1 in 15 to 1 in 20 years return period.



- I1 -
expanded their capacity tlo undertake the increased O&M workload. The
responsibility for operation and maintenance of irrigation systems has been clearly
defined and assigned to the different government levels, including project farmers
at the village level. Irrigation water charges are being collected based on existing
regulations to finance annual O&M costs, while tubewell irrigation systems are
mostly operated and self-financed collectively by farmers on a cost-sharing basis.
Most of the agricultural support services and facilities are self-financing through
sales of products and services (seed companies, agrimachinery service stations,
pest control, etc.).
(c) Effective Agricultural Support Services System to Sustain Production.
The completed complementary agricultural support services package in each
province strengthened the existing systems and ensured that production would be
achieved as planned and sustained. Facilities and services provided include
production and supply of quality seeds for grains and cotton, extension and
dissemination to farmers of new production technologies and adaptive research
results, pest forecasting and control, agrimachinery services, and supplies of
agricultural inputs through the numerous agritechnical centers and stations
strengthened and constructed under the project.
(d) Continuation of the Project Offices in Post-Project Activities. Although
construction the project has been completed, the project continues to receive
support from the various implementing agencies in technical advice and inputs for
the various post-project activities (testing, commissioning and final acceptance,
O&M, cost recovery, performance evaluation) until the project has reached its full
development stage and stabilized. This continued support would ensure successful
operation and sustainability of the project works and facilities.
F. Bank/IDA Performance
20.   The World Bank Group's overall performance in project preparation, appraisal
and supervision has been rated satisfactory, with the cooperation of the Borrower who
contributed substantially to the iinitial project preparation and subsequent project
supervision missions with comprehensive data and information. In all, the Bank Group
carried out nine missions, including seven supervision missions. The Bank Group
supervision missions were supp[emented by internal supervision missions organized by
the Ministry of Water Resources. Jointly with the Borrower, the Bank Group conducted
a project launch workshop at the start of the project covering topics on procurement,
disbursement, and monitoring aind evaluation. The Bank Group also conducted a Mid-
Term Review of the project in 1993 to reflect changes deemed necessary to ensure
smooth implementation of the project.
G. Borrower Performance
21.   The performance of the ]Borrower in project preparation, implementation,
management and performance monitoring was more than satisfactory, judging by the
time taken to complete implementation of the project, the physical targets achieved and
control of the project costs. This was achieved through establishment of effective project



- 12 -
management offices, provision of timely and adequate resources (funds and personnel)
and effective leadership in each of the three provinces. The project staff were generally
hardworking and responsive, and cooperated well with the Bank Group to resolve issues
and problems.
22.   During project implementation, project areas in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces
were affected by two major floods (1991 and 1996) and the provincial governments made
extra efforts to repair the project works damaged by the floods to ensure that the project
was completed as scheduled. Jiangsu Province demonstrated its technical excellence in
designing and constructing the four major pumping stations to upgrade the water
diversion capacity of the Grand Canal to northern Jiangsu (project areas in Jiangsu
Province). The four pumping stations were major civil engineering works requiring
technical solutions for difficult site conditions and best configurations for the pumping
stations. Shandong Province excelled in the rehabilitation and development of tubewell
irrigation for some 170,000 ha, including establishment of the Groundwater Irrigation
Research Center at Taian City.
23.   In project implementation, the three provinces complied satisfactorily with the
overall requirements of the legal covenants, procurement and disbursement, accounting
and auditing, and implementation progress reporting and monitoring.
II. Assessment of Outcome
24.   The overall outcome of the project has been assessed as satisfactory. The project
was implemented smoothly and within the time schedule (except for the two 9-month
extensions given to Jiangsu component to complete its only outstanding item on the
Grand Canal Water Management Monitoring System). The project objectives and
physical targets were achieved within reasonable increased project cost caused by
inflation. Project benefits (rural incomes and crop production) accrued exceeded the
original estimates and continue to be sustained. The project is likely to be sustainable in
view of the continued commitment and support by the Government for the project areas,
which are major national grain and commodity production bases. Operation and
maintenance and agricultural support services systems are in place to ensure sustained
operation of the completed facilities and agricultural production. The project promoted
growth of the local economy and generated revenue for the local governments that, in
return, provided continued support for the project areas.
I. Future Operations
25.   The future operations will focus on efficient operation and maintenance of the
completed project works and facilities so as to achieve the project's full development.
The existing project management offices and staff will be maintained to concentrate on
O&M aspects of the project. This would include defining O&M responsibilities for the
units concerned and initiating turnover of works and facilities. To further enhance the
project's economic benefits, the irrigation areas and agricultural support service facilities



- 13 -
will be progressively adapted to a market-oriented production economy with a self-
supporting operation mechanism, responsible for its own profits and losses. Each
province will recover project costs from the beneficiaries, mainly through the collection
of appropriate irrigation water charges based on existing government regulations. Each
province will also institute administrative and economic measures for the different levels
of government to fulfill their respective obligations to repay the loan/credit as agreed
under the project.
J. Key Lessons Learned
26.   The key lessons learned and applicable to future similar projects in China are:
(a) Compared to large-scale new irrigation areas, investment to improve and
expand existing irrigation facilities for smaller irrigation unit areas, which are
simple in design and compact for rapid implementation, is less costly in capital
investment and project benefits could be accrued, county by county, in a
relatively short period of time.
(b) Commitment by governments in providing timely and adequate resources,
effective leadership at all project levels, and the active participation of
beneficiaries and stakeholders (village, township and county governments) in
project implementation ensures smooth implementation, success and
sustainability of the project.
(c) Keeping the project subcomponents to a minimum (basically irrigation and
agricultural support services components in this project) reduce the complexity
of the project in preparation and implementation, thereby maximizing the use
of resources of the Bank Group and Borrower to achieve the desired project
objectives.
(d) Pre-setting ceilings for investment and average unit prices constrains project
planning and design, resulting in low standards of works and difficult
subsequent operation and maintenance.
(e) Participating counties should be selected based on their financial capacity and
willingness to contribute funds, recover costs from project beneficiaries and
repay debts. This ensures smooth project implementation, operation and
maintenance and debt servicing.

Re 'Implementation Completion Reporting of Irrigated Agriculture
Intensification Project"
Dear Mr lang S.Tay-
We have already read the Implementaion CompletLon Reporing of rigared
Agnidture Intensification Project which you are responsible for. We think this is a
fine report The description of the project completion and its impact are practical. The
word 'satisying," in the comment of the result of the project is appropriate. The
summary of the experience and lessons is impressing We are tying to provide more
information and data requested. We hereby make the following Suggestions for the
improvemem of the reporL
I. TE the paragraph of the description of IBRDJIDA, the two points should be
mentioned: Some project officials sent by the World Bank who took part in the
North-China Plain project applied many successful experiences drawn from the
North-China Plain project- The World Bank officials made deep investigations in the
borrower country and province aad played a big role in the implementation of the
project.
2. In the paragraph of the major experience and lessons, it is mentioned that the
projects of improving and expanding small-sized irrigation areas are fast effective
and priority should be given to those coumties where the local finacial capability is
comparatively strong and beneficiaries are willing to pay back the loan. We think
more should be added to the above comment The projects of small-sized irrigated
area treatment or with less investment and fast effect should be arranged in the
places where most of the loan are borne by local farmers, while projects of large and
medium sized water conservancy works, more consideration should be given to the
local government-s determination and loan recovery capability in the decision
mnakmg~ Burden to the farmers should be possibly avoided
3..It is a good way to combine the successfiu experience to fasten the appraisal
process for later similar projects- This could be added to the report.
4. It could be menidoned as well that there were other important fators which
affected the project. Those were appropriate appraisal and mid-term adjustment The
project effEicency was gretly increased by the realization of the proposals made
dming the umplementation in terms of the crop structure adjustmen:, irigaton
system program, comprehensive atment of ditches, canals, farmland, forestation

and road.
The above suggestions are only for reference. We will inform you timely if we have
more comments.

REVIEW TO THE  DRAFT ICR OF
CHINA IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT
(2256/3337 CHA)
1. The completion supervision to China Irrigated Agriculture Intensification
Project was carried out by the World Bank mission in March of 1997. The
preliminary draft of ICR was prepared and completed on schedule. The efficient
work of the Bank nmission has ensured the successful completion and
evaluation of the project.
2. The draft ICR makes a general summary and modesty evaluation to the
project of Shandong Component. The general implementation, the data and
material from the component reports and the analysis to the project result
described in the draft IICR is to the actual circumstances, the actual description
of the experience and lessons gained from the project will be very meaningful
for the follow-up project which is already under preparation.
3. The comments which were discussed and appointed in the draft ICR are
also hat Shandong PPMO will furtherly summarized and give more attentions.
These mainly are:(1 ).1The impact of the incremental rural incomes of the project
area to the improveiment of the living quality of the local farmers;(2).the
preferential policies to be made by the government to ensure the sustainable
development of the project;(3). the measures to be adopted by the PPMO for
the future operation and maintenance of the project.
4.The increase of the rural incomes of the project area has a favourable
impact to the improvment of the living quality of the local farmers. Based on the

monitoring index of the model household, the consumption expenditures of the
local farmers have increased substantially, the consumption structures have
tumed to be more reasonable with less cost for the staple food and
comparatively more cost for non-staple food, more expenditures for cultural
education. The housing condition of the local farmer has been improved greatly,
average housing area per capita reaches 20.8 square meters, which is 7
square meters more than that before the project.IAboutd-25% of the project
farmer household have rebuilt new houses. In some of the project area,
substantial changes have happened to the life of the local farmers. In Laiwu
project area, the timely adjustment of the cropping pattems made the incomes
of the local farmers increase greatly, the average income per capita of the local
farmers increased by RMB 351=3fromi1990-1996. Amof.-   the 42000 farmer
households of Laiwu project area, about 5382 households were equiped with
cable television, the comparatively richer farmer households even bought 1202
new transportationrE---trucks,1818Dnotor bicycles, 812 programme-controlled
telephone. Such modem commodities as refrigerator and vedio machine were
also come to the local farmers, the difference between the city and the rural
area has become less and less.
5.&Continuous attentions and support will be given to the project works
from the govemment, the govemment will support the project areas with
preferential policies toaboost.-theriragricultural development of the project
areas. More financial support will be given to make further agricultural Inputs,
additional guidances will be given to the adjustment of the interior cropping
patterns, the qualified agriculture with high production and more efficience will

be developed,furtherly, the developmen of industralized agriculture will be
prompted, so as to get more and more agriculture output. The interest of the
farmer who growving grains will be protected furtherly by means of the
establishment of Grain Risk Fund and the stipulation of the protection price of
grain. The Shandong Government will issue and carry out such measures as
Water conveyance Construction Fund and technical extension plan, to make
more investment and more technic input to prompt the sustainable
development of agriculture steadily.
6.The operation and maintenance in the future time will be strengthened
and improved progressively. (1). The responsibilities of the operation and
maintenance of project works will be made furtherly. It will be put under the
management of the professional departments as the agriculture and the water
conservancy at each level based on the character and the size of project
works. (2)The operation and maintenance will be ensured. Water charges will
be collected by 100% from the project works, and water collection rate will be
higher progressively to meet the demand of the normal maintenance of the
project works. the financial departments at each level will supply the project
works with more investment to increase more and more managerial efficience
and economic benefits.(3) More attention will be given to the recovery of project
funds, the raisin,, operation and the management of repayment funds will be
strengthened to ensure the overall repayment will be completed on schedule.
