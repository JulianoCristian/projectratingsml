A sectoral approach to project design has\n            been adopted in order to respond flexibly and efficiently to\n            the country's needs.  The project will also accelerate\n            the start of selected top priority works to protect\n            investments in infrastructure that survived the 1992 flood.\n            The project covers:  (a) repair and restoration of federal\n            and provincial infrastructure, including roads and bridges,\n            irrigation, drainage and flood protection works, and primary\n            education and basic health facilities; and (b) restoration\n            of infrastructure mainly provided by government enterprises\n            such as railways, power, and telecommunications."}, "docdt": "1993-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
