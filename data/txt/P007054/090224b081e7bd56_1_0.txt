member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external
debt, which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of
the creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization
or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the
Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank,
equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in creating or per-
mitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision
to that effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional
or other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect
to any lien created on assets of any of its political or admini-
strative subdivisions, the Borrower shall promptly and at no cost
to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other charges
on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfac-
tory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking trans-
actions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after
its date.

Borrower, Banco Central and the Financieras of any of the respective
covenants, agreements and obligations of the Borrower, Banco
Central and the Financieras contained in this Agreement, the
contract referred to in Section 4.01 of this Agreement, and the

fiscal years CFN shall have suffered a loss resulting from changes
in the rates of exchange between the various currencies (including
Sucres) used in CFN's operations, the amount of which shall have
exceeded the total amount of CFN's net profits and free reserves,

in an amount at least equal to the amount by which such loss ex-
ceeded such profits and reserves.
For purposes of this Section, (i) the term "free reserves"

cerning the administration, operations and accounts of Banco
Central in respect of the Project, and the performance by Banco
Central of its obligations under the contract referred to in

Agreements; and (ii) inform each other of any condition which
