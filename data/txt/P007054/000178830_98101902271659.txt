REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR FOR A
THIRD DEVELOPMENT BANKING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Ecuador for the equivalent of US$26 million to help finance
a Third Development Banking Project. The loan would bear interest at 8.7%
per annum and would be repaid in 15 years, including three years of grace, on
a schedule reflecting the composite amortization terms of the sub-loans to be
made by the participating DFCs. The proceeds of the loan would be channeled
through the Central Bank of Ecuador to participating DFCs for the financing of
foreign exchange costs of equipment and permanent working capital. Industrial
enterprises would receive equity investments, and loans for a term not exceeding
15 years, including a maximumiin of three years' grace, at effective interest
rates ranging from 13% to 16%. The Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "'Ecuador:  Economic Memorandum" (No. 1033-EC) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on February 26, 1976. An economic
mission visited Ecuador in August/September 1976 whose findings comprise the
basis of the following analysis. Annex I summarizes the main economic and
social indicators.
3.        With the first shipments of crude oil from the Oriente Region in
1972, Ecuador became a net exporter of oil. This provided the country with
additional resources which at least temporarily removed the savings and
foreign exchange constraints that had severely impeded Ecuador's growth in
the past. However, it has become clear that the country's oil wealth is
smaller than previously estimnated. Crude reserves, in addition, are now being
extracted faster than they are being replaced. The revised production esti-
mates, reflecting a better knowledge of the difficulties involved in the
exploitation of Ecuador's oil, indicate that Ecuador is not likely to accumu-
late and retain substantial amounts oF foreign exchange reserves in the
foreseeable future.
4.        Furthermore, there has been a sharp decline in petroleum output
since mid-1974 because of marketing difficulties for Ecuadorian crude in
export markets and a protracted disagreement between the Government and the
foreign concessionaires over the taxation of oil exports. The disappointing
performance of the petroleum sector was not expected by the Government which
had adopted policies designed to stimulate further growth.    It had increased
public expenditures, had offered more generous credit programs for agricul-
tural and industrial investment and lifted most quantitative import restric-
tions.

process of negotiating its proposed withdrawal from the consortium. The State
Petroleum Corporation cannot be expected to direct and finance the required
further development driLling, the creation of production and secondary recovery
facilities, the connection of different oiL fields to the trans-Andean pipeline,
etc. The continued expansion of petroleum production and Ecuador's balance-of-
payments prospects depend largely, therefore, on the decisions now confronting
the Government on its policy towards foreign oil enterprises.
10.       In view of these uncertainties, the Government has sought to make
efficient use of its oil revenues. It has made substantial public invest-
ments in highways. Investments in electric power and petroleum (mainly the
Esmeraldas oil refinery) have been prominent as well, with smaller shares for
agriculture and education. In total, the real annual growth of public invest-
ment reached 33% between 1972 and 1975. Public investment further rose from
8.5% of GDP in 1975 to 9.4% in 1976.
11.       Efforts have been made to improve the investment capacity of the
public sector. Partly as a result of the work of the National Preinvest-
ment Fund created in 1973, project preparation has been progressing reasonably
well although somewhat unevenly. The number of prefeasibility and feasibility
studies of development projects has increased sharply. In an attempt to
further improve its public investment machinery, the Government recently
announced the plan to establish a development bank--financed out: of petroleum
revenues--for financing priority public investment projects. It has also
declared its intention to step up public investment further over the next five
years, partly through mobilizing greater flows of public and private external
capital. In this connection, the Bank is now exploring the possibility of
organizing a consultative group for Ecuador.
12.       One of the major tests of the success of Ecuador's development
effort will be in the agricultural sector. It is apparent that, only by ex-
panding and raising the productivity of agriculture, can Ecuador create ade-
quate employment for its rapidly growing labor force and raise living standards
of most of its population. Unfortunately, over much of the past: decade, agri-
cultural production has lagged behind the needs of the country, as reflected
in the steady rise of food imports. 'Ecuador's biggest need now is to increase
land and labor productivity. The Government has reacted positively to these
problems. Since 1974, producer prices have been raised, the volume of credit
increased, and import duties on agricultural inputs reduced, along with taxes
on intermediate and capital goods used in farming. A good start has been made
by public works agencies in expanding the system of all-weather feeder roads.
Much remains to be done, however. Some of the most important deificiencies
require the creation of more effective extension and marketing systems; and
the improvement of producer prices.
13.       Ecuador's development needs, as well as persistent structural and
institutional weaknesses, call for continued external assistance to supplement
the reasonably high level of domestic savings. Considerable assistance will

industry to total income, export diversification and employment has so far
been limited. The industrial sector accounted for only 15.5% of GDP in 1975
at current prices, 11.5% of total employment and 10% of total exports. This
comparatively small contribution is probably attributable to the domestic
constraints impeding Ecuadorian industry.
22.       Paramount among these constraints are the limited size of the
domestic market and the shortage of qualified technical and managerial per-
sonnel, as well as the limited competitiveness of Ecuador's non-traditional
industriaL exports. The domestic market can be expected to expand along with
the general rise of incomes and the improvement of transportation. Manpower
limitations pose significant bottlenecks but the Government is making a con-
siderable effort in this area, assisted by the US$4 million Bank loan approved
in FY75 for vocational training.
23.       Among the critical policy issues for future industrial development
in Ecuador are the effects of the current tariff and price regulations. The
present tariffs, price controls and incentive legislation may be stimulating
investment in some inefficient industries. Besides the obvious costs in tax
revenues, these policies tend to favor capital-intensive industries. On the
other hand, the price ceilings for a number of goods--e.g., sugar, plywood,
cement, vegetable oils--have induced or reinforced scarcities of those com-
modities. In general, the recent experience in the administration of price
policy suggests that a gradual reduction of price controls may be advisable
to eliminate these distortions. There is some evidence as well that the
system of protection is also fostering imbalances. These matters have been
detailed in the aforementioned Sector Report. Based on this report, the
Bank has started a dialogue with the Ecuadorian authorities with a view to-
wards future improvement of industrial policies. Such improvements will
depend in part on the negotiation within the Andean Pact regarding the common
external tariff.
24.       Yet another major constraint, which is the central factor in the
background of the proposed loan, is the scarcity in Ecuador of risk capital
and term financing. Commercial banks have traditionally met industry's
short-term financing requirements and, to some extent, its medium-term needs,
mostly on a roll-over basis. Oil revenues, which helped to increase the
Government's financing of gross domestic investment from 1% in 1970 to 28% in
1974, have not made a sizable contribution to industrial finance, since most
of these revenues have been channeled to public investment and the agricul-
tural sector. Consequently, the long-term needs of Ecuadorian industry have
been met primarily through direct external credit, accessible to prime
borrowers only. Domestic long-term financing was practically unavailable to
industry until two DFCs--Comision de Valores--Corporacion Financiera Nacional
(CV-CFN) and Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo, S.A., Compania Financiera (COFIEC)--
started operations in the mid-1960s. At the end of 1975, the combined port-
folio of CV-CFN and COFIEC stood at S/.4.2 billion, 7% of which was financed
through two Bank loans (Nos. 721EC and 930EC) amounting in the aggregate to
US$28 million equivalent. Those funds served to finance a wide variety of
industrial projects. The average economic rate of return of the subprojects
submitted for approval exceeded 30%. Almost half of the amounts approved

PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The proposed project would be the Bank's third operation in the
industrial finance sub-sector of Ecuador. The appraisal was conducted in
April-May 1976. Negotiations were held in Washington from November 19 to
24, 1976. At that time, the Republic of Ecuador was represented by Mr.
Nieto of the Ministry of Finance; the Central Bank of Ecuador was represented
by Mr. Fausto Munoz; Comision de Valores - Corporacion Financiera Nacional
(CV-CFN) was represented by Messrs. Dongilio and Estupinan; ancd Ecuatoriana de
Desarrollo, S.A. Compania Financiera (COFIEC) was represented by Mr. Correa.
An Appraisal Report on the project (1298a-EC) is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. A summary statement on the proposed project and
loan is contained in Annex III to this Report.
General Description
28.       The proposed project would consist of the provision, through partici-
pating DFCs, of equity capital and term financing to industrial companies for
the development of productive facilities and resources in Ecuador.
29.       In line with the strategy outlined in paragraph 18 above, the
purpose of the proposed project and loan would be twofold. First, to support
improvements in Ecuador's industrial sector, particularly regarding the
financing of industrial growth. The measures recently enacted by the Govern-
ment with regard to the interest rate structure (see paragraph 25 above) are a
promising start and may be complemented with further measures which might be
identified as appropriate through the capital market studies being planned
(see paragraph 47 below). Second, to finance about 12.6% of the estimated
foreign exchange requirements of the two major participating DFCs during the
period 1976-80.
Relending Terms
30.       The institutional arrangements adopted for the previous two loans
would be retained for the proposed project. The proceeds of the proposed
loan would be entrusted to the Central Bank of Ecuador which, acting as the
Government's fiscal agent, would relend those proceeds to the DFCs parti-
cipating in the project. The Government would assume the foreign exchange
risk. In addition to the interest on the proposed Bank loan, the Central Bank
would charge participating DFCs a variable fee of 1.75-2% on their respective
loans' outstanding balances. This fee would compensate the Central Bank for
the foreign exchange risk coverage and the administrative costs it would incur
(see Sections 4.01 and 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement and Section 2.02 of
the CV-CFN and COFIEC draft Project Agreements). The ultimate users would
borrow from the participating DFCs at an annual interest rate of 12% on
outstanding balances. In addition, they will pay a commission in accordance
with the recently enacted regulations (see paragraph 25 above). Commissions
charged would be at a rate ranging between the maxima allowed under the
regulations and one percentage point below such maxima. (See Section 3.02(b)

PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The proposed project would be the Bank's third operation in the
industrial finance sub-sector of Ecuador. The appraisal was conducted in
April-May 1976. Negotiations were held in Washington from November 19 to
24, 1976. At that time, the Republic of Ecuador was represented by Mr.
Nieto of the Ministry of Finance; the Central Bank of Ecuador was represented
by Mr. Fausto Munoz; Comision de Valores - Corporacion Financiera Nacional
(CV-CFN) was represented by Messrs. Dongilio and Estupinan; ancd Ecuatoriana de
Desarrollo, S.A. Compania Financiera (COFIEC) was represented by Mr. Correa.
An Appraisal Report on the project (1298a-EC) is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. A summary statement on the proposed project and
loan is contained in Annex III to this Report.
General Description
28.       The proposed project would consist of the provision, through partici-
pating DFCs, of equity capital and term financing to industrial companies for
the development of productive facilities and resources in Ecuador.
29.        In line with the strategy outlined in paragraph 18 above, the
purpose of the proposed project and loan would be twofold. First, to support
improvements in Ecuador's industrial sector, particularly regarding the
financing of industrial growth. The measures recently enacted by the Govern-
ment with regard to the interest rate structure (see paragraph 25 above) are a
promising start and may be complemented with further measures which might be
identified as appropriate through the capital market studies being planned
(see paragraph 47 below). Second, to finance about 12.6% of the estimated
foreign exchange requirements of the two major participating DFCs during the
period 1976-80.
Relending Terms
30.       The institutional arrangements adopted for the previous two loans
would be retained for the proposed project. The proceeds of the proposed
loan would be entrusted to the Central Bank of Ecuador which, acting as the
Government's fiscal agent, would relend those proceeds to the DFCs parti-
cipating in the project. The Government would assume the foreign exchange
risk. In addition to the interest on the proposed Bank loan, the Central Bank
would charge participating DFCs a variable fee of 1.75-2% on their respective
loans' outstanding balances. This fee would compensate the Central Bank for
the foreign exchange risk coverage and the administrative costs it would incur
(see Sections 4.01 and 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement and Section 2.02 of
the CV-CFN and COFIEC draft Project Agreements). The ultimate users would
borrow from the participating DFCs at an annual interest rate of 12% on
outstanding balances. In addition, they will pay a commission in accordance
with the recently enacted regulations (see paragraph 25 above). Commissions
charged would be at a rate ranging between the maxima allowed under the
regulations and one percentage point below such maxima. (See Section 3.02(b)

good in-house staff training and competitive pay scales account for this.
Operations are conducted from the Quito headquarters and branches in
Guayaquil, Cuenca and Manta.
34.       CV-CFN is the senior institution of its kind in Ecuador and it has
also been active in promoting the organization of COFIEC and other DFCs. So
far, it has enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy from the Government but,
although primarily oriented towards the private sector, its operations broadly
reflect the social and economic objectives of the Government. During negotia-
tions it has been agreed that CV-CFN would furnish to the Bank the economic
and financial rates of return (calculated in a manner satisfacEory to the Bank)
of any investment project which entails an investment in excess of US$500,000
equivalent. In addition, CV-CFN has agreed to amend, before requesting any
disbursements out of the proposed loan, its Statement of Operating Policies
and Procedures in a way which would appropriately reflect CV-CFN's export
promotion activities, primarily consisting of short-term export financing
operations (see Sections 2.04(b) and 2.16 of the draft CV-CFN Plroject Agree-
ment).
35.       CV-CFN's appraisal and supervision procedures are very good.      CV-CFN
pays special attention to improvements of those procedures whenever they
appear necessary, and it has agreed with the Bank to issue disbursements and
supervision manuals satisfactory to the Bank within six months from the
signing of the loan agreement (see Section 2.01(b) of the draft CV-CFN Project
Agreement). Consequently, it has been agreed that Bank approval of CV-CFN's
investment projects would be required only when the Bank funds to be committed
would exceed US$1 million equivalent, provided that the total amount of Bank
funds lent or invested without Bank approval would not exceed US$8 million
equivalent (see Section 2.02(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
36.       On December 31, 1975, CV-CFN's paid-in capital and reserves had
reached S/.981.2 million up 77% from its 1972 level. During the same period,
CV-CFN's external borrowings outstanding grew by 120% (the Bank, IDB,' CAF,
USAID and KfW have provided 30.4% of the increase in assets), while borrowings
in the Ecuadorian market grew more than sixfold and financed 42.2% of assets
growth, thus constituting its most important financial resource. However,
CV-CFN has consistently shown a lQw debt/equity ratio which, at the end of
1975 stood at 2.2:1. CV-CFN plans a considerable expansion which would
require a threefold increase in its equity during 1976-80.     Since equity
contributions depend on overall government investment policy, it would be
prudent for CV-CFN to rely more on its unused leverage, should those contri-
butions fail to materialize. Consequently, the Bank has agreed to an overall
debt/equity ratio of 6:1 (see Section 2.11 of the draft CV-CFN Project Agree-
ment). In addition to low leverage, two ,other factors have accounted for
CV-CFN's low return on its equity (6.1% during 1968-75), i.e., the low yield
of its assecs and inflation, which has been unusually high for Ecuador during
1973-74. The projected expansion of CV-CFN's business would increase its



- 12 -
financial expenses and reduce its net income from its past average, 2.3% of
assets to 1.5% during 1976-80. However, the larger spread on its operations
(see paragraph 25 above) and a higher leverage should enable CV-CFN to increase
its return on equity.
37.       Although CV-CFN's liquidity has declined, it is still adequate.
However, CV-CFN has agreed to establish and apply, within six months from loan
signing, an improved budgeting system designed to prevent occasional liquidity
constraints (see Section 2.01(b) of the draft CV-CFN Project Agreement).
CV-CFN carries the foreign exchange risk on its operations, except when
financed by Bank loans, and it has incurred exchange losses of S/.31.6 million
in 1974 and S/.20.8 million in 1975. Exchange losses would be treated by
CV-CFN as losses for the year within which they were incurred (see Section
2.06(b) of the draft CV-CFN Project Agreement). In accordance with prior
agreements with the Bank, which would be retained for this project, the
Government has agreed to reimburse CV-CFN the excess of any exchange loss
incurred on external borrowings other than Bank loans over the total amount of
CV-CFN's net profits and free reserves (see Section 4.07 of the draft Loan
Agreement). Total arrears have increased to 4.3% of portfolio, but estimated
losses would be covered by existing provisions. Although this change seems
mostly due to restrictions on credit imposed during 1975, CV-CFN has agreed
to increase its bad-debt provisions to 1.5% of portfolio by December 1978 and
maintain that level at all times (see Section 2.01(b) (ii) of the draft CV-CFN
Project Agreement).
38.       The operations planned by CV-CFN for 1976-80 would involve about
S/.13.6 billion (US$544 million equivalent) of industrial financing, 39%
of which is expected to be covered by internally generated funds. CV-CFN
enjoys a privileged position to place its bonds and plans to finance about 11%
of its requirements from this source and 16% from other domestic sources. The
balance would be covered by capital increases (9%) and external borrowings
(25%). Foreign exchange requirements are estimated at US$137 million equiva-
lent, about 43% of which is covered by undisbursed portions of loans already
available. Of the resulting gap of US$78 million equivalent, 17% would be
financed by the portion of the proposed loan to be allocated to CV-CFN and the
balance through a possible loan from IDB and a Euro-dollar bond issue.
39.       Most of CV-CFN's lending is concentrated on large projects (10%
of its projects absorbed 63.7% of CV-CFN's lending during 1975). Loans
maturing beyond 9 years (11 years has been the longest term) have declined
from 57% of total lending in 1972 to 26% in 1975 reflecting the trend towards
shorter maturities in Ecuador. The geographic distribution between Ecuador's
two main economic regions (Sierra and Costa) has been about even, allowing for
variations from year to year. About 38% of total lending has been channeled
to food, textile and other agro-industries, with another 24% going to non-
metallic mineral products. This distribution of funds seems satisfactory but
CV-CFN should ensure that its lending is adequately spread among a larger
number of borrowers compatible with CV-CFN's appraisal and supervision cap-
abilities. Consequently, CV-CFN has agreed that, unless otherwise agreed by

financial expenses and reduce its net income from its past average, 2.3% of
assets to 1.5% during 1976-80. However, the larger spread on its operations

its return on equity.

for 68% of COFIEiC's portfolio at the end of 1975.   On the other hand, it has
to be recognized that a private DFC must remain profitable if it is to grow
to meet the increased demand for its services. During 1973-75 COFIEC's
return on equity averaged 14.4% annually which, after making allowance
for inflation, resulted in a negative return in real terms. Flexible and
imaginative management permitted COFIEC to reduce administrative costs and
turn to higher yield assets but required a disproportionate growth of short-
term liabilities and, ultimately a reduction in its development financing
role. The measures adopted recently by the Government (see paragraph 25
above) should contribute to arrest these trends and enable COFIEC to resume
its function of primarily providing risk capital and term financing for
industry. More specifically, the Bank would agree to COFTEC's increasing
its debt/equity ratio (a) initially, from 7:1 to 8:1; and (b) in steps, from
8:1 to 10:1 in a manner and at times to be agreed with the Bank on the basis
of the Bank's assessment of COFIEC's portfolio composition and quality,
resource composition and appraisal and supervision capabilities and perfor-
mance (see Sections 2.11 and 2.12 of the draft COFIEC Project Agreement).
Moreover, new accounting procedures, satisfactory to the Bank, are to be
established and maintained by COFIEC which will disclose at all times the
amount of letters of credit which, upon liquidation, were converted into
COFIEC's debt. In this regard, refinanced letters of credit would be subject
to the debt/equity limitation.
43.        COFIEC's arrears increased from 3.6% of portfolio in 1974 to 5.2%
in 1975 reflecting primarily the tighter credit policy adopted by the Central
Bank during the second half of 1975. Although COFIEC's auditors were of the
opinion that bad debt provisions at end 1975 were adequate (1.8% of port-
folio), COFIEC has agreed to increase such provisions net of estimated losses
to not less than (.8% of portfolio by December 1978 and to 1% by 1979. For
this purpose, COFIEC is expected to continue its program of writing off losses.
Moreover, COFIEC has agreed to increase its monthly allocation for bad debt
provisions from S/.350,000 to S/.600,000 beginning in January 1977 (see
Sections 2.01(b) (ii) and (iii) of the draft COFIEC Project Agreement).
COFIEC passes the foreign exchange risk of its borrowings to its clients
except for foreign exchange obligations incurred up to February 5, 1971 for
which a special reserve was created under the second DFC loan. The Bank
agrees with COFIEC's auditors that the current level of such reserve is ade-
quate and has received assurances from COFIEC that an adequate reserve will
be maintained (see Section 2.06 of the draft COFIEC Project Agreement).
44.        During 1972-75 the number of COFIEC's loan approvals has grown
tenfold, and the amount lent increase!d almost 42% in real terms. Concentra-
tion is not as marked as in CV-CFN (13% of COFIEC's projects absorbed 49% of
its lending in 1975), but since COFIEC has maintained the average size of its
loans lower than CV-CFN, it has been able to make almost three times more
loans than CV-CFN with only 57% of the latter's volume.     These figures do
not represent,solely, a genuine increase in development financing. Rather
they are in part a reflection of COFIEC's marked return to short-term lending.

39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 46 of this Report. They are listed as well in Section
III of Annex IV along with the timetable of key events. In addition, the
following have been agreed as:
(a) conditions of effectiveness (see Sections 7.01 of the draft
Loan Agreement):
(i) that the Republic of Ecuador shall have entrusted the
proceeds of the proposed loan to the Central Bank; and
(ii) that the Project and Subsidiary Loan Agreements with
either CV-CFN or COFIEC shall have been duly authorized
and signed and become effective.
(b) conditions of disbursement for CV-CFN and COFIEC (see Section
2.02(b) (iv), (vi) and (vii) of the draft Loan Agreement):
(i) that their respective Project and Subsidiary Loan Agree-
ments shall have been signed and become effective; and
(ii) that their respective Statements of Policies and Proce-
dures shall have been amended to reflect, to the extent
needed, the agreements reached with the Bank.
otherwise, the draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for
D)FC projects.
51.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
