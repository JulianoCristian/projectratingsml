                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to be implemented satisfactorily, with the benefits of the planning and integrated economic evaluation methodologies being highly valued by various Chilean
                         ministries and counterparts involved in the project.

                         Project disbursements to date amount at US$43 million, equivalent to 86% of total credit funds. In addition, project implementation has reported US$21 million as national

                         counterpart. The budget allocated for the PIRDT for 2011 amount at an equivalent of about US$30 million. This together with the level of subproject pipeline generated through the
                         PMDTs the PIRDT will be in a comfortable position to comply with the remaining level of disbursements of the credit (US$6.9 million) and the counterpart financing (US$18.3 million).

                         A total of 8 regions are participating in the project with the formally inclusion of two new regions to the project, Region VI OHiggins and Region XI Aysen, as of January 2011. In
                         addition of the 31 completed PMDTs for the first participating six regions, 13 additional PMDTs are programmed to be prepared in 2011, 6 of them are already in preparation. The
                         project has financed 139 subprojects in rural roads, water and sanitation, energy, and ICT. Additional projects identified in the PMDTs have been implemented by other parties
                         (central government and regional governments).

                         SUBDERE, MIDEPLAN and regional teams recognized the great contribution of the project's approach to improve the public investment system in Chile at the regional level through a
                         territorial, rather than sectoral approach. The territorial planning approach enables to align the regional interventions in a more effective manner through prioritizing public investment
                         in infrastructure that supports the economic development of the territories and improves the livelihoods of rural communities. Also, the territorial approach through its participatory
                         methodology involving all key regional and local stakeholders has proved to be a successful tool to intervene in indigenous territories.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the upcoming closing date of the project by December 2011, the Bank will be working with SUBDERE, DIPRES, Regional Governments, and other institutions and
                         stakeholders involved in the project in the preparation of a project completion report that enables to assess all the project achievements, activities carried out under the project, and
                         lessons learned. However, the Chilean Government has expressed that they will continue working with the provision for Rural Infrastructure for Territorial Development and have also
                         expressed their interest in continuing working with the Bank in the expansion and consolidation of this territorial planning methodology and the economic integrated evaluation for the
                         provision of rural infrastructure in a second operation.
