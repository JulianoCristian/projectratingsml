                         ministries and counterparts involved in the project.

                         Project implementation generated disbursement of US$15 million during the year 2010, which elevates the rate of disbursement to 86%. Given this level of disbursements and project

                         SUBDERE, MIDEPLAN and regional teams recognized the great contribution of the project's approach to improve the public investment system in Chile at the regional level through a
                         territorial, rather than sectoral approach. The territorial planning approach enables to align the regional interventions in a more effective manner through prioritizing public investment
                         in infrastructure that supports the economic development of the territories and improves the livelihoods of rural communities. Also, the territorial approach through its participatory
                         methodology involving all key regional and local stakeholders has proven to be a successful tool to intervene in indigenous territories.
