ETHIOPIA

FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT 
P113156 
(CREDIT 4543-ET; GRANT H4420-ET) 
 
Restructuring Paper 
 
1. 
The closing date for 
Ethiopia, Fertilizer Support Project
 (Credit 4543-ET; Grant 
H4420-ET), P113156 will be extended from June 30, 2010 until July 31, 2010.   
2. 
The Project has provided the Government with the needed foreign exchange 
resources to facilitate the import of fertilizer (urea and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)) 
for the 2009 production seasons. Government reports, Bank supervision missions, and the 
draft Impact Evaluation study show that farmers have received fertilizers reasonably on 
time. Procurement, importation and distribution of fertilizer for the 2010 season is well 
under way, so availability of fertilizer for farmers is also ensured for the current season. 
The 
Project Development Objective of contributing to the Government’s efforts to ensure 
aggregate availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production 
season adequate to meet smallholder farmers’ priority demands is being achieved. 
3. 
The proposed extension is necessary to ensure the completion of the Project. The 
performance of the Borrower and the implementing agency is satisfactory, and the only 
action remaining is the successful completion of the Project's impact evaluation study. 
The extension will also ensure us processing the Government's request for cancellation 
and reallocation of remaining Project funds. 
4. 
This will be the first extension of the project.
