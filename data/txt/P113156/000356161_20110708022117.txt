                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Fertilizer Support
Project (IDA Grant H4420-ET, IDA-Credit 4543-ET) under the Ethiopia Emergency
Food Crisis Response Program and the Global Food Crisis Response Program.

The project was approved on December 10, 2008 and became effective in the same
month on December 23, 2008. A total of US$250 million were approved for the project.
At project closure US$244.13 had been disbursed. The project closed on July 31th 2010,
one month behind schedule.

The report presents findings based on review of the projects‘ implementation completion
report, program paper, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant material. In
addition, an IEG mission to Ethiopia in February-March 2011, made field visits and held
discussions with government officials and agencies, project staff, beneficiaries, key
donors, and academia.

The assessment has a three-fold purpose: (i) an accountability purpose to assess the
project to verify that the Bank intervention has achieved its intended outcome; (ii) a
learning purpose to draw lessons of experience to help inform future engagement in this
area; (iii) to contribute to a future IEG food crisis response evaluation.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
Government of Ethiopia for comments. These are included as Annex C.

Summary
Ethiopia is one of the poorest and most food insecure countries in the world. The
Government has prioritized agricultural development as a part of its strategy for
increasing the country‘s food security. The Government‘s Agriculture Development-Led
Industrialization strategy, first formalized in 1993, started reforms to generate a
supportive macroeconomic framework, liberalize markets and promote the intensification
of crops through the use of modern inputs. In the last few years Ethiopia has achieved
significant progress in increasing agricultural production. However, much of the increase
has come from area expansion rather than by wide-spread productivity growth and food
insecurity remains a significant issue for the country.

More recently, Ethiopia‘s pro-growth development policies have contributed to high
average growth but demand has been ahead of capacity expansion in the economy,
contributing to high inflation and strong import growth. In 2008, when the Fertilizer
Support Project (FSP) was approved, Ethiopia faced multiple challenges: high inflation,
widening trade deficit, low foreign exchange reserves, failed 2008 belg rains resulting in
drought and food shortages affecting some 12 million people.

Among the modern inputs emphasized by the Government to promote agricultural
intensification, fertilizer has received priority attention. Ethiopia depends entirely on
imports to meet its annual chemical fertilizer demand. In 2008, with foreign exchange
reserves in the country at an extreme low and international price of fertilizers at an
extreme high, the Government requested the World Bank under the Global Food Crisis
Response Program (GFRP) for support to import fertilizers, and FSP came into being as a
part of the Ethiopia Emergency Food Crisis Response Program (EEFCRP). EEFCRP had
two parts. Part A was additional financing for Bank support to the Productive Safety Net
APL II project and Part B was FSP. This assessment covers Part B.

With an appraisal amount of US$250 million, FSP‘s development objective was to
contribute to the Government’s efforts to ensure an aggregate availability of supply of
chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production season, adequate to meet smallholder
farmers’ priority demands. The program goal was to increase the likelihood that crop
production in 2009-2010 would remain on or near the growth trends of recent years.

Taking advantage of the flexibility in its procedures under the Operational Policy/Best
Practice 8.00 and the newly approved GFRP, the Bank responded with alacrity to the
emergency situation in the country. The project helped the government import 510,370
MTs of fertilizers. Including imports financed by other donors and left-over stocks from
the previous year, a total of 727,637 MTs of fertilizer was available in the country against
an actual demand of about 427,000 MTs for the 2009-2010 production season—70
percent more than actually needed.

The logistical and capacity constraints of importing both large quantities of fertilizers and
food aid, through the Djibouti port were overlooked during preparation and appraisal.
Consequently, congestion at the Djibouti port led to delays and higher costs of the World
Food Program‘s (WFP‘s) response to the humanitarian crisis, arising from the poor rains
in the same year.
                                             viii


Ultimately in 2009, partly because of the sheer logistical challenge at Djibouti, the
fertilizer came in late to cover most of the need for the belg season which was largely
covered from available stocks. One of the main justifications for the rapid preparation of
the project was to ensure that the imports supported through it were also available for this
season. There was also delay in getting it to farmers for the meher season. The delayed
rain in 2009 provided for some flexibility in delivery as farmers usually wait to buy
fertilizers until the rains come in. Overall, there were shortcomings in the fertilizer being
available in time to meet the priority needs of farmers. Cooperative unions and the public
enterprise, the Agriculture Input Supply Enterprise (AISE), acknowledged that
particularly DAP (that formed more than 80 percent of the fertilizer procured) delivery in
the FSP year was less efficient compared to 2008/09 and one quarter of farmers report
receiving fertilizer late. Wide discrepancies in data reported from different sources make
it difficult to determine whether agricultural production increased as intended by the
project.

About 300,000 MTs of the fertilizers were carried forward as leftover stocks after the
2009-2010 production seasons. Better demand estimation, planning and coordination, and
a project design that would have agreed on importing an amount of fertilizer in line with
actual needs, would have allowed use of the foreign exchange that was locked up in the
surplus fertilizer to fulfill other competing demands in the economy in a time of crisis. In
sum, this assessment has several concerns about project relevance, efficacy and
efficiency, and rates overall project outcome as moderately unsatisfactory.

While the project implementation arrangement that allowed the AISE to emerge as the
sole fertilizer importer for the country may have contributed to timely allocation of
foreign exchange and procurement of fertilizers, the whole effort put into promoting
fertilizer marketing reform by the Bank over more than a decade, was set back. Many of
the cooperative unions that had also been importing fertilizers before the FSP are no
longer doing so and are now engaged only in its distribution. Their distribution profit
margin is determined upfront by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
when it sets the fertilizer price to be charged at the primary cooperative level. At the time
of the IEG mission in February-March 2011, AISE was still the sole importer and
stakeholder interviews revealed that this arrangement may have come to stay. Further, the
loss of importing experience and associated revenues for these cooperatives could affect
their capacity to provide other services to their members and in the longer run
compromise the effectiveness of the fertilizer distribution system. The program goal was
ultimately to keep crop production at or near the trend level in 2009/10 and these changes
that have occurred in the fertilizer distribution system have increased the risk that such an
outcome may not be maintained in the coming years. Therefore risk to development
outcome is rated moderate even though this was an operation with a limited, time-bound
objective.

The assessment rates both Bank and Borrower performance as moderately unsatisfactory
because of issues related to inadequate attention to competition with food aid, weak due-
diligence on demand-estimation, shortcomings on financial management, safeguards and
delayed attention to monitoring and evaluation during implementation. The project‘s
Environment and Social Management Plan came too late to allow for environmental and
health safety mitigation measures to be taken in distributing fertilizers. It showed that
                                            ix


many fertilizer stores did not observe the national standards and requirements for storage
and the health safety situation got worse as one moved from main stores at urban centers
to those held by cooperatives/unions at community level (i.e., primary cooperative
stores).

Building on the project experience this assessment identifies four major lessons:

      The risk of a short-run emergency response compromising a long term World
       Bank supported reform effort should be assessed at design. Steps to bring the
       reform effort back on track if needed after the emergency should be identified.
      Health safety and environmental implications need particular attention in
       emergency projects such as FSP since their rushed implementation schedule often
       does not allow for mitigation plans to be put in place before implementation.
      Inadequate attention to the limits of country capacity and effective coordination
       with agencies, such as WFP, that have traditionally been in the forefront in
       dealing with food crisis situations can hamper both the timeliness and
       effectiveness of the food crisis response.
      A more sophisticated system of estimating demand, including an estimate of the
       optimum level of strategic fertilizer reserves between one season and the next
       would be important for ensuring efficiency of resource use in Ethiopia which is
       entirely dependent on centralized imports for its fertilizers.

1. Country and Project Context
Country Context
1.2     Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries1 in the world and food insecurity defined as
the "lack of access to sufficient food for an active healthy life"2 has long plagued the
country's poor. Between 5 to 7 million Ethiopians suffer from chronic3 food insecurity and
devastating recurrent droughts that occur every few years lead to wide variations in the
number of those facing transitional or acute4 food insecurity at any given time. The country
is one of the world's largest recipients of food aid which bridges the gap between available
food supply and demand. Food aid has averaged about 700,000 metric tons (MTs) annually
over the past ten years (IFPRI 2007).

1.3     Making Ethiopia food secure is a major Government development goal and one of the
most important steps taken by the Government in this direction is prioritization of
agricultural development. The agriculture sector in Ethiopia accounts for about 40 percent of
national GDP, 85 percent of employment and 90 percent of exports. The agricultural
development-led industrialization (ADLI) strategy was formalized in 1993. It emphasizes
national food self-sufficiency and development through increased agricultural growth driven
by the commercialization of smallholder production and stronger linkages with Ethiopia‘s
emerging industrial sector (Spielman and others 2009). In the 1990s, ADLI also started
reforms to generate a supportive macroeconomic framework, liberalize markets and promote
the intensification of crops, through the use of modern inputs, such as seed and fertilizers
(ibid). Over time, the ADLI strategy has been further developed and fine‐tuned, for example,
in the Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP),
Ethiopia‘s strategic framework for the five‐year period 2005/06‐2009/10 (Dercon and Zeitlin
2009).5 The Government also has a separate food security strategy which is embedded in the
ADLI. Apart from emphasizing direct food production, the food security strategy supports
voluntary resettlement, income diversification and a productive safety net program (PSNP) to
provide direct cash/food transfer to vulnerable households.

1.4   In the last two decades, Ethiopia has achieved significant progress in its social and
economic indicators and, particularly in the last few years, agricultural production is reported

 At US$350, Ethiopia's /capita income is significantly lower than the Sub-Saharan African average of US$1,077 in FY
2009 (GNI, atlas Method).

 This shorter definition is derived from the following longer one: ―The commonly accepted definition of food security is—
when all people, at all times have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.‖ World Bank 2007a.
3
    Chronic food insecurity arises because of the inability of the poor to produce or purchase sufficient sustenance.
4
    Transitional or acute food insecurity arises due to catastrophic events such as droughts or food price increase.
5
  In December 2010, the Government established the Ethiopian Agriculture Transformation Agency (ATA) with the primary
aim of promoting the transformation of the agriculture sector by supporting existing structures of government, private sector
and other non-governmental partners to address systemic bottlenecks to delivering on a priority national agenda for
achieving growth and food security.
                                                                2


to have increased significantly. Official (Central Statistical Agency (CSA)) sources indicate
that between 2004/05 and 2008/09, cereal production, which accounts for about 70 percent of
total crop production, increased at 12.2 percent annually and total grain production (cereals,
pulses, oilseeds) increased at about 11.8 percent annually (IFPRI 2011). However, for the
country as a whole, both chronic and acute food insecurity remains a significant issue. Land
and environmental degradation have been challenges to agricultural development6 and the
increasing food demand because of a rapidly growing population has made it difficult for
supply to keep pace.7, 8

1.5     Ethiopia is endowed with significant water resources, which remain largely
unexploited (World Bank 2006a). Despite the priority given to agricultural development,
access to irrigation remains very limited leaving crop production heavily dependent on the
highly erratic rainfall. Most small farmers continue to also rely on traditional technologies
and produce primarily for self-consumption (Braun and Olofinbiyi 2007).9 Despite the push
for greater use of modern inputs through government policies and extension programs, the
inherent features of Ethiopia‘s small holder agriculture sector10 have not changed
substantially. Much of the increase in production over the past decade is explained by area
expansion rather than by wide-spread productivity growth.

Box 1. Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP)
On May 29th, 2008 the Bank‘s Board of Executive Directors approved a new $1.2 billion rapid financing
facility to address immediate needs arising from the food crisis. In response to high demand, the Bank
increased the GFRP ceiling to $2 billion on April 16, 2009, allowing for accelerated processing of an
additional $800 million in IDA/IBRD resources over the next year. GFRP provided an umbrella for rapid
Bank support to address different aspects of the food crisis. Both development policy and rapid response
investment lending could be used to provide support for various activities, among others, those
contributing to enhancing household food security by strengthening targeted safety nets and maternal and
child health and nutrition services, including cash transfer programs; emergency financing for food
imports; support for import of agricultural inputs; measures aimed at stabilizing highly volatile food
prices and assisting governments to make better use of risk management instruments in dealing with food
price unpredictability; enhancing the consistency between emergency price policy measures and longer
term measures requiring for lasting solutions. Information on the program is available at

about three times the replacement rate, which makes it one of the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (Minas 2008).

country overtime.11 Reducing vulnerability and enhancing growth have long been Bank goals
as reflected in the country assistance strategies (CASs) for the periods 2003-2005 and 2008-
2011. Emergency support has also been provided over the years—for recovery and
rehabilitation after the war with Eritrea, for drought relief and most recently in 2008 as a part
of the Bank‘s Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) (Box 1).

Project Context
1.7     The strong growth in the Ethiopian economy in the past six years as reflected in
Figure 1, has come largely from government-led development policies that have emphasized
not only agricultural development but also public investment and nonfarm private sector
development (IMF 2010). These policies have contributed to high average growth of 11.5
percent (as per official statistics) since 2003/04 but demand has been ahead of capacity
expansion, contributing to high inflation and strong import growth (IMF 2009). While some
of the import dependency is explained by the need to build large infrastructure, the
considerable increase in import of consumption goods, largely a consequence of Ethiopia‘s
small and stagnant manufacturing sector, has also played a role (World Bank 2008c).

1.8     Since Ethiopia is entirely dependent on imports to meet its annual chemical fertilizer
demand, the emphasis on agricultural development has also added to the increasing import
bill. Typically loans, grants from donors, and government resources have provided for the
foreign exchange needed for fertilizer imports. The state-owned Agricultural Input Supply
Enterprise (AISE) plays the major role in fertilizer import and marketing. However, since,




11
   IEG‘s recent Country Assistance Evaluation for the period 1998-2006 found that Ethiopia is among the World Bank‘s
largest IDA-eligible borrowers in Sub-Saharan Africa for a total net commitment of US$2 billion as of end-FY07 (IEG
2008a).
                                                                4


2005, an increasing number of cooperative unions were involved in import and distribution
of fertilizers to both union and non-members.12

1.9      In 2008, when the Fertilizer Support Project (henceforth FSP) was approved, Ethiopia
faced multiple challenges. Beginning in 2006/07, inflation began to accelerate in the country,
and there were significant increases in the nominal prices of both food and non‐food items.13
In addition to the high inflation, widening trade deficit and low foreign exchange reserves,
the 2008 belg rains failed (Box 2 for details on the belg and meher cropping seasons in
Ethiopia). The poor belg harvest and the resulting drought and food shortages affected some
12 million people and added to the high food inflation in the country.14 Nominal wholesale
prices of teff, maize and sorghum all rose by more than 90 percent between March and
August 2008; real prices of these commodities rose by 30 to 40 percent (Rashid and Dorosh
2008). At this time Ethiopia had one of the highest food price inflation rates in the world
(World Bank 2008). Steep increases in international prices for key imports, such as
fertilizers, further increased the strains on the Ethiopian economy and pushed foreign
exchange reserves to critically low levels—equivalent to just 1 month of imports of goods
and services at end-November 2008 (IMF 2009).15

1.10 The Government took several measures to deal with the crisis: it took steps to reduce
aggregate demand through, among other measures, reducing federal expenditure as discussed
elsewhere (e.g. in World Bank 2008c); it imported about 300,000 tons of wheat which it sold
in urban areas at below domestic market price to meet the food security needs of the
vulnerable urban poor; its productive safety net program provided supplementary food and
cash assistance to 4.4 million families; it launched an appeal for emergency food relief.16 To
prevent further worsening of the food security situation in the coming year it also continued
to simultaneously strive to increase agricultural production. With reserves at an extreme low,
the Government requested foreign exchange support to import fertilizers from the World
Bank under the GFRP, and the FSP came into being as a part of the Ethiopia Emergency
Food Crisis Response Program.

     Annex B Table B1 documents the shifting roles of public and private actors in the fertilizer market.
13
  Between January 2007 and March 2008, the overall consumer price index (CPI) rose by 35 percent; food prices rose by 47
percent and non‐food prices rose by 18 percent (Rashid and Dorosh 2008)
14
  After three successive good harvests in 2005, 2006 and 2007, Ethiopia experienced a poor belg harvest in 2008. Although
the belg rains only account for a small amount of total agricultural production, they have a significant impact on long cycle
crop production since these rains provide the seedbed moisture for the long-cycle meher crops. The poor belg harvest of
2008 precipitated a dramatic rise in food prices (USAID 2010).
15
  ―International prices of oil and fertilizers rose by 150 percent and 75 percent, respectively. This contributed to a doubling
of the oil and fertilizer import bill in 2007/08 to almost US$2 billion (about 8 percent of GDP). A 28 percent rise in prices of
coffee, the largest export item, provided only a partial offset to the trade balance.‖ IMF 2009.
16
  ―In 2009 two consecutive poor belg cropping seasons (March-May) prompted the Ethiopian government to launch an
emergency appeal in October for 6.2 million people. The June-September rains started late were erratic and ended early in
some areas. This resulted in below normal harvests in meher (November–December) cropping areas. It also resulted in
shortages of pasture and water which affected the reproduction and productivity of livestock particularly in the water-
deficient areas of Afar. All this combined with high staple food prices, poor livestock production and reduced agricultural
wages meant elevated food insecurity was a constant feature in 2009. By the end of the year 6.2 million people were in need
of emergency food relief.‖ WFP 2009.

2. Project Objectives, Design and Implementation
Experience
Objective
2.1    There were two parts to the Ethiopia Emergency Food Crisis Response program each
of which had a program goal and a development objective. Part A was additional financing
for Bank support (Productive Safety Net APL II) to the PSNP17 and Part B was the FSP. The
program goal for the former was to ensure that the needs of chronically food-insecure
households are adequately addressed and for the latter was to increase the likelihood that
crop production in 2009/10 would remain on or near the growth trends of recent years. The
development objective of Part A was to contribute to the Government‘s efforts to maintain
adequate coverage of the Ethiopia‘s PSNP in 2009 thereby ensuring that the objectives of the
PSNP project were met. The development objective of Part B as stated in the program
document [and the Financing Agreement] was to contribute to the Government’s [or
Recipient’s] efforts to ensure an aggregate availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for
the 2009-2010 production season, adequate to meet smallholder farmers’ priority demands.
This assessment covers Part B.

Components, Costs and Timing of FSP
2.2         FSP had two components:

           Fertilizer Component (US$249.60 million at appraisal and US$243.84 million at
            completion): to ensure the availability of foreign exchange for the import of
            fertilizers to meet the demand for the 2009/10 production seasons.
           Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Component (US$0.4 million at appraisal and
            US$0.29 million at completion): to track the fertilizer imports through the various
            steps along the distribution system and to assess the impact of the project.

2.3    The Project Development Objective (PDO) and components were not revised during
implementation. The project was not co-financed. However, the African Development Bank
(AfDB), and the Government of Japan provided parallel support. According to the
completion report for the FSP, the AfDB allocated US$59.6 million which allowed for
procurement of about 158,000 MTs of fertilizers18 and the Government of Japan provided
about 28,000 tons of urea to Ethiopia in 2009, a substantially larger donation than Japan was
providing in previous years.


2.4     The FSP was financed through re-deploying resources from 12 projects, including
several agricultural and rural operations, as well as new commitments from the World

17
     The additional financing was to fill the gap that emerged as result of the food price inflation and drought in 2008.
18
  According to the project documents obtained from AfDB the letter of Agreement between the Government of Ethiopia
and the AfDB became effective on November 27, 2008. The documents also show that part of the fertilizer was procured for
the 2009 production season and the balance for the 2010 production season.
                                                               7


Bank.19 Of the appraisal amount of US$250 million, US$127.50 million was IDA Grant and
US$ 122.50 million was IDA credit. It was agreed with the Government that the bulk of the
local currency equivalent would be used to lower its domestic borrowing—so that no new
money is created in the system. Due to SDR appreciation against the US$ during project
implementation, an additional US$9.3 million was available to the Government. Actual
project cost was US$244.01 million. Approximately US$ 6.2 million could not be used to
buy fertilizer in 2010/11 as intended by the Government as the tender was not advertized
internationally. Based on this and because of the appreciation of the SDR against the US$
undisbursed funds amounting to about US$15.5 million were cancelled. At the request of the
Government, these are to be transferred to the Protection of Basic Services (PBS) Project.

2.5     The project inception started around May 2008. It was approved in December 2008,
became effective in the same month, and was to close on June 30, 2010. The Board
presentation of the project followed streamlined procedures in line with the GFRP program.
Shortly before closing the project was formally restructured and the closing date was
extended by one month to July 31, 2010 to ensure completion of the project and to allow for
time to process the cancellation and reallocation of funds. The PDO and performance
indicators did not change.

Implementation Experience
2.6    The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MoARD) was the main project
implementing agency, but in reality, several Government departments/parastatals were
involved in project implementation: MoARD, which was responsible for the financial
management aspect of the project; AISE, which was responsible for procuring the fertilizer;
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED), which was responsible for
depositing the Birr equivalent amount of the credit and grant of the project in the treasury
account; National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) which was responsible for availing the foreign
currency account; and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), which was responsible for
opening the letter of credit for fertilizer procurement.

2.7     The size of the main fertilizer component was determined by the world fertilizer
prices prevailing at the time of project conception (mid-2008) and the estimated local
demand. World prices, for both di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and urea, were at an all time
high then (Figure 2). However, prices, for both commodities, began dropping dramatically
around November 2008 (Figure 3). Ultimately, the resources allocated under the project
enabled the government to import about 510,000 tons of fertilizers instead of the planned
400,000 tons, contributing to an oversupply of 70 percent.

2.8    In the short project lifetime implementation faced four serious challenges, two of
which had implications for the project‘s outcome, and two of which were related to safeguard
and project financial management.

          PORT CONGESTION AT DJIBOUTI

          2.7      Port congestion at Djibouti and insufficient capacity for fertilizer trucking was a
          considerable constraint during the early months. Internal documents show that the delivery at
          Djibouti of the first 150,000 MTs of DAP was scheduled to be completed by February 17 and
          the first 75,000 MTs of urea by early March 2009. This was delayed and only about 60,000
          MTs was in the country by mid-March, the time of the first supervision mission, though none
          of it had reached the farmers by then. Congestion at Djibouti and a shortage of trucks was to
          a large extent responsible for the delay in getting it to the warehouses. The port had limited
          capacity for discharging the fertilizers. Initially, of the 12 berths, only two were allocated for

bulk cargo and only one of these was allocated for discharging fertilizer. Discussions were
held for several weeks with port authorities to use the second berth for discharging the
fertilizer but there was competition with other commodities including food grain and cement.
A Steering Committee chaired by MoARD and including the Minister of Transport and
Communication was established to address the problem. The Bank followed up with the
Ethiopian Government that had committed to give priority to fertilizer import.20

INADEQUATE AVAILABILITY OF IMPROVED SEEDS

2.8     The inadequate availability of improved seeds was a critical problem during the
implementation period. Ethiopia currently faces a large gap between the country‘s production
of commercial seeds and farmers‘ demand, knowledge, access and usage of these seeds
(IFPRI 2010b). CSA estimates show that while the total quantity of improved seed supplied
nationally has increased since 1996/97, farmer use of improved seeds covered an average of
only 4.7 percent of cropped area in 2007/08 (Spielman and others 2010). Between fertilizers
and seeds, the expansion of seed use has been much more limited, reflecting the
government‘s greater focus on increasing the use of fertilizer as the key component of the
new technology (World Bank 2006a). During project implementation supervision missions
reported on the critical shortage of improved seeds, particularly maize (see Figure 4). Since
the yield response of fertilizer depends to a large extent on the quality of seeds used this
shortage potentially undermined the effectiveness of fertilizer use. Annex B Box B 1 notes
the challenges in the seed sector.




20
   A consultant report (Hine 2009), based on a visit to Ethiopia and Djibouti between April 17 th-24th 2009 notes that with
multiple arrivals, fertilizer vessels were encountering major delays in securing berths. Typical fertilizer consignments ranged
in size from 13,000 to 25,000 tons and they could be in the port from five days to three weeks. One of the two major
fertilizer supply companies, Yara, complained that they faced about $1 million in demurrage charges. With the Ethiopian
government expressing a priority for fertilizer discharge over other cargoes Djibouti port allocated four berths for unloading
fertilizers. A coordination committee to deal with the problem was set up in Addis Ababa together with a committee in
Djibouti. Amongst other things the Addis office looked into delays and manning problems at receiving warehouses. The
Djibouti committee was chaired by the Ethiopian Ambassador to Djibouti. To ensure sufficient trucks were available for
fertilizers at the truck holding park (Pika Dus) outside the port trucks were issued with permits to enter the port and were
directed to take the fertilizer. The report notes that the direction to trucks to load fertilizers, whether the driver and owner
wants to or not (since higher rates are given for the other cargos) may cause resentment in trucking companies and other
interested parties and could slow down other sectors of the economy.

 THE SAFEGUARD CHALLENGE

 2.9      The project was an Environment Category B. It was to be implemented in accordance
 with an Environment and Social Management Plan (ESMP) which was to provide guidance
 for safe management of the fertilizer consignment expected to arrive in the country, relevant
 institutional capacity building measures as well as relevant environmental awareness creation
 and training programs. According to the Financing Agreement the ESMP was to be prepared
 and provided to the Bank no later than 2 months after the project effectiveness date.
 However, the Social Assessment (ESA) including the ESMP was not finalized till late in the
 year. Although the Bank‘s non-objection to the hire of a consultant for the preparation of the
 ESA/ESMP was issued on December 10, 2008, the actual hiring process was delayed and
 distribution of fertilizers was started without the Plan. The finalized Assessment and Plan
 was sent to IDA only on 23 December 2009, and disclosed only in January, 2009. In reality,
 the ESMP came too late to allow for mitigation measures to be taken in distributing
 fertilizers. The ESMP report found that many of the fertilizer stores visited by the consultant
 did not observe the national standards and requirements for storage. The report showed that
 the health and safety situation got worse as one moved from main stores at urban centers to
 those held by cooperatives/unions at community level (i.e., primary cooperative stores).21


 21
      The footnote provides several examples from the project Environmental and Social Assessment:
 ―Most fertilizer stores do not comply with health and safety standards established by Ethiopian Standard (ES) for fertilizer
 products, thus resulting in to health and safety hazards to staffs and laborers working in them.‖ (page 42)
 ―During field assessment, the Consultant was able to observe that AISE main stores are built following international norms
 having acceptable size, structural fitness, roofing heights allowing enough aeration, etc. Most of these main stores contain
 only fertilizer products under their roof, thus separating storage of fertilizer from cereals or agrochemicals. However, the
 Adama main store (located within the branch office premises) contains some agrochemicals stored together with fertilizer,
                                                             11


FIDUCIARY CONCERN

2.10 Improper drawdown of the Designated Account (DA) was a significant financial
management concern in the early months of implementation. As per the implementation
arrangements, MoARD was to open a DA for the project at the NBE to be used for both the
Fertilizer and the M&E components. The US $250 million was credited to the Government's
central treasury account. However, the entire amount was immediately made available to the
CBE with the local currency equivalent transferred to the country‘s central treasury account.
This was a violation of the Financing Agreement as the Commercial Bank and the treasury
should have received funds only in line with actual need. The DA needed to hold the amount
for the M&E Component and the US$5,384,400 of unused balance for the Fertilizer
Component, to be used for fertilizer import in 2010. The Bank followed up and the MOFED
agreed to repay the money into the DA and to send a confirmation letter as to the use of
funds and transfer of local currency equivalent into the central treasury account in keeping
with the Financing Agreement. This issue was resolved only in October 2009.

3. Relevance
Relevance of Objectives
3.1     The foreign exchange support to the Government to import fertilizers came at a time
when the country‘s reserves were at an extreme low (paragraph 1.8). There is no doubt that
the country‘s ability to procure fertilizers would have been restricted without the support
from the World Bank and other development partners. Given the shortage of foreign
exchange the project objective of contributing to the government‘s efforts of ensuring an
aggregate availability of supply of chemical fertilizers was substantially relevant. The
program goal of increasing the likelihood that crop production remains near the growth trend
of recent years was also substantially relevant. Increasing productivity of agriculture was a
focus area for the 2008 CAS which recognized its importance both for strengthening the
basis for growth of the economy and for reducing the food insecurity of the poor.

Relevance of Design
3.2    The project design was appropriately simple with two components—a large Fertilizer
Component and a much smaller M&E one. It is creditable that even in an emergency
response intervention the design gave considerable emphasis to M&E including tracking of


thus endangering health conditions of workers in the store. The Modjo main store compound also contains empty barrels of
pesticide which according to the storekeepers have been left unattended for several years and as result bringing serious
environmental as well as health risk to people working in the stores and the surrounding environment.‖ Page 18-19.
―Physical injuries and blackening of the shoulder on the laborers while loading and unloading fertilizer, respiratory ailments
such as breathlessness, cough and whizzing (whistling) due to dust in the store and outside the store as a result of truck
movements, and skin and eye allergies due to contact with fertilizer products. All these are happening because laborers are
not provided with required protective gears and lack of training on safety and health precautions. These facts were revealed
as result of interviews we had with laborers and store keepers at AISE central stores visited. However, in order to determine
the exact magnitude of the problem, a detail study is required in the future.‖ Page 7. Project Environment and Social
Assessment August 2009.

the quantity of fertilizer imported, its distribution, and timeliness of its availability to
farmers.
3.3      Figure 5 presents the assumed results chain for the project that shows several
conditions which needed to hold for fertilizers to actually produce the desired production
impact. These conditions include among others: availability of complementary inputs such as
improved seeds that determine the yield response to fertilizers; adequacy of soil moisture;
fertilizers available are the most suited to the kinds of soils; farmers have the technical know-
how to apply fertilizers in appropriate quantities and at the right time in the crop cycle; there
are no bottlenecks to actually getting the fertilizers into the country and distributing them to
farmers; farmers are able to buy the fertilizers or have access to credit to pay for them.22
Many of these issues have been discussed and their importance recognized in the project
document itself, and in the Bank‘s analytical work (e.g. World Bank 2006a and Christiaensen
and Demery 2007).23 24 The Bank‘s analytical work also shows (Table 1) that yield loss can
be substantial because of fertilizer application in a year of poor rainfall. But for various
reasons the Borrower did not ask for support in all these areas.25 FSP was an emergency
response and a complex project with several components would not have been appropriate.
The Government viewed support from the Bank for fertilizer procurement as most critical in
the emergency.




22
  Inadequate complementary inputs and access to water, credit, extension among other factors were, at the time of project
approval, and continue to be a critical constraint to increasing agricultural production and productivity (see Annex B Box B2
for details). It is not surprising therefore, that despite a fivefold increase in fertilizer application (kg/ha), national cereal
yields have only increased 10 percent since the 1980s, and relative benefits of chemical fertilizer application have decreased
over time (IFPRI 2010).
23
  In fact, the Bank‘s draft report on Policies for Pro-Poor Agricultural Growth (World Bank 2006a) showed that based on
current usage patterns fertilizer use did not appear to be profitable in Ethiopia. It demonstrated that ―The returns to fertilizer
use thus on average are less than the associated cost, implying inefficient use of fertilizer. Further analysis of the average net
benefit at each of the five quintiles of fertilizer use intensity shows that in each group, the average farmer is not using
fertilizer profitably.‖
24
  The program document while noting that extension had been significantly strengthened in recent years and the
Government with support from other development partners such as FAO, GTZ and USAID has launched new initiatives to
boost crop production through improved seeds, also acknowledges that ―…improvements are needed in the rural credit
system, the extension system, and the provision of seeds and other complementary inputs‖ pg. 20.
25
  For example, while recognizing the importance of seeds the program document noted (footnote 2 page 6) ―… since the
value of the seed sector is much smaller than that for fertilizer and since seeds are largely produced locally, many solutions
are being found without major external assistance or importation.‖

3.4          There were however, three serious design weaknesses that are discussed below.

LOGISTICAL CHALLENGE

3.5      The logistical and capacity constraints of importing both large quantities of fertilizers
and food aid, through the Djibouti port were overlooked during preparation and appraisal.
Consequently, congestion at the Djibouti port led to delays and higher costs of the World
Food Program‘s (WFP‘s) response to the humanitarian crisis, arising from the poor rains in
the same year (paragraph 1.10 and Box 3). The fact that coordination with WFP on this
critical aspect was overlooked despite the importance given to it in the Program document for
the GFRP (World Bank 2008) clearly indicates the enormous pressure on the Bank to act
urgently in the emergency situation.26 The logistical challenge delayed both fertilizers and
food-aid (see also section on Unintended Outcomes in Chapter 6).27


26
   ―The proposed Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) facilitates a rapid and flexible Bank response, while
supporting the evolving coordination role of the United Nations Task Force on the Global Food Crisis established in late
April 2008 in Berne and the World Food Programme (WFP)‘s work on the emergency delivery of food and relief operations
to the worst hit countries. It provides a framework for the Bank to coordinate its response to the crisis in partnership with
other multilateral organizations and donor agencies.‖ Paragraph 4 page (i)
[At the 2008 Spring Meetings] ―The Governors also made clear that the World Bank needs to work pro-actively with other
stakeholders, including the UN system, During the same meetings, the President of the World Bank Group emphasized the
key emergency role of the World Food Programme (WFP) in distributing food aid and the need for donors to better support
financial shortfalls for the WFP arising from rising food procurement costs.‖ (Paragraph 2, page 1)
―World Food Programme (WFP) is the UN Agency whose mandate most directly addresses the food price crisis.‖
(paragraph 44, page 12). World Bank 2008.
27
  To give some sense of magnitude according to the 2008 CAS, ―The Bank‘s program for FY 2008 is based on an initial
IDA allocation of SDR 391 million, equivalent to $635 million at current exchange rates.‖ CAS 2008. Though the FSP
                                                              14


Box 3. Djibouti Port: Conflict between Fertilizer Imports and Food Aid in 2009
Ethiopia is a land-locked country and 90 percent of its rapidly growing import requirements are met through
the port at Djibouti. The port has modern discharge and loading facilities, but limited berth capacity, a
shortage of trucks, and customs procedure delays can tax its capacity during busy times. Though Port Sudan
and Port Berbera in Somaliland could also serve Ethiopia, they are used to a very limited extent. Port Sudan
is only used for export of sesame and other oilseeds and Port Berbera, the smallest of the three, is a major
livestock export point for the whole region. Ethiopia has been importing fertilizers for quite some time now
through Djibouti and usually there is no conflict between fertilizer import and food aid that also comes in
through that port. This is so because both commodities come in at different times in the year. For example, in
2008 fertilizer imports came in between January and May and about 80 percent of the food aid came in
between June and December.
2009 was a difficult year with the high food and fuel prices and poor rains. Fertilizer imports were high
because of the World Bank supported project and food aid requirements were also high. The number of
people in need of emergency food assistance grew from 4.9 million in January to 5.3 million in May, then to
6.2 million in July. In 2009 food aid requirements increased to 740,000 tons from 413,000 tons in 2008.
Unlike other years, because of the huge quantity imported, fertilizer imports continued well into August in
2009. As a result, not only was there competition between food aid and fertilizer imports for the facilities at
the Djibouti port but also for inland storage facilities and trucks. However, fertilizer got preference in terms
of ship discharge, handling, and haulage capacity over food imports.
In early September, WFP reported an ongoing break in the food relief pipeline. The break, initially reported
in June, resulted from significant funding shortages and delays unloading and transporting food commodities
from the Djibouti Port. Finally WFP had to initiate discussions with the government counterparts about
opening corridors into Ethiopia using the ports of Berbera and Sudan for food aid. The Berbera corridor,
which goes through Somaliland and the Somali Region of Ethiopia, was opened in April 2009. Port Sudan
corridor was opened in May 2009 to serve the northwest of the country.
The Government has now set up the Maritime Affairs Authority to ensure better coordination but the events
in 2009 could have been avoided had efforts been made upfront to coordinate activities for food and fertilizer
import during a time when both were seen as necessities.

 PROJECT SIZE

 3.6     A second design weakness was related to project size. FSP was a large28 intervention
 financed both by new and re-deployed resources at a time when foreign exchange reserves
 were critically low in the country. It was not a budget-support operation and its PDO was not
 linked to providing a specific quantity of foreign exchange. Instead, it was meant to ensure
 an ―adequate‖ supply of fertilizers ―to meet smallholder priority needs.‖ The project was
 originally conceived to help import about 400,000 MT of fertilizer. Given that other donors
 (AfDB, Japan) also provided support and there were over 82,000 MT fertilizers left from the
 previous year, this amount already appeared an over estimate relative to the consumption of

 project amount of US$250 million was not all new IDA, and came partly from portfolio restructuring nevertheless in terms
 of total IDA allocations to Ethiopia the Fertilizer project was very large.
 28
   To give some sense of magnitude according to the 2008 CAS, ―The Bank‘s program for FY 2008 is based on an initial
 IDA allocation of SDR 391 million, equivalent to $635 million at current exchange rates.‖ CAS 2008. Though the FSP
 project amount of US$250 million was not all new IDA, and came partly from portfolio restructuring nevertheless in terms
 of total IDA allocations to Ethiopia the Fertilizer project was very large.
                                                       15


previous years. In fact, internal documents confirm that the fertilizer need for the 2009 belg
season was largely met from available stocks from the previous year. FSP‘s design and size
was conceived in mid-2008 when world fertilizer prices were at an all time high (Figure 3).
Prices however, started dropping dramatically before the project was approved and became
effective in December 2008, and in the event the Ethiopia Government procured about
510,000 MTs and had foreign resources left over to procure fertilizers in 2010. The total
available amount of fertilizer in 2009—727,000 MTs from all sources (World Bank, AfDB,
Japan and previous year left-over stocks)—turned out to be more than 70 percent in excess of
the actual demand (the amount of fertilizer distributed) of 427,000 MTs. While high price
volatility and uncertainties may have made it difficult to determine up front the exact amount
of resources needed to cover the aspired import quantity, the project could have been
designed around an agreed upon realistic quantity of needed imports, leaving flexibility to
reallocate potential funding balances to more pressing needs.

THE SOLE IMPORTER ARRANGEMENT

3.7     The third design weakness was related to the arrangement under the FSP that allowed
the public sector enterprise, AISE, to emerge as the sole importer. This arrangement may
have contributed to more timely allocation of foreign exchange and procurement of fertilizers
but, as noted by various stakeholders with whom IEG met and also confirmed by the findings
of the DSA report (see paragraph 3.8 below), has set back the whole reform effort being
supported by the Bank and other donors over more than a decade. Over the last decade, the
Bank has been attempting to promote fertilizer marketing reform, including greater private
sector participation, in Ethiopia but with limited success (Box 4). Furtado and Smith (2007)
sum up well the divergent view of the donors and the Government in this area:

       "Donors have been pushing for steps in liberalization for many years - essentially arguing that the
       government should not be in the fertilizer business. The view of the government is that the private
       sector distribution network is not adequate to ensure supply, and will take time to evolve; that the
       foreign exchange implications of fertilizer imports are too important for the government not to be
       involved. There is also a long-established central planning mind-set, that sees use of fertilizer in terms
       of publicly-set targets; but this is grounded in a deeper sense that something as critical to the country's
       food supply and economic performance is too important for the government not to be involved in."

3.8      Despite this divergence in views, just prior to FSP in 2008, several cooperative
unions had begun playing a major role in fertilizer imports alongside AISE (see paragraph
1.8 and Annex B Table B1). The project document for FSP acknowledges that policies
shaping the fertilizer market were changing and reforms over the last few years had
contributed to, among other changes, reducing the direct role of the state and increasing that
of the cooperatives. However, the arrangements for the implementation of the FSP led to
reduction in the role of cooperatives eliminating them from the business of importing
fertilizers. The DSA (2010) report notes:

       ―There have been two developments in 2009 that are of fundamental importance to fertilizer sector as
       it related to small farmers. The first is government made a decision to centralize international
       procurement of fertilizers. It meant that a single agency would be responsible for fertilizer importation
       [to meet] the country needs and shipments from Djibouti to central warehouses at strategic locations.
       The other is the impact of the first on development of cooperatives which have been playing a
       dominant role in the distribution and marketing of fertilizes at all stages of [the] fertilizer marketing
                                                        16


         chain. Single-importer decision and the subsequent delegation of Agricultural Inputs Supply Enterprise
         (AISE) to be responsible for importation of fertilizer need for 2009/10 agricultural season eliminated
         fertilizer importing business for about ten cooperative unions that in prior years were engaged in
         international fertilizers procurement. It also made the unions and their members (primary cooperatives)
         a defacto single actor in the channeling [of] fertilizers from AISE to the end users.‖ Page 22-23.

3.9    Though the FSP design excluded any policy reform these developments were an
unintended outcome of the project implementation arrangement as discussed in Chapter 6.
They were a setback to the whole reform process and the risk of this happening should have
been carefully assessed and a clear road map to bring the reform effort back on track once the
emergency was over should have been identified when the Bank agreed to the single importer
implementation arrangement.

Box 4. The World Bank and Fertilizer Marketing Reform in Ethiopia
Four development policy operations undertaken between 2001 and 2004 (the Economic Rehabilitation
Support Credit (Credit 3512), Economic Structural Adjustment Credit 3666), First Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSCI) (Loan/Credit Ho730), Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSCII)
(Loan JPN 51119, IDA H1350, JPN 5380) attempted to deal with fertilizer market reform, among other
issues. A sector investment loan focused squarely on fertilizer marketing reform. The objective of the
National Fertilizer Sector Project (NFSP) (FY95) was to achieve accelerated and sustainable growth in
agricultural production with a view to improving food security and reducing poverty. Central to the
project‘s goal was its fertilizer policy reform component which comprised a group of policy actions
intended to liberalize the fertilizer market, enabling fair competition for fertilizer importing, wholesaling
and retailing between public and private actors.
Until mid-1992 fertilizer import and marketing was fully state controlled and managed by the
Agricultural Inputs Supply Corporation (previously named AISCO now AISE), a monopolistic
parastatal, in consultation with Ministry of Agriculture. The Central Government introduced a Fertilizer
Policy in 1993. Among other issues the policy encouraged full participation of the private sector in
importation, distribution, wholesale and retail trade of fertilizers and set up AISCO to operate in a free
market in competition with the private sector and cooperatives. The strategy stated that the private sector
should supplement existing market arrangements and ensure a level playing field for cooperatives and
private traders while liberalizing access to credit. However, in 1995 when the NFSP became effective
the government company was importing about 80 percent of the fertilizers. In response to the
monopolistic government domination of fertilizer imports prevailing at the beginning of the NFSP, the
Bank sought policy adjustments that would enable more open competition.
NFSP ultimately achieved little success in this area. The fertilizer sub-sector became less rather than
more competitive under the project. The reasons for the poor outcome were the presence of constraints
to the development of a competitive market that contributed to a non-level playing field in the fertilizer
import market. Although these constraints were a major barrier to market entry during the project period,
there were promising initiatives in the post-NFSP period. A workshop to discuss how to bring in the
private sector was organized by the Government in October 2006 comprising representatives of all
sector stakeholders, including AISE, the cooperatives, the private sector, and the trading houses. A
number of ideas to improve the environment for full competition resulted.

4. Achievement of Objectives
4.1    This chapter first assesses the achievements on the specific PDO followed by the
program goal.

To contribute to the Government’s efforts to ensure an aggregate
availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production
seasons adequate to meet smallholder farmers’ priority demands. (Specific
PDO)
4.2      Two issues are relevant in assessing the efficacy of the specific PDO: the amount of
fertilizer that was imported because of the project support in relation to what was needed by
smallholder farmers; and whether this fertilizer was distributed and available to smallholder
farmers‘ in time for the production seasons in the year.

4.3      Total amount of fertilizer imported because of the project and needs of
smallholder farmers: The project succeeded in helping the government import 510,370
MTs of fertilizers, (about 420,000 MTs of DAP and 90,000 MTs of urea), the highest ever
imported by the country in any year. Including imports financed by other sources (AfDB and
Government of Japan) and fertilizer stocks carried over from 2008, a total of 727,637 MTs of
fertilizer was available in the country against actual fertilizer sales (which would reflect
smallholder farmers‘ priority demands) of about 427,000 MTs. Hence an oversupply of about
70 percent. Ultimately, there was more than enough fertilizer available in the country in
2009/10. However, the question is whether it was available in time for the production seasons
and how much of the fertilizer that was distributed to farmers in 2009/10 be attributed to
Bank support. These issues are discussed next.

4.4      Timely distribution and availability of fertilizers: Ethiopia has been importing
fertilizers for quite some time now and the timely delivery and availability of fertilizer to
farmers has been a challenge every year (DSA 2010, Spielman and others 2010). The
capacity of the cooperatives through which most of the fertilizer is distributed, remains
limited (Bernard 2008).29
4.5    In 2009 also, partly because of the sheer logistical challenge at Djibouti, the fertilizer
imported through the Bank project came in too late to cover most of the need for the belg
season which was mostly covered from available stocks.30 Hence, while fertilizers were

29
  ―Despite their rapid spread, only a third of the country‘s rural kebeles had such an organization in 2005—usually kebeles
with above-average access to markets and lower exposure to price and environmental risks. Further, where such an
organization exists, farmers remain reluctant to participate, as only 17 percent are actual members. Overall, only 9 percent of
farm households are cooperative members, (similar figures were uncovered in a 2008 national survey) with poorer
farmers—in terms of landholding and education—less likely to participate (the average cooperative member holds 1.75 ha,
as compared to 0.8 ha for the average Ethiopian farmer).‖ Bernard 2008.
30
  ―Based on shipment records at Djibouti and subsequent clearing for inland transport, only 283,000 MT of DAP out of the
procured 420,000 MT for the crop year was due at ultimate distribution centers across the country before June 1st 2009.‖
DSA 2010.
                                                               18


available to meet farmer demands during the belg season, attribution to the Bank‘s project is
not possible. One of the main justifications for the rapid preparation of the project was to
ensure that the imports supported through the project were available also for the belg season.
The Program document observed:
          ―To show an impact the project has to become effective in early December, to allow minimum time for
          the logistics and distribution of fertilizers to farmers for the 2009 belg and meher season.‖ Page 7 31
4.6     As Box 2 shows, for the meher season as a whole fertilizers should be available to
farmers around May before the rain starts and road access becomes difficult. The delayed
rain in 2009 (see Annex B Box B3) provided for some flexibility in delivery as farmers
usually wait to buy fertilizers until the rains come in.32 The DSA evaluation reports (page
26) that ―DAP delivery to unions was extended up to July 2009 according to interviewed
unions in Amhara and Oromiya regions with obvious extension to primary cooperatives
(PC). There were PCs that reported DAP delivery until July 2009.‖ That said, the report
acknowledges that ―unions admitted that DAP delivery in the FSP year was less efficient
compared to 2008/09, and AISE is in agreement.‖

4.7     Overall, though the project helped procure more than 510,000 MT of fertilizers there
were significant shortcomings in it being available in time to meet the priority needs of
farmers for both the seasons. This was true particularly for DAP which formed more than 80
percent (see paragraph 4.3) of the fertilizer imported through the Bank project. The DSA
report notes:

           ―Household survey results show that 845 or 24 % of the interviewed farmers reported late delivery
          with some regional variation. Of these farmers 76 % reported the delayed delivery caused late planting
          the cost of which, according to some research results, could be as high as 0.7MT.ha very costly to
          small farmers. The second indicator is the duration of the delay. About 33% of the surveyed woredas
          said they had experienced delays longer than five days (FSP target), and also reported that DAP
          delivery in 2008-09 was relatively timelier. Urea delivery was relatively more efficient and it was as
          good as in the previous year. ………According to views obtained from AISE, regional bureaus of
          agriculture and rural development offices, and the union themselves efficiency and effectiveness of
          fertilizer distribution with unions was no better in 2009/10 than previous years. In fact, on two counts
          it could have been better. The first is distribution of DAP procured in early 2009 (February/March)
          was not adequately sensitive to farmers‘ cropping pattern and woreda level accessibility when
          impeding Meher rains set in. Union connections and relationships with authorities of woredas and
          primary cooperatives dictated distribution rather than realties at the receiving ends. The second was
          unions had higher marketing cost compared to AISE where both were involved in fertilizer distribution
          to PCs in Tigray.‖ Page 26-27.

4.8       On balance efficacy of the PDO is rated modest.




31
  The ICR also notes that ―The project was prepared rapidly because its pace was dictated by the Ethiopian agricultural
cycle: the project had to become effective in December 2008 to allow fertilizer to be purchased, distributed, and make an
impact on production in 2009–10.‖ Page 1
32
  Had it not been for erratic rainfall that held planting date on suspense, it could have been a chaotic supply situation in the
second part of May and June, according to views of woreda officials and leaders of primary cooperatives in Amhara and
Oromia.‖ DSA 2010.

To increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009-10 remains on or
near the growth trends of recent years (the program goal)
4.9     The program goal was equally short-term as the PDO. Serious doubts have been
raised about the quality of agricultural data in the country including by IEG‘s 2008 Country
Assistance Evaluation (IEG 2008a).33 FAO/WFP analysis (FAO/WFP 2006 and 2007) also
shows the vast discrepancy in data reported by MoARD and the CSA, both government
sources.34

4.10 Estimates from the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment mission suggest
that there was a 4.9 percent decrease in aggregate grain production from 17.6 million MTs to
16.8 million MTs between 2008/09 and 2009/10 (FAO/WFP 2010). Comparing 2009/10 with
the previous five-year average (calculated from various FAO/WFP reports at 17.7 million
tons) also shows that the production in 2009/10 declined by about 5 percent.35 FAO/WFP
data does not really show a clear trend in production over the last few years.

4.11 Official data from CSA, however, suggests an increase in grain production of 5.2
percent during project implementation (from 17.2 million MTs to 18.4 million MTs).
Comparing 2009/10 with the previous five year average (14.7 million MTs) the CSA data
shows a 22 percent increase. CSA data also shows about an 11 percent annual increase in
crop production (Figure 6) between 2003/08 and 2007/08. This was the trend level referred
to in paragraph 1.4.

4.12 With such large differences in data between CSA and FAO/WFP it is difficult to
make a conclusive judgment on whether production actually increased and whether the
growth trend as per the program goal was achieved.

  ―Changes over time in agricultural productivity, a key driver of pro-poor transformation of the sector, remain unclear
because of inconsistent data sources.‖ IEG 2008a.
―One of the challenges in the assessment of the recent growth and performance of the Ethiopian agriculture is the lack of
adequate and independent database that helps to assess the performance.‖ Adenew 2009.
―An immediate concern is nevertheless for further inspection of the current database and the recent yield trends. Given that a
crop-cutting method has been used, CSA data should in principle be superior. But in practice, they leave many questions
unanswered. Even if we dismiss the alternative sources and the international evidence, the official yield data are not easily
squared with the data on input use. A systematic review of how the CSA data are collected and collated as well as studies
that aim to explain the yield increases are urgently needed.‖ Dercon and Hill 2009.
―Data on national cereal production levels and trends are controversial. Changes in government and methodologies have
coincided with distinct breaks in the data, making it difficult to distinguish between actual changes and statistical artefacts.‖

 The FAO analysis of FAO/WFP (2007 and 2006) shows that the data of land under cereals and pulses reported by the
Ministry of Agriculture was 19.5% higher in 2006/7 and 45% higher in 2005/6 than the data reported by the CSA.
35
  According to the FAO/WFP report 2010 total grain production in 2007/08, 2008/09 and 2009/10 was 16.7, 17.6 and 16.8
million MTs respectively. To calculate the five-year average for previous years grain production figures for the years
2006/07, 2005/06 and 2004/05 were obtained from the FAO/WFP report 2007. These numbers were 20.4, 18.59 and 15.34
million MTs respectively. The five year average for the period 2004/05 to 2008/09 was 17.7 million MTs.

                                                 production. The paper noted that studies have
                                                 shown that fertilizer use has a significantly
                                                 positive impact on agricultural production at the
                                                 aggregate level. It quotes an unpublished World
                                                 Bank 2006 Ethiopia Rural Development
Source: World Bank 2008c and IEG calculations    Review to show that in Ethiopia the intensity of
                                                 chemical fertilizer use is statistically highly
significant with an aggregate production elasticity of about 0.12. With this as the
background, it presents calculations to argue that with a conservative estimate of crop supply
response, removal of US$250 million worth of fertilizers would result in a reduction of about
one million tons of cereal. The paper however, also presents risks associated with fertilizer
use and draws on another Bank publication (Christiaensen and Demery 2007) to show that in
years of poor rainfall the use of fertilizer can become uneconomic.

5.2      Table 1 below, presents returns to fertilizer in ―normal‖ and ―bad‖ rainfall years
drawing on the Christiaensen and Demery paper referred to above. As the table demonstrates,
the loss to farmers can be substantial in years of poor rainfall. Since most agricultural
production in Ethiopia is carried out under rain-fed conditions farmers avoid or reduce
fertilizer application in drought years or years with variable rainfall; often by 40 percent
(World Bank 2007).




36
  ―A value-cost ratio (VCR) equals the value of additional yield obtained from fertilizer use/cost of fertilizer used. The
point at which the value/cost ratio is equal to one is, in principle, the same as the profit maximizing point when the value of
the marginal product divided by the marginal factor cost is equal to one. There are, however, two important differences: (a)
the value/cost ratio is a measure of average rather than marginal change in profitability because it does not examine
incremental changes in returns as doses increase; and (b) the costs included in a value/cost ratio are generally limited to the
expenditure on fertilizer rather than the full range of costs (including labor) associated with fertilizer use. To account for
these differences in calculation and the fact that farmers do not have perfect knowledge of crop prices and yield response,
analysts have established ―rules-of thumb‖ for interpreting these ratios. Most consider a ratio equal to two as the minimum
requirement for a farmer to adopt fertilizer and a ratio of three or four to be necessary when production or price risk is high.
(World Bank 2006).

5.3     The completion report undertakes an indicative benefit-cost analysis to assess project
efficiency. Based on farm-level productivity analysis the report notes VCRs for three crops
(teff, wheat and maize) that account for 90 percent of fertilizer use in Ethiopia. It calculates
an average benefit-cost ratio of 3.78 and notes that the project most likely generated net
economic benefits of US$667 million. The VCRs used are those obtained from the DSA
2010 report as well as from survey data obtained from Sasakawa Global-2000 (SG-2000) and
range from 1.4 for teff to 3.3 for wheat with an aggregate VCR of 2.4 that according to the
completion report generates the project benefit-cost ratio of 3.78.

5.4   This project assessment has two major concerns with the analysis presented in the
completion report on the basis of which the estimated benefit-cost ratio is unlikely to hold.

         First, the VCR calculations are based on some simple assumptions about reasonable
          rainfall and grain price patterns which did not hold. Though the ICR notes
          otherwise37, the rainfall, as demonstrated in Annex B Box B3, was poor in 2009. The
          aide memoire for the third supervision mission (November-December 2009) raised
          concerns about the deterioration in the fertilizer-cereal price ratios that influence
          profitability of fertilizer use. The DSA evaluation (DSA 2010) also found that grain
          prices in 2009/10 stopped rising or even dropped compared to the previous year,
          particularly for teff causing widespread ―grievance‖ among farmers in all region. 38
          There were other problems also, such as inadequate availability of improved seeds

37
  ICR notes (page 13) ―Therefore under reasonable rainfall and grain price patterns, such as those prevailing during the
project‘s implementation, fertilizer use in Ethiopia is profitable and can be economically efficient.‖
38
  ―The effect of price drop was felt hard by farmers because teff is a high value crop and the proceeds are set aside as
guarantee for acquisition of fertilizer needs for the subsequent crop year.‖ DSA 2010.
                                                             22


            that would not allow for the production increase due to the availability of fertilizers as
            noted in the calculation of the benefit stream.
           Second, the cost stream in the completion report (page 31) does not take into account
            transport costs. Data gathered by IEG in the field and reports on how fertilizer prices
            at the primary cooperative level are actually calculated as a part of aide memoires of
            supervision reports confirm the high level of these costs. Transport costs from
            Djibouti to central warehouses can be as high a nearly 10 percent of the total cost of
            fertilizers (Annex B Table B2 and B3 for example from Aide Memoire of the Second
            and Third Supervision mission on how retail prices are determined and the
            importance of transport costs). Further, the transport cost from the Nazareth central
            warehouse to the different warehouse of the primary cooperatives is additional and
            varies according to the distance and road type and quality. The Aide Memoire notes
            this cost to be an average of 77.15 ETB/Quintal39, about 10 percent estimated for
            getting the fertilizers from Djibouti to the central warehouse. The literature (e.g.
            Rashid 2009) confirms the substantial costs of transporting fertilizers first to
            warehouses and then from warehouses to the cooperatives.

5.5       The completion report notes that even under conservative estimates the average
benefit cost ratio would be 1.64 and the project would still generate net benefits of US$154.8
million. However, there is a problem with this argument as this would imply that the VCR
would drop to below 2 (as is clear from Annex 3 Table 3 of the ICR) and we already know
from footnote 36 that at this level it will not be profitable for farmers to apply fertilizers. In
fact, it is noted that “Most consider a [VCR] ratio equal to two as the minimum requirement
for a farmer to adopt fertilizer and a ratio of three or four to be necessary when production
or price risk is high.” (World Bank 2006).

5.6     Moving beyond the farm level productivity analysis, a broader question for
determining project efficiency is that in a poor country such as Ethiopia, the more than 70
percent oversupply of fertilizer (paragraph 3.6) draws attention to the opportunity cost of
scarce resources that the country could have utilized to meet the numerous other
requirements for the development of the agriculture sector. For example, of the 12 projects
from which resources were deployed to finance FSP, some, such as the Irrigation and
Drainage (Cr. 4333) were supporting a critical agriculture need in the country and had just
become effective (January 2008) and there is little evidence to show that it was a poorly
performing project from which resources needed to be diverted.40 41




39
     1 Quintal is equal to a 100 Kilograms.
40
  One of the justifications for redeploying resources was that many of the projects in the portfolio were old or poorly
performing and reallocation of resources from these would contribute to overall efficiency.
41
 The Africa Region of the World Bank in its response to the project assessment notes that the resources used for fertilizer
were only partially fungible, since they were available for crisis response, and not for other purposes.
IEG notes that US$137.5 million was made available for this project through restructuring 12 projects as shown in Annex B
Table B4 and could have been used for other purposes.
                                                            23


5.7      The procurement of fertilizers for 2010 (530, 000 MTs) took place early without
taking into account the left over stocks of over 300, 000 MTs from the previous year.42 Were
this available surplus taken into account in deciding the import requirements for 2010, at
least in the next year valuable foreign exchange could have been saved to fulfill other
competing demands rather than again being tied up in fertilizers. On the basis of the above
overall project efficiency is rated modest.

6. Outcome
6.1     The moderately unsatisfactory outcome rating is derived from the ratings on
relevance, efficacy and efficiency as shown in Table 2 below. While the Bank was
responsive to the emergency situation in the country and designed a simple project which
was implemented quite quickly, relevance of design was modest, given the weaknesses
demonstrated in the logistical arrangements, in determining the size of the project and the
sole importer arrangement that set back the whole reform effort being supported by the Bank
and other donors over more than a decade. Efficacy of the PDO is rated modest as there were
significant shortcomings in the fertilizer being available in time to meet the priority needs of
farmers. Project efficiency is also modest because, among other reasons, scarce foreign
exchange resources were locked up in fertilizer overstocks whereas these could have been
used for meeting alternate pressing needs in a crisis situation.

Unintended Outcome
6.2     There were also two unintended negative outcomes. First, before the FSP, several
farmers‘ cooperative unions were also importing fertilizers and meeting close to 40 percent
of the national supply of DAP and urea—the two kinds of fertilizers imported. These unions
were regulated by the MoARD through a guided procurement system. Aiming to improve its
efficiency in the import of fertilizers, the Government decided to procure fertilizer in bulk in
the project year rather than in batches of 25,000 tons as in previous years. Because of its size
and capacity, AISE emerged as the sole importer and other importers instead of competing
with AISE made contractual agreements with the public enterprise to import on their


42
  As already noted in paragraph 2.4 ultimately the leftover Bank resources could not be utilized because the tender was not
advertized internationally.
                                                               24


behalf.43 The Bank went along with this arrangement given the emergency. The consequence
was that this effectively eliminated about 10 cooperative unions that in prior years were
engaged in international fertilizer procurement from the fertilizer importing business. At the
time of the IEG mission in February-March 2011, AISE was still the sole importer and
stakeholder interviews revealed that this arrangement may have come to stay. As
acknowledged by the ICR itself, economies of scale from this approach may not be there in
the medium term.44

6.3     Second, the competition between fertilizer and food aid discussed in paragraph 3.5
and Box 3 led to not only delay in getting fertilizers to the farmers but also contributed to
delay and higher costs of the WFP‘s response to the humanitarian crisis arising from the poor
rains in the same year. The Humanitarian Requirements 2009 report noted

          ―The food security situation has been further impacted by the reduction in food aid distributions
          carried out, with only five of six planned rounds completed by the end of September 2009 with
          reduced ration size, due to shortage of resources. In addition to substantial funding shortfalls, the
          period under review was characterized by serious logistics-related challenges, especially delays in
          berthing and off-loading relief ships at Djibouti port and shortage of trucks for overland transportation
          of humanitarian food into and throughout the country‖ page 4.


7. Risk to Development Outcome
7.1     The project provided one time support to the Government for import of fertilizers to
increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009/10 would remain on or near the growth
trends of recent years, the program goal. During project implementation the risks that poor
rains and inadequate availability of improved seeds, among other factors, would constrain
crop production were substantially high and ultimately, these risks did play a role in keeping
total crop production at levels lower than anticipated. Weather-related risks, particularly,
have been and will continue to be a major factor in determining agricultural production and
yields in Ethiopia as long as most cultivation is carried out under rain-fed conditions.45,46

7.2    With a simple objective, and in the emergency context, the project was designed to
be, and was, implemented in a short time. The fertilizer was procured, though its demand and


43
  The project document (footnote page 46 page 30) notes ―AISE has the biggest capacity measured in terms of market
share, warehouses, etc. The risk of losing by competing with AISE, especially given that AISE can procure larger batches, is
high.‖
44
  ―…..economies of scale effects in the procurement and importation of fertilizer are small beyond certain amounts (50,000
tons) and therefore do not preclude multiple importers in the medium term.‖ (ICR page 19).
45
  ―While Ethiopia has abundant annual rainfall, the rainfall varies spatially (different parts of the country), temporally
(different times of year) and inter-annually (yearly cycles). 80 percent of rainfall occurs between June and September, while
yearly variability can also be significant (e.g., about 30 percent average variation year over year). Consequently, increasing
rainwater storage capacity and improving water control and rainwater management techniques, especially rain water
harvesting (RWH), are critical to ensure that Ethiopia gets maximum use of its rainfall.‖ IWMI 2010.
46
   For the existing cultivated area of about 15 million hectares, only about 4 to 5 percent is irrigated, with existing equipped
irrigation schemes covering about 640,000 hectares (IWMI 2010). While some progress has been made in the last few years
it has been modest. Hence, the quality and the quantity of the variable rains is still the major factor that determines the level
of the annual harvest (Ethiopian Economics Association 2007/08).
                                                              25


use by farmers was much less than estimated for the 2009/10 production season.47 The left-
over fertilizer stock was available for use in the next production year. The DSA evaluation
reported some problems with quality—caking, poor bagging—but not for the majority of the
farmers who received the fertilizers.

7.3      Beyond the above noted problems, there are some concerns about the future of
fertilizer distribution and marketing in Ethiopia arising from how the project was
implemented. During project implementation, AISE emerged as the sole importer. Many of
the cooperative unions that had been importing fertilizers are no longer doing so and are now
engaged only in its distribution. To some extent, the unions now work as agents of MoARD
and AISE in the distribution of fertilizers. The DSA evaluation notes the concern expressed
by unions that the single importer approach could affect the capacity building of cooperatives
because of loss of revenue and marketing experience (DSA 2010). The IEG mission also met
with some cooperative unions staff and heard similar concerns. The profit margin for the
unions in fertilizer distribution is set when MoARD sets the price of fertilizers to be charged
at the primary cooperative level as demonstrated in Annex B Table B3. There is some risk
that in the long-run the capacity of the unions may weaken and this could compromise the
effectiveness of the fertilizer distribution system. The program goal was ultimately to keep
production at or near the trend level in 2009/10 and these changes that have occurred in the
fertilizer sector have increased the risk that such an outcome may not be maintained in the
future. Further, going forward, with the single importer model, the lack of a competition may
generate long term inefficiencies in fertilizer importation.48

7.4       Overall the risk to development outcome is assessed as moderate.

8. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
Design
8.1     As designed, both M&E were given considerable emphasis. Not only was monitoring
to track actual fertilizer import and distribution under the project, but it was also intended to
more broadly provide information on the fertilizer distribution system in the country so that
weaknesses in it could be identified. The project was to help strengthen MoARD‘s existing
system of tracking fertilizer distribution from imports to cooperatives and their unions. Given
the importance of knowing actual demand at the farm level the Ministry also agreed to
monitor on a regular basis the amount of fertilizer sold to farmers as well as the credit and
credit guarantees provided. MoARD was to collect data about the status of sales and
distribution from a sample of high and low potential woredas through a questionnaire.


47
  The DSA report (DSA 2010) found that the aggregate amount of fertilizer used by small farmers in 2009/10 decreased by
2.1 percent compared to the previous year. That evaluation also confirms that low sales of fertilizers in the FSP year were
mainly due to erratic and uneven rains and lack of improved seeds.
48
   ―The resulting dominance of the fertilizer market by state actors raises problems, not because the actors are parastatals
rather than private actors; but because in such monopolistic and oligopolistic structures, it is crucial that there are
competitive pressures on the firms operating. Competitive pressures ensure that the market chains remain sustainable
overtime and keep on offering good prices to farmers‖ Dercon and Hill 2009
                                                26


8.2      The project then was to be monitored through various sources: weekly updates of the
fertilizer importation status, the monthly reports on sales to farmers, and the information
provided through the sample woredas. An M&E consultant was to be hired to provide
support during peak reporting period.

8.3     The performance indicators identified were as follows: (a) the quantity of fertilizer
imported and distributed to farmers; (b) the timeliness of import and distribution of fertilizer
and complementary inputs to end users; (c) fertilizer application as share of total cultivated
areas; and (d) estimates of the costs and contribution of the fertilizer to production and
economic welfare. These were appropriate indicators and the emphasis on tracking timeliness
of availability of complementary inputs was particularly relevant given the issues discussed
in paragraph 3.3. However, despite the fact that a project indicator was to monitor
complementary inputs it was not monitored or reported on.

8.4     To assess project impact, at the end of the 2009 crop season, an independent
consultant with a strong record in impact evaluation and knowledge of Ethiopia was to be
hired to undertake a rural household survey. This survey would sample a cross section of
woredas in high and lower potential regions of the country and collect data on farm level
access to fertilizer in terms of source, timeliness and quality, use of fertilizer by crop, the
major beneficiaries of fertilizer use by farm size and agricultural potential, and use of
complementary inputs, particularly improved seed.

Implementation
8.5     The selection and contracting of the monitoring expert to provide support to MoARD
was delayed. Since there were capacity limitations within the Ministry this delayed the actual
tracking of fertilizer importation and distribution. By April 2009, the time of the first
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR), the first data for tracking fertilizer
distribution was still not available. Bank supervision missions flagged their concerns with
M&E and progress on the component was rated unsatisfactory for some time.

8.6      There was also delay in the finalization of the selection process for the consultancy
for the impact evaluation. The evaluation was ultimately carried out and involved a
household survey of some 3500 fertilizer using rural households from the four predominantly
fertilizer consuming regions Tigray, Amhara, Oromia and SNNP. Both quantitative and
qualitative methods were used to collect primary data on a number of variables for 2009/10
and the evaluation also draws on secondary data from MoARD and other relevant sources.
However, there were problems with data comparability over time. There is no way to tell
whether there were differences in the methodology used amongst the various sources of data.
For some critical variables, such as change in fertilizer consumption overtime, the evaluation
reports data for the years 2005/06 to 2009/10 from secondary sources only. Fertilizer
consumption was assumed to be equal to fertilizer sales. Similarly, changes in grain
production are reported primarily on the basis of CSA data. On other important variables
such as fertilizer application rate, the evaluation does report data obtained from the
household survey but the comparison of 2009/10 is made with a base-line of 2005/06
(constructed on the basis of farmers‘ recall ability) which is really too far back to assess the
impact of a project approved in December 2008.
                                                27


Utilization
8.7     Data from sample woredas that were selected to provide monitoring information,
when it did become available, were of uneven quality but were nevertheless useful in
providing information on fertilizer price variations across the country and their possible
causes, on the time of availability of fertilizers across the main regions, quality of fertilizer
distributed, among others. The monitoring was also useful in identifying the seriousness of
the congestion problem in Djibouti and its possible negative impact in getting the fertilizers
to farmers in time. The performance indicators were to also report on timeliness of
availability of complementary inputs to end-users. However, the ISRs and the ICR only
report on fertilizers timeliness and availability.

8.8     Even though there are weaknesses in methodology the DSA evaluation has provided
useful information on various aspects of the project and its findings have been used
throughout this assessment.

8.9    Overall M&E is rated substantial.

9. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

9.1     Given the urgency of the situation in the country, the Bank responded with alacrity to
the Borrower‘s request for support, taking advantage of the flexibility in its procedures under
Operational Policy/Best practice (OP/BP) 8.00 and the newly approved GFRP facility. The
project went from concept review to approval in under three months and given the number of
steps that are involved in getting approval, Bank staff must have worked under enormous
time pressure. The timely availability of foreign exchange allowed the public enterprise,
AISE, to issue tenders and arrange for the procurement of fertilizers in a judicious manner. It
is also creditable that even in an emergency project considerable emphasis was given to
M&E.

9.2      However, there were several shortcomings in quality at entry. Inadequate due-
diligence in determining the size of the project was one. The demand estimation procedures
for fertilizers in Ethiopia have been far from accurate and are discussed in Box 5. Since this
was an emergency operation it would have been unrealistic to expect the Bank to carry out
analytic work in this area before the project was designed. However, some due-diligence in
determining the actual quantity of fertilizer required, and consequently the project size, was
needed. A review of the demand estimation process from past years and whether it
contributed to left-over stocks (as shown in Box 5) could have given some indication of the
exaggeration in the demand estimates and possibly helped avoid the competition with food-
aid and inefficient use of scarce resources. In fact, the GFRP program document clearly
noted the Bank‘s ability to undertake pertinent analysis as its comparative advantage when it
notes:
                                                                 28


          ―The Bank‘s engagement as proposed under the GFRP is based on a role distinct from its partner
          agencies. The Bank‘s multi-sectoral expertise gives it a strong comparative advantage in providing
          integrated solutions to address food security concerns and effectively mitigate the adverse effects of
          rising food prices. In particular, the Bank is able to: (i) rapidly provide significant funds to countries at
          risk, (ii) undertake policy analysis drawing upon country, regional and global experience, (iii) provide
          access to a mix of innovative financial instruments to mitigate a portion of the increased food price
          risk, partially alleviating the need for costly physical remedies such as strategic grain reserves, (iv)
          design and deliver well-targeted social protection interventions to mitigate the effect of the price rise
          on the poor and vulnerable; and (v) support policy and programmatic responses over the medium and
          longer term including measures critical to improving the domestic agricultural supply response.‖ (page
          i)


Box 5. The Estimation of Demand for Fertilizer Imports
Only two kinds of fertilizers, DAP and urea, are available in Ethiopia. Since the market does not play a
role in assessing demand and responding to it the amount of fertilizer imported depends on an
estimation of demand by the Government for the coming season. Such demand estimation is carried out
over a period of about six months every year. The process begins at the kebele (sub-district) level by
development agents with the participation of farmers, and the outcomes are reported to higher woreda
(district) and zonal offices. In making their calculations the development agents use standard or
recommended application rates. The woreda level officials in turn deliberate on the results estimated
and make adjustments before delivering their estimates to the regional bureaus of agriculture. The
regional bureaus of agriculture in consultation with the Bureau of Finance and Economic Development
relay the regional estimates to MoARD for final review and aggregation.
Farmer‘s actual demand for fertilizers in a particular year can vary significantly from the estimated
demand depending on a number of factors—the amount of rainfall, the prices of fertilizers, the
availability of complementary inputs, among others. Farmers also seldom apply the recommended
dosage and often combine chemical fertilizers with organic ones to reduce costs. The whole process of
demand estimation leads to a certain level of exaggeration since there is a tendency to include a
contingency amount at each level.
The Bank team while aware that there were shortcomings in the Ministry‘s demand estimation process
went along with the Ministry‘s most conservative estimate. In hindsight, some rough projections on the
estimated and actual demand and carryover stocks, including consideration of the amount being
provided by AfDB and the Japanese government, could have perhaps yielded a much more realistic
estimate of actual demand and could have contributed to more efficient decision making and allocation
of scarce foreign exchange resources. Below are data obtained on fertilizer import, availability and
sales by the IEG mission from the Agricultural Input Marketing Directorate of MoARD. It is easy to
see that substantial stocks were left over each year. A systematic consideration of the costs of storage,
loss in quality due to caking, versus benefits could contribute to assessment of a strategic level of
fertilizer stocks needed in the country.

9.3     The Bank should have also given attention to the likely implication of AISE emerging
as the sole importer on the long term effort that was being made to reform fertilizer
marketing in the country. Lack of attention to the implications of large quantities of fertilizer
import on food aid was also a significant shortcoming. Overall quality at entry is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

9.4      The Bank asked for updates on the situation of shipment arrivals and transport to
central warehouses and followed up diligently with the government on M&E and financial
management compliance issues. The opportunity to coordinate fertilizer import with food-aid
was missed during project design. However, during supervision, the Bank should have made
an effort to coordinate with WFP while working with the Government to sort the logistical
constraints at Djibouti. Instead, the Bank pushed to ensure that there was no interruption in
fertilizer imports arrival and offloading at Djibouti and related fertilizer trucking. With
Government prioritizing fertilizers, partly because of the pressure from the Bank, WFP was
left to its own devices to find ways to ensure that food aid somehow did get into the country
and reached the areas where it was needed.

9.5     The shortcomings on safeguards were also serious. While it is true that the Bank
continued to urge the Borrower to accelerate the process on safeguards through its
supervision missions, several of the findings from the ESMP (footnote 21) were not unusual
and the Bank could have easily drawn on the experience of past projects that have supported
agricultural inputs distribution and marketing to understand their environmental and social
implications and ensured that basic health and safety mitigation measures were incorporated
as part of project implementation. 49 Quality of Supervision is overall rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

9.6       Overall Bank Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

9.7     For the Ethiopian Government, fertilizer import was a priority and commitment
during preparation and implementation, particularly for the fertilizer component was strong.
The Government took active steps to relieve the severe congestion and transport problems at
the Djibouti port and followed up with port authorities and road and transport authorities as
needed. However, the overall fertilizer demand was overestimated and the large quantity
imported as a consequence led to tying up of scarce foreign exchange in fertilizer over-stocks
which was inefficient.


49
  The Africa Region of the World Bank in its response notes that the private and cooperative sectors handled most of the
distribution, and the training and regulatory enforcement to assure safe handling is neither quick nor easy. It is proceeding,
however, under the rural capacity building project and other vehicles.
IEG notes however, that at least some arrangement to ensure compliance with health and safety standards established by
Ethiopian Standard for fertilizer products was in order. As footnote 21 demonstrates even these standards were not met.

9.8    On safeguards there was a violation of the Financing Agreement and the ESMP report
found several health and safety concerns. On the basis of the above, Government
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

9.9     MoARD, through its Agricultural Products Market Promotion Department, was
responsible for the overall management of the project. Despite the logistical challenges and
the shortcomings discussed, the project made overall reasonably good progress on fertilizer
import and distribution. However, performance lagged on several other aspects: M&E,
financial management and compliance with safeguards. Part of the problem was that
MoARD faced staff shortages and it gave greater priority to the fertilizer import and
distribution aspects in comparison to the other issues which were seen more as procedural,
small matters.

9.10 Supervision and reporting documents reveal that coordination was not easy among
the various government departments involved and led to delays in reporting. For example, all
procurement was made by AISE which had all the necessary financial documents but
MoARD had the responsibility for submitting the reports to the Bank and timely submission
of these reports was a concern. Implementing agency performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

9.11 On the basis of both Government and Implementing Agency performance Borrower
Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

10. Lessons
10.1   Building on the project experience this assessment identifies four major lessons:

10.2 The risk of a short-run emergency response compromising a long term World
Bank supported reform effort should be assessed at design. Steps to bring the reform
effort back on track if needed after the emergency should be identified. An emergency
situation does not allow the time to do detailed analytical work in support of lending. Yet, it
is always possible to do a quick review of past interventions, to understand the long term
goals that the Bank has been pursuing in a sector and assess if there is a possible risk to them
from the emergency response. Steps to bring the reform effort back on track if needed after
the emergency should be identified. While the arrangements under the FSP that allowed
AISE to emerge as the sole importer may have contributed to timely allocation of foreign
exchange and procurement of fertilizers, it set back the whole reform process being
supported by the Bank over the last decade with fertilizer marketing reform.

10.3 Health safety and environmental implications need particular attention in
emergency projects such as FSP since their rushed implementation schedule often does
not allow for mitigation plans to be put in place before implementation. In the FSP the
ESMP was prepared long after most of the fertilizer had been distributed. However, the Bank
could have easily drawn on the experience of past projects that have supported agricultural
inputs distribution and marketing to understand their environmental and social implications
                                               31


and ensured that basic health and safety mitigation measures were incorporated whether the
ESMP was undertaken or not.

10.4 Inadequate attention to the limits of country capacity and effective coordination
with agencies, such as WFP, that have traditionally been in the forefront in dealing with
food crisis situations can hamper both the timeliness and effectiveness of the food crisis
response. In Ethiopia import of fertilizers to contribute to agricultural production for the
coming season supported through the FSP disrupted the import of food aid to avert a
humanitarian crisis being undertaken by WFP. The conflict arose because of shortage of port
capacity and transportation logistics. Better planning and coordination between the World
Bank project and WFP and realism about the size of the project could have avoided the
conflict between the two different kinds of support provided by the two organizations.

10.5 A more sophisticated system of estimating demand, including an estimate of the
optimum level of strategic fertilizer reserves between one season and the next would be
important for ensuring efficiency of resource use in Ethiopia which is entirely
dependent on centralized imports for its fertilizers. The current demand estimation
process for fertilizers is based on a cumbersome administrative process that involves a
large number of actors at various levels of the government and little attention is paid to price
sensitivity of demand which influences the rate of fertilizer application. Over the last several
years demand has been over-estimated and has contributed to large over-stocks that fluctuate
from year to year. Development both of a sound system of demand estimation and a strategic
level of stocks based on economic analysis of all costs and benefits, including consideration
of frequent delays caused by the congestion at the Djibouti port, could avoid wastage of
scarce foreign exchange resources.

Box B 1. Challenges in the Seed System in Ethiopia
While the access and availability of seed has the potential to greatly improve smallholder productivity, there is currently
a substantial gap between the country‘s production of commercial seeds and farmers‘ demand, knowledge, access and
usage of these seeds. A series of constraints span both the hybrid maize and self pollinating seed systems.
Hybrid maize: The shortage of hybrid maize seed in Ethiopia is a national concern, and farmers are unable to access
seed in the quantities that they demand. Supply shortages are a result of constraints faced by both public sector
operations, which account for 60 percent of hybrid maize seed production, and private sector operations, which account
for the remaining 40 percent of production.
The public sector faces: inconsistent and inaccurate demand planning; productivity gaps and financial constraints in
contract grower schemes; misalignment of processing and delivery with major seed producing areas; unknown and
poorly managed capacity; non-flexibility of distribution model in terms providing farmers with choices and information.
The private sector faces: a shortage of basic seed for private seed growers; public intervention in all commercial aspects
of the seed delivery chain that prevents private companies from charging competitive prices or distributing through non-
government channels; a business and regulatory environment that does not prioritize seed businesses in terms of
resource allocation (e.g. access to foreign exchange to procure equipment,) and; insufficient support and start up funding
for young seed companies.
Self-pollinated crops: Seed for self-pollinated crops face both demand-side and supply-side constraints. On the demand
side, there is insignificant perceived advantage from seed in mass production over farmer-saved/traded options creating
insufficient incentive to purchase seeds, as well as insufficient extension devoted to increasing farmer knowledge around
varieties that deliver major improvements (e.g. yield increase, disease resistance). On the supply side, production of self-
pollinated seed faces similar productivity gaps as hybrid maize; it is currently a loss-making enterprise for the public
system, preventing ESE/RSEs from significantly expanding supply, and for the private sector companies that see little
profit potential in such seeds.

Box B3. Poor Rains in 2009
―Two major factors affected crop production in Ethiopia in 2009. The first was the virtual failure of the belg
rains that not only reduced the 2009 belg harvest, but also delayed land preparation and prevented the planting
of high-yielding long-cycle meher crops, such as maize and sorghum. These crops were often substituted by
short-cycle crops such as teff, wheat and barley, which are inherently lower yielding. This shift contributed to
reduce 2009 aggregate crop production. The second factor was inadequate performance of meher rains across
the country, with late onset, erratic distribution and early cessation. This situation affected in particular central,
south-eastern and southern Tigray, eastern Amhara (especially lowlands of North and South Wollo), Afar,
Gambella, parts of Oromia (especially Illubabor, East and West Hararghe) and parts of Somali region and
SNNPR. To a lesser extent, the poor performance of meher rains affected also some high-producing areas, such
as North Shewa, East Shewa, Arsi and midlands and highlands of Bale in Oromia; Awi, East Gojam, West
Gojam, North Gonder and South Gonder in Amhara; and Metekel and Pawe Special Woreda in Benishangul
Gumuz. In these areas, the meher rainfall only began between the last week of June and mid-July instead of its
normal start at the end of May/beginning of June. This caused delays in land preparation and there was a rush of
jobs to be done all at once, such as ploughing, planting and weed control. Poor meher rainfall in pastoral and
agro-pastoral lowlands of South Omo, Borena and lowlands of Bale and Guji reduced pasture and water
availability, resulting in early migration of livestock.

As an example, the normal onset of the meher rains in Adigrat (eastern Tigray) takes place in the first week of
June and the rains usually cease around September 20. In 2009, the meher rains began on June 22 and ended on
August 22, almost a month too soon. There was also a break in rainfall from August 1 to 14 which resulted in
the destruction of the pulse harvest and badly affected other crops. Then, once the rain resumed, there was good
distribution until the first week of September, when there was a three-week dry period. This dry period
coincided with the flowering and grain filling stages of both pulses and cereals and had an adverse effect on
yields. Fortunately, the rain resumed again, beyond the normal season, at the end of September and saved many
crops from total loss. However, yields and crop quality were both reduced because of this dry period at such a
crucial growth stage in these high-potential zones.‖

―Poor performance of the 2009 February to May belg rains, combined with several consecutive seasons of
below-average rainfall, has resulted in water shortages, decreased pasture availability, and significantly reduced
belg crop performance in southern and northeastern Ethiopia. The USAID-supported Famine Early Warning
Systems Network (FEWS NET) reported that the kiremt rains started up to three weeks late in surplus-
producing areas in Tigray, Afar, Amhara, and Oromiya regions. FEWS NET indicated that rainfall increased in
August, but kiremt rains remained below normal as of August 25, increasing the likelihood of a significantly
reduced meher harvest, the source of more than 90 percent of Ethiopia‘s annual crop production. Farmers
require adequate rainfall through September and early October to produce a normal crop. However, in early
September, USAID/OFDA noted reports of slowing or early cessation of rains in some areas. As a result of poor
rains and the exhaustion of coping strategies, USAID/OFDA staff anticipate a significant increase in the need
for humanitarian assistance the remaining months of 2009 and into 2010.‖

Note: About 68 percent of the farmers interviewed by the DSA evaluation responded that rainfall in 2009/10
was below normal in amount and distribution (DSA 2010).

          Comment on Project performance Assessment Report
                              Ethiopia
                     Fertilizer support project
1 – General comment:
 The IEG assessment report does not evaluate the project performance against the objectives
of the project. That is ―to increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009/10 would
remain on or near the growth trends of recent years and to contribute to the government‘s
effort to ensure an aggregate availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010
production season‖ which were successfully met. The report tried to evaluate the project
which has specific objectives against the overall fertilizer market system and the availability
of other productivity enhancing inputs such as seed and irrigation facilities, and finally come
up with output rating which is not acceptable to Ministry of Agriculture.

2 – Specific comments
The draft assessment contains errors of fact and interpretation with material implications for
the ratings. Please see our specific comments below.

      Rating of Outcome: U the intended outcome is restated for purposes of assessment in
       two dimensions: i) ensuring availability of supply of fertilizer adequate to meet
       demand, and ii) increasing the likelihood that production would remain on or near the
       growth trend, Outcome is rated in three dimensions ( relevance, efficacy, and
       efficiency).

       -Relevance: The author finds the project‘s objectives substantially relevant, but the
       design only modestly so due to shortcomings in the results chain, the size of the
       project, and the arrangements for importation of fertilizer.

       -Efficacy: the author finds efficacy to be modest due to late delivery of fertilizer and
       shortfall in production during the identified period.

       -Efficiency: The author finds efficiency modest due to excess carryover of stocks.

Each of the points noted in the bulleted section above is addressed below,

      Results chain: The author notes that fertilizer is most effective when combined with
       improved seed, water, and technical advice, a point with which few would disagree,
       How project design should have been different to accommodate this is not clear, At
       several points (e.g., para 3.5) the author recognizes that under emergency conditions
       increased supply of seed, water, and advice could not have been accommodated
       within the same time frame as increased supply of fertilizer. A design that attempted
       to do so under emergency conditions would have been flawed. Seeds cannot be
       imported quickly in large quantities with assurance that they will be appropriate for a
       given agro-ecological zone. The importance of teff in the Ethiopian crop mix makes
       importation of seed even more difficult. Yet a more elaborated results chain (such as
       that in Figure 5) is presented with the suggestion that its inclusion in project design
                                         45                                    ANNEX C

    ―would have provided an opportunity to the Bank team to include discussion on these
    issues as a part of supervision missions and/ or as a part of policy dialogue and
    encourage the Borrower to give them greater attention..‖ The results chain presented
    in Figure 5 is not sufficiently informative to serve as a good vehicle for engagement
    with a client for the bank. The GOE in collaboration with development partners,
    including the WB, worked to improve problems of seeds, irrigation; management of
    land and water, and advisory services in the past several years, that contributed for the
    growth in production and productivity the agricultural sector. Thus, no need to
    address all these complicated issues with this very small and short period emergency
    project.

   Size of the project: The argument is presented in para 3.8 that the project was
    appropriately sized at the time of conception in mid-2008, but too large in light of the
    drop in fertilizer prices between September 2008 and January 2009, and that the
    project size should have been adjusted accordingly. ―Since the drop in international
    prices came before the project had been actually approved, measures could have been
    explored to reduce the project size to match it with the amount of fertilizers needed.‖
    The project size could not have been changed mid-stream without increasing risks of
    delay in approval, and hence delay delivery of the fertilizer. In para 9.1 the author
    notes, ―The project went from concept review to approval in under three months and
    given the number of steps that are involved in getting approval, ministry of
    Agriculture and the Bank staff must have worked under enormous time pressure.‖
    Had the project been resized mid-way through, many of those steps would have had
    to have been repeated. Were project size truly an impediment to the relevance of
    design, then the practical remedies would have been two: either start with a smaller
    size (and risk undersupply), or restructure after approval. As prices moved from
    peaks in August to lower prices in October, it was unknown whether they would
    remain low, and hence the risk of undersupply would have been substantial. In fact
    the project was not too large. Its size allowed objectives to be met in the target year,
    and stocks were carried over for use in the next season. The issue of carryover stocks
    is addressed below in the discussion of efficiency.

   The sole importer arrangement: The bulk fertilizer procurement arrangement through
    one nominated importer was not an outcome of the fertilizer support project as the
    IEG report mentioned. It was introduced based on the Abuja declaration of the
    African head of states. The objective is mainly to get price advantage due to
    economics of scale in fertilizer procurement. In this arrangement the importer of the
    fertilizer for the season is nominated by the other importers to purchase fertilizers on
    behalf of them. It should also be noted that the fertilizer was procured on ICB base
    and the distribution and retail price was not determined by Ministry of Agriculture, it
    was determined by fertilizer distributors and retailers. Thus the whole idea regarding
    the one importer/bulk purchase arrangement reflected on the report is far from the
    reality.

   Late delivery of fertilizer: The assertion that fertilizer was delivered late is not
    substantiated. Nor is a case well made that timing of delivery had an impact on the
    response to fertilizer. As noted in para 4.5., rains were delayed and farmers therefore
                                            46                                   ANNEX C

    delayed purchases. The impact evaluation undertaken by DSA reports that in a
    sample of 550 farmers in four regions, 74% of respondents said that delivery was
    timely and 24% said that it was late. In the same study the group discussions
    participants agreed that fertilizer was supplied timely. This information is conveyed
    in footnote in the PPAR, with emphasis on the 24% reporting late delivery. The
    author implicitly judges 74% to be too low, but does not offer an alternative target
    that would have constituted adequate timeliness. No target is specified in the PAD.
    If a target is to be imposed by IEG after the fact as metric for rating, the justification
    for selection of that target should be included. The timeliness of delivery during the
    project period was at least as good as in the past, and according to qualitative
    responses in the impact evaluation, often better.

   Shortfall in production: The author acknowledges the well known ambiguities in
    Ethiopian production data. Given a choice between the FAO/WFP data that show a
    decline of production by 5 percent on a calendar year basis and CSA data showing an
    increase of about 5 percent on a crop year basis, she prefers the lower number. The
    author does not note that even if the choice is to use the FAO/WFP data, these data
    for 2009-10 represent an increase of 11% over the average level of production in the
    past five years. She further argues that if one accepts the CSA data showing an
    increase, either 5.2% or 7% depending on the basis chosen, growth is less than the
    11% trend. The wording of the PDO; i.e., to increase the likelihood that production
    would remain on or near trend, ―does not require achieving a specific quantitative
    target. If one had to define a metric for this, a plausible definition would be within
    the interval between the trend line and the average level of the past five years. No
    metric was included, however, by intent, since it would be highly risky to identify a
    point forecast of agricultural production in given year as a target for an output
    indicator for project performance. The wording captures the intent to avoid a
    domestic supply shock due to lack of fertilizer at a time of high international food
    prices. That intent was achieved; the fertilizer was delivered in quantities and largely
    on time to meet demand. It did increase the likelihood that production would be
    normal, and ex post it was.

   Efficiency: The author finds efficiency low because the quantity purchased was in
    excess of that used in one season, and the excess was carried over. ―…scarce foreign
    exchange resources were locked up in fertilizer overstocks whereas these could have
    been used for meeting alternate pressing needs in a crisis situation.‖ Whether
    purchase and carryover was economically efficient depends on the physical
    depreciation during the period of storage, the price path, fungibility of resources, and
    carrying cost of finance. A landlocked country with less than fully certain supply and
    availability of foreign exchange would be expected to hold carryover stocks. Stocks
    were useful for supply during the first planting season, and were replenished after the
    imports under the project arrived. The resources used for fertilizer were only partially
    fungible, since they were available for crisis response, and not for other purposes.
    More could have been used for safety nets and less for fertilizer, but the optimal
    proportion was not known ex ante. No evidence of significant physical deterioration
    during storage is provided, and the author appears to agree that stocks were used in
    the next season (para 7.2). No evidence is presented to show that purchase and
                                         47                                    ANNEX C

    storage was economically less advantageous than returning to the market at a later
    date. The author could have included information from the impact evaluation
    showing that use of fertilizer at the farm level was profitable. This information would
    have been relevant to the question of efficiency, but was omitted.

   The assignment of U for outcome is based, in addition to the above, on a number of
    ancillary points; e.g., logistical constraints (which were resolved within weeks and
    did not adversely affect outcomes), displacement of WFP shipments (resolved
    through the use of another port), and inadequate availability of seed (a chronic
    problem neither worsened nor addressed under the project).

   The project met its objective to supply fertilizer in sufficient quantities to support
    production at a critical period when the counterfactual would have led to enormous
    hardship and much greater cost of remediation. The rating for outcome should be
    revised to S.

   Borrower Performances: Moderately Unsatisfactory the Government‘s
    performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory due to overestimation of demand, an
    issue with financial management, and delay in implementation of safeguards. The
    Government routinely overestimates demand, and techniques for estimation should
    indeed be improved. The quantity of fertilizer provided under the project was less
    than the official estimate of demand; additional supplies financed by AfDB and the
    Government of Japan were approved after this project, and constituted the marginal
    amounts. Excess supply was effectively carried over and subsequently used. The
    financial management issue was corrected by the end of the project, and did not have
    an impact on results. The Government‘s performance should be rated satisfactory.

   The implementing agency‘s performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory due to
    lagged progress on M & E, safeguards, and fiduciary issues. Each of these was
    largely remedied by the end of the project, and the impact evaluation yielded useful
    information. The PPAR Correctly notes staff shortages in MOARD, and these are
    chronic. The performance of the implementing agency should be rated satisfactory.

    The performance of Borrower overall should be rated Satisfactory.
