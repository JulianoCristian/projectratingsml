To that end, the development\n            objective is to contribute to the Government's efforts\n            to ensure aggregate availability of supply of chemical\n            fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production seasons adequate to\n            meet smallholder farmers' priority demands. On April\n            12, 2010 the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development\n            notified the Bank that approximately 15 million USD remained\n            in the designated account for the Fertilizer Support Project\n            and requested that this amount be cancelled and recommitted\n            to the Agricultural Growth Project (AGP) and subsequently on\n            April 20, 2010 confirmed that all unused funds should be\n            cancelled. In a letter dated June 7, 2010 the Government,\n            recognizing that there was insufficient time to process the\n            reallocation before the AGP financing proposal was due to be\n            submitted for consideration by the Board of the World Bank\n            Executive Directors, requested that the unused funds be\n            instead made available to the Protection of Basic Services\n            (PBS) Program Second Phase Project. The value of the balance\n            remaining in the designated account of the Ethiopia\n            Fertilizer Support Project as of April 12, 2010 when the\n            cancellation request was first submitted to the bank is\n            equivalent to SDR 10,382,471.90. The recommitment is sought\n            by the Government in order to make full use of the remaining\n            International Development Association (IDA) resources under\n            a different ongoing operation. Since the Fertilizer Support\n            Project has been fully implemented and is achieving its\n            development objective, the remaining SDR 10,382,471.90\n            cannot be used under this project."}, "docdt": "2010-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
