objective of the Food Crisis\n            Response Program Project for Ethiopia is to contribute to\n            the Government's efforts to maintain adequate coverage\n            of the Ethiopia Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in\n            2009, thereby ensuring that the project development\n            objectives of the PSNP can be met. There is an immediate\n            need to minimize the risk of a repeated food shortage. In\n            the short-term, this can be achieved by ensuring adequacy of\n            resources to: (i) continue to effectively support\n            food-insecure households through the PSNP; and (ii) import\n            critical agricultural inputs, primarily fertilizer. Unless\n            the livelihoods of food-insecure households are protected\n            and unless Ethiopian farmers have adequate supply of\n            fertilizers, the food shortage Ethiopia is currently\n            experiencing is almost certain to recur on a much larger\n            magnitude, even with good rains. Over the longer term,\n            complementary efforts to boost agricultural productivity and\n            reduce vulnerability to shocks must be further strengthened."}, "docdt": "2008-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
