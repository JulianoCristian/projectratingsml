7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The Project seeks to increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009-2010 will remain on or near the 
growth trend of recent years.  To that end, the development objective is to contribute to the Government's 
efforts to ensure aggregate availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production 
season adequate to meet smallholder farmers' priority demands.

2. 
A total of SDR 10,382,471.90 is to be cancelled.  The amounts are proposed for 
recommitment to augment the IDA financing for the ongoing Ethiopia-Protection of 
Basic Services (PBS) Program Phase II Project.  The percentage of expenditures financed 
(inclusive of taxes) is 100% (current and revised). 
3. 
The Project has provided the Government with the needed foreign exchange 
resources to facilitate the import of fertilizer (urea and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)) 
for the 2009 production seasons.  A total of 510,000 tons of fertilizer was procured with 
IDA-funding for the 2009 production season.  Additional fertilizer was procured with 
funding from the African Development Bank and the Government of Japan, bringing the 
total fertilizer procurement for Ethiopia’s 2009 season to 626,700 tons, the highest ever. 
Sales to farmers for both the early small rains (
belg
)
season and the large rain (
meher
)
season were reported to have amounted to about 427,000 tons. Government report, Bank 
supervision missions, and the draft Impact Evaluation study indicate that farmers have 
received fertilizers reasonably on time.  
4. 
Procurement, importation and distribution of fertilizer for the 2010 season is 
almost completed, and availability of fertilizer for farmers is ensured for the current 
season. The procurement for the 2010 season was undertaken without IDA funding as the 
tender was not advertized internationally. Based on this and due to the appreciation of the 
Page  5

SDR against the US$, some funds remain unused under the Project. The Project is closing 
on July 31, 2010. 
5. 
On April 12, 2010 the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development notified 
the Bank that approximately 15 million USD remained in the Designated Account for the 
ET-Fertilizer Support Project and requested that this amount be cancelled and 
recommitted to the Agricultural Growth Project and subsequently on April 20, 2010 
confirmed that all unused funds should be cancelled. In a letter dated  June 7, 2010 the 
Government, recognizing that there was insufficient time to process the reallocation 
before the AGP financing proposal was due to be submitted for consideration by the 
Board of World Bank Executive Directors, requested that the unused funds be instead 
made available to the Protection of Basic Services (PBS) Program Phase II Project. The 
value of the balance remaining in the Designated Account of the ET-Fertilizer Support 
Project as of April 12, 2010 when the cancellation request was first submitted to the bank 
is equivalent to SDR 10,382,471.90.   
6. 
The proposed recommitment is sought by the Government in order to make full 
use of the remaining IDA resources under a different ongoing operation. Since the ET-
Fertilizer Support Project has been fully implemented and is achieving its development 
objective, the remaining SDR 10,382,471.90 cannot be used under this Project. The 
Government has already requested the Association to include in the lending program for 
FY11 an additional financing for PBS II, and the proposed recommitted amounts will 
contribute to the PBS II achieving its development objective.
