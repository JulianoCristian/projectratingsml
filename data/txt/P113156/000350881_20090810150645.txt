Type of Operation:
New Operation [X] Additional Financing [ ] Existing Financing (restructuring) [X]

The Program would be financed through new IDA resources in an amount equivalent to US$137.5
million, and redeployment of IDA-resources (credits and grants) from 12 of Ethiopia's ongoing Projects
in a total amount equivalent to US$137.5 million.
Development Objective:
The Project seeks to increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009-2010 will remain on or near the
growth trend of recent years. To that end, the development objective is to contribute to the Government's
efforts to ensure aggregate availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production
season adequate to meet smallholder farmers' priority demands.


Short Description:
The Project is an emergency operation under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), ), which
was endorsed by the Board on May 29, 2008, and will be financed through the cancellation of grants and
credits from 12 projects as well as new commitments. Two components are proposed: First, a large
Fertilizer Component (about US$249.6 million) would ensure availability of a significant share of the
fertilizer demand for the 2009 season. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will use the
Project funds to allocate foreign exchange to the domestic importer(s) for paying the foreign fertilizer
suppliers. Fertilizer distribution and sales to farmers will be mainly through private entities, in particular
farmer cooperatives and their unions. Most fertilizer is expected to be used on staple food production
where it is a critical input determining food crop yields. Second, a small but important Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) Component (about US$0.4 million) would track the fertilizer imports, the various
steps along the input distribution system, and enable an assessment of the impact of the project for the
beneficiary farm households.

          A. THE "F-CRISIS": FOOD, FERTILIZER, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

1.     Ethiopia faces a crisis that is broader, deeper and more complex than the food crisis in
almost any other country. The country's economy has been growing at double digit rates for the
last five years. Average agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates over this period
have also been at double digit rates and the sector still accounts for 44 percent of total GDP. The
growth has, however, not removed the long-standing problem of pervasive food insecurity and
severe vulnerability to shocks. This year the country is under threat from high inflation and a
widening trade deficit, coupled with failed March to May 2008 belg (small season) rains. The
resulting drought and local food shortages in several parts of the country affect some 12 million
people, and exacerbate the rise in food prices already under way due to global, regional1 and
domestic factors. Food price inflation is particular high, peaking at 91.7 percent for the 12 months
ending July 2008 and standing at 81.1 percent by September. Ethiopia has one of the highest food
price inflation rates in the world.

2.     This situation has caused severe hardships for the country and, especially, the most
vulnerable segments of the population. Of Ethiopia's population of about 77 million people
(2007, Central Statistical Agency (CSA) data), 7.3 million chronically food insecure people receive
regular support from the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), and of these 4.4 million people
have required supplementary food or cash assistance from the PSNP in addition to normal levels of
support to ensure adequate food consumption until the next harvest. In addition, another estimated
4.6 million rural people had been pushed into food insecurity by June 2008. Today (October 2008),
this number has increased to 6.4 million people dependent on emergency food assistance. The
urban population has also been severely affected by the high inflation; the Government has
estimated that 75,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition; and emergency food storages
are virtually empty. The country is eagerly awaiting the meher (main) harvest which is peaking in
October to December. Fortunately, the rains over the last few months and available forecasts
provide the basis for cautious optimism for this harvest, at least in parts of the country.

3.     Much attention has been paid over the last few months to meeting immediate needs for
food. According to the UN, donors have committed US$772 million in assistance related to the
food crisis since March 2008. The PSNP has advanced resources to increase the support to its
worst affected beneficiaries and raise the wage rate to compensate for part of the loss of purchasing
power due to inflation. The Government has imported about 300,000 tons of wheat which it sold in
urban areas at the cost of purchasing (which is below domestic market price) to ease the situation
for the urban poor.

4.     Food production in the coming season is critical, and the Government and partners are
seeking to ensure that inputs and advice are available to farmers in a timely fashion. Some
donors have made commitments to fill the 2009 funding gap for the PSNP created by advancing
resources into 2008 to meet urgent needs. The Government and Development Partners (DPs) have
also started a design process for the next phase of the PSNP. This new design will have improved
linkages to the broader Food Security Program and other relevant government services in rural


1 Crop failures, high food and non-food prices, conflicts, trade disruptions, and inadequate availability of water and
pastures have led to food insecurity in other parts in the Horn of Africa as well.



                                                             5

areas, all with a view to creating an integrated package of services that will provide a sustainable
path to graduation for chronically food insecure households.                      With regard to growth of the
agricultural sector, the Government and the DPs are strengthening existing programs and enhancing
the focus on agricultural growth. For instance, in recent years the agricultural extension system has
been significantly strengthened, and now consists of about 70,000 extension workers throughout the
country. Extension workers interact with farmers through a network of farmer training centers and
cooperatives at the local level. Cooperatives provide their members with training and other services,
including marketing of inputs and outputs. The Government with support of DPs such as FAO,
GTZ, and USAID and relevant stakeholders has launched new initiatives to boost crop production
through improved seeds, including through seed distribution and production of breeder, pre-basic,
basic and certified seeds, as well as multiplication of seeds at the community level.

5.       Nevertheless, at least two critical gaps still remain:

    · First, due to the food crisis the PSNP provided supplementary food and cash assistance to
         4.4 million existing beneficiaries to ensure their consumption until the next harvest. In
         addition, food price inflation in 2008 has left the purchasing power of the cash transfer
         severely diminished, and this needs to be addressed through an adjustment upwards in the
         nominal value of the transfer.             These two unforeseen cost overruns have drained the
         program's resources.           While some donors have committed additional resources, there
         remains a financing gap for 2009.
    · Second, the country is short of foreign exchange needed to import fertilizer2 for the 2009-
         2010 cropping season (see Section B for details). The growth in crop production in recent
         years (prior to the current season) has been due in part to increased use of imported
         fertilizer. Low application of fertilizer next year would most likely result in low yields,
         increased poverty among the 6 to 7 million of small-holder farm households who regularly
         apply fertilizer, and continued or worsened food insecurity.

6.      The proposed Ethiopia-Food Crisis Response Program aims to address these two gaps
under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) and in accordance with OP/BP8.00.
The broad goals of the proposed program are to ensure Ethiopia's food security in 2009 by helping
to address the needs of chronically food insecure households and increasing the likelihood that crop
production will remain on or near the growth trend of recent years. The total proposed financing
amount is SDR184.35 million (equivalent to US$275 million) for two Projects under the proposed
Program:
         · A PSNP Additional Financing Project of SDR16.75 million (equivalent to about
               US$25.0 million) would support the Government's efforts to ensure that the PSNP can
               provide adequate coverage of food-insecure households in 2009.
         · A Fertilizer Support Project of SDR167.6 million (equivalent to about US$250.0
               million) would provide the necessary foreign exchange to fertilizer importers to support



2The overall government and donor program also addresses needs to pay attention to other complementary inputs.
Seeds, in particular, are also of significant concern. However, since the value of the seed sector is much smaller than
that for fertilizer and since seeds are largely produced locally, many solutions are being found without major external
assistance or importation.



                                                            6

               the importation and subsequent distribution and sales of a significant share of the
               fertilizer demand for the 2009-2010 season.

7.       The proposed operation is urgent because of the timing of PSNP implementation and
the schedule of Ethiopia's agricultural production cycle. Financing for the PSNP needs to be
provided well ahead of the start of the 2009 program in January. In order to ensure that transfers
can be provided to beneficiaries early in the season ­a critical feature of the project design­ the
Government will need to begin disbursing resources to woredas in early December 2008.
Similarly, international procurement of the first batch of the fertilizer needed for 2009 must be
completed immediately, followed by actual importation and distribution and sales to farmers. The
timing of Ethiopia's agricultural production cycle is shown in Box 2 below.

 Box 1: The Agricultural Production Cycle in Ethiopia

 The urgency of the fertilizer operation under the Food Crisis Response Program is a result of the country's
 agricultural cycle. The two growing seasons in Ethiopia are belg (small rains) and meher (main rains).
 Ethiopia's agriculture is primarily driven by meher season production, which accounts for more than 90
 percent of the value of annual grain production. Cereals, pulses, and oilseeds dominate the crop sector,
 accounting for more than 70 percent of the production value; another about 10 percent is from coffee.
 Major crops are concentrated in the Central, Western, and Northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. Besides the
 availability of inputs, the performance of meher crops, or 90 percent of the value of agricultural output,
 depends crucially on kiremt rains from June through September. As shown below, the agricultural cycle
 dictates the procurement and distribution process of fertilizers, and pace of the project. To show an impact,
 the project has to become effective in early December, to allow minimum time for the logistics and
 distribution of fertilizers to farmers for the 2009 belg and meher season.


                                                         Kiremt rains                       Meher harvest

8.       The Program would be financed through a combination of new IDA resources and a
redeployment of existing IDA resources: (i) new IDA resources in an amount equivalent to
US$137.5 million;3 and (ii) redeployment of IDA-resources (credits and grants) from 12 of
Ethiopia's ongoing Projects in a total amount equivalent to US$137.5 million.4                                              Significant
resources from Government and other donor partners will be leveraged, as described in Section D.
The list of Projects from which IDA resources are redeployed includes four (4) Projects that are
proposed to be restructured with major/significant changes requiring modifications in Development
Objectives and/or changes in associated outcome targets: the Food Security Project (FSP), the ICT
Assisted Development Project, the Post Secondary Education Project, and the Rural Capacity


3This includes the US$25 million for the PSNP Additional Financing Project, plus US$112.5 million for the Fertilizer
Support Project.
4These resources would be allocated to the Fertilizer Support Project.

                                    B. MACRO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT

Recent Developments

9.     Ethiopia has made some impressive development gains in the past few years.                   Its
economy has grown at a robust rate of between 8-13 percent annually for five consecutive years--
raising the living standard of millions of its people from a very low base. The poverty headcount
ratio has declined from 44 percent in FY00 to 39 percent in FY05, and has likely continued to fall
given the high levels of growth. The country's physical and social infrastructure has expanded
rapidly: between FY00 and FY07, the federal paved road network has increased by 43 percent;
power generation capacity has nearly doubled; primary school enrollment has increased from 5.2
million to 13 million; and most health indicators have shown steady improvements.

10.    However, the development process has been accompanied by growing macroeconomic
imbalance. Although most countries in the world currently face a difficult macro environment, the
situation in Ethiopia is unusually severe. This is the first time in the last two decades that Ethiopia
has confronted the twin challenges of high inflation and low international reserves. The inflation
rate is at a historical peak, with the twelve month average inflation reaching 37.2 percent for the
period ending in September 2008. The twelve month end-of-period inflation rate stood at 59.7

percent5--substantially higher relative to its own past as well as to other countries in the region.
International reserves have gradually depleted and barely covered 1.2 months of imports of goods
and nonfactor services at the end of June 2008 (see Table 2).

11.     Food price inflation is particularly high. Food price inflation, which stood at 81.1 percent
in the 12 months ending September 2008, has far exceeded overall inflation (see Figure 1).
However, there has now been a modest decline since the inflation peak in July 2008 (91.7 percent).
The high food inflation is mainly attributed to the rise in the cereal prices which have increased by
157 percent during the 12 months ending September 2008.

12.     Ethiopia's high inflation has been caused by a combination of several factors. Growth
in supply has lagged behind growth in domestic demand. The Government strategy to invest
heavily in infrastructure and social services as a way to stimulate growth in the private sector has
created rapid expansion in domestic demand and overall GDP. While the business environment has
improved, the supply response has not kept pace with the double-digit demand growth. This has
laid the ground for rising trade deficits and inflation. Two exogenous shocks have exacerbated the
situation in 2008. The steep rise in global prices has increased Ethiopia's import bills, and affected
domestic inflation (especially fuel). The failure of the belg rain and consequent reduction in
production caused shortages of food in some areas and contributed to the general rise in food prices.
An accommodative monetary policy and significant borrowing by public enterprises fueled
aggregate demand, raising prices and increasing the demand for imports.                          Finally, with the
relentless price rise, inflationary expectations have taken root in recent months.6


5This inflation measure is slightly down from its peak in July 2008 (64.1 percent).
6How much Ethiopia's inflation is globally induced and how much is the result of domestic policies has been a subject
of great debate in the country. For two different views on this subject see "Explaining Food Price Inflation Policy

13.                The foreign exchange shortage, which is the third such episode in the last one decade,
has been caused by a number of inter-related structural factors. In recent years Ethiopia
growth process has become highly import-dependent, with import-growth elasticity being close
to 3. While some of the import dependency is explained by the need to build large infrastructure
(e.g., six hydropower dams are at various stages of construction), there has also been considerable
increase in import of consumption goods. The latter is explained by Ethiopia's small and stagnant
manufacturing sector (relative to the size of the rest of the economy)--thus increased demand for
manufacturing product has resulted in either increased imports or shortage in domestic market (and
thus higher prices). Since the domestic savings rate is low and falling, increased imports have
translated into large and growing current account deficits. While these structural constraints have
contributed to the large external imbalance of Ethiopia, the situation became overwhelming during
2007/08, after the food, fuel and fertilizer prices in global market started to rapidly escalate.

14.                The social impact of the current crisis is expected to be considerable. The price of the
consumption bundle that the poor consumes is estimated to have risen by 78 percent in urban areas
and by 85 percent in rural areas during the last two years. While the overall income of farmers has
risen faster than the increase in the general price level,7 given that nearly 50 percent of rural
households are net food buyers, the net impact of inflation is likely to modestly reduce welfare in
rural areas and to do so markedly in the urban areas.8 In addition, smallholders could suffer

Ethiopia," by Josef Loening, Dick Durevall and Yohannes Birru (October 2008).
7This is based on the fact that producer price index has grown faster than the consumer price index.
8 The discussion on the social impact of food inflation is based on the latest rounds of household surveys in 1999/00
and 2004/05. It has been argued (World Bank 2005) that, as the average size of sales by the net buyers were small
(about 10 percent of own production), net buyers were unlikely to be selling because of distress sales after the harvest.

significant income losses, if fertilizer were not available ­ the simulated impact of the unavailability
of fertilizer is an increase in the rural poverty headcount of as much as 5 percentage points.9

Government Response to the Macroeconomic Crisis

15.    In recognition of the seriousness of the problem, Government has undertaken a
number of actions to reduce aggregate demand and to cool down the overheated economy.
Specific measures include:

    · Considerable adjustment on the fiscal front. The Government has announced a budget for
         FY09 that includes a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of GDP (from 4.3 percent
         of GDP in FY08), a decline in the total federal expenditure to 19.6 percent of GDP (from
         21.3 percent of GDP in FY08), and a lowering in the domestic borrowing requirement to 1.5
         percent of GDP (from 2.4 percent of GDP in FY08). The Government has further indicated
         that it will reduce domestic borrowing further, if the funds of the proposed emergency food
         crisis operation become available to assist with the urgent needs to finance fertilizer imports
         and the safety net activities (see Table 3). While there is no evidence yet to confirm a
         slowdown in the investment program of the public enterprises, given the sharp decline in
         money supply growth (see bullet-point below) and severe shortage of foreign exchange,
         they are being forced to reexamine their investment plans. It is however too early to assess
         whether the Government will be able to halve the public sector domestic borrowing during
         FY09 from around 5 percent of GDP in FY08, as had been suggested by the IMF.

    · Elimination of fuel price subsidy. The Government has recently eliminated the fuel subsidy
         by fully adjusting the domestic prices to import parity level. The prices of gasoline, diesel,
         fuel oil, and kerosene have been adjusted upwards by 6 percent, 39 percent, 32 percent, and
         50 percent, respectively. This measure alone is expected to reduce off-budget expenditure
         by nearly US$200-250 million annually. The Government has also indicated that, in the
         future, fuel prices will be adjusted at a monthly frequency.

    · Modest tightening of monetary policy. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) has raised the
         minimum reserve requirements on commercial bank deposits twice (from 5 to 10 percent,
         and then to 15 percent), and has increased the minimum time and saving deposit rate from 3
         to 4 percent since July 2007. The authorities have agreed to contain the money growth
         target for FY09 to below 20 percent, lower than the 22.7 percent growth achieved during
         FY08. In a recent discussion, the Government has indicated that the money supply growth
         may be further reduced to a 14-17 percent range. The authorities have also agreed with the
         IMF to limit direct central bank financing of the budget.

    · Flexibility in the exchange rate. During the discussion with the IMF Article IV mission in
         May 2008, the authorities have agreed that more flexibility in exchange rate movement
         could in principle be beneficial, but were anxious to avoid sharp corrections of the exchange
         rate--not least, because they could fan inflationary expectations.

    · Measures to mitigate the impact of inflation. To soften the impact of inflation on the most
         vulnerable population, the Government has imported 300,000 tons of food grains (around
         2 percent of domestic crop production) using its own resources and has been selling it to
         urban poor at a subsidized price. The Government has removed valued added tax, turnover
         tax, and surtaxes on some food items. It has also increased the cash transfer in its safety net
         programs from ETB6 to ETB8 per day and is contemplating further adjustment.

Future outlook

16.     Ethiopia's economy is expected to significantly slowdown in the coming years due to the
macroeconomic difficulties at home and financial turmoil abroad. With widespread shortage of
foreign exchange, most economic activities dependent on imported inputs have already begun to
slowdown (e.g., construction and infrastructure projects and a number of manufacturing activities).
The volume of export of top three commodities, namely coffee, oilseeds and chat, registered
negative growth during FY08. The excessive real appreciation of the local currency is likely to
further dampen exports and exacerbate the external imbalance. The recent fall-out from the global
financial crisis and the impeding recession in developed countries are expected to result in lower
remittances, reduced demand for Ethiopian exports and lower unit prices for exports of coffee and
other commodities. While some of these impacts will be offset by the decline in global oil prices,
the net effect will be increased downside risks to growth.

17.     The IMF forecasts lower growth, high current account deficit and increasing pressure
on public finance for Ethiopia.10 Buffeted by global crisis and domestic problems, Ethiopia's
economy is expected to grow at 6 to7 percent rate in the medium-term, healthy by global norm, but
considerably below its performance of the recent past. The current account deficit is estimated to
be between 11-12 percent of GDP in the medium-term. The country is expected to face an external
financing gap of around US$1 billion in the next three years, which would require greater external
assistance from key donor partners. The slowdown of the economy and reduced imports are likely
to lower the already falling domestic revenue­GDP ratio to around 12.5 percent.                           Since the
Government is committed to keeping the fiscal deficit low (around 3% of GDP) and to reduce
domestic borrowing, the impact of the crisis would be felt through reduced growth of public
expenditure, especially in the non-social sectors.11

18.     The recent Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) undertaken in July 2008 concluded that
Ethiopia's risk of debt distress remains moderate because of the large financing needs of the
public enterprises over the next ten years. Ethiopia reached its HIPC Initiative completion point in
2004 and benefited from debt relief under the MDRI in 2006. The debt relief provided under both
initiatives helped to lower the debt ratio to less than 10 percent of GDP at the end of 2006/07.
Although the current debt burden indicators remain below the policy-dependent thresholds, three
stress tests breach the threshold for the Net Present Value (NPV) of debt to exports ratio when the
debt stock is measured inclusive of public enterprises.

IMF's Involvement in Ethiopia

19.     At the request of the Government, the IMF has been undertaking semi-annual
surveillance missions to Ethiopia. The authorities have responded to IMF advice and several
recent policy moves are in line with recommendations in the Article IV staff report. Ethiopia has
also expressed interest in a rapid-access component of the "Exogenous Shock Facility." In light of
ongoing strains on the balance of payments and further increases in inflation, an IMF staff visit in
December will review the needed policy response. The Bank is working closely with the Fund and
the authorities to restore Ethiopia's macroeconomic balance (see para. 22).

Status of Dialogue on Structural Issues

20.     The current macroeconomic problems point to structural weaknesses in the Ethiopian
economy. The imbalance between rapidly growing demand and sluggish supply is at the core of
the growing trade deficit and high inflation. The policy discussions on this problem between the
Bank and the Government have been centered on improvements in three areas: (i) the investment
climate and to attract more foreign investment into the manufacturing sector; (ii) reforming the
services sector including financial and telecommunication services; and (iii) raising the allocative
efficiency of the land market.

21.     The Government recognizes the need for a coherent and credible structural reform
program to address the country's macro problems. The Government has implemented certain

primary health, water supply, agriculture and rural roads.

structural reforms in recent months, which though modest, signal commitment to address the
structural constraints underlying the macro problems. For example, the Government has recently
liberalized entry for private operators in the domestic civil aviation sector, allowed the entry of a
new domestic bank whose business model is based on extensive use of information technology and
greater focus on retail lending (unlike the existing set of private banks that have mimicked the
business model of the public sector bank), and has set-up a modern commodity exchange for bulk
trading by the private sector.

22.    The Bank is working closely with the Ethiopian authorities on a sustainable, medium-
term framework designed to restore macroeconomic balance. Recently, the Government has
set up a `technical committee,' headed by the State Minister of Finance and Economic
Development, to identify the structural constraints facing the economy and to suggest policy
options to eliminate those constraints. The policy recommendation of the committee is expected to
be informed by various analytical works undertaken by the World Bank and the Government in
recent years (see Box 3). The World Bank is also bringing in various international experts to
Ethiopia to help the Government learn from the experience of other successful developing
countries. The Government is expected to share the roadmap of its structural reform program with
the World Bank in the form of a development policy letter in December.

 Box 2: Analytical Underpinning of Ongoing Policy Discussions

 The ongoing policy dialogue between the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) and the World Bank is
 underpinned by a number of economic and sector works carried out by the World Bank, other donor
 partners (e.g., IMF), and the Government in recent years. Some of these studies include:

 Policy Note on Structural Origins of Ethiopia's Macro Problems (2008):            This Note examines the
 structural roots of Ethiopia's macroeconomic problems and proposes a number of reform options. The
 Government has set up a `technical committee' to study the Note and to come up with a medium-term
 `reform program' that will provide a lasting solution to the country's macroeconomic difficulties.

 Macroeconomic assessments: Most recently, this includes the IMF's Article IV Consultation carried out in
 July 2008. The results of a Country Economic Memorandum (2007) - Ethiopia: Accelerating Equitable
 Growth has also shaped the policy dialogue.

 Public expenditure management: A series of public expenditure reviews have been instrumental in
 identifying reforms necessary for improved aggregate fiscal management and allocative efficiency. Most
 recent reviews include: (i) Ethiopia Review of Public Finance (2008); and (ii) Ethiopia Agriculture and
 Rural Development Public Expenditure Review 1997/98 - 2005/06. These analyses are currently being
 updated and expanded.

 Private and financial sector development: Two recent studies underpin the dialogue on private and
 financial sector issues: an Investment Climate Assessment (2008) - Toward the Competitive Frontier:
 Strategies for Improving Ethiopia's Investment Climate and a Policy Note (2008) on Making Finance Work
 for Ethiopia.

 Sector work: The Bank has also undertaken a number of sector work that have informed the ongoing policy
 discussions: Impacts of Land Certification on Tenure Security, Investment, and Land Markets: Evidence
 from Ethiopia (2008); Explaining Food Price Inflation (2007); In Makeda's Footsteps: Towards a Strategy
 for Pro-Poor Tourism Development; and Ethiopia-Rural Investment Climate Assessment (draft, 2008).

 Government strategy: The Bank's dialogue is also underpinned by the GoE's own development strategy - A
 Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty: 2005/06 - 2009/10 - and the Annual
 Policy Reviews.

The Agricultural Sector

23.     Ethiopia's agricultural sector is a major contributor to the economy and is central to
food security and poverty reduction. Any slowdown in agricultural growth will affect the
country's overall GDP growth. Agriculture accounts for an estimated 44 percent of national GDP,
almost 86 percent of exports, and 85 percent of employment. Nearly 90 percent of the poor depend
on agriculture for their livelihood. Additionally, agriculture determines the country's overall food
security at an aggregate level and is also crucial for reducing the food deficit for about 15 million
persons who are chronically or transiently food insecure.

24.     Ethiopia has substantial potential for increased agricultural growth. The World Bank
estimated in 2005 that doubling cereal yields in the more food secure areas and increasing cereal
yields by 50 percent in the food insecure areas was well within the realm of the possible. This is
underlined by a strong agricultural growth trend of the past five years. According to official data,
recent growth of the agriculture sector has been very strong, averaging about 11 percent per annum
since the 2003 drought (see Figure 3). Supported by several consecutive years with good weather,
Ethiopia's cereal production has shown a strong performance (see Table 4).

25.     Recent developments have been supported by a number of factors. Weather has been
favorable since 2003, but other factors have also played a crucial role. The Government has
strongly emphasized agriculture in its overall development strategy, the Plan for Accelerated and
Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), which calls for "Accelerating Market-based
Agricultural Development." The focus of this strategy is on Ethiopia's more than 13 million
smallholder farm households,12 which produce around 98 percent of Ethiopia's agricultural output.


12According to the 2007/08 CSA Agricultural Sample Survey, the average household has 5.23 members and only about
0.9 hectare of crop area. The average household total holding including grazing land, woodland, and other land is only a
bit more than 1 hectare; less then 1.5 percent have holding of 5 hectare or more.



                                                                               15

The Government's commitment to agricultural development is reflected in its emphasis of
agriculture in the budget.          Including rural infrastructure, expenditure for agriculture and rural
development has been around 25 percent of total spending, one of the highest shares in the world.13

26.     The agricultural sector has shown signs of transformation. Much of the spending, both
directly and through the productive safety net, has been on infrastructure, including irrigation and
water and soil conservation measures. Investments in agricultural research have increased and land
tenure security has improved significantly with the provision of land certificates to millions of
smallholders. Given the focus of the proposed Fertilizer Support Project, particularly noteworthy
are also the investments in the public agricultural extension system.                        This system has been
expanded with the objective of playing a central role in the transformation of Ethiopian agriculture
from its current subsistence orientation into a market-oriented production system. The system has
increased rapidly from around 15,000 extension workers in 2002 to about 70,000 today. Farmer
training centers have been built in many kebeles (administrative villages) and training has been
provided to thousands of farmers. In addition, the extension services make use of individual, group
and mass media approaches to deliver knowledge. A crucial aspect is the delivery of "packages" to
farmers. Regular packages, for example, aim at enabling farmers to adopt improved seeds and
commercial fertilizer together with improved management and soil moisture conservation practices.

27.     Government policy emphasizes agriculture. Not only has public spending on agricultural
investments and services increased rapidly and accounted for about 18 percent of the overall
budget14, but a number of supporting policies have also been put in place.                          For instance, an
important recent development supported by the Government is that of farmers' cooperatives and
their amalgamation into cooperative unions. The Government's aim is that cooperative services are
extended throughout the country to supply inputs to smallholders and market the output. The
support for cooperatives has been in place since 1994,15 but received renewed attention in the last
few years.      As of 2005-06, cooperative coverage was already estimated at 35 percent of all
kebeles.16 Given the strong government support, the number and membership of cooperatives have
grown rapidly since then.17


13The food security issues and vulnerability of the country has resulted in food security spending making up almost
half of expenditure for agriculture and rural development.
14This is based on actual figures for the 2007/08 budget year, including (capital) expenses for Natural Resources.
15See Proclamations 85/1994, 147/1998, and 402/2004.
16Only 17 percent of households living in a given kebele actually participated actively in a cooperative (Spielman
2008), but cooperatives are serving also non-members.
17In fact, the five-year-plan of the Federal Cooperative Agency (2006) states as one of its objective to "make 70
percent of the society user of the cooperatives' services" and to "increase the cooperatives' input marketing coverage
from its present level of 70 percent to 90 percent."



                                                          16

28.     Overall, the role of the cooperatives appears to be positive. The cooperatives are serving
to amalgamate smallholders for purposes of finance and marketing of inputs and outputs. Since
most cooperatives are relatively new, however, and given the mixed experience with cooperatives
elsewhere, several concerns have been raised. In particular, there is concern that cooperatives and
their unions receive disproportionate support relative to non-cooperative private entities. This
could limit their independence and accountability to members, and also reduce contestation in the
economic sphere that would keep them efficient.               Nevertheless, the cooperatives have clearly
played a constructive role in the increased access to fertilizer in recent years and the subsequent
increase in production.

29.     The recent growth in agriculture, although impressive, is from a low base. Ethiopia's
agricultural sector continues to be of subsistence nature; land is fragmented, often highly degraded
and predominantly rain-fed.18 The country's grain economy is quite insular and poorly linked to
international markets. Food grains are hardly imported except as food aid. Food grains are also not
exported. The country is not a natural exporter given domestic consumption and high costs of
transport. Domestic cereal prices are currently above their import parity prices,19 indicating poor
price transmission from international markets. Even though Ethiopia has established an export ban
on food grains established in early 2006, this is of limited significance in this environment.

30.     Ethiopia remains highly vulnerable to external and domestic shocks.                         The recent
performance of agriculture is in some respects puzzling; production of food grains has increased
steadily and substantially over the past five years, yet the country remains highly vulnerable to
external shocks, in particular droughts, and the number of people affected does not appear to be
declining. Shocks have time and again disrupted promising longer-term developments and have
taken a toll with not just immediate, but also more sustained negative effects. Even a small shock
of 10 percent lower rainfall in a particular year is estimated to reduce growth 4-5 years later by one
percentage point (Dercon 2004, World Bank CEM 2007). Analysis indicates that recent growth has
been due largely to expansion of area onto increasingly marginal lands. Increased use of fertilizer
has obviated the decline in yields that would be expected from expansion onto marginal areas, and
has facilitated the modest increase in yields shown in Table 4.

Food Security and the Productive Safety Net Program

31.     Addressing structural sources of chronic food insecurity requires long-term
interventions. Given the high levels of chronic food insecurity in Ethiopia, and following a severe
drought in 2002/2003, the Government with DPs developed the New Coalition for Food Security, a
long-term policy framework for reducing hunger and food insecurity in Ethiopia. As part of this
initiative, it launched the Food Security Program, which combined a series of complementary
interventions designed to enable food insecure households to acquire sufficient assets and income to
"graduate" out of food insecurity and improve their resilience to shocks.


18 Grain production is characterized by the dominant (meher) rains from around June to October and with harvest
around November and December; and secondary (belg) rains between March and May with harvest around May and
June. Of course, this is a general description and there exist variations among different agro-ecological zones in
relation to production cycles.
19See Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (EXC) Market Bulletin Nr. 15, 2008.



                                                       17

32.    The shift from food aid to cash transfers is an essential part of the Government's
strategy. The Government decided that an alternative to food aid was needed to support the
consumption needs of chronic, predictably food-insecure households, as well as to address some of
the major underlying causes of food insecurity. Hence, as part of the Food Security Program, the
Government started implementation of the PSNP in 2005. The PSNP replaced the emergency
humanitarian appeal system as the chief instrument for assisting initially 5 million chronically food-
insecure people in rural Ethiopia. It was scaled up to reach 7.3 million people in 2006. The PSNP
provides cash and in-kind resources to chronically food insecure households through labor-
intensive public works as well as through direct support to labor poor households (including the
elderly, sick and female headed households). The focus of the public works program is on soil and
water conservation activities, developed within an integrated watershed management planning
framework. The PSNP operates in rural areas in approximately one third of the country. Given its
scale and focus, PSNP public works represent a unique opportunity to contribute to environmental
transformation in Ethiopia, by promoting, financing, and implementing sustainable land
management measures at an unprecedented scale.

33.    The World Bank is supporting the Government's strategy, including by providing
support to the PSNP through a three-phase APL, which is currently nearing the end of the
second phase. The implementation of the current APL II is rated "satisfactory" (see Annex 1 A for
a review of progress in implementation and project impact). Evidence to date indicates that the
PSNP at its current scale and scope, in spite of the crisis suffered in 2008, is having a substantial
impact on beneficiary livelihoods as measured by income and assets.

34.    A consortium of donor partners is equally part of the current efforts to strengthen food
security. The World Bank APL II Project is part of a much larger Government program supported
by a consortium of partners including CIDA, DFID, IrishAID, EC, RNE, SIDA USAID, and WFP,
who together have committed cash and in-kind resources valued at around US$1.2 billion during
the current phase of the Program from 2007-2009. The donor group has pooled its financing and
several partners have provided their support as co-financing to the World Bank APL II Project. At
its current scale, the PSNP represents one of the largest social protection initiatives in Africa.

Fertilizer and Complementary Agricultural Inputs

35.    Efforts to enhance agricultural growth complement the focus on food security and
social protection. Key elements of the growth strategy include improved access to fertilizer and
seeds, agro-chemicals, water, etc., and the closely related rural financial and agricultural extension
systems. Fertilizer is applied to approximately 40 percent of total farmland under crop production,
and is heavily concentrated on a few cereals (wheat, teff, and maize).20                            Improved seeds are
purchased for less than 5 percent of the total cultivated cereal area. Approximately one percent of
the total cultivated area in Ethiopia is irrigated. The limited use of modern technology is consistent
with the low average yields in cereal production of less than 1.5 tons/ha.

36.    Modern agricultural inputs are a crucial ingredient to sustain agricultural growth
based on improved productivity. Fertilizers require significant financial resources, in particular


20This figure refers to `commercial fertilizer' (for definition and data see CSA Agricultural Sample Survey). In
addition, natural fertilizers are applied, but only to around 15 percent of the total cultivated area.



                                                              18

after recent price hikes, and ­ together with seeds ­ are the most important short-term determinants
of the next year's harvest.21 Fertilizers, where applied, can easily make up a third to a half of total
purchased inputs, if field services such as oxen power or labor are purchased, or even two thirds or
more of total input costs otherwise. Moreover, unlike seeds which are produced locally, fertilizer is
dependent on international prices22 and on the availability of foreign exchange.

37.      Utilization of fertilizer at less than 40 kg per hectare of cultivated area is still low by
global standards, but growing rapidly. The use of chemical fertilizer has increased considerably
from the time of its introduction in Ethiopia in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It rose to an
estimated 400,000 tons in 2006/07 and more than 450,000 tons in 2007/08. Forty-four percent of
poor small-holder households used fertilizer in 2005.23 Many of the few large-scale commercial
farms can import their own fertilizer from retained export earnings, whilst the fertilizer for which
the Government allocates foreign exchange to enable its importation is primarily used by millions
of smallholder farmers with an average crop area of under one hectare.

38.      Ethiopia has to import all chemical fertilizers, making the supply dependent on the
country's foreign exchange reserves.                    An estimate of the fertilizer demand of Ethiopia's
smallholder farmers24 each year is submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
(MOARD)25 to the NBE based on which NBE sets aside the foreign exchange needed.                                     A
Government committee then floats several tenders and allocates the necessary foreign exchange to
importers able to document the lowest price from a foreign supplier.

39.      A number of international fertilizer companies are competing to supply Ethiopia's
fertilizer market. A study (Development Studies Associates 2006) analyzing the period from
1995/96 to 2004/05 lists more than a dozen suppliers, on average four per year.                             More are
competing in the bidding process.26 Traditionally, much of the fertilizer (only Diammonium
Phosphate (DAP) and urea are used) are imported from the Middle East market.27 The study
concludes that this competitiveness stems from their location advantage (proximity to Ethiopia).

40.      A number of commercial entities, in particular cooperatives, are engaged in fertilizer
import and distribution. Recently, cooperative unions, the parastatal Agricultural Input Supply
Enterprise (AISE), and few private companies have participated in the import of fertilizer. The

21For estimates of supply response and economics of fertilizers see Annex 2 G.
22These are still quite high, despite a significant reduction in prices over the last few months.
23This is based on a farm household survey interviewees responding on use of fertilizer with "often" or "always".
24The demand estimate also includes some demand from the few remaining state farms. Commercial farmers with
export commodities can purchase their fertilizer directly using their foreign exchange without having to rely on the
Government's mechanism to allocate foreign exchange for fertilizer.
25The process begins with Development Agents (i.e., extension agents) at the farmer level estimating the demand for
fertilizer and other agricultural inputs and associated credit, and aggregates upward through the woreda-level
Bureaus/offices of Agriculture, Zonal Administrations, Regions, and finally the Federal level.            It takes into
consideration the existing stocks.
26 In order to improve its efficiency in the import of fertilizer, the Government has been reflecting on the
recommendation of the technical team advising the new fertilizer facility set up at the African Development Bank in
response to recommendations of the Africa Fertilizer Summit in Abuja, and now intends to procure fertilizer in bulk
rather than in batches of 25,000 tons. See procurement arrangements for proposed Fertilizer Support Project in
Annex 2 C.
27For instance, Jordan Phosphate and Hydro-Agri (supplying from Saudi Arabia) had a market share of more than 50
percent for DAP and urea respectively.



                                                             19

domestic distribution of fertilizers is mainly through the cooperative system, including much of the
fertilizer imported by AISE.28

41.     Policies shaping the fertilizer market have changed in recent years, and several key
deficiencies have been addressed. While previously the state dominated the fertilizer market
including through direct distribution by extension agents,29 reforms over the last few years have: (a)
reduced the direct role of the state and increased that of the cooperatives; (b) made the allocation of
foreign exchange and importation of fertilizer more open and transparent; (c) shifted extension
agents back to their advisory role; and (d) eliminated fertilizer subsidies and piloted the elimination
of credit guarantees (in high-potential areas, in 2008).30 These are positive developments, although
the system is still highly concentrated and farmers have limited choice in their source of fertilizer.

42.     There is no evidence of rent-seeking behavior and farm gate prices seem to reflect
border prices plus transport costs and small margins, but farmers complain about
inefficiencies related to the timing, packaging and other aspects of the distribution system.
These inefficiencies are largely related to capacity constraints such as with respect to the logistics
of fertilizer transport, storage, handling, etc. Moreover, improvements are needed in the rural credit
system, the extension system, and the provision of seeds and other complementary inputs. For
example, the rural financial sector serving the farming community is negligible31 and the seed
market is underdeveloped with a consequence of low seed production, thus dampening the yield
increases achievable with the fertilizer.

43.     Remaining inefficiencies in the fertilizer market should be addressed once they are
clearly understood.32 As remaining inefficiencies involve long-term institutional issues, they
cannot be addressed quickly and will require sustained work. As the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) (2007) report states: "Based on the lessons from the past, barriers to fair market competition
are not necessarily obvious. To complete liberalization it would be important to continuously

28Last year, AISE's business in distribution was largely limited to those areas not served by the members of importing
cooperative unions and only about 15 percent of its sales went outside the cooperative system.
29 A Bank-financed National Fertilizer Support Project (NFSP) closed in 2002 having failed to achieve its main
objective of facilitating creation of a competitive market with participation of private distributors and stockists.
Policies introduced during the course of implementation of the NFSP discriminated against private seed production and
the private retailing of fertilizer (and seed), and assigned the task to the public sector with implementation by extension
agents (which included administering credit).
30The credit guarantees provided by Regional Governments constitutes an implicit fertilizer subsidy as the interest rate
is below commercially sustainable rates and the regional governments are covering for defaults. However, there exists
no explicit fertilizer subsidy in Ethiopia and the government has no intention to change this.
31Greater access to credit through the rural financial systems would strengthen farmers' ability to access fertilizers from
distributors on a cash basis outside the cooperative system.
32A recent IEG (2007) report, which confirms the unsuccessful NFSP and market developments, also refers to some of
the positive decisions, i.e. those "to reduce collateral, interest rates, and service charges, most at uniform levels for all
importers". But it also states that "while steps appear to be in the right direction, care will be needed to ensure that
these and other actions truly provide for equal treatment." The issues noted by IEG persist today. For instance, credit
guarantees by Regional Government to cooperatives advantage the cooperatives over other private sector entities
interested in participating in the distribution system, and the absence of competition could raise costs to farmers. Yet in
many African countries without Ethiopia's tightly structured cooperative system, the markets are too thin to support a
robustly competitive network of private distributors, and the advantages of the more competitive structure are not
obvious. The substantial effort on monitoring and evaluation under the project will help elucidate the strengths and
weak points of the present Ethiopian system and provide guidance on its evolution in the future. The monitoring and
evaluation will also provide transparency to the distribution of fertilizer imported in the coming year.



                                                              20

monitor the fertilizer market to ensure the conditions needed for open competition and private
sector development." The proposed operation builds in resources for such monitoring.

44.    Despite a sharp price increase in fertilizers compared to last year, the current domestic
demand appears to be high. The international export price of DAP, for example, has more than
quadrupled from about US$260 per ton on average in 2006 to US$1,177 per ton in August 2008.
Since then, the price decreased slowly to about US$900 in October 2008. The international price of
urea has more than tripled from US$223 per ton in January-December 2006 to more than US$800
per ton in August 2008. However, largely caused by the recent financial crisis and drop in energy
prices, the price dropped to only US$350 in mid-October 2008. If demand for fertilizer for the
2008/09 season were to remain constant, the total value of fertilizer consumed would increase from
US$267 million in 2007/08 to about US$340 million at current spot market prices. However,
MOARD expects future demand to exceed that of last year as domestic crop price increases have
been even higher than fertilizer prices. MOARD `lowest demand' scenario is for 550,000 tons,
which amounts to a total cost of US$443 million under spot-price assumptions plus international
costs of shipment and handling (see also Annex 2 F). The bulk of the fertilizer will have to be
imported during the next few months to assure availability for the next planting season.

45.    Together with fertilizer seeds are the most crucial short-term agricultural input. The
production and market for improved seeds in Ethiopia is small and the gap between the use of high-
yielding varieties and Government targets ­ as well as farmer demand as determined by the public
extension system ­ is substantial. In a recent assessment of the PASDEP (MOFED 2008) the
Government states that "The supply of inputs, particularly improved seeds has not kept pace with
demand". According to the CSA Agricultural Sample Surveys, only about 4 percent of the total
crop area is planted with commercially produced improved seeds.33 The short-term availability of
seeds is further limited by the failure of the belg rain, which affected not just food production but
also production of certified seeds.

46.    The Government has taken a number of steps to improve availability of seeds. Several
important steps have been taken in the last few years. In particular, an important decision was to
decentralize the public research infrastructure in order to, among other things, make research more
responsive to Ethiopia's diverse agro-ecological zones. The organization of the Government-owned
Ethiopian Seed Enterprise (ESE) is also reflecting this trend of decentralization as it has established
local branches. The aim is not just to reduce costs and to make production of seeds more profitable,
but also to share experience with and support the emergence of local seed companies and
commercial seed-growing farmers and, thereby, to more directly satisfy the diverse needs of
farmers. In parallel, the changes in terms of seed quality control and the introduction of the concept
of quality declared seed can provide more opportunities for the local private sector. In addition, the
proclamation on plant breeder's rights signifies a clear message to the commercial sector that it has
an important role to play in Ethiopia. It aims at increasing access to foreign varieties (important for
export horticulture) and at stimulating plant breeding at home.

47.    Given the significant gap between demand and supply, in particular this year, the
government has now launched a new strategic plan to address this problem. Involving all


33The total area using improved seeds is much higher as many farmers `reuse' their own (or their neighbor's) grain for
seeds.



                                                        21

stakeholders including public research, farmer cooperatives, extension, private seed companies,
etc., this plan aims at boosting production of breeder, pre-basic, basic and certified seeds. The
success of the Government's more recent initiatives remain to be seen. While they signal steps in
the right direction, more will need to be done. In particular, the role of the private sector in the
production of hybrid varieties and of the private sector and farmers in seed multiplication needs to
be further strengthened. Seed companies have been complaining about issues such as limited
access to irrigated land in good locations and access to finance. Since the production of seed is
largely done domestically, the Government is able to address them with its own resources. Other
donors, including FAO, are providing technical and other support.

48.      Other complementary inputs are also crucial. This includes, in particular, measures with
somewhat longer-term impact34 such as agricultural extension, rural finance, land administration
services, irrigation and drainage, roads and infrastructural services. As mentioned above (see
para. 22), substantial developments are taking place in many of these areas.


                         D. THE GOVERNMENT AND DONOR STRATEGY

49.      Government and DPs coordinate their response to the food crisis through the
Development Assistance Group as well as other institutions. The Sector Working Group for
Rural Economic Development and Food Security and its technical committees, in particular the
technical committees for food security and for agricultural and rural growth, are actively
coordinating the response. For instance, in addition to their longer-standing commitments, FAO,
GTZ, USAID, and others are responding to the crisis by importing seeds, planting material or other
agricultural inputs and/or providing technical assistance to increase the supply response to these
inputs. Japan has also continued its long-standing support to provide some fertilizer.

50.      The Government, with support from its DPs, is addressing the impact of the food crisis
through a broad range of measures. The Government is simultaneously seeking to: (i) address
the macroeconomic imbalance and weak foreign exchange position (see Section B); (ii) strengthen
safety nets for the poor; and (iii) maintain supply of inputs, and particularly fertilizer, for next
season's crop.

51.      Mitigating the impacts on the poor has focused on both urban and rural areas. A new
urban support program, launched in 2007 and scaled up in 2008, has distributed subsidized grain to
poor urban households with the additional aim of mitigating food price inflation. The Government
is currently importing 300,000 tons of wheat and distributing it in urban centers at cost to flour
mills, traders, and consumer associations. Additionally, the Government has removed turnover tax
and value added tax on all grains.35 The Government also launched an updated Humanitarian
Appeal in June to cover the food and non-food needs of 4.6 million drought-affected persons



34Another important short-term complementary input are agro-chemicals. However, their use in Ethiopia is currently
rather limited. According to one estimate, pesticides are applied on about 14 percent of the cultivated area. The total
market size is estimated to be very small.
35The Government has also undertaken a number of measures in recent months to contain overall inflation, including a
modest tightening of monetary policy, increasing the reserve requirement, commitment to lower the growth rate of
broad money supply, and reducing the fiscal deficit.

52.     Within the PSNP the Government worked with DPs to provide immediate additional
support to 4.4 million drought-affected beneficiaries of the Program to protect their consumption
needs until the next harvest. The cost of this has been around US$67 million. Government was
able to mobilize financing for this through various sources. A US$25 million contingent grant
under the Drought Risk Financing component of the World Bank PSNP APL II Project, designed
for this purpose, was disbursed.36 With the agreement of donor partners, program resources already
pledged for the 2009 PSNP were drawn down on an accelerated basis.

53.     There remains a residual financing gap for the PSNP in 2009. This financing gap has
been made worse by the need to adjust the value of the transfer for the 2009 PSNP program
following the huge erosion in purchasing power resulting from the recent food price inflation. The
purchasing power of the ETB8 program transfer (approximately US$0.80) was reduced by 58
percent through June, 2008. The Government and donor partners have agreed to make financing
available in order to cover a potential increase in the wage rate to ETB12. This would represent a
transfer value 50 percent above current levels and would increase the need for program financing
by a further US$97 million. This factor, alongside the cost of providing additional support through
the Program in 2008, has led to the cost overrun within the PSNP. Several of the DPs supporting
the PSNP have responded to this cost overrun and provided additional resources, both cash and in-
kind. A cumulative financing gap of US$25 million remains.

54.    The focus on the medium- and long-term strategy to boost agricultural production is
being further strengthened. Government and donors alike are sensitive that the short-term efforts
to address the food crisis should not deflect attention from the longer term agenda.       In fact,
substantial resources have been allocated to agricultural development. In particular, the
Government, both at the federal and regional (including woreda) levels is allocating significant
resources to this area (see Table 6). In addition, a number of donors have committed significant
resources (see Table 7) and more are envisioned as discussed in the Government-donor Sector
Working Group for Rural Economic Development and Food Security.

55.    Part of the longer-term strategy is to foster improved commercialization and market
development. The commercialization of agriculture is a central piece of the Government's strategy
of agricultural development. This is also reflected in the approaches to increasing food security.
The PSNP has since its inception adopted an approach of sourcing the program's grain requirements
from the local market rather than bringing in food-aid from abroad. When this has not been
possible due to local market limitations, regional procurement in Africa has been the preferred
solution. This is one of the outcomes of working closely with WFP and other donors. Over the
long-run and given the correct market conditions, this can be an important stimulus for agricultural
production. At the same time, the World Bank is working with WFP and others on fostering market
developments and linkages.




                                                24

56.     Incremental activities in response to the food crisis include Government and donor
activities to boost availability of seeds and strengthen agricultural extension. For instance, the
Government has recently developed a new strategic plan to boost production of breeder, pre-basic,
basic and certified seeds. Of crucial importance also is the agricultural extension system, which
now consists of about 70,000 agricultural extension workers throughout the country, and the
Government will further strengthen the system to improve training on advice on fertilizers and
complementary inputs. It will also continue its support for cooperatives, so that these organizations
can effectively provide their members with training complementary to agricultural inputs. Finally,
improving the quality of water and soil resources is also vital to increase crop responses to fertilizer
and reduce the risk of crop loss, and Government and DPs will strengthen capacity-building
activities in this area.

57.     However, incremental resources for agricultural activities in response to the food crisis
are limited, especially beyond the resources provided in response to the humanitarian appeal.
Most alarmingly, they fall short of meeting needs to ensure availability of fertilizers for the next
production season. For this reason, the Government has requested that the World Bank and the
African Development Bank (AfDB) redeploy resources from the current portfolio. The request to
AfDB is for about US$64.3 million. In a recent development, the European Commission (EC) also
indicated that it has been requested and is considering supporting Ethiopia with the import of
fertilizer. While the funds are not yet firmly committed, the EC is considering channeling the funds
through IDA to harmonize donor efforts. Notwithstanding these requests made to donors, the
Government has made contingency plans to finance foreign exchange for the importation of
fertilizer up to the amount of close to US$300 million to meet the estimated demand for fertilizer
import.


       E. RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AND BANK STRATEGY

Rationale

58.     There is an immediate need to minimize the risk of a repeated food shortage. In the
short-term, this can be achieved by ensuring adequacy of resources to: (i) continue to effectively
support food-insecure households through the PSNP; and (ii) import critical agricultural inputs,
primarily fertilizer. Unless the livelihoods of food-insecure households are protected and unless
Ethiopian farmers have adequate supply of fertilizers, the food shortage Ethiopia is currently
experiencing is almost certain to recur on a much larger magnitude, even with good rains. Over the
longer term, complementary efforts to boost agricultural productivity and reduce vulnerability to
shocks must be further strengthened.

59.     Within the broader context of mitigating measures addressing the food crisis, two
significant gaps remain. PSNP resources have been exhausted due to the additional needs created
by the current 2008 food crisis. The consequent gap for the 2009 program needs to be filled
immediately. This would ensure that funds could be channeled on a timely basis through the
regional governments to local governments for distribution to beneficiaries as needed by the
Program. Similarly, fertilizer application is seasonal and Ethiopia is currently not able to afford
adequate amounts of fertilizer imports without additional support. Contracting of fertilizer for the
2009 crop season and the actual imports need to be well under way this calendar year to make



                                                 25

fertilizer available to farmers in the upcoming crop season. The benefit of addressing Ethiopia's
fertilizer requirements today versus addressing extreme food shortages 6 to 9 months from now (at
much higher cost), is high.

The Bank's Broader Strategy

60.      The World Bank's broader strategy is to support the Government in assisting
chronically food-insecure households in escaping their poverty trap and to raise overall
agricultural output. The proposed Program is intended to prevent derailing this longer-term
strategy by the current crisis and to allow the Government to continue to effectively support food-
insecure households and promote agricultural growth.37

61.      The Bank is committed to continue support to the overall Food Security Program. The
Bank together with the Government and other DPs are committed to continue supporting the Food
Security Program, of which the PSNP is a part. In the new phase (APL III) of donor support for
PSNP (starting in FY10) increased efforts will be made to achieve integration of PSNP activities
(which focus on protection of household assets in times of stress and building of communal assets
including through a sustainable watershed management concept) and other livelihood activities that
help to build productive assets of households. It is now well recognized that only with a strategy
that effectively combines the two, i.e. provision of safety nets and livelihood enhancement, can
food-insecure households find a sustainable path out of poverty. In addition, the Bank is supporting
the FSP to secure the livelihood of the most food insecure households, and the strengthening of
pastoralists' resilience to external shocks through the Pastoral Community Development Project.

62.      The World Bank is also assisting the Government in strengthening sustainable
agricultural growth through a number of investment operations. To enhance agricultural
productivity, the Bank is supporting: (i) irrigation and market development with its Irrigation and
Drainage Project; (ii) agricultural services and technology (extension and research) strengthening
with its Rural Capacity Building Project; and (iii) watershed management and rural land
certification and administration with its Sustainable Land Management Project and Tana-Beles
Integrated Water Resources Development Project.

63.      The World Bank together with other DPs plan to step up its assistance through an
agricultural-growth program. The agricultural growth strategy focuses on broad-based, small
farmer led productivity increases in areas with good agricultural potential, together with greater
efforts to address diversification and markets in partnerships with the private sector.38 Additionally,
in areas of high agricultural potential and good market access, the emphasis is on promoting higher
value products (especially through contract farming arrangements), value addition, and integrated
supply chains for meeting the potential of export and expanding urban markets.39




37 In addition to the direct response to the food crisis, Ethiopia is also addressing macro-economic challenges, in
particular very high inflation and the large balance-of-payment gap, as described in Section B.
38The current projects such as Rural Capacity Building Project, the Irrigation and Drainage Project, and the Sustainable
Land Management Project provide support in this area.
39Projects such as the recently approved Tana Beles Integrated Water Resource Sector Project provide specific support
in this area.



                                                           26

CAS Alignment

64.     The operation is broadly consistent with the CAS. The PSNP remains a core component
of the World Bank strategy as articulated in the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, World
Bank, 2008).      Although the Fertilizer Support Project proposed under the Program was not
explicitly anticipated in the lending program under the CAS, the CAS squarely recognizes the risks
Ethiopia faces and states that: "The Bank will build flexibility into its lending portfolio so that it is
better able to help Ethiopia cope with external shocks." The current crisis constitutes such a shock.
In addition, the focus areas of the CAS supported by the proposed Program include increasing
agriculture productivity and reducing exposure to chronic food insecurity and shocks.

GFRP Alignment

65.     The proposed operation is timely and well positioned under the GFRP framework. It is
fully in line with the GFRP objectives as it will (i) reduce the negative impact of high and volatile
food prices on the lives of the poor in a timely manner. It will also support the other objectives,
namely, (ii) support government in the design of sustainable policies that mitigate the adverse
impacts of high and more volatile food prices on poverty, and (iii) support the first step of a larger
strategy of broad-based growth in productivity and market participation in agriculture to ensure an
adequate supply response as part of a sustained improvement in food supply. As specified in the
GFRP framework document, short-term measures must be balanced with medium-term measures
such as those intended to improve the domestic supply response. Discussion of further measures
relevant to the medium term is underway, and these will be articulated in the context of other
operations, including a possible DPL in late FY09, the third phase of PSNP, and the proposed
agricultural growth program. Hence, this proposed operation specifically focuses on addressing the
immediate financing gap in PSNP and the short-term foreign needs to ensure fertilizer availability
in 2009-2010.


                 F. THE PROPOSED FOOD CRISIS RESPONSE PROGRAM

Program Objectives

66.     This Program seeks to ensure that the needs of chronically food-insecure households
are adequately addressed, and to increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009 will
remain on or near the growth trend of recent years.40 To that end, the development objective of
the PSNP Additional Financing Project is to contribute to the Government's efforts to maintain
coverage of the chronically food insecure through the PSNP in 2009. A key indicator of success
includes the number of beneficiaries that continue to be covered under the PSNP. The development
objective of the Fertilizer Support Project is to contribute to the Government's efforts to ensure
availability of adequate supplies of fertilizers for the 2009-2010 crop season. Key indicators of
success include (i) the quantity of fertilizer imported and distributed to farmers, (ii) the timeliness
of import and distribution of fertilizer and complementary inputs to end users; (iii) fertilizer
application as share of total cultivated areas; and (iv) estimates of the costs and contribution of the
fertilizer to production and economic welfare.


40According to official statistics, the recent growth rate in crop production has been 11 to 12 percent per year (see
Table 4).



                                                          27

67.     More details on the results indicators and the detailed description of the two Projects are
provided in Annex 1 and Annex 2. The following section provides a summary.

PSNP Additional Financing Project

68.     Consistent with the parent APL II Project, additional financing for the PSNP would be
used to provide cash and in-kind transfers to food insecure households. Since 2005, the PSNP
has established a track record of providing transfers to 7.3 million chronically food insecure people
through a labor-intensive public works program for households with able-bodied members and as
direct support grants to labor-poor, elderly or otherwise incapacitated households. The public
works program aims to create productive community assets, with a focus on soil and water
conservation. The PSNP operates in the most food insecure rural areas in around one third of the
country.

69.     The objective of the PSNP Additional Financing Project is to fill the PSNP financing
gap that has emerged as a result of the food price inflation and drought in 2008, which have
caused a cost overrun in the Project (as described in paragraphs 51and 52). The aim would be to
make financing available to the PSNP immediately, which is vital for ensuring that resources start
to flow to woredas in November so that beneficiaries can be paid on time at the start of 2009.
Additional financing would allow the PSNP to continue to operate in 2009 as designed, providing a
similar level of support to food insecure households as has been provided through 2008. It would
also ensure that this support is provided on a timely basis.41

70.     Funds would be channeled as Additional Financing through the existing World Bank
APL II Project. Progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective is satisfactory.
Implementation of the project as well as project management are satisfactory and continue to be
strengthened.42 Evidence to date indicates that the PSNP at its current scale and scope, in spite of
the crisis suffered in 2008, is having a measurable impact on beneficiary livelihoods as measured
by income and assets.43 Given that the current project is proceeding as desired there are no
proposed changes in the design, and/or scope of the project. There are no changes applicable to the
institutional arrangements, implementation mechanisms, financial management, disbursement
arrangements or closing date. As the additional funds will help address a cost overrun in the project
and thereby allow the project to meet its original objectives, the original PDO remains valid and the
relevant results indicators and target values remain the same.

Fertilizer Support Project

71.     The objective of the Project is to contribute to the Recipient's efforts to ensure an
aggregate availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production season
adequate to meet smallholder farmers' priority demands. The proposed instrument for the
Fertilizer Support Project is that of an Emergency Recovery Operation processed under the

guidelines for a Rapid Response to Crisis and Emergencies OP/BP 8.00. In line with OP8.00 the
proposed Program supports "measures to mitigate or avert the potential effects of imminent
emergencies or future emergencies or crisis in countries at high risk."

72.    The project, to be implemented by the MOARD, will have two components. First, a
large Fertilizer Component (about US$249.6 million) would ensure availability of foreign exchange
for the importation of a significant share of the fertilizer demand for the 2009-2010 season.
Second, a small but important Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Component (about US$0.4
million) would track the fertilizer imports, the various steps along the input distribution system, and
enable an assessment of the impact of the project for the beneficiary farm households.                          The
Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) of MOARD will implement both components; it also
functions as the secretariat of the national Fertilizer Foreign Procurement Committee (FFPC) that
leads the process to allocate foreign exchange for the fertilizer importation.

Fertilizer Component

73.    The Fertilizer Component is a quick-disbursing component to support the importation
of fertilizers. Recognizing both the inherent risks involved in working in emergency situations,
including the risks and lost opportunities associated with a delayed response, and the critical
importance of speed, flexibility, and simplicity to an effective rapid response, this quick-disbursing
component is designed to finance one single commodity (i.e., fertilizers) under a positive list of
goods, required to immediately address the country's food crisis.

74.    MOARD has estimated, through extension staff, the quantity of the two types of
fertilizers (DAP and urea) demanded by farmers. The total estimated amount44 is about 550,000
tons of DAP and urea for the 2009 cropping season. Based on the prospect of receiving support
from IDA, the Government has initiated the process for the country to import initially 150,000 tons
of DAP and 75,000 tons of urea. The first shipment of these imports is expected to arrive in
Djibouti starting in the second half of January, in time for distribution and sale to farmers for the
2009 belg season.        The financing of this Component is expected to also contribute to the
importation of fertilizer under the next tender process(es) using the same procedures.

75.    The Bank's Procurement Guidelines will apply.                       The quick-disbursing component
supports the provision of foreign exchange for the importation of fertilizer using acceptable
procedures that satisfy the requirements of transparency, economy and efficiency (Annex 2.C,
paragraph 8). Agreement has been reached with the Government on the form of contract which is
prescribed to be used for the supply of fertilizer, and although it is recognized that these contracts
are entered into between an independent importer/distributor and the foreign supplier, which the
Government is not a direct party to, and the Bank will not conduct prior or post reviews of these
contracts, the Bank is being provided with copies of the contracts between the importer/distributor
and the foreign supplier for verification purposes (see paragraph 78 below). The task team has
reviewed the national procedures for the importation and distribution of fertilizer by local
importers, and discussed with the MOARD how the Bank's Procurement Guidelines apply in the
current situation where bulk fertilizer purchase is leading to cooperation rather than competition


44MOARD has three different estimates. 550,000 tons is the most conservative estimate, and the one used to discuss the
securing of foreign exchange for the importation.



                                                        29

between importers. Procurement arrangements to assure transparency, economy and efficiency of
the current procurement process would ensure: (i) open competition among suppliers and control
mechanisms on the procurement by the qualified importer(s) and its contractual arrangements with
other domestic distributors; and (ii) the allocation of foreign exchange and establishment of Letters
of Credit (L/Cs) to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder(s); and (iii) monitoring and verification
of the actual importation and distribution of fertilizers.

76.     MOARD regulates the procurement process of commercial importer(s) and allocates
foreign exchange for the importation. MOARD acts as a Secretariat for the FFPC, which ensures
the regulation of the tendering process, and allocation of foreign exchange for fertilizer imports to
the qualified importer(s) with the lowest evaluated responsive bids from foreign fertilizer suppliers.
For a first batch of fertilizer, MOARD has advertised on October 3, 2008 in the local press inviting
qualified and licensed fertilizer importers who have adequate funds (in ETB) to submit bids from
foreign suppliers. The tender was extended and bid opening took place on November 11, 2008.
The importers were to use bid documents prepared by MOARD based upon the Bank's standard
bidding documents for the importation of fertilizers. The bid documents have been reviewed,
revised, and agreed with the task team to include the Bank's provisions on fraud and corruption and
right to inspection and audit of the supplier(s). Given this season's option to procure in bulk,45 only
AISE has emerged as importer. Other potential importers have made contractual arrangements with
AISE to import on their behalf, rather than deciding to compete.46

77.     Given the emergence of a sole importer for the first batch of fertilizer and the large size
of the procurement, the Government agreed to include control mechanisms for AISE.47 In
particular, this includes the following requirements that: (i) AISE advertises internationally48; (ii)
AISE's bid evaluation report is approved by FFPC/MOARD and the recommendation of
FFPC/MOARD is sent to the Bank; (iii) MOARD will allocate the necessary foreign exchange to
the AISE's commercial bank for paying the foreign fertilizer supplier on the condition that AISE
and its suppliers will be subject to the Bank's provisions on fraud and corruption as well as the
Bank's right to inspection and audit;49 and (iv) MOARD forwards to the Bank copies of the
document allocating foreign exchange to AISE, the contract between AISE and the other
importers/distributors on whose behalf it is acting, and the contract between AISE and its foreign
supplier(s).

78.     IDA disbursement for the Component would be in full upon effectiveness of the project.
Upon award MOARD will instruct NBE to sell the necessary foreign exchange to the commercial
bank handling the financial transactions between the importer and foreign supplier for paying the
fertilizer supplier(s).     The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) has been functioning as the
commercial bank of the importers, and is (currently relatively high) bank handling these


45In previous years, procurement was based on 25,000 ton shipments only, leading to elevated costs.
46AISE has the biggest capacity measured in terms of market share, warehouses, etc. The risk of losing by competing
with AISE, especially given that AISE can procure larger batches, is high.
47 In case other importers will bid during this tender process or a possible next one that the Project might (partly)
finance, the provision would also apply to them.
48AISE has advertised internationally on dgmarket and UNDB online.
49Such provisions have not normally been required to be included in Bank-financed projects under quick-disbursing
components involving financing of a positive list of goods, and the inclusion of such provisions in this operation is not
to be viewed as precedent setting.

transactions. The bank will open the L/Cs for AISE/the selected importer(s) against payment by the
importer(s) of the local currency equivalent amount of the US$ denominated L/C. This transaction
is between the CBE and the importer; the NBE and Government are not involved, and will not
extend credit.       Pre- and post-shipment inspections are included in the contracts between the
importer(s) and their foreign suppliers. The local currency amount provided by the importer and
sold by the commercial bank to NBE in exchange of foreign exchange is transferred to the treasury.
The Government will submit to the Bank a written confirmation with supporting details that the
equivalent in ETB has been credited to the central treasury account.50

79.     The actual import of fertilizer, as well as their distribution and sales to farmers, will be
handled by the importer. The commodities will arrive on a pre-determined schedule through the
port of Djibouti.         From Djibouti the fertilizers will be transported by truck into the major
warehouses of the importers, including those on which behalf the importer is acting, and wholesale
traders of fertilizer and further down the supply chain to primary cooperatives and retailers and
eventually farmers.

80.     Application of fertilizer would be by the final beneficiaries, primarily small-holder
farmers. While no subsidies are provided and no detailed targeting takes place, almost all of the
fertilizer imported with support from the proposed Project (under the FFPC/MOARD tender
procedures) would be consumed by small-holder farmers. Only about 2 percent of Ethiopia's
agricultural output is produced by large-scale commercial farms, and many of these have their own
foreign exchange reserves to import fertilizers.51 About half of all smallholders might use fertilizer;
these smallholders, who live mostly outside the most marginal areas, will be the main final
beneficiaries of the fertilizers. Traditionally, a bulk of the input is used in Oromia and Amhara
Regional States, with about 50 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of total consumption, followed
by the Southern Nations Nationalities and People's Region (SNNPR) (9 percent) and Tigray (4
percent).52

Usage of the Counterpart Funding

81.     The proposed operation is designed in such a way that it will not result in additional
public spending by the Government. It has been agreed with the Government that the bulk of the
local currency equivalent that will be generated through this operation (i.e., US$249.6 million to be
used for import of fertilizers) will be used to lower the domestic borrowing of the government--so
that no new money is created in the system.53 This arrangement is expected to have neutral or
positive fiscal impact.

Monitoring and Evaluation Component

82.     MOARD's Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) will also be responsible for the
implementation of the M&E Component. The M&E activities will be implemented with the

50For details of these financial transactions see Annex 2 D.
51Many commercial farms are specialized, for example in floriculture, and need specific fertilizers, others than DAP
and urea.
52Basically no chemical fertilizers are used in the emerging regions. Data from DSA (2006).
53The Government's intention to reduce domestic borrowing by US$250 million equivalent was confirmed during the
Negotiations.

objective to: (i) provide timely information about fertilizer import and distribution for MOARD and
the Bank, so that mitigating actions can be taken if risks such as low farmer demand materialize;
and (ii) evaluate the impact of the Project on the final beneficiaries, i.e. farm households, and
Ethiopia's overall crop production and food security and inform future fertilizer policy. The M&E
Component will track the importation and distribution of fertilizers (and of complementary inputs)
and assess the efficiency of the distribution system as well as the revealed demand by the farmer
beneficiaries, and evaluate the impact of the Project on the farm beneficiaries.                         This will be
achieved through a combination of strengthening the already existing Government monitoring and
reporting systems and the commissioning of a survey by an independent international consultant.54
Terms-of-Reference for this task have been drafted and the Selection Process (with the Bank's prior
review) is planned to start as soon as possible (see Annex 2 B Attachment).

83.     The Government and its DPs will also monitor the fiscal impact of the Project, and
ensure that domestic borrowing is reduced. No new instrument is required for this as there are
regular assessments undertaken jointly by the Government and donors including the annual Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA); the annual Public Finance Assessment (PFA),
the semi-annual Joint Budget Assessment Report (JBAR); and the biannual IMF Article IV
consultation. In addition, there are major operations such as the Public Sector Capacity Building
Program (PSCAP) and the Protection of Basic Services Project (PBS) that strengthen the public
financial system including its monitoring.

84.     The Government requested to include a small activity to support the environmental
and social assessment and the preparation of the environmental management plan under the
M&E Component. The activity would finance a consultant to assist the Government in carrying
out this activity within two months after Project effectiveness (see also para. 0).


                                               G. FINANCING PLAN

Overview of Program Financing

85.     Total IDA funding for the proposed Program amounts to US$275 million. The proposed
Program finances the cash and food transfers through the PSNP Additional Financing Project with a
total cost of about US$25 million; and the Fertilizer Support Project with a total cost of about
US$250 million, of which about US$249.6 million for the importation of fertilizer and about
US$400,000 for a M&E Component (see Table 8 below).




54By doing so, the M&E Component might also provide a basis for discussions on potential policy distortions that
might still hamper the efficiency of the fertilizer and other agricultural input market. As stated in IEG (2007): "Based
on the lessons from the past, barriers to fair market competition are not necessarily obvious. To complete liberalization
it would be important to continuously monitor the fertilizer market to ensure the conditions needed for open
competition and private sector development."

  (i) PSNP Additional Financing Project                                                         25.0

          M&E Component                                                                          0.4

 Total                                                                                        275.0


86.    The proposed Program is funding financing gaps rather than entire interventions on
their own.

   · The overall PSNP program has a total budget requirement of US$1,161.3 million over the
        period 2007-2009. Out of this, the IDA-funded (parent) PSNP APL II project is funding
        US$196.4 million; other PSNP donors are funding US$871.5 million. Taking into account a
        carry-over of US$68.1 million and US$2 million Government contribution, this leaves the
        funding gap of about US$25 million that is proposed to be covered through the PSNP
        Additional Financing Project. Obviously, total expenditures for food security, even
        excluding this year's Humanitarian Appeal, are still larger. Significantly, the Government
        spends about US$200 million of its own budget resources annually on household packages
        and other food security measures complementary to those of the PSNP Program.
   · The Fertilizer Support Project would also cover only part of the total foreign exchange
        needs for the importation of fertilizer for the 2009 season. According to MOARD's estimate
        of the value of fertilizer demand, about US$654 million in foreign exchange would be
        needed to import about 550,000 tons of DAP and urea. Estimates based on current spot
        market prices still amount to about US$443 million.               The Government has made
        contingency plans to provide foreign exchange up to the amount of close to US$300 million
        to meet the estimated demand for fertilizer import. Given recent drops in the price of
        fertilizer, this will not be fully needed. In order to keep the pressure on its foreign exchange
        reserves small, the Government has also requested assistance from AfDB (about US$64
        million) and the EC.

87.    The Program will be financed from a combination of new IDA grant resources as well
as redeployment of existing IDA commitments. The PSNP Additional Financing Project is
proposed to be financed through a new IDA grant in an amount of about US$25.0 million. The
Fertilizer Support Project is proposed to be financed through a combination of a new IDA grant in
the amount of about US$112.5 million and the redeployment of IDA resources from Ethiopia's
existing IDA portfolio in a total amount of about US$137.5 million, about US$15.0 million of
which is grant and US$122.5 credit.

Redeployment from Existing IDA Portfolio

88.    The overall size of the Ethiopia IDA portfolio consists of 28 projects with a
commitment of US$2.7 billion and about US$1.8 billion in undisbursed balances. The average



                                                    33

age of the portfolio is about 3 years. In light of the urgent current need, the Government has
proposed IDA resources be redeployed from 12 ongoing projects/programs for an estimated amount
of US$137.5 million, accounting for about 7 percent of the undisbursed balance of the portfolio (see
Annex 3 with details by project).

89.    The redeployments proposed by the Government are based on the following criteria:
(a) project savings due to exchange rate movement or changes in project costs; (b) revised
financing plans where additional donor financing or Government funding is available to reduce the
original IDA financing requirement; and (c) major restructuring, involving changes in the
development objective and/or outcome indicators, designed to improve the performance of problem
projects. The Government has avoided reallocating funds from several projects in energy and roads
sectors (comprising nearly US$1 billion in commitments), as many ICB contracts, dependent on
IDA financing, are already signed or in tendering process even though a significant amount is not
likely to be needed in the next 1-2 years. An overview of the changes proposed to the ongoing
projects is provided in Table 9 below.

90.    The restructuring of 8 of the 12 projects involve no change to development objective,
outcome indicators, or project design. Some cost savings are due to the appreciation of the SDR
against the ETB. Other cost savings arise from the projects themselves with about US$73 million
or nearly 60 percent of the proposed reallocation from projects with closing dates within the next 12
months. It is unlikely that this amount can disburse within the current implementation period and
the projects are on track to achieve their broad objectives.

91.    The restructuring also involves 4 projects that will be restructured through changes to
the PDO, cancellation of components, and changes to the implementation arrangements.
These projects include the Post Secondary Education Project, the ICT Assisted Development
Project, as well as two projects that are most directly related to agriculture and food security: the
RCBP with a proposed IDA redeployment of US$13 million and the FSP with a significant cost
savings for reallocation of US$35 million.

92.     Redeployments of IDA resources that affect projects supporting agriculture growth,
food security and the vulnerable are not contradictory to the broad objective of the proposed
operation. As noted in the description of each specific project in Annex 3, the projects will still be
able to meet their objectives though IDA resources will be cancelled. In the case of the projects
that are subject to major restructuring, namely the FSP and the RCBP, the reallocated funds are
partly due to exchange rate fluctuations (SDR/ETB) that have resulted in extra resources, and are
not required to meet the objectives of the projects. Both projects have cost savings, partly from
exchange rate and partly from a simplification and reduction of their scope. The Bank, working
with several other donors, is aiming at strengthening the support for both safety net programs and
for agricultural growth and rural development through new operations in FY10.55 In the case of the
Irrigation and Drainage and the HIV/AIDS projects, the Government has made a commitment to
replace the necessary IDA funds that were intended for local costs of the projects with budget
resources.      The reallocated IDA funds in the amount of US$10 million and US$5 million,
respectively, will be replaced by an equivalent increase commitment in counterpart funds. The
source of financing should not affect achievement of the project objectives.

93.     The proposed restructuring of the portfolio also fits well with the country strategy,
which stresses streamlining the portfolio to: (a) focus on a small number of operations that would
supply the bulk of the resources for the priority sectors, complemented by a few projects to
introduce innovation or to support one-off activities; (b) move toward sector-wide, programmatic,
and multi-donor interventions as much as possible; and (c) ensure that each intervention is
resourced adequately. Currently the portfolio is large with 28 projects. Because many older
operations have not closed in a timely manner, the number of projects in the portfolio has increased
significantly in the last few years.            The GFRP provides the Government and the Bank an
opportunity to bring a number of operations to timely closure, and move the overall structure of the
portfolio to the direction set out in the CAS. The Government is also keen to promote greater donor
harmonization by encouraging donors to support the Government's own sector-level plan in a
programmatic fashion, rather than continuing with a large number of projects.                                                               For instance,
Ethiopia is the first country to sign a country-level memorandum of understanding with donors for


55The CAS envisions an agricultural development operation in FY10 to focus on agricultural growth and catalyze
support from other donors for a more harmonized support for agricultural growth. It also includes Phase III of the
Productive Safety Nets APL, to strengthen further the safety net program for the chronically food insecure with
particular attention to ensuring provision of support to take those households beyond subsistence. Finally, the CAS
anticipates a scaling up of Sustainable Land Management Project, which had significant impact on agriculture
productivity.

                                        H. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

Economic Analysis

94.     The economic benefits of the PSNP Additional Financing result from the impact of
transfers on households and from the value of community assets created through the public
works component. First, the PSNP contributes to the reduction of extreme hunger and
malnutrition. The provision of grants to chronically food-insecure households ensures that short-
term consumption shortfalls are met, avoiding the sale of productive assets, which are central to
both improving current food-insecurity (such as avoiding selling oxen that are used for farm
production) and to reducing the inter-generational transmission of food insecurity (by avoiding the
need to remove children from school to supplement household income or to reduce consumption
that can lead to increased malnutrition). A recent study on the PSNP found that between 2006 and
2008 real income changed by 59.1 percent and 52.5 percent for public works and direct support
beneficiaries respectively. At the same time non-PSNP beneficiary household income, in the same
communities, fell by 20 percent in real terms. The study finds that this difference in income growth
is attributable to the Program.56 It finds a similar, although less marked impact on assets.

95.     Second, by providing households with predictable transfers over several years,
program support is expected to lead to an increased willingness to adopt higher risk/return
strategies with regard to household production decisions. This allows increased investment in
inputs and seeds and also an increased readiness to access other opportunities for livelihood
diversification available through credit.

96.     Third, the Program supports the rehabilitation of the environment by adopting an
integrated watershed management planning approach in the public works component that focuses
on soil and water conservation measures. These include terracing, bunding, gully control, area
closures, reforestation, small scale irrigation, and water harvesting.                      It is expected that these
measures will, in turn, lead to improved agricultural productivity.

97.     Finally, the PSNP has reduced isolation and improved access to basic public services
through the building of rural feeder roads, repair and construction of schools and health clinics, and
by making safe drinking water available. These activities are integrated into the larger woreda
development planning process. Infrastructure such as schools and health posts have had significant
impacts, with one in four households stating that children not previously attending school now do
so as a result of schools built or extended under the PSNP. The access roads under PSNP now
constitute the largest road-building program in Ethiopia, with 92 percent of households in PSNP
woredas reporting that PSNP roads have benefited them.57

98.      The economic benefits of the Fertilizer Support Project are also positive. Fertilizer use
has significant production and income impacts. This also holds for Ethiopia where fertilizer
application, while still at low levels, has increased rapidly. Fertilizer is estimated to be applied on
about 45 percent of cultivated area.58 Many farmers have been applying fertilizer for years and
fertilizer consumption has increased, without access to any significant subsidy, indicating the
benefits of doing so. If the project does not provide the necessary foreign exchange to import
fertilizer, millions of farmers who have used this technology for many years will not have the
choice whether to apply it or not. The economic analysis in Annex 2 G assesses how, given
established fertilizer technologies, price changes might affect the profitability of fertilizer use. It
also makes a more comprehensive assessment of the net returns of fertilizer use. In addition to
price incentives based on the number of units of output required to purchase one unit of fertilizer
nutrient, these net benefits largely depend on the yield response per unit of fertilizer nutrient.
Aggregate and farm-level methodologies are discussed. For a summary see Box 4.

99.      An assessment of the price ratio between fertilizer/nutrient and agricultural output
shows that current price ratios are more favorable than in the past. Output prices have
increased even faster than fertilizer prices ­ and projections of these price ratios are also well within
historical level for most assumptions. Given fertilizer nutrient-grain price ratios of 4-7 for maize in
Ethiopia that have prevailed over the past decade, the value cost ratio to farmers comfortably
exceeds the minimum of 2 generally considered necessary for wide adoption of fertilizer.

100. Many parameters including the domestic fertilizer demand estimates are subject to
significant uncertainties.           Precise estimates of future fertilizer demand in Ethiopia are very
challenging. Future prices do not only depend on a standard demand and supply framework, but
also to a significant extent on farmer's forward looking expectations, which are critically dependent
on (unpredictable) rainfall patterns, domestic and international price levels and their volatility, and
market information. The last couple of years and in particular also the last few months have show
substantial price fluctuations in world markets. This means significant uncertainties about the
development of fertilizer prices and quantities, and how they will prevail by the time farmers
making a decision about input use. A deterioration (increase) in the cereal-to-fertilizer ratios would
reduce (increase) domestic demand for fertilizer, and this might imply that domestic demand is less
than MOARD's most conservative estimate of about 550,000 tons.59 However, even if the 2009
aggregate fertilizer demand was lower than this estimate, additional financing support would still be
needed (see Annex 2 F for more details).

 Box 3: Summary of Economic Returns and Risks to Fertilizer Use in Ethiopia

 The economic analysis, as outlined in Annex 2 G, analyzes changes in fertilizer-output price ratios and
 documents production impacts at the aggregate and at the household level as well as using farm models. It
 draws from secondary sources and data, complemented by a farm level analysis, using current data on input
 and output prices.



58While no recent representative household survey on fertilizer use is available, 45 percent of smallholders used
fertilizer in 2005. Combined with the fact that fertilizer use has increase rapidly since then and a 45 percent share of
cultivated land under fertilizer, more than half of all farmers in Ethiopia are likely to have used fertilizer this year.
59550,000 tons is a 25 percent increase in terms of import quantity over 2007/08. However, according to MOARD's
record, stocks in the last (2007/08) season declined by about 50,000 tons, so that the actual projected utilization
increase is only about 12 percent.



                                                             37

 The price of cereals has increased faster than that for fertilizer, making its application more profitable than
 in the recent past (which already showed increased fertilizer use in Ethiopia).

 At the aggregate level, fertilizer production elasticities are estimated to be in the order of up to 0.12. A
 hypothetical 10 percent decrease in fertilizer application would therefore result in a 1.2 percent production
 loss in agricultural output. But the production impacts under Ethiopia's food crisis scenario are far from
 marginal.    The project will support about 50 percent of total national fertilizer consumption, which
 otherwise would not be available. In the without project scenario, due to the non-availability of fertilizer,
 aggregate agricultural output could decline by as much as 6 percent,

 At the household level, a comparison of households with and without fertilizer use show that cereal yields
 under normal rainfall conditions tend to be systematically higher when fertilizers are used. Historic survey
 data shows that the average production impact at the household level can reach up to 40 percent.

 At the farm level, using crop models for the "typical" farm households in relatively high potential areas in
 the Amhara region, the above findings are confirmed.             Under favorable rainfall patterns, fertilizer
 application could generate significant financial benefits. Simulations under current input and output prices
 show that these are in the order of about US$200 for the farm household, or about ETB40 per family labor
 day. By contrast, assuming bad rainfall patterns with a production loss of about 20 percent, the use of
 fertilizer will result in financial losses of up to ETB120 per family labor day.

 In summary, fertilizer use increases production and is profitable under current price scenarios (and trends).
 However, fertilizer use also increases risks. For example, under poor rainfall conditions, with 20 percent
 rainfall below the median rainfall level, the use of fertilizer becomes economically unprofitable, in
 particular for teff. Farmers take this risk into account. The majority of the fertilizer is applied in more
 reliable rainfall zones.


101. Supply response to fertilizer application (or, in the scenario at hand, to non-
application) and its profitability have been shown to be positive for average years in many
studies. On-farm yield response to fertilizer on maize, one of the most commonly fertilized crops
average about 15 kg in East and Southern Africa. A household level analysis based on limited
sample data from Christiaensen and Demery (2007) suggests that average output value minus
fertilizer and credit costs is about 40 percent higher with than without fertilizer. Farm-model
analysis based on data from the Amhara Region show average returns to fertilizer use of ETB40 per
family labor day. At the aggregate level a 10 percent decrease in fertilizer use has been estimated
to lead to a decrease in total agricultural output of about 1.2 percent. This suggests that the impact
of not importing a significant share of fertilizer demanded (e.g. assuming about half of total
consumption) would reduce agricultural growth by perhaps 6 percentage points, a halving of the
current double-digit agricultural growth rate.

102. There are, however, also significant risks associated with the application of fertilizer,
mainly arising from weather-induced shocks. As is shown in Annex 2 G, these shocks reduce
production impacts and can result in negative returns to fertilizer use. Already in years with a
20 percent shortfall in rainfalls, returns to fertilizer use have been shown to be negative. This risk
is significant; however, about two thirds of the farm population resides in reliable rainfall zones
where most of the fertilizer is used.

103. Other risk, as discussed above, stem mainly from price risks. For example, MOARD's
demand estimate might be excessive or, given the recently decreasing international fertilizer prices,
MOARD might be inclined to import an even greater amount. This could results in an increase of



                                                        38

fertilizer stocks and, consequently, inefficiencies. However, the risk is mitigated given the foreign
exchange constraints and resistance from importers and distributors to engage in fertilizer tenders in
the light of overstocking.

104. Delays in the domestic fertilizer distribution system can result in inefficiencies in
fertilizer application.     Some evidence from household surveys in recent years suggests that
inefficient use of fertilizer may lead to negative profits (World Bank, 2006). Growing use of
fertilizer in more marginal areas, lagging adoption of improved seed, late delivery of fertilizer, and
poor extension have been identified as factors affecting efficiency. Over the past three years, the
Government has made concerted efforts to reduce these inefficiencies, especially in massively
scaling up extension, improving timeliness of fertilizer delivery, and developing a five-year action
plan to increase use of improved seed. Further progress can be made, including through careful
monitoring and evaluation under the proposed Project.

105. The macro-economic impact is positive as the operation will help to ensure that
agricultural production will remain near its trend and will reduce domestic borrowing.
Preventing agricultural production in the next crop season from significant decline due to non-
availability of fertilizer will have a positive impact on food availability and will tend to reduce food
inflation. The poor net-consumers of food, in particular, will therefore also benefit from the
proposed Project. In addition, the Project's impact on decreasing domestic government borrowing
means that no new money is created in the system and that the operation is fiscally neutral or
positive.

Technical

106. The Project poses no technical challenges per se. The PSNP has been under satisfactory
implementation since 2005.         There is a Program Implementation Manual (PIM) and related
Operational Summary and detailed subject-specific guidelines on beneficiary targeting, community
based participatory integrated watershed management, financial management, procurement, and
monitoring and evaluation.       The PIM is periodically revised to reflect lessons learned during
implementation. There is a functioning M&E system with a strong emphasis on impact evaluation.
Government continues to conduct annual training programs on the different guidelines using a
cascade training approach. Perhaps most significant of these has been the annual community based
participatory integrated watershed management training, which is delivered annually to over 11,000
Development Agents. The Program continues to receive strong technical input and supervision.
Several joint Government-donor working groups focus on the development of different elements of
the Program, including capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, public works, and pastoralist
safety nets. There are bi-weekly joint coordination committee meetings and bi-annual joint review
and implementation support missions.

107. With regard to the Fertilizer Support Project, the importation, distribution, and on-
farm application of fertilizers is well established in Ethiopia. While many different aspects are
associated with this process, ranging from the transport logistics and communications to applying
the right nutrient amounts and ensuring the supply of complementary inputs, these are not new and
have been undertaken for many years. The modifications of the procurement procedures discussed
and agreed with the Government do not pose any technical difficulties.                Efficiency in the
distribution system could be improved as capacity constraints exist and it is expected that the M&E


                                                   39

Component will generate additional knowledge to further develop and improve the importation,
distribution, and application of fertilizers.

Fiduciary

108. With regard to the PSNP Additional Financing Project, just as with the PSNP parent project,
the overall financial management responsibility rests with MOFED. The Bureaus of Finance and
Economic Development (BOFEDs), at the regional level, and the Woreda Offices of Finance and
Economic Development (WOFEDs) are responsible for recording and reporting the financial
transactions of the program. MOFED has around 800 accountants and cashiers for the PSNP,
particularly at woreda level to improve program financial management. The team continues to
observe some weaknesses particularly concerning delays in financial reporting and submission of
audited program accounts. Further details are presented in Annex 1 D.

109. PSNP Procurement involving major packages under ICB is handled at federal level but most
of the procurements are for small value public works and purchases that are conducted at Regional
and woreda level. A procurement manual with clear guidelines has been prepared for the PSNP and
procurement training provided at every level. However procurement at all levels has been subject to
delays and procurement performance remains moderately satisfactory. Procurement efficiency
under APL II has improved after the recruitment of a qualified and experienced Procurement
Specialist under the Food Security Program Department (FSPD) and the recruitment of Regional
Procurement Coordinators at the regional level.

110. With regard to the Fertilizer Support Project, the team reviewed the financial
management and disbursement arrangements. The FFPC under MOARD regulates fertilizer
imports and allocates the necessary foreign exchange to the importer who has obtained the
evaluated lowest bid from a foreign supplier.       The Agricultural Products Marketing Sector
(Department) of MOARD, which is the secretariat of FFPC, supervises the procurement process by
reviewing the bid evaluation and allocates foreign exchange subject to obtaining a conformed copy
of the supply contract after signature for subsequent follow up to verify the quality and quantity of
fertilizer imports. MOARD will be responsible for implementing the Project and will ensure
compliance with accounting and internal control, financial reporting, and external audit
requirements. For more details see Annex 2 D.

111. The arrangements for fertilizer procurement have been found to generally meet the
requirements for transparency, economy and efficiency.            The Government through FFPC
regulates fertilizer imports and allocates the necessary foreign exchange to the lowest bid(s)
received by a domestic importer from a foreign supplier. The Bank's procurement guidelines
apply.    Several provisions have been introduced to ensure transparency and adequate control
mechanisms are in place, including that the Bank has reviewed the bidding documents, and the
Bank's policies on Fraud and Corruption, as well as the right to inspection and audit, apply. The
selection of consultants to undertake the study under the M&E component will be according to the
Bank's Guidelines and MOARD has the capacity to implement this process. For more details see
Annex 2 C.

Social and Poverty Impact

112. The proposed Program is expected to have significant positive social and poverty
impacts. It targets large parts of the population that are believed to be most vulnerable given the
food and macro-economic crisis and the various measures in place or planned outside of this
project: the 7.3 million chronically food-insecure people under the PSNP and the millions of
smallholder farmers relying on fertilizer to boost their agricultural production and ensure food
security and income.

113. The PSNP Additional Financing Project will help to ensure that the livelihoods of the
PSNP beneficiaries are not threatened by the funding gap that has been created by the
current food crisis. This funding gap threatens to weaken the safety net in (early) 2009 just as the
beneficiaries have struggled to overcome the crisis this year. Ensuring that all of the necessary
households continue to be covered adequately by the program will therefore make a very important
contribution to reducing poverty now, as well as avoiding destitution in the future.

114. The social impacts of the Fertilizer Support Project are also expected to be highly
positive. Without access to fertilizer, the millions of small-holder farmers who regularly apply
modern production technologies to boost agricultural production and, hence, feed their families and
generate income, would be deprived of their choice.                    The consequence would be decreased
profitability and more severe poverty and, in many cases, food insecurity, malnutrition, and
increased dependence on food aid.               Likely more than half of Ethiopia's smallholders, about
6.7 million households with around 35 million, are threatened by the country's lack of foreign
exchange to import fertilizer. While most of these smallholders are slightly better-off than the
PSNP beneficiaries, as they do not live in the most marginal area but in areas with reasonable
production potential, they are nevertheless poor. The simulated impact of the unavailability of
fertilizer is an increase in the rural headcount of as much as 5 percentage points.60

115. The social impact of Ethiopia not having sufficient fertilizer for the 2009 production
season extends beyond the farmers that actually use fertilizer. A reduced agricultural
production in the country would affect everyone through food shortages, the negative impact on
food inflation and Ethiopia's trade balance. This holds in particular the poor, about half of which
might be net buyers of food.61

116. The Project is unlikely to cause any adverse social impact. The project will not seek to
target distribution of the fertilizer to any particular group, since no subsidy is involved. Farmers
will procure through their cooperatives and other existing channels of distribution and will be able
to make purchasing decisions, including on the fertilizer quantities, taking into consideration prices
and other factors.




60This is a rough estimate based on an average US$200 loss from not applying fertilizer, as detailed in Annex 2G. Note
that household impacts are likely to vary with a number of variables including land holding size and weather patterns.
61Based on data from 2000, Ethiopia's poor are 22.3 percent urban (net buyers) and 30.1 percent smallholders net
buyers. See World Development Report (2008).



                                                          41

Environmental and Safeguard Policies

117. One of the key objectives of the PSNP is to address the underlying causes of food
insecurity, to which land degradation is universally agreed to be a major contributor,
particularly in highland areas. Thus the design of the PSNP public works program is intended to
have environmentally positive impacts. Indeed, these activities, which include, for example, soil
and water conservation, land reclamation and improvement of community infrastructure, are
expected to constitute a vehicle for significant environmental transformation and enhanced
productivity.

118. It is nonetheless common knowledge that past mass-mobilization efforts in
environmental rehabilitation in Ethiopia have frequently failed or have been abandoned, as a
result of which the environment has returned to its degraded state. Such adverse outcomes occur
particularly if their locations or designs do not follow good environmental practice, or if they are
incompatible with optimum overall management of the watershed.

119. To address such issues, the approach to the environmental performance and
sustainability of the public works program is three-pronged:

(i)    Public works are derived from a community-based approach to integrated watershed
       management, a process which forms the basis of the awareness-creation and training
       program, supported by a budget to provide technical and material inputs. Moreover, the
       PSNP public works are also viewed as contributing to the Nile Basin Initiative;

(ii)   Standards to be followed in the design and implementation of the individual public
       works are established in Community-Based Watershed Management guidelines published
       by the MOARD, which are made available to concerned woreda staff and Development
       Agents; and

(iii)  The process of selection and screening of public works for possible negative
       environmental impacts is in accordance with Ethiopia's Environmental Impact
       Assessment proclamation. The process is documented in the Environmental and Social
       Management Framework (ESMF) produced by the Government. The ESMF, produced by
       Government and disclosed under APL II, is incorporated in the awareness-creation and
       training programs. Responsibilities for its implementation and monitoring are designated at
       federal, regional, woreda and kebele levels in the ESMF: Implementation Guidelines. In
       addition, joint government-donor 6-monthly public works reviews are conducted, which
       include monitoring of ESMF implementation, followed by corrective measures if required.

120. With regard to the on-going PSNP, three safeguard policies were triggered at the time
of project approval including EA Policy OP 4.01, Pest Management Policy OP 4.09, and the
International Waterways Policy OP 7.50. Of these the most significant to ongoing
implementation is EA Policy OP 4.01, which has been addressed by the development, disclosure
and implementation of an ESMF. This is designed to ensure that public works involving any form
of physical relocation of residents or involuntary loss of assets or access to assets are not approved
under the PSNP. Public works within, or in the vicinity of, a cultural heritage site, including
community sites of cultural importance, are avoided whenever possible. If the site cannot be


                                                  42

avoided, the matter is referred to the regional EPA for further examination and subsequent
modification or disapproval of the public works. In addition, the ESMF screening process, which is
mandatory for all public works, assesses and minimizes potential impacts such as increased
pressures on human settlement, disturbance to religious sites, increased social tensions over asset
allocation, and the capacity to enforce measures such as the prohibition of open grazing. In order to
address projects that might include the renovation or extension of medical clinics in the public
works program, the government's Waste Management Guide for Rural Health Clinics is published
and disclosed, in accordance with OP 4.01. In addition, as mentioned above, the government Guide
for Integrated Pest Management in Small-Scale Irrigation Schemes is published and disclosed, in
accordance with OP 4.09. Regarding OP 7.50 (International Waterways), the government and
World Bank notified the concerned countries in accordance with this policy, covering the five-year
period of APL I and APL II. Being limited to small, community-level schemes, water abstraction
rates are still well within the notified levels.

121. The environmental impact of the Fertilizer Support Project is expected to be positive.
Ethiopia's soils are nutrient-depleted in many areas and lack the capacity to generate sufficient
biomass to serve the needs of the population and its livestock. While better farming and land
management practices have to be at the center of a strategy to overcome this situation, a sharp drop
in fertilizer in the coming production season would lead to further nutrient-depletion with negative
consequences on productivity and, hence, overexploitation of marginal lands and other natural
resources. Fertilizer applications are still at low levels in Ethiopia and other agro-chemicals are
even less frequently used by small-holder farmers.

122. Adverse environmental impacts are likely to be small, but possible.                 In particular,
improper storage, use and application of pre-treated seeds and other planting materials and
inorganic fertilizers may lead to adverse environmental and health impacts. There exist a critical
mass of capacity within MOARD and at the federal, regional, woreda and kebele levels to manage
the environmental safeguard and provide effective extension support to farmers and pastoralists in
the application of inorganic fertilizers and pre-treated seeds.    At and below the woreda level
throughout the country there are well-trained subject matter specialists and development agents
(extension agents) whose principal responsibilities include serving as the link between research and
farmers, bringing innovative technologies to farmers, and advising farmers on the rational use of
agrochemicals including inorganic fertilizers as well as adoption of integrated pest management
approaches.      The guidelines on the application of fertilizers prepared by MOARD and its
collaborating agencies such as the Federal Environmental Protection Authority (FEPA) serve as a
useful tool in delivering extension service to farmers on the proper use of fertilizers.

123. From an environmental and social safeguard standpoint, the proposed Fertilizer
Support Project is Category B. This suggests that environmental and social impacts of the
project, for the most part, will be minimal, site-specific and manageable to an acceptable level. The
proposed Program triggers two safeguard policies: The Environmental Assessment Policy (OP
4.01); and the Pest Management Policy (OP 4.09), predicated on program objectives to increase
agricultural production and productivity.

Since this project is being processed under rapid response procedures of OP/BP 8.00,
MOARD in collaboration with FEPA will undertake a quick environmental and social
assessment and prepare a management plan acceptable to the Bank within two months after


                                                  43

effectiveness of the Fertilizer Support Project. A consultant will support the Government in its
efforts (see para. 84). The preparation will include consultation of key stakeholders including
farmers, farmer cooperatives and their unions, and other importers. This assessment will assist in
determining whether OP 4.10 is triggered. It will have, as attachment, simple guidance notes for
safe management of the fertilizer consignment expected to arrive in the country, compliance
monitoring arrangements and mechanisms, relevant institutional capacity building measures as well
as relevant environmental awareness creation and training programs.                 The Project will be
implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Environmental and Social Management Plan.


                                     I. BENEFITS AND RISKS

124. The benefits and risks of the proposed operation have to be judged within the wider country
context and the broader Bank's commitment to assist the Government in its efforts to achieve
immediate and long-term food security and agricultural growth.

Benefits

125. The provision of timely, flexible support to Ethiopia will assist the Government with an
immediate response to the food crisis.           As discussed in Section H, the provision of quick
disbursing financing will enable the Government to: (i) continue support through the PSNP, at
current levels, to the most vulnerable food insecure households, thereby ensuring that there is not
increased destitution as a result of the current crisis; and (ii) ensure that necessary amount of
fertilizers are available for the next agricultural production season. This will increase the likelihood
that a recurrence of the current food crisis in 2009 will be avoided. Moreover, given that domestic
food prices are currently well above their import parity price ­ with lack of foreign exchange
appearing to be the main obstacle to arbitrage imports ­ the proposed operation might have a
dampening immediate effect on food inflation.

126. The impact of the Program in terms of economic returns, on social aspects and poverty,
and on the environment is expected to be overwhelmingly positive. The PSNP is a well
established safety net program in its fourth year of implementation. Independent impact evaluations
have shown that the program is having a demonstrable and significant effect on beneficiary-
household income and assets. Ensuring that all of the necessary households continue to be covered
adequately by the program will therefore make a very important contribution to reducing poverty
now, as well as avoiding destitution in the future.

127. Similarly, without timely access to fertilizer, millions of smallholder farmers will be
faced with reduced agricultural production, reduced income and the risk of food insecurity,
malnutrition, and increased dependence on food aid. The primary beneficiaries of the Fertilizer
Support Project are smallholder farmers.62 While they do not belong to the poorest strata of
society, i.e. those being supported under the PSNP, these farmers are still poor and vulnerable and
are likely to fall into poverty without access to fertilizer and related production-enhancing
agricultural practices. Reduced agricultural production will also lead to overall increased food



62Smallholder farmers make up about 98 percent of agricultural production in Ethiopia and almost all fertilizer
procured through the FFPC/MOARD tender procedure is used by smallholders.



                                                    44

shortages and food inflation with negative impact for all Ethiopians, in particular poor net-food
buyers.

128. The Fertilizer Support Project will have a monitoring and evaluation component that
will increase the understanding of the economics, inefficiencies, and capacity limitations of the
fertilizer system under the current rapidly changing setting, in particular of prices.        This is
particularly important as past analyses have pointed to economic inefficiencies of fertilizer use,
including those that are closely related to a lack of improved seeds and other complementary inputs
such as credit and irrigation as well as a poor agricultural extension system. However, tremendous
changes have occurred just over the last few years, and the policy and institutional issues are
complex.

129. In terms of its macro- and fiscal impact, the Fertilizer Support Project will be inflation
neutral and fiscally positive. The PSNP Additional Financing, at US$25 million, is a relatively
small component, which may contribute to some additional pressure on prices in PSNP
administrated areas, though the overall impact is likely to be modest. Since the bulk of the money
will be used for import of fertilizers, it will therefore not put added pressure on domestic aggregate
demand. But, to the extent this operation will contribute to an expectation of better harvests in
2009, it can be expected to have a moderating effect on inflationary expectations. In terms of its
fiscal impact, the proposed project will be positive by helping the Government to borrow less from
domestic sources.

130. The project will contribute to addressing recurrent food insecurity in the Horn of
Africa by helping to strengthen food production in Ethiopia over the coming seasons. Decent
crops in the areas of greater and more reliable rainfall within the region will make it easier to
supply the least food secure areas, mainly the pastoral areas of Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti, both
through local market transactions and through locally sourced food aid. This is particularly
important, given the difficult situation and high levels of food insecurity not just in Ethiopia, but
also neighboring countries.

Risks and Mitigation

131. Country Risks. The proposed Program will be implemented in an overall risky country
environment. In particular, Ethiopia is in a difficult macro-economic situation and while the high
risks from this are being mitigated through active engagement between the Government and the
Bank as well as the IMF, the risks remain substantial. The uncertain global financial situation
contributes to this risky environment in Ethiopia. Other substantial country-level risks include
those related to weather shocks and their impact on the overall economy and food security, as well
as governance and security issues. These risks have to be taken into account and are being mitigated
through continuous engagement. More program-specific risks relate to the following:

132. Timing and Delays. The impact of the Fertilizer Component is dependent on ensuring that
the bulk of the fertilizers are procured by December 2008, and there are some risks from delays.
The risks of delays from the Ethiopian administration are low due to a strong Government support
and established import and distribution procedures.          There is risk of delays in the fertilizer
distribution system as the capacity of the stakeholders involved is limited. However, given the
urgency to increase production, there will be a concerted effort by the Government working with


                                                    45

the distribution sector to ensure timely availability of fertilizer to farmers. The existing distribution
system will be used, and significant organizational changes are neither required nor practical. The
procedures with respect to the distribution system will be closely monitored as part of this
operation, so that mitigating measures can be taken should problems be observed.

133. Economics of Fertilizer Use. Prices of crops and agricultural inputs including fertilizer
have increased to historically very high levels, and are still changing rapidly. This price risk
translates into two main outcomes. First, farmers applying high-priced fertilizer may not achieve
the productivity level nor obtain the output prices necessary to be profitable. Second, due to high
input prices and uncertainty of output prices farmers might not demand the expected fertilizer
amounts.    Potential mitigation activities include price information dissemination through the
Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) and information collected under the M&E Component
disseminated; and, as the fertilizer imported is tendered in batches, later batches can be reduced
accordingly.

134. Inadequate M&E System. A M&E system is important not just for assessing the success of
the operation, i.e. `ex-post', but reliably tracking the import and distribution of fertilizer (and
complementary inputs) on a timely ("real-time") basis is also crucial to make possible policy
adjustments during the 2008/09 implementation season and, hence, for the success of the operation
itself. Experience from other projects show that there is a risk that the M&E system might be of
limited scope, rigor, and independence. However, this risk was discussed and the Government
made a firm commitment to the M&E Component during negotiations, mitigating this risk. In
particular, risks would be mitigated by agreeing on a representative rural household survey
capturing major features of the distributional and cost-benefit structure of the fertilizer and input
market supply system, including those of the cooperatives.

135. Weather. A drought would seriously affect the supply response to fertilizer application. In
this case, the purchase and application of fertilizers may have little production effect in marginal
areas and negative welfare impact for farmers that purchased fertilizer. While DAP remains in the
soil for longer and will still have some positive impact in the following season, the impact of urea
will be largely lost. Clearly, this risk exists and is taken into account by farmers every production
season. An overview of the most recent rainfall patterns and forecasts is presented in Box 4.

Box 4: Rainfall Patterns in Later 2008

Over the last few months, performance of rains in most parts of the country has improved, though some parts
of the country have seen continuing drought, including Somali, belg benefiting lowlands of Oromia, Afar
and pocket areas in Eastern Tigray. Satellite based crop estimates such as the Netherlands-based EARS
Earth and Environment Monitoring, and monitoring reports from the field, indicate that harvests from the
meher production season will likely be average for most of the western parts of the country, while a below-
average harvest is anticipated in the country's eastern parts. This, together with FEWS NET rain forecasts
until December 2008 provide the basis for cautious optimism for the country's overall situation; however,
unusual rains during the time of harvest, as experience in later October and early November raise some new
concerns. For most of the meher-dependent crop producing areas, located in the Central, Western, and
Northwestern highlands, forecasts indicate normal to above-normal rainfall conditions. While these rains are
secondary for agricultural production, they can be crucial for the replenishment of water points, which in
turn are critical in Ethiopia's main crop producing areas.




The forecasts also indicate the geographical spread and risks. The forecasts show that agro-pastoral areas in
Southern Ethiopia may face severe challenges due to poor rain, potentially increasing humanitarian needs.
As Ethiopia's agriculture is largely rainfed, the rainfall patterns are crucial for Ethiopia's food security ­ and
are also so for the success of the fertilizer operation proposed under the Food Crisis Response Program.
However, no weather forecasts for the 2009 kiremt rains are currently available.

136. Experience indicates that usually only parts of the country are affected by a serious drought
and the risk of an overall negative impact for all farmers using fertilizer and for the country as a
whole is only modest. This risk is mitigated through a number of ongoing Government and donor
initiatives that are addressing weather risks. Measures being developed, tested, and extended
include drought-resistant seed varieties, index-based weather insurance, and the improvement of
meteorological data and its dissemination. However, the development and implementation of these
measures requires time and their impact in the next season will be limited. A drought would also
have a large impact on the food insecure households supported under the PSNP. Should this occur,
mitigation would be partially sought, as has been the case this year, through a scaled-up response
under the PSNP itself.

137. Food-price inflation. Further high domestic food price inflation would have a significant
impact on the PSNP as the value of transfers to food insecure households would be eroded.
However, domestic cereal prices are already significantly above import parity prices.                         The



                                                       47

Government has stated its intention to continue a process, already started, of importation of cereals
until prices fall towards import parity. Moreover, the harvest over the next months should also
contribute substantially to a downward pressure on price increases. Finally, the Fertilizer Support
Project is a major risk mitigation measure to address the prospects of food inflation induced by
shortages next year. Therefore the risk of further significant domestic cereal inflation is mitigated
and modest.

138. Risk to Ongoing IDA Portfolio. Risk stems from redeployment of IDA resources from
ongoing projects. This risk is being mitigated through the careful design of the reallocations
themselves as well as a firm Government commitment to provide sufficient domestic budget funds
for project activities that are necessary to achieve the project objectives. This commitment will be
formalized as part of this operation and closely monitored by the various task teams.

 ANNEX 1 A: BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR US$25 MILLION ADDITIONAL
                                     FINANCING FOR PSNP

A. Introduction

1.      This Annex provides the background and rationale for US$25 million Additional Financing
for the Productive Safety Net Project APL II (PSNP, Project ID: P098093, Credit number: H2660),
as part of the Emergency Food Crisis Response Program. The proposed additional grant would
meet the financing gap that has emerged following the program response to the twin shocks of food
price inflation and drought in 2008. There would be no change to the original design and ongoing
activities of the project.

B. Project data and performance

2.      The PSNP APL II was approved on January 9, 2007, with a grant amount of SDR118.5
million. It is the second project in a series of three APLs. Key project data and performance are
summarized below.

                         Key Project Data & Performance of PSNP APL II
Key Project Data                               Project Performance
Grant Amount: US$175 million equivalent        Development Objectives: Satisfactory
Effectiveness date: 04/05/07                   Implementation Progress: Satisfactory
Closing date: 06/30/10                         Financial Management: Marginally Satisfactory
Current disbursements: US$132.55 million       Procurement: Marginally Satisfactory
Remaining balance: US$53.19 million            Environmental Safeguards: Marginally Satisfactory

3.      The development objective of the overall PSNP series is to contribute to reducing
household vulnerability and improving resilience to shocks. This will be achieved through
reform of the humanitarian emergency system to a development-oriented program which (i)
provides timely, predictable and adequate transfers to beneficiary households, thus allowing
effective consumption-smoothing and avoiding asset-depletion; (ii) creates productive and
sustainable community assets and contributes to large-scale rehabilitation of severely degraded
areas; (iii) stimulates local markets through demand linkages; and (iv) establishes more effective
responses to drought shocks to avoid increasing destitution among affected households. The second
APL aims to consolidate the progress made under APL I and continues to strengthen technical
capacity in all aspects of program implementation.

4.      There are three project components:

a) Component 1: Safety net grants which provide transfers to chronically food insecure
    households through (i) labor-intensive public works for those households with available labor.
    Sub-projects to be undertaken are determined locally by the beneficiary communities through
    an annual, participatory planning process that focuses on integrated watershed management, and
    (ii) direct support, which provides grants to households who are labor-poor and cannot
    undertake public works. Beneficiaries include, but are not limited to, orphans, pregnant and
    lactating mothers, elderly households, other labor-poor, high risk households with sick



                                                  49

                          ANNEX 1: PSNP ADDITIONAL FINANCING PROJECT


    individuals (such as people living with HIV/AIDS), and the majority of female-headed
    households with young children and no other available adult labor.

b) Component 2: Drought risk financing, which aims to provide timely resources for transient
    food insecure households in response to shocks within existing program areas. The component
    is financed using a contingent grant, which will provide resources for scaling-up activities under
    Component 1 in response to localized or intermediate drought in PSNP woredas.

c) Component 3: Institutional support, which supports institutional strengthening activities,
    including related management costs. It also provides funding for M&E activities, as well as
    transparency and accountability initiatives.


5.      The World Bank APL II Project is part of a much larger Government program
financed and supported by a consortium of partners including CIDA, DFID, IrishAID, EC, RNE,
SIDA, USAID, and WFP, who together have committed cash and in-kind resources valued at
around US$1.2 billion during the current phase of the Program from 2007-2009. At its current
scale, supporting around 7.3 million beneficiaries, the PSNP represents one of the largest social
protection initiatives in Africa. The donor group has pooled its financing, both in cash and food.
Several partners have provided their support as co-financing to the World Bank APL II Project.

6.      Progress     in   implementation       is   positive.  The    "Development     Objective"   and
"Implementation Progress" have been consistently rated as "satisfactory" in all previous ISRs. The
IEG rating for APL I was "satisfactory" and the QAG rating for quality at entry for APL II was
"satisfactory". These ratings reflect (i) the underlying progress in delivering transfers to
beneficiaries on a timely and predicable basis, and (ii) the value of outputs under the public works
program, which are increasingly assessed as being of good quality. In 2008, 80 percent of public
works projects are estimated to have reached satisfactory technical standards and sustainability
ratings.63 In the case of both transfers and public works there is a consistent improvement in
implementation over time.

7.      Yet challenges clearly remain. Despite dramatic improvements in the timeliness of
transfers, delays still exist in distribution of resources to beneficiaries. In the case of public works
securing operations and maintenance for all projects such as roads and water projects remains a
challenge. These issues are the subject of ongoing dialogue with Government and are being actively
addressed in improved project management procedures and training. Challenges in implementation
are also evidenced by a number of "marginally satisfactory" ratings in the last ISR. With regard to
financial management, although there have been notable improvements year-on-year and there are
currently no overdue audits, delays in receipt of IFRs and audit reports, and lack of consistent
follow-up on recommendations of audit reports remain a concern. Procurement is also subject to
delays. But again this has shown improvement. The rating for environmental safeguards reflects
delays in implementing environmental screening for all public works projects. This has steadily
improved and the related rating is likely to be upgraded during the ongoing PSNP Mid-term
Review.

8.       Key project legal covenants have been complied with, although as noted above, in the
case of financial management this is often with some delay.

9.       There is strong evidence of program impact. Although the full impact assessment for the
project is not due until January, 2009, interim assessments based on household surveys and a
sampling of public works projects provide important insights. The outcome indicator for the
project is "the % change in beneficiary household assets and income". Between 2006 and 2008 a
recent study found a change in real income of 59.1 percent and 52.5 percent for public works and
direct support beneficiaries respectively.              At the same time non-PSNP beneficiary household
income, in the same communities, fell by 20 percent in real terms. The study finds that this
difference in income growth is attributable to the program.64 It finds a similar, although less
marked impact on assets.

10.      With regard to public works, the initial findings of the ongoing public works impact
assessment are encouraging. Most soil and water conservation projects are found to be effective,
ranging from 69 percent of check dams, to 100 percent of water-retaining trenches and area
closures. Infrastructure such as schools and health posts have had significant impacts, with one in
four households stating that children not previously attending school now do so as a result of
schools built or extended under the PSNP. The access roads under PSNP now constitute the largest
road-building program in Ethiopia, 92 percent of households in PSNP woredas reporting that PSNP
roads have benefited them.

11.      The positive evidence on implementation and impact is supported by household
perceptions of the program65. Citizens widely acknowledge that (i) the program is fair in
identifying beneficiaries and allocating support; 87 percent of respondents reported that the PSNP
selection process was fair; (ii) the program is transparent and inclusive in its operation; 74 percent
of respondents either "strongly agreed" or "somewhat agreed" that they had been provided with
good opportunities to provide input on PSNP selection decisions; and (iii) it is efficient and helpful
to communities in the projects it supports; 97 percent of respondents considered previously
completed PSNP projects useful to the community. In sum, overall satisfaction with the PSNP is
very high; some 83 percent of respondents report being either "strongly" or "generally satisfied"
with the program. It is important to note however that beneficiary perceptions confirm the
challenges in implementation noted above; only 60 percent of beneficiaries report receiving their
payments on time and possible evidence of underpayment of transfers will be subject to further
study.

C. Causes of the cost overrun

12.      There are two causes of the cost overrun; both are related to the impacts of the food
price inflation and drought which hit Ethiopia in 2008. These are discussed below and are
summarized in the table below.

64The income analysis discounts income received from the PSNP directly, which is therefore not included in these
calculations. The difference in income is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Source: Devereux et al. (2008) ;

                            ANNEX 1: PSNP ADDITIONAL FINANCING PROJECT



13.     Firstly, food price inflation in Ethiopia, as noted in the program document has been
exceedingly high. Food price inflation, which stood at 81.1 percent in the 12 months ending
September 2008, has far exceeded overall inflation. However, there has now been a modest decline
since the inflation peak in July 2008 (91.7 percent). The high food inflation is mainly attributed to
the rise in the cereal prices which have increased by 157 percent during the 12 months ending
September 2008. The largest increases are among the cereals that have been relatively cheaper and
consequently, largely consumed by low income households.66 The price of maize rose 261.1
percent in the 12 months ending July, 2008. The impact at household level of this unprecedented
food price inflation was greatly exacerbated by the ultimately failed March to May 2008 belg (small
season) rains, which resulted in drought conditions throughout the southern and eastern parts of
Ethiopia, as well as areas in the highlands. The combination of these twin shocks had a devastating
impact on household food security, much of it concentrated in existing program areas.

14.     In order to support households in coping with these shocks, Government and donor
partners agreed that further support should be given to existing PSNP beneficiaries to ensure
their food consumption until the next harvest in October, 2008. Additional transfers were given
through the program to affected households, mostly in-kind although some were provided in cash.
This was given to all affected beneficiaries, but was concentrated in "hotspot" areas, designated as
such based on evidence of severely deteriorating food security and rapidly rising malnutrition. A
total of 4.43 million of the Program's 7.35 million beneficiaries received additional support in
2008. The cost of this was US$67 million67. Government was able to mobilize financing for this
through various sources. The US$25 million contingent grant under the Drought Risk Financing
component of the World Bank PSNP APL II Project, designed for this purpose, was disbursed.
With the agreement of donor partners, program resources already pledged for the 2009 PSNP
program were drawn down on an accelerated basis.

15.     Secondly, while the longer term impact of food price inflation on the program is still being
assessed, there is an immediate impact in 2009. The daily cash transfer provided through the
program, currently set at ETB8 (approximately US$0.8) has suffered enormous erosion in
purchasing power as a result of food price inflation.                  The ETB8 transfer was established in
December 2007 for the 2008 Program. Purchasing power was reduced by 58 percent between
December 2007 and June 2008, more than cutting it in half. It has been agreed that in order for
the Program to meet its objectives some adjustment in the value of the transfer must be made.
In adjusting the cash transfer several factors need to be taken into account. While restoring
purchasing power to previous levels is a primary concern, the potential impact on labor markets,
inflation, and overall program affordability also need to be considered. Critically, the danger of
overshooting long-term prices must also be factored-in given the uncertainty over long-term price
trends and several factors suggesting that domestic food prices will fall in the coming months68.

67Of the total cost US$17.6 million was provided directly in cash transfers and the remainder was used to finance the
purchase of 87,154 tons of grain, which was then used for transfers.
68The two primary arguments supporting the case that there is likely to be downward pressure on grain prices are (i) the
November/December Meher harvest is predicted to be adequate and will likely lead to price reductions, and (ii)
Government has indicated it will continue to import grain from abroad with the stated objective of reducing prices

16.     A recent study commissioned by the Government and donors has balanced these differing
considerations. It suggests that long-term prices will trend down, towards import parity, which is
well below current price levels. Based on a recommendation linking the purchasing power of the
wage rate to projected import parity prices, the Government and donor partners have agreed to
make financing available in order to cover a potential increase in the transfer value to ETB12, 50
percent above current levels. An adjustment in the transfer value to ETB12 would require an
additional US$97.3 million of program financing.

17.     The impact of these additional costs on the Program budget is shown in the table below. The
total budget for the coming year is US$288.3 million and 324,373 tons of grain; a total equivalent
cash budget of US$473.1 million. Existing commitments, including from IDA have provided much
of the financing needed for this.69 Several donor partners have mobilized additional resources
specifically in response to the cost overruns highlighted above.                  Almost all of the required
resources in cash or food have now been mobilized for 2009, but there is a residual financing
requirement of US$25.3 million.

beneficiary. Thus 121,344 tons of the 165,837 tons financing gap in food can be met using the US$69.2 million
available cash resources. The outstanding 44,493 tons will cost the program US$25.3 million.


D. Rationale for the Additional Grant & Expected Outcomes

18.     The objective of the PSNP Additional Financing Project is to fill the PSNP financing
gap that has emerged as a result of the combined impact of food price inflation and drought
in 2008, which have caused a cost overrun in the project. The causes of the cost overrun were
outside the control of the project. The additional grant will allow the project to continue to function
as designed in 2009, providing a similar level of support to food insecure households as has been
provided through 2008. It would also ensure that this support is provided on a timely basis.

69This includes the IDA resources currently undisbursed from the Project, as indicated in Table 1, for which the World
Bank has received a request for disbursement.

Without this additional financing, the current PDO would not be achieved, and the project's impact
indicators would be compromised.

19.     The option of accelerating processing of the next APL to meet the current financing
gap was considered and rejected. The additional grant would provide financing for 2009 while
APL III would provide financing from 2010 onwards. The program requires financing immediately
and any further delay in securing funds would directly undermine project performance in 2009. A
number of design questions related to APL III will be discussed and agreed with Government
during the course of 2009. It is important that the necessary time be given to this dialogue to ensure
that APL III is appropriately designed.

E. Proposed changes

20.     There are no changes in the PDO, design, and/or scope of the project. As the additional
funds will help address a cost overrun in the project and thereby allow the project to meet its
original objectives, the original PDO remains valid and the relevant results indicators and target
values remain the same.

21.     There are no changes applicable to the implementation mechanisms, financial
management, disbursement arrangements, or closing date.                With the exception of the
unforeseen cost overrun, progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective is
satisfactory, and implementation of the project as well as project management are satisfactory and
continue to be strengthened.     Although there are no changes to the financial management or
procurement arrangements for the Project, Annex 1 C and 1 D provide fully updated annexes on
Procurement and Financial Management for the Project, reflecting current capacity and recent
performance in these areas.

22.     The Table below indicates how the Additional Financing would be incorporated into
the financing for the parent project. There are no changes to the institutional arrangements; the
project will continue to be managed by the Food Security Coordination Bureau in the MOARD.
The Natural Resource Department of MOARD will continue to be responsible for overall
supervision and monitoring of the public works component.            The Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development (MOFED) will continue to be responsible for financial management of the
project.

F. Consistency with CAS

23.     As noted in the main program document, the PSNP remains a core component of the
World Bank strategy in Ethiopia as articulated in the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS,
World Bank, 2008). The CAS also recognizes the risks Ethiopia faces and states that "the Bank will
build flexibility into its lending portfolio so that it is better able to help Ethiopia cope with external
shocks." In the face of the shocks that Ethiopia has faced in 2008, Additional Financing to support
the PSNP is fully consistent with the CAS.

G. Benefits and risks

24.     The impact of the project on social aspects and poverty is expected to be
overwhelmingly positive. The PSNP is a well-established safety net program in its fourth year of
implementation.      Independent impact evaluations have shown that the program is having a
demonstrable and significant effect on beneficiary-household income and assets. Ensuring that all
of the necessary households continue to be covered adequately by the program will therefore make
an important contribution to reducing poverty now, as well as avoiding destitution in the future.

25.     The underlying risks of the parent project remain, although these have all been mitigated by
developments since approval of the project. The most substantial risks identified at the time of
project approval included (i) limited capacity of local and regional level implementers and (ii)
financing gaps given the size of the program and the need to commit such a large volume of
resources to a multi-annual program.

26.     Additional to the risks identified for the parent project, there are several risks directly
related to this PSNP Additional Financing Project. As highlighted in the program document
these are:



                                                    55

                         ANNEX 1: PSNP ADDITIONAL FINANCING PROJECT


27.     Timing and Delays. For the PSNP to function effectively program financing needs to be
made available before the start of each calendar year so that it can be channeled through the
regional governments to local governments for distribution to beneficiaries as the Program is
implemented. While this system now works relatively effectively it is still slow, and several years
of implementation have highlighted the importance of ensuring that resources are available as early
as possible to avoid downstream delays. Thus there is a risk that if Additional Financing is delayed
this will undermine the ability of the project to meet its objective of providing timely and
predictable transfers to households.

28.     Weather. A drought would seriously affect household-level food security in 2009. This
would have further implications for project financing as the impact on the poorest households
would again likely be mitigated by a scaling-up of the PSNP. Whilst no direct mitigation is sought,
the situation will continue to be closely monitored so that any mitigating measures are taken and
financing can be mobilized in timely manner. It is possible that financing for the proposed World
Bank APL III could play a part in such a response.

29.     Food-price inflation. Further high domestic food price inflation would have a significant
impact on the PSNP as the value of transfers to food insecure households would be eroded.
However, domestic cereal prices are already significantly above import parity prices. The GoE has
stated its intention to continue a process of importation of cereals until prices fall towards import
parity. Moreover, the coming harvest in the next month should also contribute substantially to a
downward pressure on price increases. Therefore the risk of further significant domestic cereal
inflation is largely mitigated and remains modest.

31.    General. Procurement under the Additional Financing for the second Productive
Safety Net Project (PSNP APL II) would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004
and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers,"
dated May 2004 and provisions stipulated in the legal agreement. For each contract to
be financed by the additional financing, the different procurement methods, estimated
costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and
the Bank in the Procurement Plan.

regions. The PPR report covers only the FSPD while the RPCs reports provide procurement issues
encountered at the regions and woredas under PSNP II.

37.    The procurement risk under the proposed project is rated HIGH. Overall, the GOE
procurement oversight arrangements are nascent at the federal level and only being established at
the regional level. There is a shortage of procurement professionals, making it difficult to attract
and retain proficient procurement staff and the linkage between the three levels
(federal/region/woredas) is weak. Procurement records management is poor nationally and
procurement planning skills are lacking at the sub-national level. Arrangements are being made
under the PBS II to strengthen procurement oversight nationally.   The thresholds for prior review
for international competitive bidding (ICB) including the maximum contract value for which the
short list may comprise exclusively Ethiopian firms in the selection of consultants are presented in
the table below.

38.    The Project Procurement Plan for PSNP II will be updated by the Recipient to provide the
basis for the procurement methods with the same prior review and ICB thresholds as for PSNP II.
The updated plans will be revised by the Recipient and agreed with the project team as appropriate
and posted on the project's database and the Bank's external website.

39.    The Procurement Capacity Enhancement Plan includes actions to be completed by
December 31, 2008:

        9.1.   recruiting RPCs in Amhara and Tigray regions;
        9.2.   project staff undertaking a tailor made procurement training;
        9.3.   establishing satisfactory procurement records systems; and
        9.4.   revising the TORs of the PSNP Procurement Specialist to ensure he can focus part of
               his input on providing procurement support to the regions.

40.    Frequency of Procurement Supervision. In addition to the prior review supervision to be
carried out from the Bank offices, the procurement post review of procurement actions carried out
during the semi-annual supervision missions as well as the annual roving procurement audits of the
existing project will be continued.

  ANNEX 1 D: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS

A. Introduction

41.    The objective or rationale of the PSNP Support Component of the Food Crisis Response
Program is to fill the PSNP financing gap that has emerged as a result of the food price inflation
and drought in 2008. This would allow the PSNP to continue to operate in 2009 as designed,
providing a similar level of support to food insecure households as has been provided up until 2008.
Specifically, financing would be used to provide cash and in-kind transfers to food insecure
households. Financing would be channeled through the existing World Bank APL project, allowing
it to continue to meet its development objectives. The PSNP has an established track record of
providing transfers on a timely basis, in cash and kind, to food insecure households. Resources are
provided through a labor-intensive public works program for households with able-bodies members
and as direct support grants to labor-poor, elderly or otherwise incapacitated households. The public
works program aims to create productive community assets, with a focus on soil and water
conservation. Evidence to date indicates that at its current scale and scope the PSNP, in spite of the
crisis suffered in 2008, is having a measurable impact on beneficiary livelihoods as measured by
income and assets.

42.    A financial management assessment was carried out in accordance with the Financial
Management Practices Manual issued by the Financial Management Board on November 3, 2005.
The objective of this Assessment is to update the previous Financial Management Assessment and
determine whether the implementing entities continue to have acceptable financial management
arrangements, which ensure that: (1) the funds are used only for the intended purposes in an
efficient and economical way, (2) the preparation of accurate, reliable and timely periodic financial
reports, and (3) safeguard the entities' assets.

B. Executive Summary

43.    The project's transactions will be managed as it is done now. The overall performance of the
project is currently satisfactory as per latest ISR rating. The performance of the project in financial
management was rated Moderately Satisfactory by the last FM supervision. The risk of the project
remains Substantial.

44.    The project's transactions will be managed as it is done now. The overall performance of the
project is currently satisfactory as per latest ISR rating. The performance of the project in financial
management was rated Moderately Satisfactory by the last FM supervision. The risk of the project
remains Substantial.

45.    Fiduciary arrangements of the implementing agencies meet the Bank's minimum
requirements under OP/BP10.02. It is adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and
timely information on the status of the project required by IDA. However, concerted efforts should
be made in addressing reporting delays observed.

C. Summary Project Description

46.    The development objective of the overall PSNP is to contribute to reducing household
vulnerability and improving resilience to shocks. This will be achieved through reform of the
humanitarian emergency system to a development-oriented program which provides timely,
predictable and adequate transfers to beneficiary households, thus allowing effective consumption-
smoothing and avoiding asset-depletion; creates productive and sustainable community assets;
contributes to large-scale rehabilitation of severely degraded areas; stimulates local markets through
demand linkages; and establishes more effective responses to shocks such as drought to avoid
increasing destitution among affected households. There are no changes proposed to the PDO. The
existing institutional framework, procurement and disbursement arrangements will be maintained.

D. Country Issues

47.    The recently completed Joint Budget and Aid review (JBAR) and the Fiduciary Assessment
(FA) show that Ethiopia has made significant progress in strengthening public financial
management (PFM) in recent years. The JBAR, which was conducted by the Bank in collaboration
with other donors, reviewed the PFM system using the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) framework.         Out of the sixteen indicators covered under this review,
fourteen were on the Government's systems for public expenditure planning, budgeting and
reporting. The remaining two indicators are means to assess donor performance. Ethiopia scored
high on seven of the fourteen indictors, i.e. macroeconomic management, including aggregate fiscal
discipline and minimizing fiscal risks. The JBAR observes satisfactory progress in budgeting and
accounting reform but notes that the adequacy and quality of budget reporting leaves room for
improvement and remain a key concern.

48.    The status of PFM reform and performance varies between regions. Southern Nation and
Nationalities Peoples Region (SNNPR) and Tigray regions have been the beneficiaries of
investment and local initiatives to support PFM reform. They both show improvement in the
overall public finance function and a consequential reduction in fiduciary risk. Few other Regions,
such as Amhara and Oromya, have also shown significant progress in PFM while others are at an
earlier stage of investment in PFM or have not yet commenced their plans and therefore
demonstrated less progress in PFM improvement.

49.    The Overview of the PEFA assessment report is as follows: An evaluation of PFM
performance in Ethiopia has been conducted in early 2007 based on an international reference
framework ­ the PEFA framework. The assessment was done at the federal and regional levels and
two separate reports were issued. Seven regions were included in the assessment. The assessment
report issued in April 2007, which is still in its draft form, observed significant improvement in the
area of financial management at regions, including budgetary transparency in recent years, robust
budget preparation, regular internal audit scrutiny and follow up of internal audit recommendations,
timeliness of in-year and annual financial reports, and mutual supportiveness of the federal and
regional Auditor Generals. Nonetheless, the report noted that the quality and nature of internal audit
is uneven throughout the regions. It also reported untimely clearance of suspense accounts and that
some regions are still experiencing significant delays in producing timely in-year and end of year
information. The report further identified capacity issues in reviewing annual budgets.

50.    In the view of the above table, while the inherent risk is Substantial the control risk is
Moderate. The overall risk rating continues to remain Substantial

Strengths and Weaknesses of Financial Management

51.    As noted in various reports the country's discipline in executing budget and compliance with
the existing Government regulations are the major strengths in implementing the project. The
Government's existing arrangements are already being used in a number of projects, including
PSNP and PBS which is currently under implementation.

52.    The main weaknesses for the FM arrangements continues to be shortage of qualified
accountants and auditors (mainly at Woredas), delay in reporting, limited focus of internal audit,
and understaffing of the audit function. As part of ongoing dialogue during project implementation
staffing continues to be strengthened at the local-level to address this. The long process involved in
producing reports from Woredas to regions, and from regions to MOFED, may cause delay the
timely submission of financial reports to the DPs. The program continues however to experience
delays in the completion and submission of reports and audits of desired quality. Delayed



                                                      64

                        ANNEX 1: PSNP ADDITIONAL FINANCING PROJECT


submission of reports (both audited and unaudited) and inadequate follow-up on recommendations
of some projects are of major concern.

E. Implementing Entities

53.    The current arrangements will continue to operate. At the Federal level, MOFED will
continue to be responsible for the overall financial management of the project, the management of
the designated and the pooled local currency account. MOFED will also continue to be responsible
for producing regular financial reports and facilitating the annual audit of the PSNP account.

54.    At the regional level, BOFEDs continue to be responsible for ensuring that a suitable
accounting system covering both regional and Woreda levels is established. BOFEDs will continue
to collect and aggregate all financial data and information from Woredas on the Project, review the
effective use of accounting procedures by Woredas, and provide technical support and assistance to
Woreda finance personnel to help them develop the needed skills and competences to carry out
their functions. Each region will prepare monthly, quarterly and annual reports, which will be sent
to the federal level.

55.    At the Woreda level, a suitable accounting system is established for the disbursement of
funds for activities financed under the PSNP. The records of funds utilized will be maintained in
accordance with sound accounting practices that are capable of generating accurate and timely
information for verification. Woreda accounting personnel received training on how to maintain
accurate accounts for the funds utilized and the same type of training will continue in the second
phase of the Program. In case Woredas face difficulties in accounting or handling financial records,
the region will provide timely assistance and training to resolve such difficulties.

F. Budgeting

56.    The overall budgetary arrangements will also continue to prevail. The chart of accounts of
the Government accommodates the expenditures of the project. The capacity of the accounting
staff to fulfill budgeting needs of the project is adequate.      Although the overall budgeting is
satisfactory, it was noted in the last supervision report that budgets are prepared and reported on a
lump sum basis with no breakdown for without proper identification of the category such as public
works, direct support, capital and administrative. Further more, there was very much limited use of
variance analysis and that there is no use of the budget as a management control tool. These have to
be improved.

G. Accounting

57.    The current accounting standards in use in the project will be applicable. FM manual has
been developed and is in use by the project and this will continue to apply for the duration of the
additional financing.   The existing accounting software will be maintained in order to allow
production of all accounting and financial data required and the chart of accounts will facilitate the
preparation of relevant quarterly and financial statement including information on the total project
expenditures.




                                                  65

                          ANNEX 1: PSNP ADDITIONAL FINANCING PROJECT


58.    There is an overall improvement in the account recording at regions and Woredas; however,
there is still more to be done in maintaining the proper audit trail for consolidation works at Federal
level. In addition, MOFED and BOFEDs should undertake adequate robust reviews and check on
the reports submitted to them from Regions and Woredas respectively.

59.    The current project has recruited and maintains significant number of accountants and
cashiers at both Federal and Regional and Woreda levels. As of April 8 2008 there were about 775
staffs out of which 359 accountants and the rest were cashiers at regional and Woreda level. The
current staffing at all levels will continue to operate.

H. Internal Control and Internal Auditing

60.    The project's internal controls, including processes for recording and safeguarding of assets,
are documented in the Project FM Manual. These procedures will continue to be applicable.

61.    MOFED, BOFEDs and WOFEDs internal audit departments or units will perform post audit
reviews. However, the lack of effective and value-adding internal audit function at Federal,
Regional and sub regional levels was noted in the prior supervision mission.

I. Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements

62.    The current flow of funds and disbursement arrangements will continue to be applicable for
this new initiative. The existing banking arrangements: designated accounts (DAs) and pooled
local currency account at Federal level, separate bank account at regional and Woreda level will be
maintained for disbursement purposes in accordance with the project objective.




                                                    66

63.   The following table sets out, the categories of items to be financed out of the proceeds of the
additional grant, the allocation of the amounts of credit to each category and the percentage of
expenditures for items to be financed in each category:


                           IDA Credit /Grant

                         ANNEX 1: PSNP ADDITIONAL FINANCING PROJECT


J. Financial Reporting

64.    The project will continue to prepare on a quarterly basis, the Consolidated Interim unaudited
Financial Report (IFR) and submit to the Bank within 60 days of the end of the quarter. The format
and the content are consistent with the Bank's standards.

65.    Although there have been steps taken by MOFED and FSPD to enhance the timeliness
reporting and auditing, and these have led to significant reductions in the delays in reporting, the
program continues to experience delays in the completion and submission of reports which are of
desired quality. Incomplete reports with inadequate documentation were repeatedly noted.

K. Auditing

66.    The current audit arrangement will also continue for this additional financing. This would
include the financial audit and the roving audit arrangements currently in place. MOFED will have
the project financial statement audited by Office of the Federal Auditor General (OFAG) or an
auditor assigned by OFAG and will submit the audit report to the Bank within nine months of the
end of the year. In addition to this, an independent audit firm will conduct a review of the financial
transactions of the program at the Woreda level. This is what is referred to a Roving audit which
will also continue. The coverage would be similar to the existing one which is forty Woredas each
year, 10 per quarter, including a resurvey of the previous five Woredas which has already been
covered. There exists a ToR for both audits.

67.    The transaction-testing Roving Audit for the year 2007 was not conducted on time, i.e. the
audit for the period from January 1 2007 to December 31, 2007 was not conducted as planned
which would include 10 Woredas per quarter. This is currently under implementation. The 2008
Roving Audit from January 1 2008 up to now is not yet started and auditors are not yet recruited.

68.    The financial audit report for the year ended 7 July 2007 was received and reviewed. The
audit report is qualified and the management letter revealed a number of internal control
weaknesses. An action plan is being requested so as to resolve the issues noted in the report.

L. Financial Covenants

69.    MOFED will submit the audited Program accounts to IDA nine months after the end of each
fiscal year. The fiscal year ends on 7 July of each year. The audited financial statement will include
all sources of funds for the Program, including other donors and the Government. MOFED will
submit quarterly IFRs to IDA sixty days after the end of each quarter period.

N. Financial Management Action Plan

70.    The action plan below indicates the actions to be taken for the project to strengthen its
financial management system and the dates that they are due to be completed by.

71.    The project will be subject to periodic supervision missions, at least twice per year, jointly
with donors. Supervision activities will include: i) review of quarterly FMRs; ii) review of annual
audited financial statements as well as timely follow-up of issues arising; iii) transaction review;
iv) participation in project supervision missions as appropriate; and v) updating the FM rating in the
Implementation Status Report (ISR).

                         ANNEX 2 A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1.      The objective of the Project is to contribute to the Recipient's efforts to ensure an aggregate
availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production season adequate to meet
smallholder farmers' priority demands. The proposed instrument for the Fertilizer Support Project
is that of Emergency Recovery Operation processed under the guidelines for a Rapid Response to
Crisis and Emergencies OP/BP 8.00. In line with OP8.00 the proposed Project supports "measures
to mitigate or avert the potential effects of imminent emergencies or future emergencies or crisis in
countries at high risk."

2.      The Fertilizer Support Project will be implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Sector
(Department) of MOARD, largely in accordance with established procedures. It will have two
components: First, a large Fertilizer Component (about US$249.6 million) will ensure availability
of foreign exchange for the importation of a significant share of the fertilizer demand for the
upcoming crop season.          Second, a small but important Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
Component (about US$0.4 million) will track the fertilizer imports, the various steps along the
input distribution system, and enable an assessment of the impact of the project for the beneficiary
farm households.

3.      Component 1: The Fertilizer Component will aim to ensure the timely import of
fertilizers for the 2009 production season.            The design of this quick-disbursing component
recognizes both the inherent risks involved in working in emergency situations, including the risks
and lost opportunities associated with a delayed response, and the critical importance of speed,
flexibility, and simplicity to an effective rapid response. It is designed to finance one single
commodity (i.e., fertilizers) under a positive list of goods, required to immediately address the
country's food crisis.

4.      MOARD has estimated, through extension staff, the quantity of the two types of fertilizers
(DAP and urea) demanded by farmers. The total estimated amount is about 550,000 tons of DAP
and urea for the 2009 cropping season. Based on the prospect of receiving support from IDA, the
government has initiated the process for the country to import initially 150,000 tons of DAP and for
75,000 tons of urea. The proposed Project will finance this first batch of fertilizer for the early 2009
season (belg and early meher). If (as expected) the costs will be lower than the US$249.6 million
allocated for this Component, the Project will also finance part of the next batch of fertilizer
targeted for the later meher season.

5.      The implementation would rely largely on the established procedures,70 which have been
found to be generally satisfactory by the Bank.              A national Fertilizer Foreign Procurement
Committee (FFPC) would oversee the tendering process for allocating foreign exchange needed to
import fertilizers. The Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) of MOARD, the implementing
agency of this Project, also functions as the secretariat of the FFPC.

6.      An important change compared to previous years is that MOARD is allowing for bulk
procurement.      This is a change from the practice in previous years. For example, in the last

                                                       71

(2007/08) season, about 12 cooperative unions and the parastatal AISE imported fertilizers were
competing for foreign exchange allocation and import market share, each one importing only
perhaps one or two shiploads.71 While this practice had the advantage of many importers including
small ones competing with each other, Ethiopia did not make use of its size. Many importers
competing have the disadvantage that each one is only handling limited amounts of fertilizer. The
consequence has been somewhat limited interest from foreign suppliers and high prices for each of
the small batches that are individually procured.              As one of the biggest fertilizer users in Africa,
Ethiopia can attract large suppliers that give a price discount in case large quantities are sold.

7.       This problem of fragmented import markets and hence, limited market power, also exists
outside Ethiopia and was discussed by the Agricultural Ministers of the African Union Member
States at the Conference for an African Green Revolution in Abuja, Nigeria in June 2006. The
Summit charged the African Development Bank with the responsibility of establishing the Africa
Fertilizer Development Financing Mechanism by 2007 and one of its activities is the establishment
of an African Fertilizer Procurement Facility (AFPF) that would consolidate orders to gain
leverage, realize scale efficiencies and make more affordable fertilizers available to small holder
farmers in Africa. Ethiopia is strongly committed to this process and, since the AFPF is not yet
established, decided to follow its principles on a national scale in the 2008/09 season.

8.       MOARD has advertised (on October 3, 2008) in the local media the tender for the allocation
of foreign exchange to cover the cost of the first amounts of fertilizer, i.e. 150,000 tons of DAP and
75,000 of urea under two different bidding procedures,72 amounting to about 40 percent of the
country's total estimated fertilizer demand for 2009.73               74   The bidding documents provided by
MOARD to interested importers specify that these large amounts will be procured on a lot by lot
basis.

9.       The consequence of the floating of a bulk tender as observed in the current process is that
importers tend to cooperate rather than only compete with each other. During this first tender of the
2008/09 season, AISE has emerged as the sole importer of these large amounts and is acting on
behalf of other importers/distributors, cooperatives and one private trading house.75 To account for
this fact, the task team agreed with the Government that qualified importer(s) (AISE) are asked to
float the tender internationally, i.e. to publish an advertisement in the Development Gateway's
dgmarket and UNDB online. The time of bid opening was extended by 14 days to November 11,
2008.




71While previously AISE and (mostly party-owned/affiliated) enterprises dominated the import of fertilizers, AISE's
market share has declined, other enterprises have gone out of the fertilizer business, and the market has been
increasingly dominated by cooperative unions.
72Procurement is on a lot basis, so that smaller market players can participate (see Annex 2 C).
73At current spot market prices, this amount is estimated to cost about US$180 million. If the cost is indeed lower than
total financing provided by the proposed Fertilizer Support Project, the Project will also finance the foreign exchange
for part of the next bulk procurement, planned for early 2009.
74Procurement is on a lot basis, so that smaller market players can participate (see Annex 2 C).
75This might or might not happen for the next tender to which the financing of the proposed Project would contribute.




                                                           72

                                  ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


10.      The importer, i.e. AISE,76 makes a public bid opening and then evaluates the bids within 4
days after bid opening. AISE has invited 2 representatives from the importers/distributors, on which
behalf it imports, to serve on its evaluation committee. AISE then submits its importer bid, i.e. the
evaluation report plus copies of bids from foreign suppliers, to MOARD/FFPC for review and
approval. MOARD will send a copy of the report and its review to the Bank. MOARD will, upon
its approval, instruct NBE to provide the necessary foreign exchange to the Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia (CBE), the bank handling the financial transactions between the importer and foreign
supplier for purposes of issuing a letter of credit under the fertilizer supply contract.

11.      The Bank's Operations Procurement Committee (OPRC) has reviewed the procurement
arrangements and found them to be satisfactory, meeting the test of transparency, economy and
efficiency. As the procurement of fertilizer is undertaken by commercial entities, the Bank will not
conduct prior or post reviews of any fertilizer supply contracts. However, the following provisions
will apply: (i) open competition among suppliers and control mechanisms on the procurement by
the qualified importer(s) and its contractual arrangements with other domestic distributors; (ii)
allocation of foreign exchange and establishment of L/Cs to the lowest evaluated responsive
bidders; and (iii) monitoring and verification of the actual importation and distribution of fertilizers.

12.      Given the emergence of a sole importer and the large size of the procurement, the task team,
followed advice of the OPRC, and worked with the Government to include control mechanisms for
the importer (AISE).77          In particular, this includes the requirements that: (i) AISE advertises
internationally; (ii) AISE's bid evaluation report is approved by FFPC/MOARD and the
FFPC/MOARD recommendation is sent to the Bank; (iii) MOARD will allocate the necessary
foreign exchange for the importation of fertilizer on the condition that AISE and its suppliers will
be subject to the Bank's provisions on fraud and corruption as well as the Bank's right to inspection
and audit;78 and (iv) MOARD forwards to the Bank copies of the document allocating foreign
exchange to the AISE, the contract between AISE and the importers/distributors on whose behalf it
is acting, and the contract between AISE and its foreign supplier(s).

13.      IDA disbursement for the Component would be in full on effectiveness of the project. Upon
award MOARD would instruct NBE to sell the necessary foreign exchange to the commercial bank
handling the financial transactions paying the foreign fertilizer supplier(s).79                 80The commercial
bank will in turn sell the foreign exchange to the importer. It will open the Letters of Credit (L/C)
for the selected importer(s) against payment to CBE by the importer(s) of the local currency
equivalent amount of the US$-denominated L/C. This transaction is between the CBE and the
importer; the NBE and Government are not involved, and will not extend credit. Pre- and post-


76These procedures would hold for any other importer that still wants to compete during the current tender or the
following tender that the proposed Project is likely to also (partly) finance.
77In case other importers will bid during this tender process or a possible next one that the Project might (partly)
finance, the provision would obviously also apply to them.
78Such provisions are not normally required under the quick-disbursing component to finance a positive list of goods,
and the inclusion of such provisions in this operation is not to be viewed as precedent setting.
79The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) has been functioning as the commercial bank of the importers, and is
AISE's bank handling these transactions.
80As the importers get the foreign currencies in exchange for the equivalent amount in ETB, this equivalent amount in
ETB is transferred to the treasury.



                                                             73

                                  ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


shipment inspections are included in the contracts between the importer(s) and their foreign
suppliers.

14.      As stated above, the Bank's Fraud and Corruption Provisions apply. Generally, quick-
disbursing components involve a large number of items in the positive lists, with several importers
(i.e., hundreds of small value imports by many local importers). In this operation, as there is only
one commodity with only few large imports totaling close to US$250 million, the Bank will ensure
(through a suitable disbursement condition in the Financing Agreement) that the contracts between
the local importers and their foreign suppliers include the provisions of (i) fraud, corruption,
collusion, coercion and obstructive practice; and (ii) the Bank's right to audit the importer's and
their foreign supplier's accounts and records relating to the performance of the import contracts.81

15.      The actual import of fertilizer as well as their distribution and sales to farmers will be
handled by the importer or importers, including the state-owned AISE and cooperative
unions/federations as well as trading companies. The delivery schedule for the fertilizers is pre-
determined by the demand and shipped through the port of Djibouti. Actual imports for the first
150,000 tons of DAP and 75,000 of urea are expected to arrive on numerous vessels between mid-
January and mid-April 2009. From Djibouti the fertilizers are transported by truck into the major
warehouses of the importers and wholesale traders of fertilizer and further down the supply chain to
primary cooperatives and retailers and eventually farmers. The main final beneficiaries of the
fertilizers are small-holder farmers82 and the bulk of the fertilizer is used in high-potential areas.
Traditionally, a bulk of the input is used in Oromia and Amhara Regional States, with about 50
percent and 30 percent of total consumption, followed by SNNPR (9 percent) and Tigray
(4 percent).83

16.      Component 2: Monitoring and Evaluation. M&E activities would be implemented by
Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) of MOARD with the objective to: (i) provide timely
information about fertilizer import and distribution for MOARD and the Bank, so that mitigating
actions can be taken, if risks such as low farmer demand materialize; and (ii) to evaluate the impact
of the Project on the final beneficiaries, i.e. farm households, and Ethiopia's overall crop
production and food security and inform future fertilizer policy. The M&E Component would track
the importation and distribution of fertilizers (and of complementary inputs) and assess the
efficiency of the distribution system as well as the revealed demand by the farmer beneficiaries, and
evaluate the impact of the Project on the farm beneficiaries. This would be achieved through a
combination of strengthening the already existing Government monitoring and reporting systems
and the commissioning of a survey by an independent international consultant, with TORs
acceptable to the Bank. The results framework and monitoring and evaluation arrangements are
discussed in more detail in Annex 2 B.

17.      The Government and its DPs would also monitor the fiscal impact of this Project, and
ensure that domestic borrowing is reduced. No new instrument is required for this as there are

81Such provisions are not normally required under the quick-disbursing component to finance a positive list of goods,
and the inclusion of such provisions in this operation is not to be viewed as precedent setting.
82Commercial farms with own foreign exchange reserves can import their own fertilizers without going through the
Government's foreign exchange window for fertilizer import.
83Basically no chemical fertilizers are used in the emerging regions. Data from DSA (2006).

regular assessments undertaken jointly by the Government and donors including the annual PEFA;
the annual PFA, the semi-annual JBARs; and the biannual IMF Art. IV consultation. In addition,
there are major operations such as PSCAP and PBS that strengthen the public financial system
including its monitoring.

18.     The Government requested to include a small activity to support the environmental and
social assessment and the preparation of the environmental management plan under the M&E
Component. The activity is to finance a consultant to assist the Government in carrying out this
activity within two months after Project effectiveness.

19.     Project Closing Date. The proposed Closing Date of the Fertilizer Support Project is June
30, 2010. This time frame will give the Project sufficient time to fully disburse the funds and
monitor and evaluate the distribution and application of fertilizers and complementary inputs
throughout the country.84

20.     Bank Supervision. The Bank's Project Task Team consisting of a Task Team Leader and
FM and procurement staff based in Ethiopia who would supervise the Project on a continuous basis.
Specialized experts on fertilizer and/or M&E would be employed for Components 1 and 2,
respectively. Two supervision missions are planned for early and late 2009 to assess progress of
overall project implementation.




84The final evaluation through a survey and ICR mission needs to take place at the end or after the 2009 meher harvest
(November/December 2009).

Monitoring Arrangements

21.    The M&E system for the Fertilizer Component will consist of two elements: (i) monitoring
of fertilizer imports and distribution at critical steps along the input distribution system in terms of
quantities and timeliness, (ii) monitoring and evaluation of use and payoffs to fertilizer and
complementary inputs at the farm level,

Tracking fertilizer distribution

22.    As far as possible the existing MOARD system will be employed to track fertilizer
distribution from imports to wholesalers and cooperatives and their unions.               Much of this
information is already collected through the administrative system including trade statistics from
the customs office, and information collected by MOARD and its corresponding offices at regional
and woreda levels, including Development Agents (i.e. extension workers). For instance, MOARD
receives quarterly reports on the imports of fertilizer as well as quarterly imports from each of the
importers on their imports and the status of their stocks and sales.

23.    Nevertheless, given the importance of monitoring the demand at the farm level and of credit,
MOARD agreed to establish an additional monitoring through their system of Regional BOARDs
and WOARDs. This system would collect on a regular basis the amount of fertilizer sold to
farmers as well as the credit and credit guarantees provided (the table below provides an overview).
The format of the reporting was agreed during the Negotiations. To assist MOARD in these
enhanced monitoring and reporting efforts, MOARD will hire a short-term consultant under the
M&E Component, who would work part-time during the peak reporting period.

Evaluating Adoption and Impacts

24.    At the end of the 2009 crop season, rural household survey data would be collected to
evaluate fertilizer use and beneficiaries at the farm level in order to inform future policy and
capacity building in the agricultural input sector. The survey would be designed to collect data on;

(i) farm level access to fertilizer in terms of source, timeliness and quality, (ii) quantitative
estimates of use of fertilizer by crop, (iii) the major beneficiaries of fertilizer use by farm size and
agricultural system/potential, and (iv) use of complementary inputs, especially improved seed. In
addition, the survey data would be combined with yield cuts in farmers' fields and recent data from
onfarm trials and demonstrations to provide an up to date assessment of payoffs to fertilizer use for
major crops and production zones.

25.    This survey would sample a cross section of woredas in high and lower potential regions,
measured in terms of both agro-ecological potential and ease of access to markets (see Attachment
to this Annex). The sample will be based on previous national household sample surveys in order
to provide panel data for better discrimination of impacts.

26.    The survey would be carried out by the Government commissioning an independent
international consultancy with a strong record in impact evaluation and knowledge of Ethiopia,
based on TORs and with consultants acceptable to IDA. Detailed draft TORs are available (see
Annex 2 B Attachment) and are being discussed with the Government.

Annex 2 B Attachment: Draft Terms-of-Reference of Farm-household Evaluation Survey

A. Background

27.    In response to rising food prices, the Government of Ethiopia aims to increase the likelihood
that crop production in the 2009 agricultural season will remain on or near the growth trends of
recent years. It has requested IDA resources in the amount of US$275 million, out of which about
US$250 million is for a Fertilizer Support Project to finance the importation of fertilizers to support
production growth for the 2009 agricultural season.

28.    After the final disbursement of funds and distribution of fertilizers or other complementary
inputs along the value chain, a systematic assessment is required. The purpose of the evaluation of
the Project is to assess whether specific project objectives, have been met. The evaluation thus
requires up-to-date information about the fertilizer market and beneficial impacts of the project.

29.    Details about this Project and the specific M&E requirements are in the Project Document.

B. Expected tasks and outputs

The assignment would entail the following key tasks:
    · Original household survey data collection;
    · Other secondary data collection, to create pseudo-benchmarks; and
    · Analytical report summarizing major findings.


30.    Original household survey data collection. It is the consultant(s) obligation to assess the
best possible survey and underlying sampling strategy.          For example, to save costs and ease
logistical efforts it could be desirable to link the data collection strategy to other ongoing surveys.
Alternatively, it may be more feasible to carry out a new survey. The expected sample size of the
survey is in the order of 3,500 households. The consultants should also make an attempt to survey
a selected number of cooperatives. The survey does not need to be fully representative at the
national level, though it is expected that the consultants use appropriate stratification techniques,
and assure a high degree of geographical representation.

31.    Major data to be collected would include:
    · Standard household demographic variables, including those allowing an assessment of
        production and wealth benefits of fertilizer use, and those allowing an rudimentary
        assessment of environmental and health impacts;
    · Farmer's access to different types of fertilizers and variables allowing an assessment of the
        origin of fertilizer purchase;
    · Farmer's reporting timely delivery of fertilizers and variables allowing an assessment of the
        origin of timely or delayed delivery;
    · Area estimates allowing an assessment of adequate fertilizer doses;



                                                   79

                              ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


    · Data on cropping systems, effective use and quality of purchased goods, and other plot-
        specific data; and
    · Other variables of interest to be determined in consultation with MORAD.

32.    Other secondary data.       Similarly, it is the consultants obligation to collect appropriate
secondary data to eventually complement information from the new the household survey and
whenever feasible, create pseudo-benchmarks that would allow evaluating developments over time.
Appropriate secondary may be from the Annual Agricultural Sample Survey (AgSS) collected by
the Central Statistical Agency and other surveys, such as for example those conducted by the
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Ethiopian Strategy Support Program
(ESSP). MORAD, in conjunction with the World Bank's tasks team, would help to facilitate access
to this information.

33.    Major data to be collected would include:
    · Appropriate       information    that  allows    creating pseudo-benchmarks      and    tracking
        developments over time;
    · Data on production and yields, in particular for cereals, oilseeds and pulses, representative
        at the national level, and disaggregated whenever feasible;
    · Data on fertilizer imports and other information, documenting and summarizing the
        distribution along the value chain, as obtained through MOARD's progress monitoring and
        audit reports; and
    · Other information of interest, to be determined in consultation with MORAD.

34.    Analytical report. The analytical report should at the minimum cover the evaluation areas
described in the Project Appraisal Document. It is expected that a first draft of the analytical report
is shared with MORAD in early April 2009. The analytical report should be sufficient in depth and
have a well-written executive summary that clearly presents major findings.          The consultants
should, prior to final submission, substantially review major findings in consultation with MORAD,
MoFED, the World Bank, and if appropriate other agencies.

35.    Specifically, the analytical report should at the minimum cover the following areas:
    · An assessment of the quantity and types of fertilizer imported over the coming agricultural
        cycle. This information can be obtained from audit reports, customs authorities' data, and
        estimates as obtained through MOARD's progress monitoring and audit reports.
    · An assessment of the timeliness of import and distribution of fertilizer and complementary
        inputs to end users along the value chain. This information and subsequent analysis would
        come from the proposed household survey complemented with information, if appropriate,
        from selected primary cooperatives and MOARD's monitoring system.
    · An estimated of the costs and the potential contribution of the fertilizer to agricultural
        production and household economic welfare (cost-benefit analysis).         The consultant is
        expected to use appropriate quantitative techniques to provide these estimates.            The
        consultant is also expected to draw careful conclusions and point out limitations, in
        consultation with MORAD, since in an ideal environment an assessment of costs and
        benefits would benefit from a long-term perspective.

                                                   80

                             ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


    · The consultant is also expected to assess, through appropriate data collection and analytical
        techniques, potential environmental and health impact of fertilizer distribution.       The
        consultant will also communicate with the evaluation team of the Productive Safety Net
        Component (PSNP) to explore synergies. However, these analyses can be rudimentary, and
        are not expected to be the main focus of the proposed consultancy.

C. Duration and payment of consultancy

36.    The expected duration of the consultancy is from November 2008 until June 2009.

37.    From November 2008 to February 2009, the consultant is expected to work on the rural
survey and collect other secondary data. From February to May 2009, the consultant will work on
the analytical report. A first draft should be submitted to MORAD in early April 2009, followed by
a final report in May 2009.

38.    The expected total cost envelope includes survey design, survey execution, collection of
secondary data, and final write-up of the analytical report. The payment schedule would be as
follows:
    · 10 percent upon submission of an Inception Report, which is expected two weeks after
        signature of contract;
    · 30 percent upon mutual agreement and finalization of survey design with MOARD's task
        team;
    · 30 percent upon submission of the cleaned unit record data to MORAD; and
    · 30 percent upon submission of final evaluation report.

D. Selection criteria

39.    The consultants (or the consultant firm) will be selected through (international) quality and
cost-based selection.
    · The consultants should demonstrate a clear understanding of Ethiopia's agricultural sector.
        They should have worked in similar assignments either in Ethiopia or in countries of similar
        geographical and economic setting.
    · The consultants must demonstrate experience in successful implantation of rural household
        surveys, and subsequent analysis of agricultural and other data specifically for monitoring
        and evaluation purposes.
    · The consultants should have minimum academic qualification of a Masters Degree in
        Economics, Agricultural Economics, or Rural Development with more than 8 years of
        working experience. A PhD will be considered as an advantage.

E. Reporting obligations

40.    The consultants will report directly to MORAD. If required, technical backstopping can be
provided by the Bank's task team.

                       ANNEX 2 C: PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS

1.    General. The Fertilizer Support Project (FSP) is an emergency project under the Global Food
Crisis Response Program. Due to the risks and lost opportunities associated with delayed response,
and the critical importance of speed, flexibility, and simplicity the Fertilizer Support Project will be
implemented under OP/BP 8.00.         FSP includes a quick-disbursing import support component
designed to avail foreign exchange to finance the procurement of fertilizers under a positive list of
goods required to immediately address Ethiopia's food crisis as well as a small component for
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) that will track the supply of fertilizers as well as assess the
impact of the project.

2.    Procurement of the required fertilizers. For the next planting season alone, fertilizers
requirements are estimated at 375,000 tons of Diammonium Phosphastes (DAP) and 175,000 tons
of Urea.    In anticipation of the foreign exchange support from Fertilizer Support Project for
fertilizer import, MOARD published a call for bids for allocation of foreign exchange from
interested local fertilizers importers in the local press on October 3, 2008 for the procurement of
150,000 tons of DAP and 75,000 tons of Urea. The Project team studied the MOARD procedures
for the allocation of foreign exchange for fertilizers import and presented the matter to the Bank's
Operations Procurement Committee (OPRC) whose deliberations were as follows:

3.    Quote: an exceptional meeting of the OPRC held on Tuesday, October 7, 2008, the following
points were discussed:

        ·       The OPRC agreed with the team's proposal on the procurement of the required DAP
        and Urea fertilizers following the provisions of Para 2.66 of the procurement guidelines
        (operations involving a program of imports). The OPRC explained that this paragraph
        normally applies to imports following ICB procedures or to smaller contracts procured by
        private or public entity following commercial practices that ensures economy and
        efficiency. Based on the teams' review and confirmation regarding the acceptability of the
        commercial procedures of the private sector, and given that this procurement is part of an
        emergency project under OP/BP 8.0, the OPRC recommends that the Operation
        Committee allows for adapting these provisions for the two large contracts of
        fertilizers envisaged under the project.

        ·       The OPRC concluded that even if this procurement involves private sector imports
        and the Bank is not financing the contracts between the local importers and the international
        supplier, the anti-corruption guidelines would apply. Accordingly, the provisions on Fraud
        and Corruption, and the Bank's right to audit and review, should be included in the bidding
        documents that were prepared by the government for the selection of the local importer(s).
        Additionally, in light of the perceived and potential risks related to these two large
        contracts, OPRC, on exceptional basis, agreed with the team's proposal to include the above
        provisions in the contract(s) between the local importer(s) and international supplier(s).
        Unquote

4.      The Operations Committee (OC) of the Bank at its meeting of October 9, 2008 endorsed the
recommendations of the OPRC.         Subsequently, the task team obtained information that other
importers including one commercial entity and several cooperative unions had delegated the state

                                                   83

                             ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


owned Agricultural Input Supply Enterprise (AISE) to act as their Agent. It is thus apparent that
AISE could become the sole fertilizer importer and bid for the allocation of foreign exchange for
the large value fertilizer contracts as "lead importer". Therefore another meeting of the OPRC of
October 22, 2008 discussed the procurement arrangement again. OPRC members virtually:

      Quote agreed that the Bank will not prior review the process as this is still considered as
      an emergency operation of imports using commercial practices. What we have done is to
      introduce better competition, control mechanisms and separation of the evaluation of bids
      by the Agricultural Input Supply Enterprise (AISE) and the review and approval
      mechanism by the ministry/fertilizer procurement committee for the allocation of foreign
      exchange which will bought by the importer with equivalent local currency.

      The sector has confirmed that the following M&E mechanisms have been put in place.
      There is no prior or post review of 'procurement' or foreign exchange allocation process.

      Monitoring and Evaluation: M&E activities would be implemented by Agricultural
      Marketing Sector (Department) of MOARD with the objective to: (i) provide timely
      information about fertilizer import and distribution for MOARD and the Bank, so that
      mitigating actions can be taken, if risks such as low farmer demand materialize; and (ii) to
      evaluate the impact of the Project on the final beneficiaries, i.e. farm households, and
      Ethiopia's overall crop production and food security and inform future fertilizer policy.
      The M&E Component would track the importation and distribution of fertilizers (and of
      complementary inputs) and assess the efficiency of the distribution system as well as the
      revealed demand by the farmer beneficiaries, and evaluate the impact of the Project on the
      farm beneficiaries. This would be achieved through a combination of already existing
      Government monitoring and reporting systems and the commissioning of a survey by an
      independent international consultant, with TORs acceptable to the Bank. Unquote

5.      In order to increase transparency and competition for the expected large contracts for the
supply of fertilizers, AISE would publish the bidding opportunity in the dgMarket for a minimum
of 14 days.

6.      Due to fluctuating fertilizer prices, MOARD may have foreign exchange left over from the
Fertilizer Support Project support after allocating the foreign exchange to AISE to procure the
175,000 tons of DAP and 75,000 tons of Urea. This would necessitate another round of allocation
of foreign exchange under the Fertilizer Support Project. MOARD would follow its established
procedures for competitive allocation of foreign exchange that have been found satisfactory to the
Bank, and consistent with the OPRC recommendations above, including the risk mitigation
measures agreed between MOARD and the Bank following the procurement capacity assessment
reported on below.

7.      Selection of Consultants: Procurement of consultants under the Fertilizer Support Project
would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's Guidelines: Selection and Employment
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 (revised October 2006) and provisions
stipulated in the legal agreement. The procurement plan for the M&E component to be financed by
the Bank has been agreed with the Bank before credit negotiations; it indicates the selection



                                                  84

                              ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


methods, estimated costs, together with prior review requirements and time frame for
implementation.

8.      The M& E component of the Fertilizer Support Project will finance consultant services for
monitoring and evaluation; environmental and social impact assessment studies; technical
assistance to the Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) of MOARD; and for audit services.
The Impact Evaluation of Fertilizer Usage will involve household surveys to track and evaluate the
impact of the supply of fertilizers procured under the project. Contracts above US$100,000 will be
awarded through the use of the Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method in accordance
with paragraphs 2.1 ­ 2.3 of the Bank's Consultants Guidelines. Consulting Services for audit and
other contracts of a standard nature may be procured under the Least Cost Selection (LCS) method
in accordance with paragraph 3.6 of the Bank's Consultants Guidelines. Consulting assignments
costing less than US$100,000 may be procured through the Selection Based on Consultants
Qualification (CQS) method. Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than
US$200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in
accordance with paragraph 2.7 of the Consultants Guidelines. The Single Source Selection method
would be used in accordance with paragraph 3.9 of the Bank's Consultant Guidelines. Small
contracts such as for assisting in the preparation of the environmental and social impact assessment
study and management plan and the contract for the provision of technical assistance over a one
year period that can be undertaken by individual consultants would be procured in accordance with
Section V of the Consultants Guidelines.

9.      Institutional Arrangements: Fertilizers will be procured by the importer(s) selected and
allocated foreign exchange through the well-established procedures overseen by the Foreign
Fertilizer Procurement Committee (FFPC).           FFPC uses the Agricultural Marketing Sector
(Department) of MOARD as its secretariat. The foreign exchange would be channeled to the
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) but the importer(s) would open Letters of Credit (L/C) in favor of
their supplier(s) at the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE).             The M&E studies will be
implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) of MOARD, however the
selection of consultants will be carried out by the procurement unit in the Department of Finance,
Procurement and Property Administration of MOARD with the assistance of the Procurement
Specialist hired under the Bank financed Rural Capacity Building Project.

Capacity Assessment

10.     The fertilizer procurement is governed by a policy issued by the Council of Ministers and
implemented by FFPC supported by MOARD's Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) to
ensure transparency in allocating foreign exchange to licensed importers for the right quality and
quantity of fertilizers at the cheapest possible price. MOARD has for this purpose developed its
own standard bidding document (SBD) based on the Bank's SBD for the procurement of
commodities. It then monitors the performance of importers, mainly the AISE and cooperative
unions, allocated foreign exchange in procurement and distribution of fertilizers. The following is a
brief description of the procedures followed:

    MOARD determines the farmers' demand for DAP and Urea fertilizers;

    Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED), determines the amount of foreign
exchange available for importing fertilizers;


                                                  85

                              ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


   MOARD determines quantity of fertilizers that can be imported based on the amount of foreign
exchange available;

   MOARD prepares bidding documents and advertises in the local press the invitation allowing
25 days for licensed importers having adequate funds (in ETB) to submit bids to import fertilizers;

   Interested importers which are mainly Cooperative Unions/Federations and the state-owned
AISE, obtain and submit price offers from international fertilizer suppliers;

   Within six days of receipt of bids, the FFPC selects and announces, to NBE and the
participating importers, the winning importer that has submitted a bid with the lowest price offered
by international fertilizers suppliers; and

   The winning importer enters into contract with its international fertilizers importer and opens
L/C at its commercial bank.


Procurement Risks and Mitigation Measures

11.    Under the quick disbursing component of Fertilizer Support Project, the key
procurement risks include: (i) fraud and corruption in the process; (ii) reduced competition among
importers for reasons of inadequate capacity to perform the large contracts; (iii) the participation of
AISE, which is Government-owned; and (iv) over invoicing by importers thereby defeating the
principle of economy. The risk to Procurement Management under the FSP is rated HIGH. To
mitigate these risks, the following procedures have been agreed between the Recipient and the
Bank:

            MOARD prepared bidding documents for the procurement of fertilizers;

            The AISE, as an Agent delegated by other domestic importers of fertilizers, had
            purchased those bidding documents and issued to potential foreign suppliers of
            fertilizers;

            AISE would advertise extension of the bid submission date from October 27, 2008 to
            November 11, 2008 in the dgMarket, and national press of wide circulation and issues
            revised bidding documents;

            AISE will publicly open the bids from foreign suppliers, and submit its Bid Evaluation
            Report (BER) to the Foreign Fertilizer Procurement Committee (FFPC);

            FFPC will review AISE's BER and upon acceptance submit to the MOARD;

            The MOARD will review and approve the BER and the winning foreign supplier(s);

            FFPC notifies AISE of allocation of foreign exchange in a letter which includes the
            World Bank's provision for Fraud and Corruption and the World Bank's right to audit
            the AISE. This letter will also require AISE to submit two conformed copies of its
            contracts with foreign supplier(s) as per the draft contract contained in the revised
            bidding documents mentioned above;

            AISE will then sign contract(s) with its foreign supplier(s) and submit two conformed
            copies of each contract to MOARD; and




                                                86

                             ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


              AISE will be buying the allocated foreign exchange by putting up the equivalent local
              currency (ETB) to the CBE selling the foreign exchange under authority of the National
              Bank of Ethiopia.


12.     Under the M&E Component, the procurement risks include: (i) the limited knowledge of
consultants' selection under Bank financing among MOARD staff; (ii) limited skills in procurement
planning; and (iii) poor procurement record keeping. The risk to procurement management under
the Fertilizer Support Project is rated HIGH. To mitigate these risks, MOARD would use the
services of the experienced Procurement Specialist working for the Bank-financed Rural Capacity
Building Project to: (i) support the Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) and the MOARD
procurement section in conducting the procurement of the M&E consultants; (ii) support the
selection planning; and (iii) set up a satisfactory procurement data management system. Fertilizer
Support Project project staff will be invited to the procurement training planned for the PSNP
project staff in November 2008. The Prior Review Thresholds for this component of Project have
therefore been set as per the table below.

Table of Thresholds
           Category                  Prior Review Threshold                 National Short List

Procurement Plan

13.     The selection plans for the M&E Component have been agreed between the Recipient and
the project team before negotiations and will be posted on MOARD's database and in the Bank's
external website.

Frequency of Procurement Supervision

14.     In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the M&E
study will be used to monitor procurement performance. Post review of procurement actions,
excepting those under the quick-disbursing component, will be conducted during the semi-annual
supervision missions.

 ANNEX 2 D: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS

A. Introduction

15.     This financial management (FM) assessment was conducted in accordance with the
Financial Management Practices Manual issued by the Financial Management Sector Board with
particular reference to the FM arrangements for emergency loans. The objective of the assessment
is to determine whether the implementing entity has acceptable financial management arrangements
to ensure that: (i) the emergency loan funds are used only for the intended purposes in an efficient
and economical way; (ii) the preparation of accurate, reliable and timely periodic financial reports;
and (iii) safeguard the entities' assets. Under OP/BP 10.02, borrowers (recipients) and project
implementation entities are supposed to have and maintain adequate financial management systems
which include budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds flow, financial reporting and auditing
arrangements to ensure that they can readily provide accurate and timely information regarding
project resources and expenditures. These arrangements are deemed acceptable if: (a) they are
capable of correctly and completely recording all financial transactions and balances relating to the
project resources; (b) if they can facilitate the preparation of regular, timely and reliable financial
statements; (c) safeguard the project's assets; and (d) are subject to auditing arrangements
acceptable to IDA. As part of the FM assessment, the team visited the Federal Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development (MOARD) and the Agricultural Input Supplies Enterprise
(AISE).

B. Components

    1. Fertilizers Component: The import of fertilizers comprises the main part of the whole
        project covering a cost of about US$249.6 million. This is mainly to provide support
        through necessary foreign exchange, to public or private entities, including cooperative
        unions and state owned agricultural input supply enterprise, to import significant share of
        the demand of fertilizer for the 2009-10 season.

    2. Monitoring and Evaluation Component: This component will cover up to US$400,000 and
        is to support the monitoring system to track the imports, and the various steps along the
        input distribution system, to assess the impact of the Project for the beneficiary farm
        households.

C. Country Public Financial Management Issues

    1. The Federal Government of Ethiopia has been implementing a comprehensive Public
        Financial Management Reform with the full support of the developing partners including
        the Bank. For a number of years, the Expenditure Management and Control sub-program
        (EMCP) of the government's civil service reform program (CSRP) has been the main
        instrument of support to the Public Financial Management Reform. EMCP has developed a
        revised strategic plan to implement the nine components of the sub-program. Mobilization
        behind the EMCP (in terms of financial and human resources) is a key component of the
        Public Sector Capacity Building Program (PSCAP) and has now been considered a priority
        in order to achieve further improvement in all aspects of financial management. Recent
        reviews of the program show a marked improvement in budget formulation, cash


                                                  89

                        ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


   management, procurement, disbursement, accounting and reporting. Further support to the
   PFM is envisaged under the proposed Protection of Basic Services II (PBS-II) Project.

2. The improvements in the PFM reform have been further confirmed by the recently
   completed Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR) and the Fiduciary Assessment (FA) that
   have shown that Ethiopia has made significant progress in strengthening its public financial
   management in recent years. The JBAR, which was conducted by the Bank in collaboration
   with other donors, reviewed the Public Financial Management (PFM) system using the
   Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework. Out of the sixteen
   indicators covered under this review, fourteen were on government's systems for public
   expenditure planning, budgeting and reporting. Two indicators assessed donor performance.
   Ethiopia scored high on seven of the fourteen indictors, i.e. macroeconomic management,
   including aggregate fiscal discipline and minimizing fiscal risks. The JBAR observed
   satisfactory progress in budgeting and accounting reform but noted that budget reporting
   and quality needs improvement.

3. The Overview of the PEFA assessment report is as follows: An evaluation of Public
   Financial Management (PFM) performance in Ethiopia has been conducted in early 2007
   based on an international reference framework ­ the PEFA or Public Expenditure and
   Financial Accountability framework. The assessment was done at the federal and regional
   levels and two separate reports were issued. Seven regions were included in the assessment.
   The assessment report issued in April 2007, which is still in its draft form, observed
   significant improvement in the area of financial management at regions, including
   budgetary transparency in recent years, robust budget preparation, regular internal audit
   scrutiny and follow up of internal audit recommendations, timeliness of in-year and annual
   financial reports, and mutual supportiveness of the federal and regional Auditor Generals.
   Nonetheless, the report noted that the quality and nature of internal audit is uneven
   throughout the regions. It also reported untimely clearance of suspense accounts and that
   some regions are still experiencing significant delays in producing timely in-year and end of
   year information. The report further identified capacity limitations in reviewing annual
   budgets.

4. A country's FA completed in 2005 noted that considerable progress has been made in
   implementing PFM reforms in both federal and regional levels. Despite the progress made,
   there are a number of areas for improvement which include budget processes, internal
   controls and cash management. There is need for further improvements in financial
   reporting (reducing delays in in-year and annual financial reporting), internal audit, external
   audits and scrutiny of public finances.

16.     In the view of the above table, showing that the inherent risk and the control risk are both
Moderate, the overall risk rating is Moderate.

E. Implementation Arrangements

17.     The MOARD through its Agricultural Marketing Sector (Department) will be responsible
for the overall management of the project. MOARD will look after the technical implementation of
the imports. MOARD will be responsible for maintaining the designated account for the project.

18.     As noted in Annex 2. A (Project Description), the first phase import of fertilizers would
include the import of 150,000t DAP and 75,000t urea, the cost of which would amount to a
significant share of the fertilizer demand for the 2009-10 season the total amount of the IDA
Grant/Credit for the Project. The remaining will be used for the subsequent phase(s) of importation.

19.     The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) has an established arrangement to regulate the
importation of quality fertilizers to farmers through one qualified importer, a state-owned
enterprise, AISE on behalf of other licensed fertilizer distributors (see Annex 2. C: Procurement
Arrangements). All importers are expected to report to MOARD on quarterly basis on the imports,
sales and distributions they have made. The content of these reports is:

    1. Summary of fertilizer import status, depicting the amount procured, imported and the status
        of under shipment
    2. Fertilizer procurement status, depicting the name of the importer, the quantity procured,
        country of origin and the status of the floated date, the bid date, the LC date and the date of
        the import and,
    3. Fertilizer sales report by regions.

F. Fund Flows and Disbursements

20.     MOARD will open a Designated Account (DA) for this project at the National Bank of
Ethiopia (NBE). This DA will be used for both the fertilizer import and the M&E component.

Import of fertilizers:

21.     As noted above, the first phase of fertilizer import being initiated on about October 3, 2008
is estimated to cost most of the financing provided by the IDA Credit; the tendering process for the
second batch of fertilizer is expected to be completed before the first shipment of fertilizer arrives
in the country. Since the Government needs the foreign exchange to be provided to importers, the
task team determines in line with OP12.00 para. 5 that 100 percent advance amounting to the cost
of the first phase of fertilizers imports will be released to the DA on effectiveness of the
Credit/Grant. The procurement process is as outlined in Annex 2 C (Procurement Arrangements).

22.     The payment process for the import is envisaged as follows: A commercial bank opens a
Letter of Credit (L/C) for the selected importer(s) in favor of the supplier against remittance by the




                                                  92

                                  ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


importer of the local currency equivalent amount of the foreign currency-denominated L/C.85 This
is done once a contract agreement has been reached between the importer and the supplier. Payment
to the supplier is made on delivery of the fertilizers as stipulated in the L/C.

23.      The payment process to the supplier by the commercial bank is envisaged as follows:
Based on the contract agreement between the supplier and AISE, the commercial bank will pay the
agreed percentage to the supplier up on receiving the necessary documents from the supplier's bank
ensuring that the fertilizer have been loaded on the ship in the agreed quantity and quality. The
commercial bank will certify the documents received and once it has ascertained that all was done
as per the L/C, it will release the agreed percentage of the invoice amount to the supplier. The
remaining amount will be paid when the fertilizer arrives at the port of discharge and AISE assures
that it has received the same in good order.

24.      In effect therefore, the commercial bank buys foreign exchange from the National Bank of
Ethiopia and sells foreign exchange to AISE; and facilitates the payment to the supplier.

25.      MOARD will submit to IDA quarterly (as part of Interim Financial Report - IFR) a
Summary of the total eligible imports made from the DA, which is to be backed up by the source
documents received from AISE.

26.      Transfer of domestic currency proceeds into the government's treasury account: As noted
above, the Bank would disburse the loan proceeds into a DA. The DA would form part of the
country's official foreign exchange reserve at the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE).                               The
government would promptly credit ETB equivalent to its central treasury account that is used to
finance regular budget expenditures. The Government would submit a written confirmation to the
Bank within 30 days of disbursements with supporting details.

27.      A Safeguards Assessment of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was done by the IMF in
2001. The 2008 IMF Article IV consultation report notes that the NBE has made progress in
implementing the recommendations. The task team is satisfied as to the effectiveness of these
controls.

28.      As discussed in para. 83 of the main part above, the Government, the IMF and Bank, and
other Development Partners will monitor through instruments such as the Public Finance
Assessment (PFA) and the semi-annual Joint Budget Assessment Reports (JBARs) the fiscal impact
of this transaction, i.e. the reduction in domestic borrowing.

The M&E component:

29.      Disbursements will be on the basis of IFRs. An initial advance equivalent to 6-months
estimated expenditure will be transferred to the DA. Funds will be transferred from the DA opened


85In practice, this payment is normally effected through one of these processes: (a) the importer pays 100% of the ETB
equivalent to the commercial bank before the L/C is opened; (b) the importer pays 30% of the invoice amount in ETB
equivalent to the commercial bank (drawing from its own resources or from its regular Overdraft facility already
established with the commercial bank for its regular business purposes). For the remaining 70%, the commercial bank
provides the importer "a merchandising loan" with collateral being the shipped goods. The importer repays this amount
when the goods are sold.

                                                          93

                              ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


at the NBE to the MOARD's separate ETB account, and payments will be made from this account.
Subsequent replenishments will be on the basis of actual utilization stated in the IFRs and forecasts
for the next 2 quarters.

         (US$249.6 m)



G. Accounting and Internal Controls

30.     Import of fertilizers: AISE as the lead importer will maintain and keep the import
activities in its records. As evidence of the eligible imports made, the MOARD finance department
will receive from AISE copies of the source documents of the eligible imports. No accounting
entry will be passed by the ministry but rather the source documents, evidencing the eligible
imports will be stored and a summary statement of eligible imports will be prepared. This summary
statement of eligible imports will be sent to the Bank. The source documents serving as an
evidence of eligible imports will include:

    1. Copy of Bill of loading, airway bill, etc
    2. Certified copy of the chamberized invoice (Commercial invoice)
    3. Country of origin certification
    4. Packing list

31.     MOARD will properly file the source documents and send copy of the statement of eligible
expenditures to IDA as part of the quarterly IFR.

32.     The M&E component: The Project Finance department of MOARD will be responsible for
maintaining and recording the activities of this component. The unit will use the Governments
accounting policies and procedures, the modified cash basis of accounting will be used to record the
transactions of this component. One financial management staff will be assigned from the existing
accounting staff of the ministry. If the accounts department of the ministry is overstretched with
different project accounts, a possible alternative is the hiring of an accountant. Since there will be

                                                   94

                             ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


limited work load on this project, the hired accountant could also assist the understaffed projects
handled by the same ministry such as the Rural Capacity Building Project (RCBP).

H. Financial Reporting

33.    Fertilizers: Once the source documents of the imports are obtained by MOARD, it will be
properly filed by the finance department. The statement of eligible imports will be filed by
MOARD and a copy should be sent to IDA as part of the IFR within 45 days of the end of each
fiscal quarter.  The format of this statement was agreed between MOARD and the Bank at
Negotiations.

34.    Interim financial report (IFR) will be submitted to the bank within 45 days of the end of
each fiscal quarter for both components. The IFR should include a statement showing for the period
and cumulatively (project life and /or year to date) actual and planned cash receipt and payments by
main income and expenditure classifications and beginning and cash balance of the project. The
format of the IFR was agreed with MOARD at the Negotiations.

I. External Audit

35.    The statement of eligible imports submitted to the MOARD, the DA and the financial
statement for the M&E component will be subject to external audit. A single audit opinion would
be provided on the project financial statements which would include:

    1. The consolidated statement of eligible imports
    2. The Designated Account held by MOARD
    3. The financial statements for the M&E component

36.    Since the Federal Auditor General is responsible for auditing all Government funds, it will
conduct the audit or assign other external auditor to the project. The external auditors, acceptable to
IDA, will be appointed within 2 months of the Date of Effectiveness. The terms-of-reference for the
external auditors were agreed at Negotiations. The audit report, along with the management letter
will be submitted by MOARD to IDA with in 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. The audit

J. Further Assessment

37.    The Agricultural Input Supplies Enterprise (AISE), a public sector agency (parastatal)
which is engaged in importing mainly fertilizers and other agricultural inputs, is the importer
selected by the Government to handle the bulk imports. A financial management assessment of

K. Supervision Plan

38.   This is an emergency project in response to the Food Crisis that will be managed by
MOARD. Bank's supervision will be as intensive as possible during the project implementation to
ensure that the funds are used for the intended purpose and also provide support when needed.
Hence quarterly supervision missions will be carried during the year to support the project
implementation.

L. Financial Covenants
   1. MOARD will submit the audited project accounts to IDA within six months after the end of
      each recipient fiscal year. The fiscal year ends on 7 July of each year.
   2. MOARD will submit unaudited interim financial reports (IFR) to IDA forty five days after
      the end of each quarter.

M. Financial Management Action Plan
   1. MOARD will appoint auditors within two months of effectiveness.
   2. MOARD will assign one FM staff from its existing accounting staff for this project.

Annex 2 D Attachment:        Agricultural     Inputs   Supplies   Enterprise  (AISE)    ­   Financial
Management Assessment Report

I. Background

39.      As per the project description in Annex 2 A and the procurement procedures in Annex 2C,
the procedure that the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MOARD) has adopted to
import the fertilizers needed by the country is through the FFPC/MOARD tender procedures.

40.      In the first tender procedure over 150,000 tons of DAP and 75,000 tons of urea, AISE has
delegated by other importers to import fertilizer into the country. Therefore this report is to assess
the capacity of AISE in financial management, inventory control and distribution. As part of the
FM assessment, the team visited the Agricultural Inputs Supplies Enterprise (AISE).

II. Establishment of AISE

41.      The enterprise was established on 13 Yekatit 1986 E.C as an autonomous public enterprise
by council of ministers regulation No. 177/1986 with an authorized capital of Br. 22,432,000 which
is totally paid up in cash & in kind. It has a limited liability. AISE is a financially independent
public enterprise. It runs the import business by the sales it makes and through the overdraft facility
it gets from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE). It receives no subsidy from Government.

42.      The enterprise is under the privatization and public enterprises supervising agency. It is
managed by a board chaired by the state minister of the ministry of inland revenues. The board
members include representatives from the privatization and public enterprises supervising agency,
Ministry of justice and AISE. AISE has also an audit committee which reports directly to the
privatization and public enterprises supervising agency.

43.      AISE has 7 branches, more than 86 sales centers and 29 marketing offices through out the
country- located in the main regions of the country namely Tigray (Mekelle), Adama and Nekemt
(Oromia), Addis Ababa, Dessie and Bahir dar (Amhara) and Awassa (SNNPR).

III. Fertilizer import process

44.      The first phase of fertilizer import being initiated on about October 3, 2008 is estimated to
cost a large share of the amount of the financing provided by the IDA Credit. AISE has emerged as
the sole importer for this first batch of fertilizers.

45.      The payment process for the import is envisaged as follows: The CBE opens a Letter of
Credit (L/C) for the AISE in favor of the supplier against remittance by the importer of the ETB
equivalent amount of the foreign currency-denominated L/C. Payment to the supplier is made on
delivery of the fertilizers as stipulated in the L/C. In practice, this payment is normally effected
through the following process. The importer pays 30 percent of the invoice amount in ETB
equivalent to the commercial bank drawing from its regular Overdraft facility already established
with the commercial bank for its regular business purposes. For the remaining 70 percent the
commercial bank provides AISE "a merchandising loan" with collateral being the shipped goods.
The importer repays this amount when the goods are sold.

                               ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT



1. Budgeting

46.     AISE has a five year strategic plan and, based on that, develops its annual operational
budgets. The budget is prepared by management and presented to the board for approval. There is a
budget section under the finance department which notifies all departments and sections, the budget
for the year. This department is responsible for variance analysis. AISE's current market share is
about 45 to 50 percent of the country's fertilizer need and hence they have the experience to import
the stated fertilizers in bulk.

2. Accounting

47.     The account of AISE is semi-computerized. The enterprise is using a database system
centrally. Bank reconciliation is made on monthly basis.

48.     The finance department has currently 31 accountants, including the sales centers.

49.     AISE will maintain and keep the records of the import activities in its records. As evidence
of the eligible imports made, AISE will send to MOARD's Finance Department copies of the
source documents of the eligible imports. The source documents serving as an evidence of eligible
imports, to be sent to MOARD will include:

    1. Copy of Bill of lading, airway bill, etc
    2. Certified copy of the chamberized invoice (Commercial invoice)
    3. Country of origin certification
    4. Packing list

2. Internal Control and Internal Auditing

50.     AISE has satisfactory internal controls in place to ensure that the all funds are to be used for
the intended purposes. There is satisfactory level of segregation of duties and approval and
authorization regulations are clearly laid out. AISE has a finance manual serving as a guide to all
finance staff.

51.     AISE has an internal audit department performing post audit activities on all the financial
transactions of the entity. The internal audit department at AISE is adequately staffed for reviewing
the activities of the fertilizer import made through out the year. The internal audit department
produces quarterly report and submits the same to the audit committee. The audit committee
oversees the action taken by the respective departments. The internal audit department visits
selected sales centers on a monthly basis and produces a report based on their inventory control and
distribution. This is part of the report that the internal audit reports to the audit committee on a
quarterly basis.

3. Inventory Control

52.     AISE has adequate inventory control procedure. The stock control section under the finance
department together with the purchase & distribution department are responsible for inventory
control. The inventory control procedure in AISE is as follows:

53.     Once the contract for import of fertilizers is signed with the supplier, the AISE procurement,
transit and distribution division will sign agreements with local transporters to deliver the fertilizers
from the port to the designated destinations. The agreement with the transporters is made before
arrival of the fertilizers so as to avoid delayed transportations. The agreement with the transporters
includes a clause which states that the transporters will be made liable for shortage of fertilizer bags
when received by the central warehouses.

54.     When the fertilizers are ready for dispatch from the supplier at the port of loading, an
inspection company will inspect the quality and quantity of the fertilizers and will send a report of
the status to AISE. Once the fertilizer reaches port of discharge (Djibouti port), an inspection
company along with the transistor of AISE, will inspect the fertilizer received and produce two
reports independently. AISE uses the Maritime inland transit services parastatal as its transistor.
Once the fertilizers are inspected, the maritime will produce a way bill and it gives a copy to the
inland transporter. The way bill indicates the quantity of fertilizer and the destination as to where
the specific vehicle has agreed to deliver. The fertilizers will then be distributed to the different
central warehouses where the store keeper of AISE and a representative of CBE will receive the
goods and produce a report of the safe arrival.

55.     The CBE has interest in the imported fertilizers since it is imported by 70 percent of
merchandizing loan as explained above. The stock is well controlled both by CBE & AISE. AISE
conducts surprise and end-of-year stock counts.

4. Distribution mechanism

56.     AISE will sell the fertilizers to the cooperatives through the different central warehouses
located in the main regions of the country namely Tigray (Mekelle), Adama and Nekemt (Oromia),
Addis Ababa, Dessie and Bahir dar (Amhara) and Awassa (SNNPR).

57.     AISE will make quarterly reports to MOARD as indicated below.

Reports to MOARD

 58.    The Government of Ethiopia (GOE) has an established arrangement to regulate the
 importation of quality fertilizers to farmers through either a state-owned enterprise or other
 licensed fertilizer distributors. All importers are expected to report to MoARD on quarterly basis
 on the imports, sales and distributions they have made. The content of these reports is:

    1. Summary of fertilizer import status, depicting the amount procured, imported and the status
        of under shipment

5. Auditing

59.    AISE has audited its statements up to July 7, 2007. The audit report is not yet finalized but
the draft has been received. The auditors issued qualified opinion for the last three years due to long
outstanding liabilities shown on the financial statements.

62.                        The total value of fertilizer imports for the 2009 belg and meher production season depends
on the assumption for the total imports and, even more crucially, on the prices at the time of actual
procurement. A look at historical trends reveals that the recent prices increases (see Figure 1
below) are accounting for the vast share of increased value and foreign exchange requirements for
the import of fertilizer.

Note: Data for 2008 is an estimate. Data for 2009 is based on projected fertilizer price data and MoRADs conservative
fertilizer demand scenario.


63.                        The Government has three 2008/09 import quantity targets/scenarios, based on different
methods to estimate the `demand': (i) PASDEP targets: 756,000 tons; (ii) demand estimated by
DAs and aggregated through the Bureaus of Agriculture and Rural Development: 713,000 tons; and
(iii) a more modest demand based on an extrapolation of the last three years' demand: 550,000 tons.
The more modest estimate is a 25 percent increase in quantity over 2008, still a considerably high
increase compared to previous years.86 However, according to MOARD's records, total stocks in
2008 have decreased by about 50,000 tons, so that an import of 550,000 tons would relates to an
increase in fertilizer utilization of only about 12 percent.

64.                        The actual price to be paid for imported fertilizers depends on the development of
international fertilizer markets. The historical trends show that price changes for the import of
fertilizer in Ethiopia have been in line with the price increases of Sub-Saharan Africa in general
(see Figure below). In line with substantial fluctuations in world markets, there are uncertainties
about the development of fertilizer prices and quantities, and how they will prevail by the time
farmers making a decision about input use. A deterioration (increase) in the cereal-to-fertilizer
ratios may imply that the domestic demand for fertilizer is less than MoRAD's most conservative
estimate of about 550,000 tons. However, even if the 2009 aggregate fertilizer demand were lower
than this estimate, additional financing support would still be needed to match the historically high
level of fertilizer prices. Moreover, the actual demand will depend largely on the farmers' price


86None of these demand estimates fully takes into account the change of farmer demand based on price response. The
estimates might therefore be an overestimate as farmer's revealed demand of fertilizer at high prices might decrease.
However a precise estimate are challenging because they would depends on farmer's forward looking expecations,
which inter alia, are depended on unpredictable rainfall patterns, domestic and international price levels, and other
factos.

                                                                                                                  102

 65.              The assumptions used for the forecast of foreign exchange requirements by MOARD is that
 importers will have to pay the estimates based on current prices; price estimates shown below are
 from June 2008. Even in MOARD's most modest scenario (iii) the total fertilizer import value
 increases to about US$654 million, US$387 million more than in 2007/08 (see table below).87
 Nevertheless, the scenario shows that the cost of fertilizer import will increase steeply.

66.               More recently observed prices show a significant moderation compared to MOARD's
assumption or the price peaks around August 2008.                                                                                        In particular, the price for urea dropped
dramatically after the onset of the global financial crisis and the drop in energy prices. Based on
current (end-October) spot prices and MOARD's conservative quantity assumptions, the total cost of
fertilizer import for the 2009 season would be around $286 million, only little more than Ethiopia
paid last season for a considerable lower quantity imported.




 87  One might want to question whether even MOARD's most modest scenario might not still be an overestimate of
 actual demand at currently high prices and, significantly, given foreign exchange shortages. However, the generally
 positive development of the input to output price ratio in the following Annex provide an indication that farmers will
 indeed demand significant amounts of fertilizers, despite their high prices.

                                                                                                                   103

                 ANNEX 2 G: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF FERTILIZER USE

67.     The proposed emergency Project does not introduce new technologies or approaches, but
ensures that technologies that are established and have been practiced by Ethiopia's farmers for
many years can also be applied in 2009. In other words, the `without project' scenario would be
one where US$250 million worth of fertilizer demanded by farmers ­ most likely more than half of
total estimated demand ­ would not be available to them due to foreign exchange constraints.

68.     If the project does not provide the necessary foreign exchange to import fertilizer, farmers
will not have the choice whether to apply it or not. A lack of significant amounts of fertilizer would
be highly costly for the country and those farmers that regularly use fertilizer. This hypothesis is
supported by the fact that fertilizer is largely unsubsidized and has been applied by millions of
smallholder farmers for many years.

69.     The following analysis evaluates the profitability of fertilizer use in Ethiopia under present
and foreseeable price ratios.

Fertilizer-Grain Price Ratios

70.     The price ratios for urea and DAP fertilizers to an index of cereal prices in Ethiopia are
presented in the table below.       It shows that these price ratios are currently well below their
historical levels. Although prices of fertilizer are extremely high, domestic cereal prices have
increased even further. The Ethiopian relative prices diverge from those on global markets because
fertilizer prices are more closely linked to global trade than domestic grain prices, which react
strongly to domestic supply shocks (i.e. droughts, floods), regional factors (i.e. bumper harvests in a
few key producing zones), and are subject to price expectations by farmers.

71.     Fertilizer prices correspond quite closely to international markets as all fertilizer is imported
and there are no trade barriers or taxes other than foreign exchange distortions. Fertilizer prices at
farm gate, however, tend to lag behind international prices given the time difference between
international procurement and actually purchase by farmers ­ and the fact that most
importers/distributors, in particular the cooperatives, sell fertilizer at procurement costs plus
handling, storage, etc. costs and only a small profit margin. Ethiopia's grain market, on the other
hand, is rather isolated. There are virtually no exports and imports of grain except for those under
food aid.

72.     As the table below shows, the price of fertilizer relative to grain in 2008 had fallen by about
40 percent relative to levels in 2001 and 2002 despite the increase in fertilizer prices on global
markets. Hence, given today's fertilizer-output price ratios the application of fertilizer would be
more profitable than in previous years, in particular given the October 2008 significant drops in
international fertilizer prices, which get transmitted into the domestic market.

Notes:   a. Fertilizer prices for 2000 to 2004 are average prices across 21 sites in Ethiopia; data for 2005 to 2008 are
sales prices of the AISE. Data for 2009e is an estimate based on projected fertilizer procurement prices, assuming a 35
percent level in cereal price level increase; 2009f indicates a 70 percent cereal price level increase.
b. Real prices of fertilizer are calculated using the national CPI for July of each year shown.
c. The index of real prices of the four major cereals is calculated using average real wholesale prices for an October-
September crop marketing year.


73.      A similar price ratio measure is that between the price per kg of nutrient and the price per kg
of grain output (PN/PO). Using world prices this ratio is generally between 2 and 4 depending on
the crop (farmers receive higher prices for wheat than maize) and the nutrient (phosphate is usually
higher priced than nitrogen) and general level of development and infrastructure. The ratio during
the Green Revolution in Asia was around 2-3 for wheat, but most evidence suggests that the ratio is
more than double that in most African countries (Morris et al., 2007).

74.      Fertilizer-grain price ratios have been broadly within these ranges for Ethiopia and
somewhat more favorable than for most African countries. In the 2008 crop season, incentives are
estimated to have significantly improved since domestic fertilizer prices were based on 2007 world
prices before the major run up in world prices, while domestic grain prices have risen sharply since
then.

75.      Fertilizer prices in 2009 at the farm level are uncertain and will be based on the global
prices over the next few months and costs of transport. The long lead time of many months to
procure, import, and distribute the fertilizer and await the 2009 main harvest at the end of the year
also should be taken into account. Hence, projected farm-level fertilizer prices for 2009 have been
estimated under two assumptions:

    1. Upper-bound estimate--margins from FOB to CIF (lagged one year) and from CIF to farm
         level are fixed as a percentage of fertilizer prices--that is, margins are assumed to have
         increased in line with fertilizer prices due to higher freight charges and internal transport




                                                             105

                                 ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


         and handling costs.88 This likely represents an overestimate since many of the domestic
         costs of distribution are non-tradables not linked to fertilizer and fuel costs.

    2. Lower-bound estimate--margins from FOB to CIF (lagged one year) and from CIF to farm
         level are fixed in dollar value based on margins in recent years.89 These margins do not
         account for higher international and domestic transport costs in 2008 and 2009.

76.      For both estimates, grain prices in 2009 are assumed to be the same in dollar terms as
estimated prices for mid-2008 (US$550/ton for wheat and US$480/ton for maize).

77.      Grain prices in Ethiopia are also quite variable depending on local supply and demand but
much less related to global prices. Given the current food scarcity, use of constant grain prices is a
conservative assumption.90

demand for fertilizer from 2008 levels, though the analysis is complicated by the fact that the actual
fertilizer demand would be depended on price expectations which are uncertain.

80.      Recent price movements provide increase confidence that price ratios will remain within the
band experienced in recent years and under which use of fertilizer has been profitable in areas with
reliable rainfall. For example, in the third week in October, global spot prices for urea fell by a
reported 35 percent. Measures undertaken by the Government to restrain growth in demand are
likely to result in moderation of increases in food prices in the coming months. Thus the change in
the relative prices of fertilizer and grain are likely to be in the direction to support profitable use of
fertilizer.

81.      The above analysis provides reasonable assurance that farmers in Ethiopia can apply and
profit from application of fertilizer. The following more detailed assessment draws on farm models
to provide another perspective.

Farm-level Production Impacts

82.      Baseline crop models are taken from the Economic and Financial Analysis of Ethiopia's
Irrigation and Drainage Project from 2007. The farm models typify the "average" farm in the Ribb
and Megech command areas,91 producing several crops and operating on an average of 1.5 hectares.
During the original field work it was found that only a few farmers in the area use chemical or
organic fertilizers. These are relatively high potential areas with good infrastructure and access to
markets, and are thus not representative of all areas. Yields also tend to be relatively high, but at
levels shown to be attainable in many other parts of Ethiopia, as well.

83.      Average cropping patterns are assumed to remain unchanged over the coming agricultural
season. In the wet agricultural season 45 percent of the land is used for teff, 20 percent for finger
millet, 13 percent for maize, 12 percent for noug, and 10 percent for rice production. In the dry
season, 20 percent of the farmland is used for vetch and 20 percent for chickpeas. The assumed
cropping intensity is thus 140 percent.

84.      The analysis further assumes two scenarios by comparing the "with" and the "without"
fertilizer situation. Fertilizer applied when rainfall is good can bring a yield increase of 100 percent
relative to the "no fertilizer" alternative. Higher supply responses are possible in Ethiopia (for a
summary see Byerlee and others, 200792), but require additional technological improvements, and
hence have not been assumed for the present purposes. When rainfall is unfavorable, yields decline
20% even if fertilizer is used.

85.      Historical data suggest a low elasticity of output to fertilizer prices, probably reflecting the
low average usage of chemical fertilizers by smallholders and their adherence to standard
recommendations if they do use it (Abarar, Morrissey, and Rayner 200493). Fertilizer prices in

Ethiopia have risen less than cereal prices in recent years. Labor has been valued at ETB18 per
average family member working day.

86.     Import parity prices have been calculated for internationally traded commodities and
chemical fertilizers using World Bank commodity price data for June 2008. The current official
exchange rate of ETB9.68 per US$ been used, applying a 5 percent exchange rate premium
adjustment. Other commodities or inputs have been valued on the basis of the prevailing market
prices using CSA price survey data from June 2008. For non-tradable commodities market prices
have been converted to border prices by applying a standard conversion factor of 0.9.

87.     Under average rainfall patterns fertilizer use is profitable in high potential areas. While
tentative, the analysis confirms the earlier household level evidence, which is based on historic
survey data. According to the farm models and its assumptions, under average rainfall patterns,
fertilizer application in relatively high potential areas generates significant financial benefits at the
farm level. The gain to a farm household applying fertilizer is in the order of about US$200 (or
about ETB40 per family labor day).

88.     By contrast, assuming bad rainfall patterns with a production loss of about 20 percent, the
use of fertilizer will result in heavy financial losses at the farm level (or ETB120 per labor day).
This finding underscores the risks involved in fertilizer application for most households. Based on
historical patterns, Ethiopia faces a major drought on average every five years. The high-potential
areas where most of the fertilizer is applied are more rain secure. Nevertheless, the risk of drought
is significant

89.     The results were found to be sensitive to adjustments in output and fertilizer prices. An
assumed drop in domestic cereal prices of about 15 percent along with constant fertilizer prices as
of June 2008 would result in close to zero incremental returns at the farm level. Moreover, a
rudimentary sensitivity analysis suggests that the "switching" value for profitable use of fertilizer is

                                ANNEX 2: FERTILIZER SUPPORT PROJECT


in the order of about 50 percent of the assumed production increase at the farm level. If production
increases are less than 50 percent, fertilizer application become unprofitable.

Fertilizer Profitability

90.      Fertilizer profitability is commonly expressed as a value-cost ratio (VCR) computed from
representative onfarm data comparing fertilizer treated plots to unfertilized plots as the ratio of the
value of additional yield obtained from fertilizer use to the cost of fertilizer used. A VCR of at least
two is usually considered as a minimum to provide an incentive for fertilizer use in rainfed
environments to cash-constrained small-scale farmers (Kelly et al., 200694). The VCR is in turn
determined by two components: (i) price incentives based on the number of units of output required
to purchase one unit of fertilizer nutrient, i.e. the fertilizer nutrient-grain price ratio (PN/PO)
discussed above, and (ii) the yield response per unit of fertilizer nutrient (O/N). While a discussion
of price ratios has been provided above, the following discusses yield responses of fertilizer at the
aggregate and at the household level.

91.      The fact that fertilizer use has a significantly positive impact on agricultural production at
an aggregate level has been shown by many studies. For example, the World Bank (2006)95 shows
that in Ethiopia the intensity of chemical fertilizer use is statistically highly significant, with an
aggregate production elasticity of about 0.12. This suggests that a hypothetical 1 percent decline
(increase) in the quantity of fertilizer would contribute, on the average, to a 0.12 percent decline
(increase) in total agricultural output. Consequently, a drop in fertilizer application by not just 1
percent but by 400,000 tons or considerable more than 50 percent is estimated to result in a
considerable more than (50 percent times 0.12 equal to) 6 percent drop in Ethiopia's agricultural
production value.96 This would imply a dramatic reduction, in fact halving, of agricultural growth
from the recent reported rate of more than 11 percent.

92.      The impact of reduced fertilizer availability would be mainly felt by the crop sector and, in
particular, the cereal sector. The elasticity with respect to crops or cereals rather than total
agricultural production is higher than 0.12. With a conservative estimate of crop supply response,
removal of 400,000 tons or more of fertilizer (worth about US$250 million) would result in a
reduction of about (16 million tons times 6 percent) one million tons of cereals, worth about
US$500 million (using the same production elasticity; 50 percent times 0.12 equals 6 percent).

93.      Evidence of a positive and significant production effect of fertilizer use appears to be robust
and with little change over time. For example, Yao (1996)97 finds a positive effect on fertilizer use
on aggregate agricultural production for Ethiopia during the 1980s, with production elasticities of

96The impact of a reduction of fertilizer by 300,000 tons would likely be higher than the elasticity (i.e. changes on the
margin) suggests. As evidenced in Figure 1, the marginal productivity of fertilizer use per hectare falls as the
production level rises.

similar magnitude as those presented above. Maize has the highest production elasticity.98 This
analysis also finds that the positive impact of fertilizer can be offset by adverse weather-effects.
The finding that especially rainfall is a key determinant for production is among the single most
robust findings in the aggregate supply response literature for Ethiopia (see for example Abarar,
Morrissey, and Rayner, 2004)99.

94.     Supply response to fertilizer has also been studied through field trials. Following large-
scale demonstration of fertilizer by Sasakawa Global 2000 and the MOARD, which reached about 4
million farmers in the 1990s, Howard et al. (1999) carefully assessed fertilizer use and profitability
for farmers in Oromya Region who had participated in and "graduated" from the program. Yield
responses ranged from 16 to 32 kg of grain per kg of fertilizer nutrient for maize with improved
varieties and hybrids. This response is within the range for improved varieties of maize in East and
Southern Africa (Kelly, 2006; p. 51), although likely to be higher than farmers achieve under
normal field conditions.

95.     Another alternative method to assess the average production impacts to fertilizer at the
household level is to compare the net output values of households with and without fertilizer use.
We use data from Christiaensen and Demery (2007)100 where the yields are estimated using a
production function and the data are from 15 Ethiopian villages. The return is the value of output
minus any applicable fertilizer costs. Credit costs are here assumed to be in the order of about 10
percent of the estimated crop revenue. Yields in normal years tend to be systematically higher
when fertilizers are used. The average production impact at the household level can reach up to 40
percent.




98Ironically, the cheapest grains are those that respond most to fertilizer use. Available evidence for Ethiopia suggests
that under ideal conditions maize can respond up 4 fold, sorghum, wheat and barley 2-3 times, but teff only up to 100
percent.

Risks

96.     The above analyses shows the significant risks associated with the application of fertilizer.
For instance, in the analysis based on Christiaensen and Demery (2007), in bad years, with 20
percent rainfall below the median rainfall level, the use of fertilizer becomes economically
unprofitable, in particular for teff. Since nearly all agriculture is rainfed, there are significant risks
of drought, especially in the more marginal areas.

97.     Other evidence from household surveys in recent years suggests that inefficient use of
fertilizer may lead to losses, particularly in marginal areas, without use of improved seed, when
fertilizer arrives late, and when extension services are poor (World Bank, 2006101).        Over the past
three years, the Government has made concerted efforts to scale up extension, improve the
timeliness of fertilizer delivery, and make more improved seed available. For the present operation,
the Government and partners are seeking to reduce the risk of late delivery by securing the needed
foreign exchange in a timely manner and accelerating procurement.                  The fertilizer will be
distributed primarily in areas with more secure rainfall. Improvement in the seed sector is a long
term process and is under way. The planned expansion of the extension service is largely complete.

98.     The risks are present but not new, and farmers have applied fertilizers in the past despite
these risks. Indeed, contrary to common perceptions, Ethiopia tends to be a lower risk environment
for agriculture than many other African countries (World Bank, 2006102). About two thirds of the
farm population resides in reliable rainfall zones where most of the fertilizer is used. For these
farmers, the major risk is that fertilizer will not be delivered on time. Given current food scarcity,
and the modest increase in food supply projected for 2009, the risk of a sharp drop in domestic
grain prices is minimal.

99.     In sum, the economic analysis suggests that application of unsubsidized fertilizer as
envisaged under this project (i.e., predominantly in areas with reliable rainfall) is profitable at the
farm level under reasonable assumptions with regard to prices. Risks are significant, and largely
associated with weather as well as farmers' expectations and input decisions about changes in
relative fertilizer grain prices. At the aggregate level, the opportunity cost of not securing the
needed foreign exchange would be on the order of $500 million conservatively estimated, and the
cost would be felt quite immediately rather than at a future time; i.e., not diminished by application
of a discount rate.

I. Projects with Savings

1.      Cultural Heritage Project (Cr. 3632): The project objectives of this LIL are to test and
develop approaches to integrate the conservation and management of cultural heritage into local and
national economic development efforts. After 7 years of implementation, the project has closed on
October 15, 2008. Although the project had implementation difficulties, progress toward meeting the
learning objectives has been largely on track.       The project has completed most of the planned
activities, and the lessons learned will inform the design of the proposed Tourism Development Project
(FY09/10). The cost savings at the end of the project period amount to around US$0.5 million.

2.      Capacity Building for Decentralized Service Delivery (Cr. 3698): The objective is to
enhance decentralized service delivery performance by initiating long-term public sector capacity
building at the federal, regional and municipal levels.       The Project has supported a coordinated
program of implementing civil service reforms, restructuring and empowering local governments, and
strengthening the Ministry of Capacity Building.         The objectives have largely been achieved,
especially in regard to capacity building in 18 municipal governments, and laid the foundation for the
recently approved Urban Local Government Development Project, which will provide significant
funding to these 18 municipalities for improving infrastructure services. The project will close at the
end of December 2008 after 6 years. The cost savings is US$2.0 million.

3.      Public Sector Capacity Building Program Support Project (Cr. 3899): The objectives are
to: (i) improve the scale, efficiency, and responsiveness of public service delivery at the federal,
regional, and local levels; (ii) empower citizens to participate more effectively in shaping their own
development; and (iii) promote good governance and accountability. The project is in its fifth and
final year of implementation and progressing well. Government capacity to plan and deliver gender
sensitive services has improved. Service delivery to citizens has been improved through: one-stop
shop centers, specification of service delivery standards, introduction of complaints handling
mechanisms, improved regulation in taxation, business registration, investment licensing and court
administration. Public financial management capacity has improved through reforms to budgeting,
accounting, cash management, procurement, audit, asset management, financial information systems
and financial regulations and directives. The civil service has introduced a legal framework for
decentralization, an enhanced civil service law, a code of conduct and an improved human resource
management system based on merit-based recruitment, promotions, rewards and sanctions. A culture
of customer-focused and result and performance based delivery is developing in the civil service.
About 60 percent of the project funds have been utilized so far and the project is expected to be
completed by July 2009. The Project is also being cofinanced by several donors (primarily CIDA
US$13.6 million; DFID US$43.6 million; EC US$11.43million; Irish Aid US$8.5 million). The
cancellation of US$20 million will affect the purchase of equipment and some consultancy services,
which are expected only at the end of the project period. Hence, it is clear that the core capacity
building objectives of the project already been met by now, and hence in a narrow sense, the
cancellation will not affect the project objectives.      Given that the underlying capacity building
program, coordinated by the Ministry of Capacity Building, will be a long-term endeavor to which the
Government is firmly committed, there is little doubt that resources (own or external) will continue to
be allocated.

           ANNEX 3: BRIEF ON PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED IDA RESOURCE REALLOCATION



4.      Financial Sector Capacity Building Project (H.2390): The project will assist in building the
foundation for a more transparent, well-governed, well-regulated, and competitive financial sector that
can allocate resources to the private sector more effectively and efficiently, and help ensure better
access to finance for all. Implementation has been slower than expected but has improved after the
appointment of key consultants. Nevertheless the pace remains significantly behind schedule on
several key project activities such as drafting terms of references and recruitment of consulting firms
and contractors to assist the central bank with capacity building. A key challenge has been the highly
cautious and conservative culture of the regulatory authority that has been resistant to change. Overall
performance is moderately satisfactory. Overall disbursement ratio is around 20 percent and the
project is slated to close by June, 2009. With the next supervision mission, consideration will have to
be given to downgrade the project. Given the relatively low interest the counterpart is showing, it is
reasonable to limit the outcome objectives and focus attention on attaining those in the limited time
remaining. The cancellation of US$7 million of potential cost savings is consistent with this approach.



II. Projects with Revised Financing Plans

5.      Irrigation and Drainage (Cr. 4333): The development objective of the project is to
sustainably increase agricultural output and productivity in project areas. The expected overall project
results include: (i) increase in value added per worker; and (ii) increase in value added per hectare.
The project became effective in January 2008. Hence progress is limited. A review of the project
costs indicates that the IDA cancellation of US$10 million from the unallocated category is not
expected to affect project objectives.

6.      Private Sector Capacity Building (Cr. 4027; H 1410): The key objective is to facilitate
increased participation of the private sector in the economy by creating conditions for improving its
productivity and competitiveness.      The project has been under implementation for 3 years, and
following the restructuring in January 2008, there seems to be some improvement in implementation.
Most of the procurement activities have been completed; and the Retrenchment Package for the
Privatization Component is now completed and will soon be implemented.                     The Ethiopia
Competitiveness Facility, a key instrument to provide technical support to private businesses with a
matching grant system, is on track with a Manager in place now. Other smaller components are
moving as planned.       Based on observed improvements, the project is making progress towards
achieving its development objectives. Overall project implementation is rated moderately satisfactory.
The cancellation of US$7.0 million of IDA resources, which is primarily related to local currency
expenditures, for activities such as severance pay, will be borne by Government resources.

7.      Water Supply & Sanitation (Cr. 3901; H. 0850): The objective is to increase access to
sustainable water supply and sanitation services for rural and urban users through improved capacity of
stakeholders in the sector. The project is in its fourth year of implementation. The project is on track
to achieve its development objective. All regions have taken ownership of the National Water and
Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) Program for villages, towns and cities. Rural WaSH Programs have
been introduced in 200 woredas (districts), each having its own Woreda wide WaSH Plan. Some 801
water supply schemes and 195 institutional latrines in schools and Health facilities have been
constructed.    In addition, 12,674 improved household latrines have been constructed from



                                                   114

            ANNEX 3: BRIEF ON PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED IDA RESOURCE REALLOCATION


communities' own resources. Planning, capacity building and immediate service improvement is
underway in 87 small towns and preparations are being made to start planning and capacity building
activities in 30 bigger towns. However disbursements are lagging behind the plan, with only a third of
the resources having been disbursed and the project expected to be closed by March 2010.
Undisbursed balances currently amount to US$69 million. The Project has also received cofinancing
from DFID recently for nearly US$140 million ( 70 million equivalents) with the aim of scaling up
investment in the existing beneficiary woredas and towns and to extend to additional 100 woredas.
Given this and the Government's expressed commitment to fill in shortfalls in local currency
expenditures, the cancellation of US$13 million will not affect project outcomes

8.      Multi Sectoral HIV/AIDS Phase II (H: 2790): The objectives are to: (a) increase access to
prevention services for youth; and (b) sustain access to care and support for people living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and orphans. The implementation of activities is progressing well towards the
universal access to HIV prevention means, care and support in Ethiopia.         The major challenges
identified included scaling up prevention to reduce incidence of new infections and prevention of
mother to child transmission. The massive community mobilization being undertaken appears to have
reduced stigma and discrimination as indicated by an increasing numbers of communities supporting
PLWHA and orphans and an increasing number of people participating in Voluntary Counseling and
Testing. The project is in its second year of implementation. The overall implementation is rated
moderately unsatisfactory as there are some financial and project management issues to be resolved.
Overall disbursements have been about 20 percent so far. Project is expected to close within 18
months. The cancellation of about US$5 million will be covered by Government funds, in the event of
a shortfall and hence the project objectives will not be impacted. The Government is also keen to
integrate HIV/AIDS related interventions into a comprehensive health-sector program and other sector
programs (e.g., education) as soon as possible. For this reason, an extension of the closing date is not
contemplated.

III. Major Project Restructuring

Ethiopia- Food Security Project (Cr. 3646)

9.      Rationale for Restructuring. The Food Security Project (FSP), co-financed by CIDA and
Italian Cooperation trust funds, was approved on May 30, 2002 and became effective on November 26,
of the same year. It was designed as a community driven development (CDD) project with five
components: (i) grants to communities/kebeles for asset building and income generating activities
(IGAs) and for child growth promotion (CGP); (ii) capacity building for woredas, regions, and federal
ministries serving the project's beneficiary communities; (iii) food marketing initiatives; (iv)
communications and public education; and, (v) project administration and impact evaluation. The FSP
operates in four regions of the country: Amhara, Oromia, Tigray and the Southern Nations
Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) and in 93 (out of a total of 274) food insecure woredas.

10.     To date the Project has reached about 300,000 food insecure households with direct support
and a further 70,000 households through investments in community assets. Nevertheless, the number
of households reached is lower than intended because disbursements on the grants component has been
low (53 percent of the allocation to grants in six years of implementation) and revolving funds
established through community grants are not yet being effectively rotated. Moreover, while as a CDD



                                                 115

           ANNEX 3: BRIEF ON PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED IDA RESOURCE REALLOCATION


project, the FSP seeks to empower its beneficiary communities to address food insecurity, there have
been only modest achievements in this respect.

11.     Hence, progress towards the PDO is therefore only moderately satisfactory. The proposed
restructuring seeks to enhance the Project's achievements by inter alia deepening community
participation and decision-making and improving management of revolving funds by extending its
capacity building activities to community level institutions.

12.     The FSP contributes to the Government of Ethiopia's (GoE) larger efforts towards food
security. Its design adopted a rather wide-ranging approach to addressing the needs of food insecure
communities including interventions to promote stronger livelihoods, to help improve access to food
from the market and to engender behavioral change to improve nutrition of children and women. Over
time, additional programs to promote food security and improved nutrition as well as to support the
development of markets have been introduced.               Programs ­ such as the Federal Food Security
Program; 2003, the Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP); 2005, the National Nutrition Program
(NNP); 2008 and the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECEX); 2008 ­either complement the FSP or
have taken over some of its objectives. Recently, the GoE has embarked on a process to develop a
National Food Security Program (NFSP) that brings together different interventions to support food
insecure households under one framework. The proposed restructuring will position the FSP better
within this framework and link FSP interventions more coherently to complementary programs;
thereby enhancing the Project's long term impact.

Proposed changes.
  a. Change in the PDO:            The revised PDO would be: "to build resource base of poorer rural
     households, increase their employment and incomes and improve nutrition levels for their
     children less than five years of age, pregnant and lactating women".                  As such it excludes
     reference to improving access by poorer food insecure households to food from the market as this
     element of the PDO has been achieved outside of the Project. The Project's outcome indicators
     are accordingly adjusted and a revised results matrix is provided below. (Table I).
  b. Cancellation of a small "food marketing initiatives" component: Under this component, FSP was
     to undertake studies that would inform reforms and institution building for (a) improved
     management of food aid to secure a stable price environment for domestic producers and traders,
     (b) establishment of a food market information system, (c) development of a warehouse receipt
     and inventory credit system for traders, and (d) the development of a competitive and efficient
     market in warehousing services sufficient to support a warehouse receipt system.                    These
     activities are being achieved outside the FSP103 ­studies to promote related policy and
     institutional change would be redundant.
  c. Extending capacity building efforts to grassroots institutions and beneficiary communities ­ this
     would allow community grants to be properly managed at the kebele level and the project's
     achievements to be sustained over the longer term. It would also allow community involvement
     and decision making over the project's resources to be deepened..
  d. Adjustment of implementation modalities to: (i) increase responsibility of line bureaus and
     agencies such as regional bureaus of health, the federal cooperative agency and its regional
     counterparts in the oversight of relevant project activities, (ii) introduce better performance and


103Progress on these activities is documented in the consultancy report: Assessment of Performance Component two
(Capacity Building Support) and Component Three (Grain Marketing Initiatives).


                                                       116

            ANNEX 3: BRIEF ON PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED IDA RESOURCE REALLOCATION


      impact monitoring mechanisms, (iii) introduce more flexible credit disbursement arrangements,
      and (iv) definitions related to community grants would be further clarified to indicate
      management of such grants at the kebele level.
  e. Cancellation of US$35 million from the IDA allocation. FSP is entering its final phase of
      implementation during which it will focus on local level capacity building to sustain
      interventions to date; i.e., to ensure proper management and use of community grants already
      provided to beneficiary communities, rather than to continue replenishing such funds. This will
      allow the cancellation of US$35 million from the IDA allocation which would be reallocated to
      the Ethiopia
  f. Extending the credit closing date by one year to June 2010 to properly implement grassroots
      capacity building initiatives and to effectively link the Project's interventions to the newly
      formulated National Nutrition Program (NNP) and the second five-year National Food Security
      Program (NFSP) currently under formulation.

Ethiopia-Rural Capacity Building Project (Cr. 42010)

13.     Rationale for Restructuring. The basis for the restructuring of the project is to increase the
focus on results by strengthening the M & E system and to simplify the design of the project and
reallocating funds among components so as to strengthen important and well-performing activities.
The implementation of the project is in its third year of implementation and behind schedule, largely
due to the complexity of the original Project design as well as the weak capacity of the executing
agency.

Proposed changes.

(i) Change and simplification of PDO.         The original PDO was "to assist Ethiopia to strengthen
agricultural services and systems for improved agricultural productivity, make them more responsive
to clients' needs, and enhance the capacity of producers to become aware of and to adopt economically
viable and environmentally sustainable technologies and practices". The proposed PDO is "to assist
Ethiopia to strengthen agricultural services and systems and make them more responsive to clients'
needs". This is a more focused and more easily measurable objective; the simplified wording
contributes to greater clarity and fits well with the Government's own objectives for the sector.

           ANNEX 3: BRIEF ON PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED IDA RESOURCE REALLOCATION



(ii) Revision of results framework The number of indicators will be reduced together with better
aligning the indicators with the Government's own monitoring and evaluation systems; the outcome
indicators are: (a) Difference in income change of households (M/F headed) between project and non-
project woredas; (b) Difference in productivity changes of main commodity between project and non-
project woredas: (c) Number of new agricultural activities adopted in project kebeles. The revised
intermediary results indicators are shown below.

(iii) Restructuring and reallocation of components and activities: While all Project Components will
remain part of the Project, the design by will be simplified through the cancellation and merging of
some project activities under specific components, specifically:
     a. Component 1: Agriculture Technical Vocational and Education Training: The Component
        remains unchanged.
     b. Component 2: Agricultural Extension: The Farmer Advisory Service Fund (FASF) and the
        Advisory Service Development Fund (ASDF) under Sub-component 2.3 Institutional
        Innovation will be replaced by a Farmer Innovation Fund (FIF) that would fund small scale
        innovations at the request of farmer groups.
     c. Component 3: Agricultural Research: Funding for region-specific research is proposed to be
        channeled through the already established National Agricultural Research Fund (NARF)
        mechanism instead of establishing a competitive fund for each participating region. In addition,
        the capacity building activities under this Component are proposed to be reduced (by about
        US$5.4 million) as the National Agricultural Research System is still undergoing an internal
        Business Process Re-engineering and will have access to other funding sources.
     d. Component 4: Improving Information and Communication Systems within MOARD:                      The
        Component would be completed after the installation of ICT equipment that is currently being
        procured for MOARD. The other activities are proposed for other funding and are cancelled
        under the funding for this Project.
     e. Component 5: Development of Agricultural Market Institutions: The activities for Market
        Policy Support sub-component 5.1 a) are proposed to be cancelled. Sub-component 5.1 would
        only comprise of support for Technology Solutions to the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange
        (ECX). Sub-component 5.2 will focus only on the support for a quarantine facility for the
        export of live animals and not include any activities related to phyto-sanitary standards. The
        total allocation of this Component is proposed to increase (about US$3.0 million) in order to
        respond to the need of the ECX.
     f. Component 6: Project Management: The Component is estimated to be over-budgeted and a
        redeployment of some resources (about US$0.6 million) is proposed.

14.     The project cost savings of about US$13 million will be cancelled and redeployed to the
Ethiopia-Food Crisis Response Program. The reason for these cost savings are: (i) given the slow
implementation progress to day it is unlikely that the project can disburse its funds until its closing date
and `unallocated funds' (about US$7.4 million) can be redeployed; (ii) cancellations from the (net)
redeployment from the Components (about US$3.8 million); and depreciation of the ETB against the
SDR (for IDA funds) and Canadian Dollar (for CIDA funds) (about US$1.8 million).

15.     Analysis. The proposed restructuring will not impact in any significant manner the economic,
financial, technical, institutional or social aspects of the project as originally appraised.           The

           ANNEX 3: BRIEF ON PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED IDA RESOURCE REALLOCATION


Environmental and Social Management Framework of the Project will continue to being implemented
to assess and mitigate negative environmental and social impacts.

16.    Risks. The critical risks mentioned in the Project Appraisal Document remain valid. However,
the proposed restructuring of the project would help to further strengthen commitment and ownership
by the Government and its implementing agencies and thereby reduce the risks to achieve the project's
development objective. Given the experience of implementation to date, capacity constraints that delay
financial reporting and audits are high.

Ethiopia- ICT Assisted Development Project (Cr. 3985)

17.     Rationale for Restructuring. The Project will be restructured and the objectives redefined to
take into account the narrower (simplified) focus of the project. US$10 million will be cancelled and
reallocated to the Food Crisis Response Program. During the Mid-Term review in March-April 2008,
the Government requested that the rural connectivity sub-component be dropped from IDA financing
and the corresponding funds (US US$7.3 million) be reallocated. The Government had identified an
alternate funding source for this sub-component. Since then, in response to the food crisis in Ethiopia,
the Government has proposed the redeployment of US$10 million from ICTAD funds (inclusive of the
US$7.3 million above) to the Food Crisis Response Program. The additional US$2.7 million that is
being cancelled from the project will also be substituted by Government funds.

Proposed Changes.

18.     Revision of PDO: The current Development Objective of the ICTAD project is "To assist
communities improve their livelihood through the use of appropriate Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT) that facilitate increased access to markets, development information, and delivery
of public services."     In light of the Government's request to drop the Rural Connectivity sub-
component and in line with the PASDEP it was agreed that, that the revised PDO would be "To
increase the use of ICTs by communities in project target areas", where a community is defined as
persons living in a specific area or who possess a common interest; and target areas are defined by
geographic locations where project interventions take place. This is a more focused and more easily
measurable objective.

19.     Removal of Remaining Dated Covenants:           The project included three Dated Covenants
pertaining to: (i) the licensing of Community Radios by EBA (fulfilled); (ii) licensing of ISPs by ETA
(partially fulfilled ­ ISPs are licensed but cannot operate due to ETC's network technical service


                                                  121

              ANNEX 3: BRIEF ON PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED IDA RESOURCE REALLOCATION


limitations)105; and (iii) licensing of Rural Connectivity providers by ETA based on public-private-
partnership (PPP) arrangements between ETC and local service providers. The rural connectivity
covenant is no longer relevant since the sub-component is being dropped. Therefore, it is proposed
that there be no dated covenants in the re-structured project.

20.       Revision of results framework:           It is proposed to reduce the number of indicators, and better
align them with monitoring indicators used by Government systems as follows:
          · Increased number of satisfied ICT users in project areas
          · Increased number of ICT-based businesses in project areas

21.       The revised intermediate results indicators are below.

22.       Project Restructuring and re-allocation of funds: The design will be simplified through the
cancellation and merging of some project activities under the two Components, The specific changes
are as follows: (i) the rural connectivity sub-component will be dropped; and (ii) the Training of
Trainers (ToT) for ICT/renewable power equipment maintenance and providing student training
laboratories in existing TVET centers will be scaled up.

23.       The restructuring also include redeployment of US$10 million to the Ethiopia-Food Crisis
Response Program. The reasons for these cost savings are: (i) cancellation of the rural connectivity
sub-component (about US$7.3 million); and (ii) the Government's agreement to swap US$2.7 million
in IDA funds earmarked for local expenditures with their equivalent in ETB. The revised Expenditure
categories are provided below.

24.       Analysis. The proposed restructuring will not impact in a significant manner the economic,
financial, technical, institutional or social aspects of the project as originally appraised. The potential
impact of dropping the rural connectivity sub-component will be compensated for by the Ethiopian
Telecom Corporation's (ETC) ongoing roll-out of national backbone infrastructure and its provision of
telecom services in rural areas, with financing from the Government of China.

25.       Risks. The critical risks mentioned in the Project Appraisal Document remain valid. However,
the proposed restructuring of the project would help to further strengthen project ownership by the
Government and its implementing agencies and thereby reduce the risks to achieve the project's
development objective. Given the experience of implementation to date, capacity constraints that delay
procurement and staffing of implementing agencies are high. An updated risk table is provided in
Table 3.

26.    Risk Rating: The overall project risk rating is assessed as Substantial (higher than the original
Rating of Moderate in the PAD).

Ethiopia-Post Secondary Education Project (Cr. 3984)

27.    Rationale for Restructuring:       The project became effective on April 4, 2005 and will be
closed in September 2009. The restructuring proposed below will allow the cancellation of funds that
have not been utilized and are not expected to be utilized before project closing. Implementation
progress has been unsatisfactory for over one year given considerable delays in implementation of the
University Development component and lack of any progress under the TVET component.                The
project disbursement rate is about 27 percent with only one year of implementation remaining.
Furthermore, institutional capacity has been weak, and inadequate provision of monitoring and
evaluation and technical assistance at the university level have minimized results. The cancellations
combined with the restructuring amendments are designed to strengthen the M&E system, simplify the
design of the project and focus on better performing activities.

28.    The long term objectives of the project will continue to include: (i) strengthening the quality
and availability of post-secondary education (i.e., university and technical/vocational education); (ii)
providing medium term budget support to ensure budgetary allocations in other education sub-sectors
are protected during a capital intensive transition period for post-secondary education; and (iii)
stimulating innovation and modernization at the level of institutions, faculties and departments that
will lead to improved teaching and learning as well as to the realization of self-defined strategic
objectives. These objectives are not expected to be modified or changed.

29.    The project has two main components: (1) University Development and (b) Technical and
Vocational Education (TVET).           The University Development component includes three
subcomponents: (a) Institutional Development Grants (IDGs); (b) System Support Agencies; (SSAs);
and (c) Development Innovation Fund (DIF).            The TVET component consists of the three
subcomponents: (a) Skill Development; (b) Monitoring, Evaluation and Research; and (c) New
Program Development. This second component addressing TVET will be cancelled and all references
to TVET removed.

Summary of proposed changes.
(i)    Cancellation of funds (SDR10,350,000) to be redeployed to the Ethiopia - Food Crisis
       Response Program).
       a. Cancellation of SDR900,000 from Category 1 (b) Goods.
       b. Cancellation of SDR1,850,000 from Category 2 (b) Consultants' services and training
           including audits
       c. Cancellation of SDR3,500,000 from Category (3) Institutional Development Grant
       d. Cancellation of SDR3,000,000 from Category (4) DIF Subproject
       e. Cancellation of SDR1,100,000 from Category (2) (b) Consultants' services and training
           including audits.
(ii)   Percentage of Expenditures: Change the percentage of expenditures to be financed to 100% of
       foreign expenditures and 100% of local expenditures for all categories, thereby cancelling the
       counterpart financing obligation.

           ANNEX 3: BRIEF ON PROJECTS WITH PROPOSED IDA RESOURCE REALLOCATION


(iii)  Change of Implementing Agency: The implementing agency will be changed from the "PPD" to
       "HEPCO"; "HEPCO" means the Borrower's Higher Education Projects Coordinating Office.
(iv)   Clarification of Implementing Arrangements: Schedule 2, Part A, Paragraph 2 will be change
       by adding the following: "strengthening the capacity of MOE for management of expanded
       higher education functions, including support for the Policy and Policy Analysis Department,
       and establishment of three new higher education system supporting agencies, including a
       quality relevance assurance agency, a higher education strategy institute, a national pedagogical
       resource center and institutional pedagogical resource centers, all through the acquisition of
       goods and provision of technical advisory services"
(v)    Revision of results framework. In order to better capture the impact of the PSEP and reflect the
       ongoing activities, the KPIs will be amended to delete references to the TVET component.
       Although some project level indicators were established at the outset of the project, the
       completion of the matrix was delayed because the outcomes of the Five Year Plan (ESDP3)
       were not fully determined at the time the project was taken to the Board. When finalized, they
       were recorded, but not until December 2007. The revised indicators matrix will be included as
       an amendment to the DCA and will include:
           (1) Number of pre-accredited and accredited institutions and programs
           (2) Number of comprehensive Development Innovation Fund proposals submitted and
               successfully implemented, disaggregated by level
           (3) Number of MA and PhDs awarded annually, by gender
           (4) Number of faculty/instructors upgraded through short-term and degree training, by
               gender, with PSEP funds
           (5) Number of university administrators and managers upgraded through short-term and
               degree training by gender, with PSEP funds
           (6) Annual intake of students disaggregated by undergraduate and graduate levels
           (7) Number of students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs disaggregated by
               gender
           (8) Percentage of entering undergraduate students finishing on time, disaggregated by
               gender

30.    Analysis. The proposed restructuring will not impact in any significant manner the economic,
financial, technical, institutional or social aspects of the project as originally appraised.      The
Environmental and Social Management Framework of the Project will continue to being implemented
to assess and mitigate negative environmental and social impacts.

31.    Risks. The critical risks mentioned in the Project Appraisal Document remain valid. However,
the proposed restructuring of the project would help to further strengthen commitment and ownership
by the Government and its implementing agencies and thereby reduce the risks to achieve the project's
development objective. Given the experience of implementation to date, capacity constraints that delay
financial reporting and audits are high.
