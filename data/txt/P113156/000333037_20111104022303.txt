F. Results' Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project aimed to increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009-2010 will
remain on or near the growth trend of recent years. The specific Project Development
Objective was to contribute to Government's efforts to ensure aggregate availability of
supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 agricultural season, adequate to meet
smallholder fanners' priority demands.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Project Development Objectives were not revised.

3. Oiventhis sjtuation; the; Govel'lUtl.eht of Ethiopia sought urgent assIstance from the,
World Bank. The Bank responded by engaging in the desi~ of Ethiopia"s Emergency
Food Crisis Response Program under the Global FoodCrisis Response Program, in
accordance with OPIBP8.00. The Emergency Food Crisis Response Program had two
parts" Fitst,addiiional financing ofUSS 2? million to ~e Ptoauct!ve SafetrNetsProgram
contnbuted to government efforts to sustain thechromcally food Insecure. Second,
US$ 250 million financed the Fertilizer Support Project (FSP),the subject of this report.
The project was designed to addreSs the shortage of foreignexcharige for fertilizer
imports for the 2009-10' agricultural seE;lS()n.. The project was prepared rapidly· because its
pace was dictate&bythe Ethiopian agriCUltural cycle: the project had to become effective

1.1Colltext. at Appraisal

4. Ethiopia's agricultural sector is dominated by cereal production and remains a
major contributor to the economy~a bulwark of food security, and a catalyst of rural
poverty reduction. Any slowdown in agricultural growth affects national growth in gross
domestic product and well-being. Agriculture accounts for an estimated 44 percent of
national gross domestic product, almost 86 percent of exports, and 85 percent of

                                                                          -1-
14.       The project had two components:

      •    The Firtilizer Component (US$ 249.6 million at appraisal). This component
           sought to ensure the availability of chemical fertilizer for the 2009-10 crop season.
           MoARD used project funds to allocate foreign exchapge to the domestic importer
           for paYbig foreign fertilizer suppliers and supervised distribution of that fertilizer
           during~ijtlplementation.                                          "

      •    The Monitoring and Evaluation Component (US$ 0.41nilliol1 afiappraisal). This
           component aimed to track fertilizer imports, track fertilizer distribution, and
           assess the project's impact on beneficiary smallholder farm households.

1.6 Revised Components

15.       The .
              fertilizer project's components were not revised.
                           .


1.7 Oth~r ~jg..ifi~antChanges

16. There was no significant change to the project's design, scope, scale, and
implementation arrangements. The project used approximately US$ 6.2 million less than
expected (remaining funds could not ~ used to buy fertilizer in2010-11 because of
procurement slippages). An additional·l..JS$ 9.3 million was available to the Government
of Ethiopia because the Standard Drawing Rights (SDR) appu:ciated in relation to the US
dollar (seeAImex 1 for detailednumbers)~               "

2. Key Fado~t\ffecting Implementation and Outcomes".

2.1 Projed Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

17. The project's design Was unique in that it solely provided foreign exchange to
support fertilizer imports. The project was.funded by redeploying resources from 12 of
Ethiopia's Bank-financed projects (in an amount equivalent to US$ 137.5 million),
including several agricultural and rural operations. To further support the project,the
Bank added a new grant equivalent to US$ 112.5 million. The Goverm:pent.ofEthiopia's
willingness to restructure about half of its Bank-funded projects to meet this critical need
showed the high priority accorded to jt. The Bank took adv~tage of the flexibility intts
procedures under OPIBP8.00 and the Global Food Crisis Response Program and
responded in a timely manner to effectively meet client interests.

18. The emergency occasioned by the food, fuel, and fertilizer crisis provided very little
time to meet the effectiveness gOl1l1 of December 2008. Hence the project was designed to
use the existing fertilizer -system without addressing policy and organizational reforms
that could have delayed appraisal. Project inception started around May 2008, following
an African Union international· workshop in Pretoria on food crisis responses. The formal
request for assistance from the Government of Ethiopia was sent on August 4,2008,
approved on November 25, 2008, and became effective on December 23, 2008. The



                                                -4-
  fertilizer project was originally approved for 18 months. Following a one-month
  extension, it closed on July 30, 2010.

  19. The task team was backed with generous resources for preparation (see Annex 4),
  resulting in strong staff and consultant support. The lending instrument was considered
  appropriate because (i)~alytical work undertaken during preparation confirmed thatthe
  extreme shortage of foreign exchange· and the downside production .risks of severe
  constraints to fertilizer access were significant and constituted: an emergency situation,
  (ii) it was eligible under the Global Food Crisis Response Program, and (iii) it was
  approved by senior management. Because of several complex aspects (specifically
  regarding risks, the significant lending amount, and soundness of the macroeconomic
  rationale), the project was reviewed more than three times, discussed in internal meetings
  at the regional Vice-President level, and cleared by the Bank's Operations Committee.

  20. Given the unusual circumstances leading to the emergency project, the preparation
  team conducted no detailed analytical work, background studies, or in-depth consultation
  with stakeholders. Earlier studies of the agricultural and rural sector (World Bank 2006;
  Byerlee and others 2007), along with a thorough internal review process, helped to
  partially compensate for analytical gaps. Projects monitoring and evaluation effort was
  intended to increase· knowledge of the agricultural input market. The team also took into
  account the fertilizer demand forecasts from the miIustry's Agricultural Marketing
  Department, but w~ aware of their liinitations.

  21. Because. of the project's urgency and associated visibility in the midst of the crisis,
  project preparation was quite rapid, highly coordinated, and focused on the most
  immediate needs. Due to the high relevance for the country.and associated visibility, the
  core task team was committed and strongly supported by other units.

  22. During project preparation, the Bank and Government of Ethiopia agreed on a
  transparent procurement and international bidding process, allowing fur competition,
  including for importation (see World Bank 2008, Annex 2C). This process led the
- Ethiopian Agricultural Input Supply Enterprise (AISE) to become the sole importer of
  fertilizer since cooperatives and unions (and one private company) judged that signing an
  agent arrangement with AISE was less risky than competing with and possibly not under., .
  bidding AISE.                           .

  2.2 Implementation.

  23. The decline of international fertilizer prices led to higher-than-planned fertilizer
  imports. The project was conceived when fertilizer prices were very high, but by the time
  the loan became effective and the international bidding process was concluded, global
  fertilizer prices had dropped significantly. Prices ofDAP and urea peaked intnid-2008 at
  more than US$ 1,100 and US$ 750 per ton,respectively. By December 2008, DAP was
  selling at US$ 450 per ton and urea at US$ 247 per ton (figure 1). The fall in fertilizer .
  prices and transparent international bidding thus helped Ethiopia import a larger-than-
  planned quantity of fertilizer. In contrast to the 400,000 tons ofDAP and urea targeted



                                              -5-
 for purchase under the project,Ethiopia in fact purchased about 510,000 tons for the
 amount offoreign exchange supplied through the project

 24. The anticipated availability of foreign exchange allowed AISE to issue tenders for
 fertilizer in a timely manner (the Bank agreed to finance imports under such tenders in
 September 2008). Early award of tenders to foreign suppliers allowed fertilizer delivery
 at the port in. February-April 2009 and regional warehouses in April-June 2009.
 Stakeholders in the field stressed, and the impact evaluation survey confirmed, that
 fertilizer was overwhelmingly available before the rains. The timely delivery of fertilizer
 appears to have significantly improved under the project The establishment of a
 monitoring system under the project also seems to have helped authorities improve the
 timely d~livery of fertilizer.

 25. Shortly before closure, the fertilizer project was formally restructured and extended
 for one month (fromJune 30 to July 30,2010). This restructuring was done to ensure the
 reallocation of unused Bank funds (approximately US$ 15.5 minion equivalent)4 to the
 Protection of Basic Services Project

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

26. The project's monitoring and evaluation component had two core activities: (i) a
regular monitoring exercise during implementation and (ii) the impact evaluation, based



 The fertilizer project used US$ 244 million or about 97,6 percent ofIDA resources (US$ 250 million at
4,
project approval) for fertilizer procurement. Unexpected additionalresources became available because of
SDR appreciation,


                                                                            -6-
on household survey data. On the whole, the component was effectively designed and
utilized. Implementation of monitoring showed some weaknesses with regard to
timeliness and quality. Many investment lending projects in Ethiopia face significant
challenges related to monitoring and evaluation, and the achievements under this
component were better than most projects.

27. The monitoring exercise was unique. A low-tech approach-information collected
directly from a sample of geographically diverse woredas (districts) through a five-page
questionnaire-yielded basic information about the status of fertilizer imports and the
market. The quality and consistency of the monitoring data and timely implementation at
the institutional1evel showed room for improvement (World Bank 2009,2009-2010).
The project revealed that MoARD suffered from a shortage of staff, skills, effectiveness,
and a lack of attention to monitoring and evaluation.

    ..   Monitoring. The monitoring exercise was conducted by ministry staff and as
         noted comprised a sample of about 3Shigh- and low-potential woredas (MoARD
         2009). About every three months, the ministry collected market information about
         fertilizer imports, sales, and distribution at the national, regional, and more local.
         administrative levels. The monitoring information was of moderate quality, but it
         was carefully cross-checked during supervision missions and used to inform the
         task team (World Bank 2009-2010). For example, at an early stage monitoring
         helped to identify the seriousness of the congestion at the Djibouti Port, which
         placed the project's objectives at risk. Together with recommendations from the
         Bank (Hine 2009), this information helped the Government of Ethiopia to
         forcefully address the congestion.

    •    Evaluation. The impact evaluation included a survey of about 3,500 households in
         all major regions (DSA 2010). The survey and analysis received detailed technical
         backstopping from the task team. The assessment also collected other information,
         such as secondary data, and conducted intensive qualitative interviews with
         stakeholders to cross-check the findings. Because the impact evaluation suffered
         from procurement delays, putting the monitoring and evaluation component at
         risk, it was rated unsatisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory during
         implementation. At closure the impact evaluation was submitted on time.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

28. Environmental and social safeguards. The project was classified as environmental
category B, which requires a partial assessment. The overall compliance with
environmental and social safeguards by the client was rated marginally unsatisfactory
throughout the project's life. Following a series of procurement delays, combined with
difficulties in identifying and contracting staff and some lack of attention, MoARD
submitted the Environmental and Social Assessment and the Environmental and Social
Management Plan (see Admasu 2009) with such a significant delay that
recommendations could not be implemented. The main risks were (i) diverse health and
safety issues arjsing when handling fertilizer and (ii) fire and explosion hazards presented



                                              -7-
                    .                          .
by stored fertilizer. Field visits by supervisioIlini§sion~, conducted with special attention
to identify and eventually minimize safeguatds risks; nevertheless irtdicatedthat these
potential safeguard risks did not materialize itl arty major way.

29.       Procurement. Given that procurement Was part of an emergency project under
OPIBP 8.0; the Bank ensured that procurement procedures satisfied the requirements of
transparency and efficiency but did not fully review the fertilizer procurement process. A
partial assessment suggests that the procurement of fertilizer went smoothly. The
consultancy services provided under the project were subject to the Bank's procurement
plan and fullr~view. Procedures were followed, but the consultancy services. to assess the
environmental.and social impacts and to conduct the impact evaluation experienced
significant profurement delays, caused by capacity constraints within the ministry and
unfamiliarity with Bank rules within the Agricultural Marketing D~artment. This
combination offactors caused the initially satisfactory procurement rating to be
downgraded during implementation to moderately satisfactory and, at one point,
moderately unsatisfactory.

30. Financial management. The financial management arrangements were simple.
During appraisal, the financial management risk for both inherent and control risks were
assessed to be moderate. Disbursement was made 100 percent in advance. A careful
financial management assessment of AISE as the de facto sole importer was also
conducted during appraisal. The main strengths identified were the country's internal
control procedures as well as the familiarity ofMoARD staff with Bank-financed projects.
Nevertheless, the financial management performance during implementation ranged from
moderately satisfactory to unsatisfactory. The project's inherent as well as control risks
remained moderate throughout implementation. At closure, fmancial management was
rated as moderately satisfactory. The main weaknesses were:

      •    Delayed interim financial reports and audits. Submission of quarterly interim
           financial reports and the yearly audit report was delayed. The ministry, bearing
           responsibility for the financial management of the project, needed to colle.ct
           financial management documents from AISE, file them properly, and prepare the
           quarterly as well as yearly financial reports for the Bank. Delays in this process
           had a direct impact on the timely submission of the quarterly interim financial
           reports. At the end of the project, these issues were corrected.

      •    Intergovernmental coordination issues. The need for coordination between the
           implementing entities was great, inclUding MoARD (responsible for financial
           management), AISE (responsible for procuring the fertilizer), the Ministry of
           Finance and Economic Development (responsible for depositing the equivalent
           amount in Ethiopian birr into the treasury account), the National Bank of Ethiopia
           (Central Bank) (responsible for withdrawing the foreign currency amount), and
           finally the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (responsible fOl: opening the letter of
           credit for fertilizer procurement). Complex intergovernment coordination caused
           some misunderstandings. and delays, which needed to be rectified during
           implementation.

2.5 Post-completion OperationlNext Phase

31. The project was prepared in the context of the Global Food Crisis Response
Program and explicitly designed as a short-tenn emergency measure, with no follow-up
plans. At the same time, Bank support for strengthening sustainable agricultural growth
and food production in Ethiopia is continuing through a number of current and new
investment lending operations, such the Irrigation and Drainage Project, Rural Capacity
Building Project, Sustainable Land Management Project, Tana~Beles Integrated Water
Resources Development Project, and most notably the recently established Agricultural .
Growth Prograrn.

3. Assessment of Ou.tcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

32. Given the global food and fertilizer price crisis, combined        a significant
shortage offoreign exchange, the PDO was highly relevant In a situation of high food
and overall p~ce inflation, the failed 2008 belg harvest, and the extreme shortage of
foreign exchange, the project was designed as an emergency operation to support the
import of fertilizer and thereby sustain grain production. The anticipation of Bank funds
allowed the timely procurement and subsequent distribution of fertilizer.

33. Despite declining fertilizer prices over time, the relevance of the project's PDO was
high (though it would not be high in the absence of an emerJSency), Fertilizer prices
dropped significfIDtly by the time the project was approved, and further declined when the
project was implemented. However, the global fertilizer market was uncertain and
volatile. Based ~n historical price records, fertilizer prices take approximately three years
to stabilize after a major crisis. In fact, price increases in late 2010 indicated that the
market may not yet have stabilized.

34. The design of the project was relevant, mainly because its simplicity allowed fast
implementation. One major aspect was the design of the procurement process, which led
AISE to become the de facto single importer of fertilizer. Under the fertilizer project this
arrangement appears to have contributed to efficient and timely allocation of foreign
exchange, procurement, imports of fertilizer, and distribution of fertilizer to smallholders.
In the medium tenn, however, the net impact of this arrangement for Ethiopia's fertilizer
sector is uncertain; see section 3.5c on other unintended outcomes.

 35. Overall projectimplementation went smoothly. Tenders were properly evaluated by
 AISE and approved by the ministry's Foreign Fertilizer Procurement Committee on time .
.The major initial delay at Djibouti Port in unloading and bagging fertilizer was. caused by
 the overlapping arrival of several cargos of cement, sugar, and emergency grain but
 rectified through the coordinated govemmenteffort noted previously. Slightly delayed
 rainfall for the meher (main) season ineant that no negative impact from the port delay
 was observed. The Governme~t of Ethiopia also made arrangements through an
 intenninisterial committee and a newly created Maritime Affairs Authority to ensure that
 fertilizer unloading, bagging, and transportation received priority.


                                            -9-
36. Fiduciary compliance, as well as the implementation of the monitoring and
evaluation system, suffered from shortcomings that were mostly corrected by closure.
Safeguards compliance was moderately unsatisfactory, as the Environmental and Social
Assessment was submitted too late for its recommendations to be implemented. However,
some attention was given to potential health or safety risks during field supervision and
no substantial issues were identified.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

37. The broad development objective has likely been met. The fertilizer project's
higher-level objective was to "increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009-10
remains on or near the growth trend ofrecent years. " An evaluation of the extent to
which the broad development objective was achieved is complex owing to: (i) the largely
hypothetical "without-project" scenario, (ii) unclear magnitude of the impacts of
increased fertilizer supply on crop production; (iii) a large number of other factors
influencing aggregate crop production; and (iv) specific data challenges in measuring
aggregate crop production in Ethiopia.

38. Nonetheless, to the best knowledge available to the team in developing this report,
it appears that the goal of preventing a significant decrease in grain production due to a
severe shortage of fertilizer was likely met:

     •   Hypothetical without-project scenario. Early tendering allowed AISE to finalize
         fertilizer contracts in January 2009 and deliver fertilizer on timeto smallholders
         in all major crop-producing regions for the 2009-10 season. According to
         stakeholders, without the support of the foreign exchange available from the
         project, fertilizer delivery would likely have been delayed or significantly
         reduced. Both scenarios would probably have lowered crop production.

     •    Impact offertilizer use on production. Estimates of the impact of increased
          fertilizer use on aggregate crop (cereal) production range from a low 0.05 up to
         "0.35, depending on growing conditions and availability of improved seed (Yao
          1996). The availability of improved seed was reported to be a constraint during
          the crop season that the project was active, but recent (2008-09) household
          survey data from the International Food Policy Research Institute point towards
          a fertilizer production elasticity of above 0.2 in Ethiopia (Rashid 2009). This
          infonnation suggests that the use of fertilizer has a substantial impact on
          aggregate crop production.

     •   Complementary conditions. Besides fertilizer, a large number of factors have an
         impact on crop production, such as access to water, improved seed, credit, and
         extension services. Since most agriculture in Ethiopia is rainfed, rainfall is of
         particular importance: Under average rainfall patterns, fertilizer use is profitable,
         whereas bad rainfall patterns may result in heavy financial losses at the farm
         level (Abrar, Morrissey, and Rayner 2004). While reports about rainfall during



                                            -10-
           project implementation are mixed, the consensus view is that the rains were
           slightly late for the 2009 main production season, but once they started, they
           were adequate arid evenly spread throughout the season. Parts of the country
           experienced marginal drought conditions, and 'for most of the country improved
           seed Was inshort supply. According to official data, however, the impact of
           these deficiencies on aggregate production appears minimal.

       •   Crop production. Official data from the Central Statistical Agency (CSA)
           suggest an increase in grain production of 5.2 percerit during project
           implementation (from 17.2 million tons to 18.4 million tons). In,contrast,
           estimates from the Food and Agriculture 'Organization (FAO) and the World
           Food Program (WFP) crop,and food security assessment mission suggest that
           there was a 4.7 percent decrease in aggregate grain production. The well-known
           lack of consensuss and concerns about the reliability of agricultural statistics in
           Ethiopia thus pose a challenge in assessing whether the fertilizer project
           achieved its broad development objective. Even so, FAO and WFP also report
           that based on the five-year average production level, Ethiopia in 2009-10
           recorded a 7 percent increase'ingrain production (FAOIWFP 201 0). Either way,
           the available data suggest that the project may have helped avoid a significant
           decline in grain production;

39. The project's specific development objective was more than achieved. The specific
objective was to "contribute to the government's efforts to ensure aggregate availability of
supply of chemical fertilizer for the 2009-10 crop season adequate to meet smallholder
farmers' priority demands. "Given that global fertilizer prices had dropped significantly by
the time the project was approved (figure 1), the reduced prices allowed Ethiopia to import
a larger quantity offertilizer (510,000 tons versus the planned 400,000 tons) with the same
amount of foreign exchange. The project thus achieved the target of fertilizer imports by
 127.5 percent. 6 Moreover, the project was instrumental not only in supplying the aggregate
quantity of fertilizer but in ensuring its timely supply, as the Bank agreed with the
Government of Ethiopia to allow AISE to start the tendering process as early as September
2008.                                             .

40. Not surprisingly, because of the well-known tendency to overestimate prospective
demand, fertilizer consumption was lower than planned based on Agricultural Marketing
Departnient forecasts. As noted, the project used the lowest demand 'scenario from the
departnient (550,000 tons). Assuming that 50,000 tons would have gone into replenishing
stocks, this level of fertilizer demand still implied a 12 percent annual growth in fertilizer
use. However, actual fertilizer use (defined as sales) during 2009':"10 was much less at

6 African Development Bank (AIDB) funding ofUSS 59.6 million and the Government of Japan's support
allowed Ethiopia to import an additional 118,000 tons offertilizer.


                                                 -11-
about 427,000 tons. This level was still 5A percent higher than the level for 2008-09
(405,000 tons) (MoARD 2010a).

41. Core KPls included: (i) the quantity of fertilizer imported and distributed to farmers;
(ii) the timeliness of distribution of fertilizer and complementary inputs; (iii) effective
fertilizer application as a share of total cultivated area; and (iv) estimated costs and
contribution of the fertilizer to production and economic welfare (not measured). These
KPIs were broadly met (see Annex 2 for an overview), albeit with the following
qualifications:

    •   Quantity offertilizer imported and distributed. As discussed, the project
        ultimately financed purchases of fertilizer that surpassed the original procurement
        target by 27.5 percent.

    •   Timeliness and distribution offertilizer and complementary inputs. Field evidence
        suggests that fertilizer distribution appears to have been timelier in the project
        year than in previous years, which can be attributed to 'early and efficient
        tendering supported by the project. About three-quarters of farmers reported
        timely delivery, although no quantitative benchmark is available. The supply of
        complementary inputs, such as improved hybrid seed, appears to have been below
        market demand (World Bank 2009-2010; FAO/WFP 2010; DSA 2010)<

    •   Effective fertilizer application as share oftotal cultivated area. According to the
        Development Study Associates (DSA) impact evaluation study, the share of
        chemical fertilizer in relation to total cultivated land was 37 percent during 2009-
        10. Taken at face value, this information suggests that the original target of
        equaling or surpassing the 49 percent coverage reported for 2008-09 was not
        achieved. The indicators are methodologically not directly comparable, however,
        because the impact evaluation captured only the application of chemical feliilizer
        in five regions. Official CSA data apply to an regions and include organic
        fertilizer.

    "   Costs and contribution offertilizer to production and economic welfare.
        According to official data, overall grain production appears to have increased by
        5.6 percent with associated average yield increases of2.6 percent. An indicative
        benefit-cost analysis (Annex 3) suggests that the application of fertilizer has been
        profitable and economically efficient, both at the farm and aggregate level. The
        weighted average value-cost ratio (VCRs) of three representative crops is 2.4 and
        the overall benefit-cost ratio is 3.8. The economic welfare impacts are likely to be
        related to increased or stabilized cereal production, which protect the most
        vulnerable groups from price increases, in particular the poorer urban population.

42. Field interviews by the team preparing this Implementation and Completion Results
Report (ICR) and information from the impact assessment by DSA (2010) suggest that
the fertilizer that was supplied was generally of satisfactory quality. In fact, fertilizer
quality may have been marginally better in 2009-10 than in previous years, perhaps


                                            -12-
because the high government priority assigned to fertilizer distribution resulted in
enhanced supervision when transporting and handling fertilizer. Although fanners in a
few areas (mostly Amhara) complained about caked product, such complaints appear
slightly lower than in previous years.

3.3 Efficiency

43. The ICR team conducted an indicative benefit-cost analysis to assess economic
efficiency (Annex 3). The key parameter to measure aggregate efficiency is based on the
fann-Ievel profitability of fertilizer used, as measured by the VCR. The various VCRs
used in calculating benefit-cost and net benefit ratios are based on the DSA (2010) impact
evaluation as well as survey data from Sasakawa Global-2000 (80.:-2000) in 2010.
Compared with other studies, the DSA study reported relatively high VCRs when
compared to available studies. Because the calculations are very sensitive to the VCR, the
ICR team preferred to keep assumptions conservative and calculate mean VCRs from the
SO-2000 dataset. Since VCRs based on SG-~OOO fertilizer response data were more
consistent with other studies, these VCRs were used in the baseline scenario and VCRs
from DSAstudy were used in optimistic scenario.

44. The key findings of the analysis indicate significantly positive results for both the·
benefit-cost ratio and net benefit stream approach. The fertilizer project most likely
generated net economic benefits of US$ 667.9 million, with an average benefit-cost ratio
of about 3.78. The project was thus reasonably justifiable in terms of economic efficiency.
The highest fertilizer response and return are from wheat, followed by maize and teff.
Therefore under reasonable rainfall and grain price patterns. such as those prevailing
during the project's implementation, fertilizer use in Ethiopia is profitable and can be
economically efficient. In view of recent international fertilizer price increases, the
fertilizer stock left over from 2009-10 may also generate marginal net benefits (see
figure 1).                                        .

             Table 1: Results from Benefit-Cost Analysis (most likely scenario)

       Aggregate estimate         2.4                     667.9               3.78
        Teffonly                  1.4                     144.1               2.20
        Maize only                2.6                     231.5               4.11

45. A sensitivity test under more conservative assumptions (lower bounds) shows that
the project produced positive returns even under the unfavorable assumptions. The break-
even point for net benefits to become negative and the benefit-cost ratio to drop below 1
would require a VCR below 0.63, which appears unlikely, as even under unfavorable
cropping conditions no study data support such a low VCR. In the upper-bound scenario,
which is mainly dependent on the precision of the VCRs calculated by DSA, the net
benefit stream would be US$ 1,164.9 million with a benefit-cost ratio of 5.85.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

46. Rating: Satisfactory. Overall project outcomes are rated as satisfactory. The rating
is based on high relevance, likely achievement of the broad development objective,
satisfactory achievement of the specific PD~, and achievement of major (though not all)
KPIs, combined with reasonable economic efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

47. Detailed estimates of the welfare and other impacts of the project are not available.
Nevertheless, studies suggest the following likely welfare effects:

    •   Direct effects on crop production. The impact evaluation did not estimate poverty
        effects of fertilizer use. Partial budget analysis suggests largely positive effects on
        rural households, however. Net returns average between 2,560 and 5,500
        Ethiopian birr (ETB) per hectare, depending on the region (DSA 2010). By
        extension, these average figures would imply a net income and thus short-run
        welfare-enhancing effect for rural households, combined with reduced risks of
        food insecurity.

    •   Indirect effects on/ood inflation. In Ethiopia, a shift from growth to a serious crop
        production shock of 10-20 percent can temporarily raise food price inflation by
        up to 2.0-3.5 percentage points per month. All things equal, a serious shock in
        crop production alone would increase annual inflation from zero to up to 20-40
        percent within a full year (L~ening, Durevall, and Ayalew Birru 2009). The
        stabilization of crop production has an important role in reducing consumer price
        inflation, which is heavily influenced by food production, in particular of cereals.

    •   Indirect effects on urban welfare. The poorest urban households were hit
        especially hard by food price inflation (Alem and Soderbom 2010; Loening and
        Oseni 2007). Stabilized food production prices may have significantly contributed
        to prevent a further increase in urban poverty for vulnerable groups in Ethiopia.

(b) Institutional Ch.ange/Strengthening

48. Under the project, the Bank did not seek policy, institutional, or organizational
reforms related to input supply. Some positive institutional changes nonetheless have
been recorded on fertilizer procurement. In the period since the project ended, the
Government of Ethiopia has adopted some improvements in its overall procurement of
fertilizer, such as using the fertilizer bidding documents used under the fertilizer project.
Improvements made during project preparation with support provided by Bank staff
involved the inclusion of qualification criteria and a few other (mostly minor)
amendments. As noted, the government also set up a Maritime Affairs Authority to avoid
future port congestion of the kind experienced during the fertilizer project.


                                             -14-
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

49. Based on stakeholder views and preliminary forecasts, this ICR notes that, partly
due to continued timely availability of fertilizer, in combination with relatively high
domestic grain prices and favorable rainfall, Ethiopia is expecting a good crop h~st. In
other words, theJarge carryover stock ofFSP fertilizer into 2010-2011 may have
generated positive short-run production externalities.

50. Owing to the design of the procurement process, AISE became the de facto single
importer of fertilizer, acting onits own behalf as well as that of cooperative federations
and unions. The ministry has maintained this procurement process and practice, and
AISE remains the sole importer. This practice facilitates bulk procurement, the allocation
of foreign exchange, and the ministry's coordination tasks. The net impact of this
arrangement on Ethiopia's fertilizer sector is uncertain, however. Economies of scale at
the macro level need to be weighed against possible inefficiencies in the marketing and
distribution chain at the micro level associated with concentration in the sector. These
effects however are uncertain, because currently there is no measurable evidence
suggesting that the single importer had negative effects on prices or distribution and
efficiency.

51. Prioritization offertilizer imports over emergency cereal imports delayed the
WFP's response to the Ethiopianfood crisis in 2009 and significantly increased that
institution's transport costs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

52. The beneficiary survey collected data from 3,500 rural households in early 2010.
This dataset was the basis for assessing the project's impact on fertilizer distribution and
use at the regional, woreda,·and kebele (administrative village) level~ (see Annex 5 for
details). The assessment's main findings are:

   •   Aggregate fertilizer supply has increased but fertilizer consumption among survey
       households declined marginally due to erratic rainfall, difficulties in accessing
       credit for fertilizer, and lack of complementary inputs such as seed.

   •   The availability and timeliness of fertilizer supply may have improved in the
       project year compared with prior years.

   •   Fertilizer use was profitable at the farm level during the project year.

   •   Poorly implemented forecasts of fertilizer demand, typically based on estimates
       prepared by development agents and farmers, perpetuated the recognized gap
       between effective demand and aggregate fertilizer supply.




                                            -15-
     •   At the local level, stakeholders signaled their appetite to explore options for
         greater involvement of the private sector, as the dominance of AISE may have
         narrowed the marketing chain.       .

 4. Assessment of Risk to DeV'elopment Outcome

 53. Rating: moderate. The rating combines the narrowly defined PD~ along with
 broader and forward-looking considerations. While an emergency operation is not meant
 to address these latter considerations, the ICR considered them as important for
 sustainability reasons, in particular considering Ethiopia's structural vulnerability to
 exogenous shocks. Specifically, the ICR team considered the fonowing aspects:

     • A negligible-to-Iow residual short-run development risk. (i) The PD~ of this
         emergency operation was specific to developments during the food crisis. The
         project was implemented under unique circumstances. The likelihood that
         detrimental changes would affect past fertilizer procurement and distribution of
         already applied fertilizer does not apply (and makes an assessment of
         development outcome risk almost redundru;lt). (ii) Regarding the leftover fertilizer
         stock (table 6), supervision mission evidence suggests an overall low risk that
         fertilizer may be used improperly or subject to substantial moisture or caking. In
         this narrow sense, therefore, residllal development risks are negligible.

     • A modest-fa-significant vulnerability risk to exogenous shocks. (i) Being
         landlocked· and dominated by smallholder agriculture, Ethiopia remains
         vulnerable to exogenous ·shocks. Historically Ethiopiahas experienced adverse
         shocks every five to seven years, stemming from drought, tenmH)f-trade volatility,
         and (more recently) the global food crisis. (ii) In the aftermath of the food crisis,
         however, good progress was made in restoring macroeconomic stability, notably
         through step-wise adjustments of the nominal exchange rate (the ETB was
         devalued by more than 35 percent in relation to the US dollar after the food
         crisis).? Foreign exchange reserves were rebuilt and export receipts recovered to
         pre-crisis levels. Structurally the country also benefits from gradual agricultural
         export diversification. Combined with prudent economic management. risks
         somewhat decreased, though larger foreign exchange reserve cushions are still
         needed (IMF 2010) .




 In December 2010, Ethiopia's inflation rate rose to 14.5 percent, and food price inflation increased to g,g
.7
percent.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

54. Rating: Satisfactory. The project design, rapidly conceived during the global food
crisis, was based on the strategic assumption that supporting domestic crop production
would best be possible through assuring the availability of chemical fertilizer through a
fast-track emergency lending operation. This strategic approach was effective. 8 The
limitations of the analytical underpinnings, due to rushed preparation of the emergency
operation, were partly compensated through a thorough internal review process. The
simple project design was adequate and allowed timely implementation~ Monitoring and
evaluation progressed at the intermediate stage, and a satisfactory impact assessment
based on a large household survey was produced.

55.' As with all projects, for this project one can say with the benefit of hindsight that
some things should have been done differently. The transport and port congestion risk
could have been anticipated through more careful review and intersectoral dialogue in the
Ethiopia country team. More emphasis could have been placed on creating a better
knowledge base. A better knowledge base would have allowed the evaluation of
institutional and policy questions related to the project (e.g., questions related to whether
the project helped cement a rather unique fertilizer supply structure, the expected net
effects of a revised procurement process that led toa single importer, the use af DAP and
urea only, and the private sector's limited role in the supply chain).

(b) Quality of Supervision (including ofjiduciary and safeguards policies)

56. Rating: Satisfactory. SupervIsion was regular, constructive, and proactive. The
team produced three supervision missions during key milestones of the fertilizer
procurement and distribution process (March 2009, May 2009, and December 2009).
During the first supervision mission, the Bank assisted in identifying the magnitude of the
transport congestion in Djibouti Port, which prompted swift government action.
Communication between the Government of Ethiopia and Bank staff was good. The
Bank.actively engaged in ensuring that monitoring was implemented and that the impact
evaluation was done, providing technical backstopping on many occasions. The
performance of the team was explicitly appreciated by the government with regard to
proactive recommendations from the supervision missions and follow-up by the task
team leader (MoARD 2010a).




g Despite a Jack of consensus on the causes of high inflation in Ethiopia (IMF 2008b); the available
evidence suggests that the food crisis in Ethiopia was almost synonymous with food inflation (Rashid
2010), in particular cereal price inflation. Out of a number of nondomestic factors influencing inflation,
domestic cereal production matters most (Loening, Durevall, and Ayalew Birru 2009).

57. Staff interacted closely with the government. Because of the short implementation
period, the core team remained without significant fluctuations. The project task team had
a sufficient mix of skills, support from national and international fertilizer experts, and
support from a transport specialist during the port congestion (Hine 2009), as well as
support from several other Bank units (see Annex 4). The ratings throughout
implementation were candid. However, supervision performance was reduced by delays
in procurement, financial management, and safeguards, partly due to insufficient staff
time to engage more proactively, and directly, with the client. While these issues are of
broader concern for the Ethiopia country team, under the project they did not cause
serious difficulties.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

58. Rating: Satisfactory. Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. The rating
takes into account satisfactory quality at entry and overall fine supervision practice,
qualifed, however, by fiduciary and safeguard delays.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

59. Rating: Satisfactory. During preparation and implementation, the Government of
Ethiopia showed high ownership and commitment. This involvement was crucial to
achieving the development objectives. The government showed high commitment by
solving the port congestion and related transport problems. Prior to closure, an effort was
made to rectify outstanding fiduciary issues.·Closure and transition arrangements have
been timely and smooth.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies' Performance

60. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. During preparation and implementation, the
ministry and its Agricultural Marketing Department showed equal commitment.
Relationships with stakeholders were excellent at all administrative levels, participation
in supervision missions was smooth, and significant individual efforts were made for the
closing arrangements. Nevertheless, owing to staff and budget constraints, the ministry
managed to assign only one government official to work-no more than part-time-on
the fertilizer project. As a result, implementation focused on the fertilizer component.
The shortage of staff time was the main cause for sometimes significant shortcomings
with respect to safeguards, procurement, financial management, and some delays in
monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, due to internal procedural constraints, and despite
sufficient resources for monitoring and evaluation, the ministry was unable to rectify
these issues in a timely fashion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

61. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Overall borrower performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory. This rating acknowledges that (i) the government and


                                           -18-
implementing agencies are closely related and (ii) the' implementing agencies'
petformancewas less than satisfactory due to the allocation of insufficient staff time.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific, and ofwide general application)

62. In emergency situations, the Bank needs to be pragmatic and act rapidly to
respond to clients' needs. In response to the needs and request of the Government of
Ethiopia, the Bank acted rapidly and successfully to arrest a potentially severe decline in
food production. It used its flexibiHties, especially under OPIBP8.00 and the Global Food
Crisis Response Program, and relied on the existing fertilizer supply and distribution
system. The Bankdid not seek to address complex reforms under the project that could
have delayed its implementation.                           .

63. The concentration ~f importation under a single entity performed adequately
under this project, but is not necessary for attainment of economies of scale. Under
the project, a parastatal enterprise became the single importer of fertilizer in Ethiopia.' It
remains the monopoly importer, thoug1:lthe procedures introduced under the project make
this position contestable. Currently no evidence suggested that the single importer had
measurable negative effects on fertilizer prices or distribution efficiency. On the other
hand, economies of scale effects in the procurement and importation of fertilizer are
small beyonelcertain amounts (50,000 tons) anel therefore do not preclude multiple
importers in the medium term.

64. Weak data on production and inadequate methodology for estimating demand
for fertilizer constrain decision making"Fert~lizer demand forecasts in Ethiopia are
administrative exercises. Aggregate crop production data remain subject to uncertainty.
Concerns about the reliability of these statistics pose challenges for project evaluations
and planning more generally. While these issues should be addressed more systemically,
the project's monitoring and evaluation system is noteworthy. Despite shortcomings, it
produced regular status updates, and-based on a large rural household survey-a
credible impact evaluation. More efforts are required to .harmonize and improve data
collection practices in Ethiopia.

65. Many small-scale farmers are able to buy fertilizer on a cash basis. Ethiopia has
no explicit fertilizer subsidies and reforms are reducing credit guarantees and
encouraging farmers to purchase fertilizer ona cash basis. During the project, field
evidence and impact evaluation data from the project indicate that the large majority of
farmers used cash to purchase fertilizer, and only in exceptional circumstances did local
administrations support new credit guarantees. Experience under the project confirmed
the ability and willingness of many small holders to pay cash for fertilizer.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

66. Staff from WFP informed the ICR team about the prioritization of fertilizer imports
over emergency cereal imports during the 2009-10 crop season. This decision delayed
WFP's own response and significantly increased the transport costs.




9 AIDB supported the Government of Ethiopia with a grant of approximately ofUS$ 59.6 million for
additional fertilizer procurement (AfdB 2010, MoRAD 201Ob). This support in parallel with the fertilizer
project allowed additional procurement of about 158,000 tons of fertilizer. While the AIDB project was not
linked to the Bank's fertilizer project, it nonetheless followed the project's procurement procedures. AIDB
staff acknowledged excellent cooperation and useful information sharing with Bank staff throughout the
fertilizer project's life. In addition, the Government of Japan provided about 28,000 tons of urea to Ethiopia
in 2009; this is a substantially larger donation than Japan was providing in previous years.

 Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

 Overview and Summary

 For this report, an indicative benefit-cost analysis was done to assess economic efficiency.
 The key parameter to measure aggregate efficiency is based on farm~level profitability of
 fertilizer use~ as measured by the VCR. The various VCRs used in calculations for the
 benefit-cost ratios (BeRs) and net benefit streams (NBSs) are based on (i) a survey
 conducted by SG-2000 in 2010 for the most likely scenario, (ii) the DSA impact
 evaluation for the upper b~unds, and (iii) other available studies for the lower bounds.

 The key findings indicate significant, positive results for both BCR and NBS. The project
 most likely generated net economic benefits ofUS$ 678.3 million with an average BCR
 of about 3.9. The project is thus reasonably justifiable in terms of economic efficiency.
 The highest response and return are from wheat, followed by maize and teff.

 A sensitivity test conducted under low (unfavorable) bounds for various assumptions
 showed that the project produced overall positive retums, even under unfavorable
 assumptions. The break-even point for net benefits to become negative and the BRC to
 drop below 1 would require a VCR below 0.61, which is extremely unlikelx. Hence
 under reasonable rainfall and grain price patterns, such as thQse prevailing during project
 implementation, fertilizer use in Ethiopia is profitable and economically efficient.

 Assumptions of Cost and Benefit Streams

  The VCR or marginal rate of return analysis shows whether the financial returns to
. fertilizer use exceed the cost of fertilizer treatment based on the incremental yield
  attributable to one additional unit of fertilizer use. When moving from no fertilizer use to
  fertilizer use, a marginal analysis can indicate whether the value of the incremental yield
  is equal to, less than, or more than the incremental costs. Higher benefits do not attract
  farmers if costs are also higher.

 Many researchers typically contend that marginal agronomic responses must be at -least
 twice the nutrient-to-grain price ratio for significant fertilizer adoption to occur. This
 assumption suggests that the VCR should 'be equal or greater than 2 (equivalent to a
 marginal rate of return of 100) to provide an incentive for efficient fertilizer use by
 farmers.

 The DSA study generated estimates of crop-wise VCRs; reliable estimates are scarce in
 Ethiopia. VCRs from SG-2000 survey data in 2010 have been used in the cost-benefit
 calculations. The estimates are conservative in the sense that the upper-bound estimates
 (best possible scenario) are always derived from DSA data, whereas the lower-bound
 estimates (worst possible scenario) are derived from other study or survey data.

Key assumptions for the cost stream are:

    •   The opportunity costs of capital are estimated between 5 percent and 6 percent,
        with '6 percent as a base scenario, and a maximum reference point of 15 percent.
        The Bank's threshold for investment lending is often 12 percent, and some rural
        development projects in Ethiopia have achieved rates of return of above 15
        percent. Currently, however, with near.:.zero-percent lending rates from the
        Federal Reserve Board or the Europe'an Central Bank, a low opportunity cost'
        appears p l a u s i b l e . '                           ,

    •   The opportunity cost of capital is calculated for the leftover fertilizer stock of
        110,000 tons, because it is to be used during the 201()'-11 cropping season. The
        fertilizer is assumed to be applied for three months, assuming that a significant
        fraction of the stock can also be used for the belg season and for irrigated
        agriculture. Of these 110,000 tons, 35 percent, 30 percent, and 25 percent of the
        fertilizer stock has been kept for teff, wheat,'and maize, respectively. In Ethiopia,
        over 90 percent of fertilizer is used on three crops only, and priority is given to
        these three crops in the analysis ..

    •   A downward adjustment in the price of the carryover fertilizer stock was made,
        because it 'Was purchased when world prices for fertilizer were relatively low.
        More fertilizer was procured and imported than originally planned. The
        overestimation of demand at appraisal therefore had the positive result of
        lowering fertilizer prices for the 2009-11 seasons. As a result, with continued
        favorable grain prices and good rainfall patterns, farm-level profitability may
        increase.

    •   The AISE typically calculates new prices by weighting average DAP and urea
        prices between old and new stocks. For the analysis ~n this report, the current
        stock is estimated to result in an overall price decrease of about 8-10 percent. The
        same figure has been assumed for individual crop's.

   •    Potential losses due to moisture or caking are assumed between 1 percent and 3
        percent. Field evidence generally suggests that moisture or caking is a rather
        isolated problem, as confirmed by DSA data and ,project supervision reports.
        Primary cooperatives appear to store their fertilizer carefully.

   •    Storage costs at the cooperative level are estimated assuming that about 5 percent
        of the cooperatives need to pay for storage of 110,000 tons for three months.
        Average costs of about ETB 2.5-5.0 per ton are from supervision mission field
        observations. Similar figures have been employed for teff, wheat, and maize.

Key assumptions for the benefit stream are:

   •    Production benefits due to increased fertilizer supply are calculated. It is expected
        that some VCRs may be better for the 201()'-2011 season, however, mainly


                                            -26-
       because of good rainfall. The calculations could thus underestimate the likely
       benefits streams.

   •   Only the purchase of 51 0,000 tons of fertilizer through project funds is considered.
       Supplies financed through other sources, such as AIDB and JICA, are not
       considered as actual fertilizer consumption.

   •   The high leftover stock (table 6) will help to ease supply gaps, mostly for the belg
       season. Assuming that the belg season contributes to about 8-10 percent of
       agricultural output, it is optimistically estimated that on average half of that
       output (proxied by the most likely production benefits from the past season) could
       be stimulated by sufficient fertilizer supply.

   •   Several other potential benefits include, for example, reduced welfare costs for
       the urban poor, some profit margins generated by the fertilizer distribution chain,
       and other benefits that occur to society. Assuming that about IS percent of the
       population lives in urban or semi·urban areas, and some 15-20 percent of net
       buyers live in rural areas, it is optimistically estimated that on average 8-10
       percent of the most likely production benefits from the2009-JO season can be
       attributed to other potential benefits. The project may have helped reduce food
       prices and thereby reduce negative welfare shocks for the urban poor.

Sensitivity Check and Importance of VCRs

To better approximate potential data uncertainty, the analysis considers upper and lower
bounds that depart significantly from the most likely (average) values.

The main findings are insensitive to most ofthe key assumptions presented above. The
exception is the VCR: the main outcome of the bepefit·cost analysis is almost entirely
dependent on the accuracy of farm-level profitability. However, VCR estimates in
Ethiopia are not consistent or stable. Since the VCR depends on three key parameters
(fertilizer price, crop price, incremental yields), variation in those parameters can
generate variable results. To improve the robustness of the project's estimated economic
benefits, the various estimates available were surveyed by the ICR team (table 2).

The first estimates of VCRs come from trial data estimated by MoARD (1992) and range
from 2.8 to 5.3. Stepanek (1999) estimated the VCRs for fertilizer use for maize under
low, medium, and high scenarios from on-farm response data. Other studies are from
Demeke and others (1998) and Rashid and Ayele (2009). Estimates prepare.d by DSA for
the fertilizer project's impact evaluation varied. They ranged from 2.0 to 6.0 and are
relatively high when compared to other studies. The SG-2000 data on response rates to
fc;:rtilizer by crop and region are typically lower than the DSA estimates. Given the
variation in VCR estimates from different sources, the ICR team used estimates the SG-
2000 dataset as the most likely scenario, the DSA (2010) data as'the upper bound, and
other studies as the lower bound.

By using 2009--10 crop and fertilizer prices, the ICR calculated VCRs for each crop in
three dominant fertilizer-using regions: Amhara, Oromia, and the Southern Nations,
Nationalities, and People Region. These three regions accounted for more than 90 percent
of national fertilizer use. The final national VCRs for estimating the FSP's fertilizer
project's overall economic benefits were calculated following a two-step procedure:

   •   Based on VCRs available from the DSA study and SG-20oo data for each crop
       and region, a weighted average VCR was calculated for each crop by using each
       region's share in fertilizer use. Since no crop-specific data are available at the·
       regional level, the share of each region in national fertilizer consumption was
       used as an approximate weight.

   •   Given regionally weighted averages for each crop from the two sources, the
       national average VCR was then calculated by using the shares of the three crops
       as weights. These calculations yield an overall average VCR of 3.7 for the DSA
       study and for 2.4 SG-2000 estimates.

Overall results

The results of the. e~onomic.analysis, summarized in table 3, show that the project most
likely generated net economic benefits ofUS$ 667.9 million, with an average BCR of
about 3.78. The BCR for all crops, including the aggregate production estimate, is thus
reasonably justifiable in terms of economic efficiency. As noted, the highest response an'd
return are from wheat, followed by maize and teff.

Even under the conservative assumptions represented by the lower-bound scenario, the
NBS would still be in the order ofUS$ 154.8. million, with an aven~ge estimated BCR of
1.64. The break-even point for net benefits to become negative and the BCR to drop
below 1 would require a VCR below approximately 0.63, which appears unlikely, as no
available study supports such a low VCR, even under unfavorable cropping conditions. In
the upper-bound scenario, which is mainly dependent on the precision of the VCRs as
calculated by the DSA impact assessment, the NBS would be US$ 1,164.9 million, with a
BCR of5.85 (see table 4 for details on the calculations).

Given reasonable rainfall and grain price patterns such as those prevailing during the
implementation-of the project, fertilizer use in Ethiopia can be profitable and
economically efficient.

Annex S. Summary of Beneficiary Survey Jl~sul~s .

The Ethiopian consulting fIrm DSA conducted a detailed assessment of fertilizer supply
anduse at the farm level. The DSA team interviewed approximately 3,500 rural
households jn early 2010 on their experience regarding fertilizer access in 2009 and the
2009-2010 nieher se~onharvest. The team also collected primary and secondary data
from federal and regional governments. Based on these data, it conducted an assessment
of the fertilizer project's impact on fertilizer distribution and use at the regional, woreda,
and kebele levels. The~sessment's main fIndings are: .

   •   Aggregate fertilizer supply has increased, but fertilizer consumption among
       survey household declined marginally in 2009-10. This decline is attributed to
       inadequate and erratic rainfall and difficulty in accessing fertilizer credit.
       However, overall fertilizer consumption has considerably increased over the past
       few years. Three crops, namely teff, wheat, and maize, account for 92 percent of
       total fertilizer use. Moderate output growth of these crops was observed.

   •   The availability ofDAPand urea and the timeliness with which fertilizer was
       supplied improved in the project year compared with prior years. Although a few
       cases of fertilizer quality problems (supplying caked fertilizer and underweight
       bags) were reported, the overall quality ·of fertilizer supplied through the project
       was better in 2009-10 than in previous years.

   •   The use of a single fertilizer importer, AISE, had positive outcomes from the
       point of view of importing fertilizer efficiently during an emergency~ but it
       narrowed the marketing chain. In the future it would be desirable to explore
       options for involving the private sector in the fertilizer market.

   •   The profItability of using fertilizer on tefT, wheat, and maize in the project year
       was measured by VCRs using incremental yield and crop and fertilizer prices.
       The calculated VCRs were over 2, confIrming that fertilizer use was profItable at
       the farm level. Factors attributed to profItable and positive VCRs in 2009-10
       were better yields, reduced marketing costs, and favorable grain prices.

   •   The fertilizer requirement projected by development agents and farmers created a
       gap between effective demand and aggregate fertilizer supply. Potential demand
       estimates are derived on the basis of blanket fertilizer recommendations. This
       serious concern requires immediate attention for future planning, capacity
       building, and effIcient fertilizer use.

   •   Information on fertilizer application and location-based fertilizer
       recommendations are needed for future fertilizer use and resource allocation at the
       smallholder level.

Assessment ofproject development objective

The project's development objective was to sustain growth in national crop production at
the high level of recent years and to help maintain stable food security. This objective is
successfully achieved, mainly by supplying sufficient fertilizer on time to the farming
community.

The DSA study estimated the 2009-10 grain harvest at 18.1 million tons, up from 17.1
million tons in 2008-09 (a 5.6 percent increase). Production increases have been
achieved under conditions of somewhat erratic rainfall, mainly by increasing crop
productivity per unit of cultivated land and by expanding cultivated area. Based on CSA
yield estimates for 2009-10,the productivity of Ethiopia's three major food crops
increased by 4.5 percent (wheat), 2.5 percent (teff), and 5.8 percent (sorghum) over the
previous season.

 Assessment ofspecific prpject objectives by component/activities

  Ferti,lizer procurement component. Rating: satisfactory. Originally it was estimated
  that, under prevaiiing international prices, project funds were sufficient to enable
  Ethiopia to import 420,000 tons of fertilizer. A declinein ipternational fertilizer prices by
  the time the project was implement~d, combiI).ed with the newly introduced bulk
  procurement method, enabled Ethiopia to procure ~ 10,370 tons of fertilizer with project
  resources. Including impo$ financed by other sources and fertilizer stocks c~ed over
  from 2008, 727,637 tons or'fertilizer were available to farmers in time for the 2009-10
, crop season. Congestion at Djibouti Port and challenges associated with transporting
  fertilizer to central warehouses were significant concerns when imports began but were
  speedily resolved.

 Monitoring and evaluation component. Rating: satisfoctory. As per World Bank
 consultant procurement guidelines, DSA was selected competitively to undertake an
 impact evaluation survey. The assignment was carried out according to the specifications
 in the contract and terms of reference. Reports (inception,' interim, draft, and final
 reports) were submitted on time and amended to reflect reviewers' comments if required.
 Overall, the survey was found to be of good quality, based on an intensive search for
 primary and secondary data, characterized by good analytical work, and presenting useful
,recommendations. '

 Environmental and social impact assessment. Rating: moderately satisfactory. The
 ministry undertook the Environmental and Social Assessment, including an
 Environmental and Social Management Plan, through an individual consultant. The
 Environmental and Social Assessment and Management Plan were discussed, reviewed
 by relevant stakeholders, and dl'sclosed once they were finalized. Most of the
 Environmental and Social Management Plan had already been implemented or was under
 implementation by the concerned bodies. The problem associated with this activity was
 that it was not completed within the agreed timeframe (no later than two months after
 project effectiveness). The delay Was mainly attributed to the lengthy consultant
 procurement procedure followed by the ministry.

 Assessment ofroles and responsibilities ofparticipating institutions

 qovernment of Ethiopia. The government's role in implementation was very
 satisfactory. It has proven its commitment and ownership through continuous follow-up
 and involvement in problem solving.

Implementing institution. During project planning and implementation, MoARD played
a lead role, and its Agricultural Marketing Department was responsible for implementing
the project. It implemented the project successfully in accordance with agreed procedures,
including fertilizer procurement; monitoring fertilizer imports, distribution, and sales;
submitting monitoring reports to the Bank; procuring consultancy services as per agreed
guidelines; preparing and submitting project status and fmancial reports to the Bank;
working in close collaboration with Bank staff; taking precautions to implement the



                                             -37-
project in accordance with the Batik's anti-corruption guidelines; and using funds only
for eligible payments.

World Bank..The role of the Bank towards successful completion of the fertilizer project
was also satisfactory. The Bank disbursed funds in a timely way to. ensure that fertilizer
was procured on time. The feedback from three Bank supervision missions that
monitored fertilizer imports, distribution, and sales helped the ministry take corrective
measures that contributed to the project's successful completion. Moreover, day-to-day
follow-up by Bank staff, especially the task team leader, alerted the ministry to adhere to
the implementation schedule.

Problems encountered

The congestion at Djibouti Port and challenges associated with transporting fertilizer to
central warehouses were the major problems encountered during implementation. They
were resolved by government-coordinated interventions before they caused serious
supply imbalances.

Lessons learned

Officials from MoARD and representatives of importers traveled to Djibouti and
discussed with port authorities and other bodies the optimum utilization of port berths
and other facilities. Arrangements were also made with the Ethiopian Ministry of
Transport and Communications and local truck companies. These actions permitted
fertilizer to be imported and distributed to farmers on time.

World Bank supervision contributed a great deal of useful advice for implementing
project components.
