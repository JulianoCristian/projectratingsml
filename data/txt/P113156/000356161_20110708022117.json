{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Fertilizer Support\n            Project for Ethiopia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the risk of a short-run emergency\n            response compromising a long term World Bank supported\n            reform effort should be assessed at design. Steps to bring\n            the reform effort back on track if needed after the\n            emergency should be identified. Health safety and\n            environmental implications need particular attention in\n            emergency projects such as Fertilizer Support Project (FSP)\n            since their rushed implementation schedule often does not\n            allow for mitigation plans to be put in place before\n            implementation. A more sophisticated system of estimating\n            demand, including an estimate of the optimum level of\n            strategic fertilizer reserves between one season and the\n            next would be important for ensuring efficiency of resource\n            use in Ethiopia which is entirely dependent on centralized\n            imports for its fertilizers."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
