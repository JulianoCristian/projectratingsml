APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Road transport has a vital role in the economy of Burundi, provia-
ing as it does almost the only means of transport within the country. Ship-
ment of all imported and processed goods from the capital, Bujumbura, to
the widely dispersed population, and collection of the country's agricultural
production for internal consumption and export relies almost entirely on the
road network. The rugged topography, however, makes land transport both
difficult and costly, a situation aggravated by the extremely poor conditior
of the road network due to inadequate maintenance. The purpose of the proposed
project is to reduce the high cost of internal transport, an impediment to
economic growth, through imtroved highway maintenance on 1,400 km of the most
economically important roads.
ii.       The nroject is based on a feasibility study financed by the United
Nations Development Programne (UNDP) in 1968-1969, on a detailed engineering
and maintenance study financed by the Association (Credit Sll-BU: US$380,O00)
in 1970, and on studies undertaken by consultants in 1973 to update the
original reports.  The Droject comprises:  (a) a four-year highway maintenance
program including the provision of technîcal assistance, training, equipment
and workshop facilities; (b) services of consultants to carry out the feasi-
bi7ity study and detailed engineering of the Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road
(106 km) and to prepare a master plan for further road development; and (c)
project preparation including refinancing of Credit Sll-BIJ.
iii.      The total capital cost of the project îs estimated at US$8.4
million, With a foreign exchange component of US$7.2 million. The IDA
credit of US$5.0 million will cover US$4.82 million of the foreign costs and
US$0.18 im*dion of the local costs. Contributions from the UNDP (US81.05
million) - } the Federal Republic of Germany (US$1.33 million) will cover the
remainïng foreign costs, while the remaining local costs will be met by the
governments of Eelgium (US$O.4 million) and Burundi (US$0.62 million of which
about US$200,000 represents taxes and duties). In addition to meeting its
share of the local capital costs of the project, the Government of Burundî 'as
given assurances that it will meet the required recurrent costs of highwav
maintenance which are expected to total about US$1.0 million annually.
iv.       The Department of Roads and Bridges in the Ministry of Public Works
wilIl be responsible for ex'cution of the nroject, assisted by the experts to
be nrovided.  Maintenance and training eqtuipment to be financed by IDA (USS2.O
million) will be procured after international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank/IDA guidelines, wîth separate contracts for each type or each grouip



- il -
of similar types of equipment. For any contract of less than US$10,000 equi-
valent, bidding will be advertised locally. Suitably qualified consultants
xdll be selected to carry out the preinvestment studies.  The supplementary
review by consultants in 1973 carried out at the suggestion of the Associa-
tîon will be financed retroactively (US$10,000).
v.        The highway maintenance program, which will be the first phase of
a 1onger pro-ram, will concentrate on laying the foundation for a competent
and self-sufficient highway maintenance organization. The program is well
justified, with improved maintenance of the approximately 1,400 km of road
included in this first phase expected to yield an economic return of 13%.
vi.       The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$5.0 million to
the Republie of Burundi.



BURUNDI
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The proposed highway maintenance project has evolved with diffi-
culty. In 1968-69 the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with the
Bank as executing agency, financed a feasibility study for improvement of the
road from Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, to Kigoma in Tanzania, a rail-
head of the East African Railways by which Burundi's export-import traffic is
transported to and from the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam. The study, which
was carried out by the consultants, DIWI-SCET (Federal Republic of Cermany/
France), demonstrated that the volume of international traffic was insuffi-
cient to warrant an improved international road link in competition with
established lake transport between Bujumbura and Kigoma. Data collected tinder
the studv indicated, however, that improvement of the road from Bujumbura as
far as Nyanza Lac would be economically justified.
1.02      In 1970, the Association followed the study with a credit (Sll-BU)
of US$380,000 to help finance the detailed engineering of the Bujumbura-
Nyanza Lac road (121 km) as well as a study for the improvement of highway
maintenance, identified during appraisal of that project as a high priority
recuirexent.  The consultants, Dr. Ing. Walter (DIWI, Germany), were re-
tained to carry out these studies and, on the basis of their findings, in
October 1971 an IDA mission appraised a project consisting of reconstruction
of the Bujumbura-Mutambara section of the road to bituminous paved standard;
improvement of the Mutambara-Nyanza Lac section to gravel standard; and
initiation of a four-year program to improve highway maintenance. In April
1972, an US$8.9 million credit was negotiated for this project but Board
presentation was deferred when the influence area of the project road was
depopulated after political disturbances in May 1972.
1.03      In November 1972 the Burundi Government proposed to the Association
that the conditions of contract for reconstruction of the Bujumbura-Nyanza
Lac road be modified to render the work more labor intensive with the purpose
of expediting resettlement of the region.  Subsequently, the consultants
DIWI were asked to study the feasibility of this approach. The conclusion of
the consultants' report, submitted in April 1973, was that labor, if
available, could be substituted for equipment for some operations but that
execution of works to the original standards was not justified at this
stage in view of the present low traffic volumes (only about half of the
1971 level). In April 1973, FAO consultants, A. Albenque and A. Quinard,
undertook a study to determine the potential for economic rehabilitation of
the region through resettlement of the population. They concluded that if
a resettlement and rehabilitation progran were undertaken, it would take
about five years before production in the abandoned areas reattained îts



- 2 -
1971 level. In view of these findings, IDA proposed to the Government to
finance only limited improvement of the Bujumbura-Nyanza Lac road for the
present and to defer financing of the reconstruction to paved standard of the
Bujumbura-Muzambara road section until traffic volumes justîfy ït.  Although
the Government iniîtally agreed, it indicated later that it considered that
the reconstruction of the road section was needed immediately and that it
could not wait until IDA could finance it.  The Government therefore preferred
to seek alternate sources of financing for the reconstruction and to limit
the proJect to highway maintenance and preinvestment studies. Accordingly,
in December 1973, a revised draft Credit Agreement for a US$5.0 million
credit was negotiated with the Government.
1.04      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$8.4
million, with a foreign cost component of about US$7.2 million. Project
costs will be shared by the Association, by the UNDP and by the governments
of the Federal Republie of Germany, Belgium and Burundi. The IDA credit of
U155.O million will cover about 61% of total costs net of taxes and duties.
US$4.82 million, or 96% of the credit will be for foreign costs and the re-
maînin-. US$180,000 will be applied toward local costs. The proposed credit
includes refinancing of Credit Sll-BU.
1.05      This will be the third Bank Group lending operation in the trans-
port sector of what is now the Republic of Burundi. A Bank loan (165-BE)
of US$4.8 million was made in 1957 to the Belgian Trust Territory of Puanda-
Urundi to finance the improvement of the Bujumbura-Muramvya road to bitumi-
nous paved standard and the expansion of the port of Bujumbura. These works
were completed in 1959.
1.06      This report is based on the above-mentioned studies and on the
findings of two IDA missions to Burundi: the first in October 1971 comprising
Messrs. R. H. Snel (engineer), D. Jovanovic and A. Weckerle (economists), and
the second in July 1973 comprising Messrs. W. Sikorski (engineer) and K. Clare
(economist). The report was edîted by Miss J. Murphy.
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Setting
2.01      The Republic of Burundi is a small, landlocked country in Central
Africa on the northeastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. The terrain is very
rugged. making transport within the country very difficult; road construction
is costly and this has hampered the development of a road svstem of adequate
standards. The major economic activity is agriculture. Coffee is the main
export, accounting in recent years for almost 80% of total export earnings,
with cotton, the second export item, accounting for about 10%.



- 3 -
2.02      Burundi is among the most densely populated countries in Africa
(136 inhabitants/km2). About 95% of the people live in rural areas on
individual holdings and the absence of organized settlements is a striking
fe,ture of the landscape.  The only urban concentrations are found at the
few administrative centers established under the Belgian trusteeship.
Bujumbura, the capital and main marketing and processing center, has approx-
imately 100,000 inhabitants.
B. The Transport System
2.03      Transport within the country is almost entirely by road.  The
5,500 km network is among the most dense in Africa (Table 1) and is
adequately distributed in accordance with the needs of the dense rural
population. The condition of the network, however, is extremely poor,
mainly due to inadequate maintenance. The resulting high vehicle operat-
ing costs are a major factor in the generally high cost of internal trans-
port.  The small size of miost trucks, determined in part by the state
of the network, and the under-utilization of the trucking fleet, pri-
marilv because of seasonal variations in transport demand, are also contri-
buting factors to the high costs.
2.04      Almnost all export-import traffic is by lake between Bujumbura and
Kigoma in Tanzania and bv rail between Kigoma and the Indian Ocean port ot
Dar es Salaam, a total distance of about 1,400 km. While alternative outiets
to both Atlantic and Indian Ocean ports are possible, they are less reliable
and more costly than the present route. The port of Bujumbura has a capacity
of 450,000 tons per annum, having been designed to handle large volumes of
transit traffic for what are now the countries of Zaire and Rwanda as well
as domestic export-import needs. Due to political tension among the three
countries, transit traffic dropped sharply just a few years after the port
was reconstructed in 1959 and declined still further when Zaire reopened, in
1966, a lake port at Kalundu. At present only about one-third of the total
capacity at Bujumbura is utilized.  Because of this under-utilization, the
port has â'-8 to increase its charges per ton to meet fixed costs, thus rais-
lng the a- -ady bigh cost of transport for external trade.  Traffic through
the port over the past f ew years has grown at about 6% annually, and totalled
157,400 tons in 1971, about 14'. of it being in transit.
2.05      The country has an international airport serving large jet aircra c
ar Bujtmxbura as well as six sa îi airstrins scattered throughout the country.
The 3uiumbura airport, whlch ïs the only one serviced by scheduled flights,
has recentiy been modernizeci with aid from France ard Belgium. The annual
voIu;,e of traffic throu-h zhis airport has been erratic, and in 1972 amounted
to on'v about 24,000 passen-ers and 850 tons of frei-ht, about half of the
1970 leveis.  The Governrient h11s recently created a state-owned airline,
Societe de transport aerienne du Burundi, with technical assistance from the
French Covernrent.  The company bas acouired three DC3's with which it is
provirling short-haul service hetween Bujumbura and neighboring countries.

C. Transport Policy and Coordination
As roadc transport is dominant within the country, there are no
particular pro Ye.rras of modal coordination.  The Government recognizes, in the
fran1e Cf overa  s social and economic development, the importance of providing
e-n :rdrliable transport facilities.  Policy is directed primarilv to
tne reciuc4-fn or internal transport costs through improvement of the existing
low-sta-ndard road network. To achieve this, emphasis is appropriately being
praced on the reconstruction of primary routes, particularly those radîating
rom Buiumbura, and on improvement of highway maintenance (para. 3.08).
2.07      Becaiuse of its landlocked position and distance to the sea, there
is l4tt'e Burundi can do to lessen the high cost of transport for its exports
anfd iinrorts. Its dependence, however, on rail service via Kigoma, which in
r,.c past has heen disrupted from time to time, places it in a particularly
-*.<lnerab  position.  As stated above, several other, though more costly,
routes co the Atlantic and Indian Ocean ports would be possible in an emergen-
cy, and an objective of Government policy for the lone term is the improvement
of access to these routes. The Government is considering the feasibility of
developing a route east to connect with Tanzania's road-rail system. A road
from Gitega through Ruyigi to the Tanzanian border was studied by consultants,
DIWI, under the maintenance study, but i ts improvement was found to be un-
:justified at this time. The most promising alternative as an emergency route
seems to be the existing road north through Pwanda to Kampala in Uganda, and
from there bv rail to Mombasa in Kenya, a total distance of about 2,000 km.
Both the European Development Fund (FED) and IDA are helping to finance the
paving of various sections of the 800 km of road involved.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Road Network
3.01      The road network consists of about 5,500 km of roads and tracks
(Table 2). About 3,000 hn of roads are under the authority of the Ministry
of Public Works and have been classified as either primary, secondary or
tertîarvy a classification which reflects theïr administrative function.
The remaaining roads, which carry very little traffic, are left to the local
authorities. Onlv about 2% of the total network is presently paved: the
Bujumbura-Gitega road (102 km), the Bu-jumbura-Zaire border road toward Uvira
(14 km), and the 6 km Bujumbura airport road.
3.02      The builk of the network consists of unengineered earth roads and
tracks.  The roads are narrow, with widths varying from 4 to 6 meters; their
aigrnment is poor; and lack of maintenance has caused deterioration of the



- 5 -
running surface. Although of low standard, most of these roads are usable
throughout the year because many of the natural soils, particularly in the
mountainous areas, consist of gravel and other well-draining materials.
B. Traffic Crowth and Characteristies
3.03       Traffic volumes are very light throughout the country with only
about 6% of the classified network carrying 100 or more vehicles per day
(vpd) and almost 60% carrying less than 10 vpd. The most travelled roads
are those radiating from Bujumbura.  The Ministry of Public Works maintains
traffic counting stations on the main roads.  Traffic data and statistics
on fuel consumption over the past five years indicate that traffic on the
network as a whole is growing at about 6-8% per year.
3.04       The vehicle fleet (Table 3) grew at an average annual rate of about
8% between 1966 and 1970; in 1970, the fleet totalled about 5,350 vehicles,
of which 69% wvas passenger cars and light vans; 29%, trucks; and 2%o, buses
and special vehicles.  Government-oxmed vehicles represent ahout 3Y, of the
total fleet. The fastest growth has been among privateiy-owned light vehicles.
Buses are in particularly short supply, and much passenger transport is by
truck.
3.05      There is very little public regulation of the road transport
industry.  All commercîaL carriers are required to have vehic'es inspected
twice a year and to obtain a license, available for a small fee. The industry
is dominated by individual owner-drivers. A few organized freight companies
exist, the largest of which is a Belgian-owned firm, TRANSRUKI, which has its
main office in Bujumbura. Competition is keen, and the Government prescribes
onlv maximum tarif fs per km. Mucb of the nassenger transnort in Buîumbura and
Citega, the Cto largest urban centers, is provided by a bus company orerated
by the Department of Transport Services (Service des Transports de Burtindi -
STB) in the Ministry of Public Works.
C. Highway Administration
3.06      The Ministry of Public Wnrks has responsibility for the desiFns
construction and maintenance of a.ll classified roads.  V>o denartments wIt..in
the AMinistry deal with various aspects oef roads administration: the Depart-
ment of Roads and Bridges (19irection des Ponts et Chaussees - DPC) executes
mînor construction works and carries out rotutine maintenance and the Depart-
merln  of Planning and Design (sureau Cenrral Technique) engineers works
carried out bv the DPC and administers a 1 construction contracts.  Until re-
centlv, the STB, in addition to providi_ng passenger transport, purchased,
riaintained and repaired al! highway maintenance equipment. This arrangement,
however, often led to excessive delavs in equipment repair, largely because
of the STB's other resvonsibiîities.  At the recommendation of the consultants
under the highway maintenance study the Covernnent has given the DPC respon-
sihility for the maintenance of its orn equipment fleet and is setting up a
>;echanical Services Division in the DPC for this purpose (para. 3.13).



-6-
3.07      "111 activitles are directed from Ministry headquarters in Bujumbura.
Th-j high!y cec.tralized type of administration is well suited to the present
needs of rhe counLrY în vlew of its size, the preponderance of activity near
,  ci   ard t.e shortage of technically trained personnel.  At present,
t'e orlv BururA± .a^4t,eers dealing with roads in the Ministry are the Directors
of the DrC and o- the Deparrment of Planning and Design; the few remaining
technicai st.-ff are provided from Belghmi, the Federal Republic of Germany,
France aLd FF.D.  Only about twenty Burundi nationals are scheduled to complete
engineering studies abroad within the next five years, and the Ministry, which
expects to obtain at most about half of these, will remain dependenr for some
tliçe on expatriate technical staff for the desîgn and execution of major con-
struction works. The experts to be provided under the project will strengthen
the technical staff and help to train new graduates as they become available.
D. Planning and Fînancing
3.A8      T'ne 'Mnistry of Planning, in cooperation with the Ministrv of Public
Works, plans ïnvestments în the highway sector.  Major highway construction
works are fînanced through foreign aid, mainly from FED. Of the four primary
routes included in the first Five-Year Development Plan (1968-1972) still
beine executed, FED agreed to finance the reconstruction and paving of two:
the Miuramvya-Gitega road (54 km) has been completed at a cost of about US$4.0
million and the Bugarama-Kayanza-Rwanda border road (82 kn) is under construc-
tion, at an estimated cost of about US$10.5 million. Detailed engineering
for the Bujumbura-Cibitoke-Rwanda border road (80 km) is underway. The fourth
road in the plan is the Bujumbura-Nyanza Lac road (121 km) for which the
Government is seeking financing (para. 1.03). The main objective of the se-
cond Five-Year Development Plan (1973-76) with regard to highways is the im-
provement of maintenance.
3.09      Road users contribute to Government revenues through import duties
and taxes on vehicles, spare parts and fuel, and through registration and
licensing fees. Total revenues collected are estimated te have averaged about
US$2.n m'willion annually from 1969 to 1971, which exceeds by a wide margin the
Goverrrent's annual highwav expenditures (para. 3.10) though approximating total
expenditures on roads including foreign aided developnent projects.  While
most of these funds are fed into the Government's general budget, a surtax on
gasoline nnd diese1 oil is allocated directly to the National Road Fund,
established în 1969 to help finance capital expenditures in the highway sector.
The surtax was raised from FBu 1 (USe 1.14) per liter to FBu 3 (USé 3.8) per
liter in April t973.  Revenues from the surtax are expected to amount to about
TUS$600,000 în 1973. Total revenues from road users are expected to continue
sufficient to cover all recurrent highway expenditures as well as a substantial
portion of capital investments. As most highway investments will in fact be
financed hy foreign aid, road users will continue to he a substantial source
of revenue for the Covernment's general development budget.



-7-
E. Highway Expenditures
3.'0      The Government's annual highway expenditures, apart from its con-
tribution to foreign aided development projects, averaged about US$910,000
over the period 1967-1970 (Table 4). That portion spent on recurrent main-
tenance averaged US$610,000 annually, of which 80% was for salaries and
wages and the remainder for fuel, materials and spare parts. New equipment
purchases accounted for an average of about US$180,000 annually and minor
construction works, for the remaining US$120,000. Minor construction works
and maintenance equipment have been financed out of the "budgets extraordi-
naires" of the DPC and the STB and from the National Road Fund, while the
recurrent costs of highway maintenance have been financed through the "budgets
ordinaires" of the DPC and the STB. The Association estimates that, on the
basis of present traffic levels, about US$1.0 million is required annually to
assure adequate maintenance of the road network. During the initial project
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that sufficient funds will be
allocated annually for highway maintenance needs and, to this end, amended the
regulations concerning the National Road Fund in April 1973 so that revenues
received from the recently increased surtax on fuel can be utilized for re-
current maintenance expenditures as well as small capital works.
F. rngineering and Construction
3.11      The Department of Planning and Design is in charge of the design
of highway construction work and administers foreign financed construction
projects. The Department's staff, which is headed by a Burundi engineer,
consists of about ten expatriates (engineers, architects and technicians) of
whoxn most are provided through technical assistance from Belgium, France and
FED, the others having been contracted by the Government. Engineering and
supervision of construction on major projects are carried out by foreign con-
sultants. Major construction works are let to contract after competitive
bidding.  There is no domestic construction industry; several European firms,
one of whi   has established an office locally, have undertaken works carried
out to date.
G. Highway Maintenance
3.12      The DPC is responsible for maintenance of the approximately
3,!000 km of classified roads. The Department lacks both staff and equipment
and bas not been able to provide the network with satisfactory maintenance.
The limîted equipmient available is used on a few of the most important roads
near Bujumbura and Gitega; maintenance of most of the network is done by hand.
While hand labor can be used effectively for some maintenance operations,
such as the clearing of ditches and filling of potholes, the DPC has not been
able to make efficient use of its labor force because trained staff is lack-
ing to organize and direct the work crews and transport is unavailable for



- 8 -
either laborers or materials. DPC activities have therefore been limited to
emergency repairs and clearir±g of land slides. The absence of regular and
satisfactory preventive maintenance has led to a gradual deterioration of the
road network.
3.13      The few paved roads had also been deteriorating badly, but since
1967 they have received regular maintenance under a program financed by the
Federal Republic of Germany which provided mechanical equipment, technical
assistance and traîning.  In order to coordinate its efforts with the mainte-
nance program included in the project, the German technical assistance program
has, since mid-1972, been assisting the DPC in the establishment of a Mechanical
Services Division so that it might take over responsibility for maintenance of
its own equipment as recommended in the highway maintenance study. The German
assistance includes construction and equipping of a mechanical workshop at
Bujumbura, which will be completed by July 1974, and the provision of four
experts (one engineer and three mechanical foremen) through mid-1975. This
assistance will be extended under the project (para 4.03).
4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project consists of the following:
(a)  implementation of a four-year highway maintenance
program; and
(b)  the provision of consultants' services for:
(i) preparation of a master plan for road develop-
ment;
(ii) feasibility study and detailed engineering of the
Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road (106 km) and other roads
identified under (i) above;
(iii) updating the consultants' report financed by Credit
Sll-BU for preparing the project; and
(c) refinancing of Credit Sll-BU.
Highway Maintenance Program
4.02      The Association estimates that some eight to ten years will be
required to establish a highway maintenance organization capable of keeping
the road network adequately maintained. The four-year program (1974-1977) to



- 9 -
be carried out under the present project will be the first phase of the long-
term program and will concentrate on providing the required facilities and
on training a nucleus of able technicians and skilled laborers on which a
strong organization can be built. The present project includes:
(a) the provision of technical assistance to the DPC, including
the training of DPC personnel at all levels;
(b) the purchase of maintenance, workshop and training equip-
ment, spare parts, fuel and materials;
(c)  the construction of a mechanical workshop and storeroom
at Bujumbura and of a small maintenance depot at Gitega.
During negotiations, the Government agreed that it will, during the first six
months of calendar year 1977, consult with the Association to define the
second phase of the maintenance program expected to begin in 1978, and seek
financing for its execution.
(i) Technical Assistance (See Table 5)
4.03      At present, the DPC technical staff is limited to the Director, a
few technicians, and the four german experts who are helping organize the
new Mechanical Services Division and supervising the ongoing construction
of the mechanical workshop. The German authorities have agreed to extend
these services to the end of the project period and, under the project, the
German team will assist in establishing and operating the new equipment re-
pair services. The UNDP has agreed to finance six additional experts, to
be provided by consultants, who will be assigned to DPC headquarters and to
road maintenance operations. They will assist in establishing five small
maintenance units (para. 4.06) which wîll undertake the maintenance of about
1,400 km of selected roads over the four-year period.
4.04      In addition to filling various posts at headquarters, the consul-
tants' team and the German technical assistance team will train Burundi
counterp^ -s as they become available. During the program period some two
newly gra.uated engineers or technicians are expected to join the DPC annually,
and they will be absorbed as quickly as possible into its organization. The
experts will also provide on-the-job training of technical personnel, with
the consultants being responsible for training inspectors, foremen and equîp-
ment operators, and the German experts, for the training of mechanics.
4.05      The training needs of the department are, however, much more exten-
sive than can be met by the civil engineering consultants to be provided.
Meeting these needs will necessitate a comprehensive program in technical edu-
cation for the upgrading of unskilled and semi-skilled laborers through class-
room and practical training. Existing facilities in Burundi for technical
education include a technical school in Bujumbura to which is attached a
School of Public Works, and a training center in Gitega which is supported by
Belgian technical assistance. With some adaptation, the present facilities



- 10 -
can be utilized to satisfy the training requirements of the maintenance program.
The proiect therefore includes the services of a training expert for three
months to evaluate the existing training facilities and needs, and to develop
a curriculum for training maintenance personnel in coordination with the on-
the-job training to be provided by DPC headquarters' staff. The project also
includes a provisional allowance for the employment of instructors and the pur-
chase of training equipment. During negotiations the Government agreed that,
upon receipt of the training expert's recommendations, it will consult with
the Association and agree upon the appropriate allocation of funds available
for training under the project.
(ii) Equipment and Materials
4.06      Under the first phase of the maintenance program, approximately
1,400 km of the most important roads will receive regular maintenance (Table 6).
Of these, the roads in the poorest condition (about 400 km) have been selected
for minor betterment works and regravelling. All operations which can be
done properly by hand will continue to be carried out by manual labor whose
efficiency will be increased by providing the maintenance crews with light
trucks. In addition, to increase the efficiency of operations and to assure
the required quality standard, equipment will be provided for works which
are most appropriately carried out by machine, such as haulage of materials
and grading and compaction of road surfaces. Five small mechanized units
will be established and equipped under the project: three for grading
of road surfaces, one for regravelling, and one capable of minor earthworks
and improvement of drainage facilities.  The type and number of mechanical
equipment needed for the program (Table 7) have been assessed on the basis
of estimates of average daily traffic, the type of roads to be maintained,
and the estimated number of working days per year, taking into account the
existing salvageable equipment. The project also provides for the purchase
of spare parts for the new equipment and for some of the existing equipment,
as well as for the purchase of fuel and materials required to carry out
deferred maintenance and road betterment works.
(iii) Buildings
4.07      Buildings to be constructed under the project include the mechanical
workshop at Bujumbura, on which construction has begun, an annex to the work-
shop containing a storeroom for spare parts, and a small maintenance depot in
Gitega for equipment maintenance and minor repairs. The Federal Republic of
Germany is financing construction and equipment of the workshop; IDA will
finance construction of the workshop annex and the maintenance depot and
renovation of the School of Public Works at Bujumbura.
Preinvestment Studies
4.08      While the maintenance works to be carried out under the present
project will, for the most part, improve the road system adequately to serve
present traffic requirements, more substantial works will be renuired on cer-
tain road sections over the next five years if they are to serve the country's



- il -
needs. The project therefore includes the provision of consultants to assist
the Government in identifying and preparing future road projects. The consul-
tants will carry out a feasibility study, followed by detailed engineering
if justified, of the Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road (106 km) which serves a densely
ponulated area where several agricultural programs are underway including an
IDA-financed coffee project (Credit 147-BU). Consultants will also prepare
a master plan for further road development in Burundi, identifying priorities
and proceeding with additional feasibility studies of specific roads after
agreement between the Covernment and the Association.
4.09      The Government has requested IDA financing for the study, carried
out by consultants at the suggestion of the Association, to complete project
preparation (para. 1.03); that îs, DIWI's supplementary study of the
Bujumbura-Nyanza Lac road. The project, therefore, includes a provision
for retroactive financing of the foreign costs of this review (US$10,000).
The project also includes refinancing of Credit Sll-BU which financed the
engineering and maintenance studies on which the present project is based.
B. Project Execution
4. 10     The DPC in the Ministry of Public Works will be responsible for
execution of the project and will be assisted by the experts to be proviclei.
The consultants' team at headquarters will prepare the bidding documents for
the mechanical equipment and materials and will assist in the evaluation of
the bids. Separate contracts for each type or each group of similar types of
equipment will be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance
xith Bank/IDA Guidelines. For any contract of less than US$10,000 ecuivalent,
bidding will be advertised locally. These arrangements were confirmed during
negotiations. Suppliers of mechanical equipment will be required to provide
satisfactory after-sales and spare parts service. Suitably qualified consul-
tants will be selected to carry out the preinvestment studies.

4.12      The cost of equipment, fuel and materials has been estimated on
the basis of data provided by the consultants. The foreign cost of equipment
and spare parts is equivalent to the CIF Bujumbura prices. The foreign cost
of the aggregate of fuel, materials and buildings (workshop annex and main-
t.ance depot) is estimated at about 80% of the total cost of these items.
The costs of consulting services for technical assistance and training have
oeen estimated on the basis of man-month requirements. The cost of the pre-
investment studies has been estimated on a per-kilometer basis.
4.13      A quantity contingency of 10% has been added to the procurement
items of the highway maintenance program to cover additional needs that may
become apparent during its execution. A 10% contingency allowance has also
been added to the consulting services. A 12% contingency has been provided
for price escalation. The allocations for the UNDP and the Federal Republic
of Germany includes 20% for contingencies.
4.14      The total capital cost of the project is estimated at US$8.4
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$7.2 million or
86%. Costs will be shared as follows:

The German contribution is for constructing the main workshop and providing
experts to help operate it, while the UNDP grant will help finance the six
experts who will assist the DPC to carry out the road maintenance works. The
Belgian c--tribution will be a grant to help finance local project costs.
Burundi , l finance all costs not covered by external aid, including all
taxes and duties. IDA will help finance equipment, fuel, materials, construc-
tion, and studies as indicated below.
D.  Dishursements
4.15      Credit funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 87% of the on-site cost of fuel and materials and of
the cost of constructing the workshop annex and main-
tenance depot, which percentage represents an average
of the estimated foreign exchange costs of these items
plus the Association's contribution to local costs;



- 14 -
(b)  the CIF cost Bujumbura of imported equipment and spare
parts;
(c)  the foreign exchange costs of consultants' services for
training and preinvestment studies; and
(d)  refinancing of Credit S11-BU.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 8.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      Due to Burundi's rugged topography, landlocked position and distance
to the sea, transport costs in general are an important factor in its economic
development. Transport within the country relies almost exclusively on road
transport which provides the only means of communication among most of the
widely dispersed population and productive areas. The road network is, how-
ever, in extremely poor condition, and the resulting high transport costs are
an impediment to economic growth. Providing reliable and efficient transport
links consistent with demand is thus of high priority. In view of the low
traffic volumes on »ost of the network, the appropriate way to cater for traffic
is improved road maintenance and this is the focus of the present project.
5.02      The four-year highway maintenance program (Table 6) was defined in
the course of project appraisal, taking into account the length of roade which
most urgently require maintenance and improvement, their traffic, the capa-
bility of local technical staff to implement the project and the availability
of local funds to meet capital and recurrent costs.
5.03      The estimates of traffic volumes on the roads included in the pro-
gram are based on counts taken by the consultants. Traffie on these roads
is expected to grow at about 7% per annum, which has been the average growth
rate experienced on these roads during the past five years. The economic
life of the project has been taken as ten years reflecting roughly the
weighted average of the economic lives of the interdependent elements making
up the program.
5.04      For the purpose of analysis, the cost of the maintenance program
has been taken to include the cost of capital investments, technical as-
sistance and (incremental) recurrent maintenance over the project period
(1974-77), as well as the costs incurred since mid-1972 under the Cerman
technical assistance programn for establishing the Mechanical Services
Division. The level of maintenance expenditure under the project as com-
pared with expected expenditure without the project involves an incremental
recurrent expenditure of about US$115,000 in 1974, increasing to about
US$230,000 in 1977, at which time the maintenance program will be in full-
scale operation including the maintenance of about 204 km of paved roads.



- 15 -
Thereafter expenditures are expected to remain at about this level. The
benefits considered are the savings in vehicle operating costs (Table 9)
on the approximately 1,400 km of roads to be maintained and improved as in-
dicated in Table 10.  The streams of costs and benefits, summarized in Table
1-, indicate that the proposed investments are economically sound, yielding
an economic return of 13.0% and a first year return of 13%.
5.05      The above estimate relies on a number of inputs which have been
quantified with unequal degrees of certainty. The maintenance cost estimates
appear to be well founded. On the benefit side, however, future traffic
growth and savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from improved main-
tenance include some elements of uncertainty. If traffic is assumed to grow
at only 5%, the economic return would remain satisfactory at about 11%,
while a 10% decrease in savings in vehicle operating costs would reduce the
return to about 107. Onlv in the unlikely event that both traffic growth
and vehicle operating cost savings were substantially less than assumed
would the economic return fall below an acceptable level.
6.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      As indicated in paragraphs 4.03, 4.07 and 4.14, the UNDP, the
Federal Republic of Germany and Belgium will participate in the financing
of project costs.
6.02      The following are the major project matters which were discussed
and agreed between the Government and the Association during credit negotia-
tions in April 1972 and November 1973:
(a)  the annual allocation of sufficient funds for highway
maintenance (para. 3.10);
(b)  consultation with the Association during the first
months of calendar year 1977 on the definition
afid financing of the second phase of the highway
maintenance program (para. 4.02); and
(c)  consultation with the Association and agreement upon
the appropriate allocation of funds available for
trainin7 under the pro.ject (para. 4.05).
6.03      The proiect is suitable for an IDA credit of US$5.0 million equiva-
lent to the Government of Burundi.
