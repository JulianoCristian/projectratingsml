To that end,\n            the proposed project seeks to (i) rehabilitate, replace and\n            extend the Somalia National Electricity Corporation's\n            (ENEE's) generating, transmission and distribution\n            facilities in Mogadishu; and (ii) provide comprehensive\n            advisory services, operational support including line\n            managers and training to ENEE for three years in all key\n            corporate areas.  Further to this, the project aims to (iii)\n            provide technical assistance and logistical back-up\n            resources to the Ministry of National Planning (MNP) to\n            strengthen energy planning, carry out subsector investment\n            analyses, least cost petroleum procurement, distribution\n            studies and develop household energy supply and demand\n            management policies.  Lastly, the project intends (iv) to\n            provide technical assistance and logistical back-up\n            resources to the National Woodstove Project (NWP) to promote\n            cooking efficiency improvements."}, "docdt": "1987-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
