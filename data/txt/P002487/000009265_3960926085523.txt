MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SOMALIA
FOR A POWER REHABILITATION AND ENERGY PROJECT
1.         The following report on a proposed developLent credit to Somalia
for  SiR  9.7  million  (US$12.5  million  equivalent)  is  submitted  for
approval.   The proposed credit would be on 40 year IDA terms.  US$ 10.3
million would be onlent to the Ente Nazionale Energia Elettrica (ENEE) at
7.76% for a term of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period and would
help finance technical assistance and the purchase of equipment, capital
spares, and vehicles. ENEE would carry the foreign exchange risk. US$1.3
million for operating spares would be made available to ENEE against
payment of a matching amount in local currency.   The balance of US$0.9
million would be for technical assistance and logistical back-up resources
to the Ministry of National Planning (MNP) and the National Woodstove
Project (NWP). ADB would provide cofinancing of US$9.5 million equivalent
and EIB of US$14.7 million. A grant of US$50.0 million equivalent is being
provided by the Government of Italy as parallel financing for the prGject.
At a meeting of the colenders in June 1987 cofinancing and coordination
arrangements for the project were finalized.
2.         !!S§Mn!t. As indicated in the Bank's energy assessment report
of December 1985, Somalia's indigenous energy resources consist of a
fragile forest cover, other biomass (primarily crop residues), wind and
solar energy and a hydro potential of 100-120 MW along the Juba River.
There are indications of petroleum and natural gas but exploration has not
yer resulted in commercial discoveries (Afgoy Gas Delineation Credit
1043-SO).   Petroleum imports in 1985 were equivalent  to 61% of total
merchandise exports. Geothermal and lignite resources thus far identified
in northern Somalia are too small and remote from energy consumption
centers  to  be  of  much  economic  value.    Present  annual  per  capita
consumptlon of energy is about 200 kilograms of oil equivalent, which is
low by region6- standards.   82% of this consumption is from woodfuels.
Local patterns of supply and demand are seriously unbalanced and scavenging
for fuelwood and charcoal production have denuded large areas surrounding
towns, villages and refugee camps.
3.           ENEE, a parastatal corporatic-i under the Ministry of Public
Works, is responsible for power operations in Mogadishu and six regional
centers. Power facilities are in poor condition owing to shortage of funds
for spare parts, lack of skilled manpower and manpower incentive systems,
and inadequate operating and management  systems.    ENEE  can currently
operate only 20% of its installed generating capacity, meets less than 35%
of connected demand (30 MW) on the Mogadishu system and has not been able
to connect a further 10 MW of unserved demand.  Power system losses are
high at 24% due to an overloaded distribution network and unmetered
consumption. Unreliable power supply in Mogadishu is frequently disrupting
productive economic activities and fostering the build-up of costly
substitutes, i.e. captive generators and kerosene lighting.  The proposed
project addresses these issues.



-2-
4.            The Ministry of National Planning (MNP) is responsible for
overall energy planning  and  policy  formulation.    Other  energy  sector
responsibilities are lodged with several other ministries, i.e. (i) the
Ministry of Juba Valley Development (MJVi,) is responsible for developing
the hydro and agricultural potential along the Juba River; (ii) the
Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources is in charge of developing
petroleum and other minerel fuels; (iii) the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce supervises the national refinery (IRAQSOMA) and petroleum agency
(NPA); and (iv) tha National Range Agency (NRA) under the Ministry of
Livestock, Forestry and Range covers forest development and associated
charcoal and woodstove activities, Interaction for the purposes of energy
policy formulation, planning and investment programming between Government
agencies has only begun during the last several years, when an energy
planning unit was created in MNP. This unit has since been upgraded into a
full department and the GOS has indicated that the Energy Planning
Department (EPD) will have an increasingly central role and responsibility
for energy planning, policy formulation, and interagency coordination.
Specific high priority tasks include least cost investment planning and
petroleum   products   procurement   and   distribution,         EPD   requires
strengthening in its management and capability for identifying and
evaluating policy options in these and other areas.   Assistance will be
provided under the proposed project to address these tasks.
5.           Project Objectives.  The project's principal objective is to
improve the efficiency and reliability of power supply and distribution and
to meet some of the unserved demand in Mogadishu, Somalia's main economic
area.   To sustain physical  rehabilitation  improvements,  it would also
assist ENEE in strengthening its performance in key technical, financial,
and managerial areas.  The project would also help the GOS to develop its
capabilities 'or sound energy planning and policy formti :ion, with
particular attention being given to it'entifying least cost supply and
distribution options for petroleum products.   Finally the project would
promote conservation of woodfuels through dissemination of improved cooking
stoves for higher cooking efficiency and development of efficient charcoal
production and marketing.
6.                   Project  Description.   The  proposed  project  would
(i)  rehabilitate/replace/extend  ENEE's  generating,   transmission,  and
distribution facilities in Mogadishu; (ii) provide comprehensive advisory
services, operational support including line manag2rs, and training to ENEE
for three years in all key corporate areas; and (iii) provide technical
assistance and logistical back-up resources to EPD to strengthen energy
planning, carry out subsector investment analyses and least cost petroleum
procurement and distribution study, and develop household supply and demand
management policies; and (iv)provide technical assistance and logistical
back-up resources to the National Woodstove Project under NRA to promote
cooking efficiency improvements.   The total estimated project  cost  is
US$94.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$84.7
million (902). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B,   A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Somalia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively,   A map is also
attached as is the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6834-SO dated September 29,

'987.  A Project Preparation Facility of US$1.5 million has been approved
to finance engineering, advance procurement services and some emergency
rebabilitation works.
7.            Rationale for DA Involvement.  The project is part oi the
country's  priority  investment  program  and  reinforces  IDA's  country
assistance strategy which emphasizes key infrastrincture support and
institution building. It responds to the need for institutional reforms at
ENEE, urgently required investment to meet an emergency situation, and
Government's request to mobilize and coordinate donors in the power
sector.  It also develops longer term investment plans and, while medium
term oriented, helps pave the way to longer term sector development,
possibly including the US$300 million Baardhere project along the Juba
River.
8.         Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with Government/ENEE
on the following principal actions: (i) tariffs would be adjusted so that
ENEE would fund at least 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% of its investment programs
in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 and thereafter, respective'y, from internally
generated cash after working capital and debt service; (ii) ENEE would earn
a return on revalued net fixed assets of not less than 8% starting in 1990;
(iii) ENEE would maintain acco- ts receivable and payable at not more than
120 days in 1988 and 90 days in 1989 and thereafter of billing and
non-payroll cash operating expenditures respectively; (iv) ENEE would not
incur new debt over and beyond that for contracted for the project, if the
debt service coverage ratio, based on reasonable  financial projections
which include the new debt, is less than 1.5 during any year of the
projection -eriod; (v) Government, ENEE, and IDA would jointly review the
Reference  Investment  Program  (RIP)  from  1988  on  an  annual  basis;
investments not in the RIP would require IDA approval if such investments
were above US$  1 million equivalent or  1% of groe:- revalued assets,
whichever is smaller; (vi) ENEE and Government will review annually with
IDA whether ENEE will meet the financial performance requirements for that
year and the next year and subsequently take appropriate measures,
including adjustment of tariffs; and (vii) as a condition of credit
effectiveness, IDA would require (a) signature of the operational
assistance/project management contract for the project featuring the
maintenance of line managers; (b) settlement of second 50% of arrears
between ENEE and the public sector; (c) effectiveness of African
Development   Fund   and   European   Investment   Bank   agreements;   and
(d) Government to conclude subsidiary loan agreement with ENEE.
9.         Justification.  Economic benefits from LLe proposed project are
expected  from  sustained  improvements  in  efficiency,  availability  and
reliability  of  power  supply  in  the Mogadishu  system.    The estimated
economic rate of return is 25%.
10.         Risks.  The main risk would be delays in implementation and
non-sustainability of improvements. This risk would be diminished by the
project's operational and management support and systems improvement
component and regular monitoring of ENEE's financial performance.
