"loan_no": "P263;3844", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is highly likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. The Portfolio Development Project was a very\n            unusual operation implemented in a very unusual Borrower\n            during a very specific time period. Hence, lessons learned\n            do not lend themselves easily for formulation if one\n            attempts to draw conclusions potentially applicable to new\n            projects in Russia, let alone other countries. Nevertheless,\n            the key lessons learned from the Portfolio Development\n            Project are outlined as follows:  1) The reasons behind such\n            painfully slow start-up to Russian projects have varied, but\n            eventually these particular projects not only improved but\n            in fact turned into success stories. It seems that patience\n            and flexibility exhibited by the Bank may work wonders for\n            some projects. In retrospect, in this particular project it\n            has worked apparently once the critical mass of ownership of\n            the Project accumulated circa 1997. The PDL started to\n            perform only when the right team was assembled in FCPF with\n            very strong leadership. 2) A new institution building\n            project may succeed provided, among other things, that a\n            capable, well connected and strong manager is identified,\n            whose commitment to the project is clearly above average and\n            who has skills that are normally required for crisis\n            management. If this is not the case then the risks to the\n            sustainability of the project increase exponentially.  3)\n            Decentralization of task management benefits a project. 4)\n            The supervision requirements, especially for documentation,\n            are very much geared towards a typical model of task\n            management from Washington with regular supervision\n            missions. When the task team is permanently in the field\n            project issues are being resolved on the daily basis and,\n            hence, recording of these project developments in formal\n            aide-memoires tend to seem like a somewhat artificial and\n            superficial burden. Perhaps an alternative arrangement to\n            record the status of such project could be offered.  5)\n            Fiscal sustainability of a new entity is a key foundation\n            for success of an institution-building project, especially\n            if an entity created is not supposed to or cannot be, for\n            various reasons, financed from the regular budget. The\n            solution for this Project, though again perhaps not easily\n            replicable, but certainly an effective one was to provide to\n            the Federal Center for Project Finance  (FCPF) a building in\n            the center of Moscow. The building is a major source of\n            revenues to cover FCPF's operating costs and thus an\n            important factor behind the sustainability of the project."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
