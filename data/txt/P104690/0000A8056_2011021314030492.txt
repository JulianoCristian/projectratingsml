                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to reduce the country financial vulnerability to natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes) of Haiti. This will be
                         achieved through the establishment of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and the financing of catastrophe insurance coverage from the
                         Facility.

                         The project aims to allow Haiti to join the CCRIF and benefit from financial protection against catastrophic earthquake and/or hurricane events. Without this
                         grant, it is unlikely Haiti would join this pilot initiative that represents the first entity created to protect small island states from the financial impact of natural
                         disasters.

                         The project's objective of reducing Haiti's financial vulnerability to natural disasters by creating an insurance mechanism that would provide a rapid injection of liquidity in the event of
                         a covered hurricane or earthquake event has been fulfilled. The $7.75 million CCRIF payout to Haiti following the January 12, 2010, earthquake was the first significant financial

                         inflow that Haiti received. It gave Haiti the capacity to continue paying key civil servants' salaries as they began to work with donors to organize disaster relief and mobilize financing
                         for the larger recovery and reconstruction effort. Beyond making the policy payment, CCRIF played a vital role in the relief effort by furnishing the Haitian authorities and donors with
                         high resolution modeling and mapping of storm-related rainfall, wind speed, and coastal flooding hazards at critical locations such as aid operation centers, refugee camps, and
                         transportation hubs. This practical, real-time information was used by the authorities and donors to guide decisions pertaining to the location of resettlement camps, etc.
