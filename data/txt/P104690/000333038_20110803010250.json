Project for Haiti were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: this\n            project offered Haiti the opportunity to join the first ever\n            regional catastrophe insurance pool and thereby secure\n            immediate liquidity in case of covered disasters\n            (earthquakes and hurricanes). It is part of a broader\n            development agenda of Bank support aimed at reducing the\n            vulnerability of Haiti and other Caribbean island countries\n            to natural disasters. After three years of operations,\n            several lessons can be drawn from this project. Risk\n            modeling tools to assess financial exposure to natural\n            disasters can provide loss estimates in dollar terms that\n            can help Ministries of Finance better understand and compare\n            threats to their fiscal balance and sensitize them to the\n            need for more pro-active disaster risk management\n            strategies. The analytical process can help increase\n            interaction between Ministries of Finance, national\n            emergency management agencies, and hydrological and\n            meteorological institutes. In the present case,\n            International Development Association (IDA) financing for\n            Haiti's participation fee and insurance premium during\n            the first three years of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk\n            Insurance Facility's (CCRIF's) operation allowed\n            the Haiti to join the CCRIF and test its value at without\n            cost and risk to itself. IDA finance also served as a\n            vehicle to deepen the Bank's dialogue with Haiti on its\n            broader and longer-term disaster risk reduction and climate\n            change adaptation strategies. The quick cash injection a\n            natural disaster is effective only if the country's\n            post-disaster budget execution system allows for an\n            immediate use of these funds. Countries should be encouraged\n            to conduct a disbursement test for a simulated disaster and\n            possibly further improve their post-disaster budget\n            execution system."}, "docdt": "2011-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
