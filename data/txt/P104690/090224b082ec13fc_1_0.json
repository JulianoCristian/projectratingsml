The facility ensures these\n            countries have rapid access to emergency financing after\n            severe weather events, and several have already done so.\n            Haiti, Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent, and the\n            Grenadines suffered earthquakes or hurricanes sufficient to\n            trigger payouts totaling United States (U.S.) 13 million\n            dollars. These rapid cash infusions reduced each\n            government\u2019s financial vulnerability to the disasters,\n            helping them to make ends meet while waiting for\n            larger-scale financing. As the first multi-country natural\n            disaster risk pool and parametric insurance facility in the\n            world, CCRIF is being closely studied by governments with a\n            view to replicating it in other regions of the world."}, "docdt": "2012-05-08T00:24:04Z"}
