The\n            emergency recovery and disaster management project (ERDMP)\n            was approved in 2005 and augmented with additional financing\n            in 2008 to strengthen the capacity of the national disaster\n            risk management system, in particular the directorate of\n            civil protection (DPC), to prepare for and coordinate public\n            response to a natural emergency. The DPC used its new\n            resources to coordinate a response that successfully\n            mitigated effects of the devastating 2008 hurricane season,\n            during which four major storms over a three-week period\n            affected 865,000 people and forced 130,000 into shelters.\n            This will ensure that disaster risk management is\n            mainstreamed as a core component of programs for sustainable\n            poverty reduction and economic growth. Continued support\n            from International Development Association (IDA) will be\n            required to ensure that Haiti successfully transitions from\n            a country living at risk to one living with risk."}, "docdt": "2009-08-28T02:50:03Z"}
