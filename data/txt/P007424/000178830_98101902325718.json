Loan\n            Project is to support the Government's program to\n            expand the value of exports of non-traditional manufactured\n            goods by 25% a year over the next five years. Thirty million\n            dollars of loan funds will be used to establish a revolving\n            Export Development Fund, which will discount commercial bank\n            loans made to exporters of manufactured goods. The Fund will\n            provide foreign exchange for the importation by bona fide\n            Jamaican exporters (and suppliers to exporters) of raw\n            materials, intermediate goods and spare parts into Jamaica.\n            The Fund will be replenished with US dollars from the sale\n            of exports and is projected to turn over up to 1.3 times a\n            year in the first year of operation and possibly more\n            rapidly thereafter. The Fund will be a government-owned\n            entity controlled and administered by JECIC, a Bank of\n            Jamaica subsidiary. It will have a minimum existence of five\n            years. $1.5 million of loan resources will be used to\n            provide technical assistance to JECIC to develop its\n            capacity to manage export financing programs and to JNEC to\n            develop its capacity to provide export marketing assistance\n            to manufacturers and to evaluate industrial development and\n            export policies and incentives."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
