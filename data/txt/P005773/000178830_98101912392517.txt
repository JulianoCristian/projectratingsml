I. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
1.01      YAR suffers from a lack of exploitable commercial energy resources.
Coal occurrences have been found at various locations, especially in the
vicinity of Taiz in the southern part of the country, but neither the extent
of the reserves nor the feasibility of commercial exploitation is known.
Similarly, no petroleum has so far been discovered despite intensified
exploration in recent years, and there are no known uranium deposits. There
is no hydropower potential and, although there is thought to be a good proba-
bility of geothermal energy in the area southeast of Damar (southern YAR),
this remains to be confirmed. Solar energy may be a possible source in the
long run, but this will depend on the development of feasible devices suitable
for YAR conditions.
1.02      For all practical purposes, the only indigenous energy resources
are the traditional fuels common to most agriculturally based developing
countries, in the form of firewood and agricultural and animal wastes. Fire-
wood, though becoming scarce and expensive, is still widely used in urban
and rural areas for cooking; in rural areas the stalks and roots of the major
cereal crops are another important fuel, often supplemented by dried animal
dung. No data are available on the total quantities of these fuels which are
consumed nationwide, but some indication of their paramount importance is
given by a survey of household expenditure carried out in the capital, Sana'a,
in 1972. According to this, the average household of some 6 persons spent
about 7% of the household budget on all forms of fuel, including electricity,
and of this firewood accounted for over 50%, while all the traditional fuels
together accounted for 62%, compared with 38% for kerosene, liquid petroleum
gas (LPG) and electricity. Since dependence on traditional fuels must be
even greater in the rural areas where the great bulk of the population lives,
it may be concluded that these fuels are a much more important element in
national energy consumption than oil and electricity.
Consumption Trends
1.03      Despite this, consumption of imported petroleum products, the
only other primary energy source in YAR, has increased rapidly in recent
years, from 82,000 tons in 1970 to over 200,000 tons in 1976 (19% p.a.).
The import cost has risen even more sharply as a result of the leap in
world oil prices since 1973.
1.04      YAR is amongst the lowest countries in the world in terms of per
capita consumption of commercial energy, which amounted to only 30 kilograms
standards coal equivalent 1/ (kgce) in 1974. This understates total energy
1/   1 kg standard coal equivalent = 7,000 kilocalories.



- 2 -
consumption, of course, since it excludes the consumption of traditional fuels
(para. 1.02), for which data are not available, but it compares with an
average of 394 kgce of commercial energy for all developing countries, 388
kgce for Jordan, 36-0 kgce for the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, 250
kgce for Oman and a world range for all countries of 12-19,500 kgce.
Organization
1.05      The Yemen Petroleum Company (YPC), established in 1962, is respon-
sible for importing and distributing petroleum products, but is not authorized
to undertake exploration. It is owned by the Government (51%) and the Yemen
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (49%). The Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Authority (MPRA) created by Government decree in 1973, has the
general responsibility, under the Minister of State for Minerals and Oil, for
developing the country's mineral resources, including petroleum and coal. The
Yemen General Electricity Corporation (YGEC), created in 1975, is responsible
for public electricity supply.
Investment
1.06      The first Five-Year Plan, covering the period 1976/77-1980/81,
includes provision for investment expenditures by YPC totaling YRls 324 million
(at 1975/76 prices), mainly for increased storage capacity and improved dis-
tribution facilities for petroleum products. In addition, possibly half of
the planned investment of YRls 74 million by MPRA for mineral surveys and
exploration may be for energy sources (hydrocarbons, coal, geothermal energy).
The Plan also provides for investment in the electric power subsector of
YRls 858 million, so that total planned investment in the energy sector is
about YRls 1,220 million, or about 15% of planned public investment over the
five-year period. This takes no account of private investment in the sector,
especially for oil and gas exploration by foreign oil companies, for which no
figures are available.
B. The Power Subsector
Background
1.07      The generation of electricity in the Yemen Arab Republic started
by Government agencies and private individuals for their own use in the three
main cities of Sana'a (the national capital), Hodeida and Taiz. Some of
the private producers supplied their own homes and those of their immediate
neighbors. These small generation and distribution schemes were later com-
bined to form the first electricity companies. The General Electricity
Company of Sana'a was established as an independent private company in 1959.
At the time of nationalization (1975) it was owned 75% by the Government, 15%
by the Yemen National Bank and 10% by private shareholders. The Hodeida
Electricity and Water Company was established in 1965 as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Yemen National Bank. The Taiz Electricity Company was



-3-
established in 1961 as a private company owned 17% by the Government, 23%
by the Yemen National Bank and 60% by private citizens.
1.08      These companies developed along completely independent lines.
Electricity was distributed at 15 kV in Sana'a and Taiz and at 10 kV in
Hodeida. All companies suffered from the lack of qualified technical and
managerial staff, which resulted in inadequate maintenance and inspection.
These difficulties and the civil war of the sixties led to a situation in
which the generation facilities and the distribution networks were run down
and in need of extensive improvements. The shortage of generating capacity
was particularly marked in Hodeida and Taiz in recent years, resulting in
relative stagnation of the load growth in these two cities over most of the
period. In Hodeida, the maximum demand remained the same between 1973 and
1976 at 2.7 MW but rose by 39% to 3.7 MW in 1977 following an increase in
generating capacity. Similarly, in Taiz the load remained at 1.8 MW between
1972 and 1974, but rose to 2.0 MW in 1975 (11.1% growth) and 2.4 MW in 1976
(19% growth). The poor condition of the distribution networks is indicated by
the high level of distribution losses in all three cities, which currently
range from 20% in Hodeida to 25% in Taiz.
1.09      After the civil war it soon became obvious that the individual elec-
tricity supply companies could not continue pursuing their activities inde-
pendently and still meet the national objectives of development. In 1975 Law
12 was passed, which nationalized the power companies and established the Yemen
General Electricity Corporation (YGEC). There are, however, a number of
private producers in areas where YGEC does not provide service. These private
facilities vary from individual sets in individual homes to sets owned by
private individuals who extend service to their neighbors at rates ranging
from YRI 1-2/kWh (USJ 22.2 to 44.5/kwh).
Existing Facilities
1.10      Presently YGEC has three isolated main power systems, Sana'a,
Hodeidah and Taiz, as well as a few separate schemes in smaller towns and
villages. The system has a total generating capacity of 23.3 MW, of which
19.3 MW is firm. This installed capacity comprises 31 diesel sets totaling
19.4 MW and 6 mobile combustion turbines totaling 3.9 MW. All units use
diesel oil for fuel.
1.11      In both Sana'a and Hodeida the load is very suppressed and gener-
ating capacity has had to be operated at its maximum availability, as can be
seen from Table 1.2. Load shedding, particularly in Sana'a, is almost a
routine practice during the evening peak load hours.  New diesel generating
plant, partly financed by the Saudi Fund and partly by the Arab Fund under a
1974 loan agreement, is under construction, providing 10 MW in Sana'a, 7.5 MW
in Hodeidah and 5.0 MW in Taiz of installed capacity. The new capacity is
expected to start operation in Sana'a in mid-1978 and in December 1978 in
Hodeida and Taiz, and should improve greatly the supply situation as well as
provide reserve capacity to enable YGEC to perform the urgently needed main-
tenance on the existing units.



- 4 -
1.12      Under an ongoing project financed by an Arab Fund loan made in 1974,
the distribution networks in the three cities are being reinforced with 56
substations of 500 kVA each and 1l-kV underground cable and overhead line
materials. Most of the equipment has already been delivered and the work
is expected to be completed during 1978.
1.13      However, this ongoing distribution project does not include the low-
voltage networks which were for the most part built using very small poles and
small conductors which are now unsuitable to carry even the present load.
1.14      The primary distribution voltage in Sana'a and Taiz is 15 kV and
10 kV in Hodeida. Conductor sizes vary and are as small as 16 mm2, thus
limiting the load carrying capacity and system expansion. Many of the sub-
stations, in particular those in Taiz, are in a dangerous state and in need
of rehabilitation.
1.15      The low-voltage networks in all three cities are already saturated
and require either reinforcement or replacement. Even in the areas where the
network is in relatively good condition, because of the small conductor size
used (mostly 35 mm2) reinforcement is needed to carry more load and improve
the quality of service. On a nominal 220 volt phase to neutral supply, peak
load voltages are reported to drop as low as 90 volts. Excessive and illegal
service connections beyond the system capacity have resulted in a situation
of very weak and low voltage mains by which conductors of 16 mm2 and 25 mm2
extend over distances well in excess of 1,000 m. System losses are high,
reaching as much as 25% of the energy generated in the case of Taiz. These
losses are due mostly to the rundown state of the network.
Development Program
1.16      YGEC's consultants predict a large increase in its energy sales
between the years 1977 and 1983; non-industrial consumption (residential, com-
mercial, government departments, embassies, street lighting) is forecast to
increase from 45 GWh to 179 GWh and industrial consumption (including water
and sewage pumping loads) from 9 GWh to 306 GWh. Although this rate of
growth may seem optimistic, past growth and present load suppression suggest
that failure to achieve these forecasts would be due to YAR's inability to
implement the planned projects on schedule rather than to any shortfall in
demand. Presently there are over 12,000 residential consumers on the waiting
list, representing about 30% of the total number already connected. In
addition to the proposed Project, YGEC envisages implementing the following
projects between 1978 and 1983 in order to meet its forecast needs. This will
require an investment of about YRls 1,025 million (US$228 million) including
escalation.
Generation
(a) A 3 x 20 MW steam power station to be built near Hodeida
on the Red Sea and financed partly by the Arab Fund and



- 5 -
partly by the Saudi Fund under a 1977 loan agreement, to be
completed in 1982-83;
(b) 50 MW of additional generating capacity in the three cities,
Sana'a, Hodeida and Taiz, to satisfy the demand before the
start-up of the steam station; and
(c) 25 MW of diesel and combustion turbine sets to satisfy the
demand in the existing rural load centers.
Transmission
(a) The construction of about 200 km of 132-kV double-circuit
transmission line and 160 MVA of associated substations to
connect Sana'a and Hodeida to the planned 3 x 20 steam station
mentioned above.
(b) Interconnecting the towns of Amran and Bajil with 33-kV
lines and associated substations to the new main grid.
This transmission project is being financed by the Arab Fund and the
Saudi Fund under the same agreement by which the 3 x 20 MW steam
station is being financed.
Distribution
The proposed Project, covering 1979-81 distribution needs,
which is expected to be followed by further distribution
expansion through 1983.
Rural Electrification
There is no overall plan at present, individual villages
being electrified on an ad hoc basis by local diesel
generation. However, extension of the 33-kV system to
feed the villages and rural areas surrounding the main
load centers such as Sana'a and Taiz would be a logical
development. The proposed Project includes provision
for a study, financed by IDA, to formulate a national
rural electrification program based on economic priorities
and uniform criteria. YGEC has agreed to carry out such
a study by consultants in accordance with terms of refer-
ence agreed with IDA.
This program will place heavy demands on YGEC particularly in view of the
relative lack of staff experienced in steam generation and transmission
projects. YGEC will be dependent therefore on consultants for the execution
of the program.



-6-
Role of IDA
1.17      The proposed IDA credit, which would be the first Bank Group involve-
ment in a power project in YAR, would enable the Association to influence the
institutional development of the power subsector from an early stage of YGEC's
existence in accordance with sound electric utility procedures and thereby
assist YGEC to develop into a strong and effective public service organiza-
tion. IDA participation in the Project would also have a catalytic effect in
attracting cofinancing from other aid sources.
C. The Beneficiary
Organization and Management
1.18      YGEC is responsible for the generation, transmission and distribu-
tion of electric power throughout the Yemen Arab Republic. It is a finan-
cially and administratively autonomous body of a commercial character. As
shown in the organization chart (Figure 1.1), YGEC has a full-time chairman,
deputy chairman and a board of management of not more than nine members ap-
pointed by the Government, two of whom represent Yemen industries and ordinary
consumers. YGEC reports to the Minister of Economy through its chairman.
1.19      The chairman of YGEC is responsible for policy matters and for
liaison with Government authorities. The deputy chairman is responsible for
liaison between the board of directors and the general manager, and acts for
the chairman and the general manager in their absence. The general manager
is responsible for planning and directing the activities of the corporation
in accordance with decisions of the board of directors. However, there are
indications that the chairman has become too involved in day-to-day opera-
tions. The duties and responsibilities of the chairman and the general
manager have been discussed -- the chairman has agreed that a list setting
out the respective responsibilities of the chairman and general manager will
be prepared and forwarded to IDA by July 1, 1978.
1.20      The general manager is supported at the head office by a small cor-
porate staff comprising a commercial/planning manager, a chief engineer, a
financial controller, an administrative manager and a controller of stores;
the corporate staff managers exercise functional control (but not line
management control) over all activities in the three regions of Sana'a,
Hodeidah and Taiz.
1.21      The regional managers are responsible to the general manager for
managing regional activities in accordance with the corporation's objectives.
The regional managers and the corporate staff managers meet monthly as an
executive committee under the chairmanship of the general manager. Each
regional organization includes an accounts office, administrative office,
technical department and stores and purchasing department. Details of the
regional organization are shown in Figure 1.2.



-7-
Manpower
1.22      In December 1977, YGEC had 888 employees, of whom 48 were in the
head office and 840 in the regional organizations. Table 1.3 shows details
of YGEC's staffing situation. The total number of approved positions is 940,
giving the high ratio of about one employee per 50 customers. However, as
suggested in a study of YGEC's organization by the consultants Peat, Marwick,
Mitchell and Co. (PMM), the number of employees may be justified because of
the large clerical force required for manual billing and the delivery and
collection of bills. The 52 existing vacancies include several key positions
such as commercial/planning manager and chief financial controller in the head
office. YGEC employs 25 expatriates, most of whom are from Arab-speaking
countries and appear to be well qualified. The senior engineering staff,
who have been provided by the UK Government on fixed appointment terms, are
competent and experienced. There are only a few Yemeni engineers in the
corporation. They have been educated abroad but have no experience in power
sector planning and operation. YGEC will remain heavily dependent on expa-
triates in its senior management ranks over the next few years, particularly
in view of the big expansion program which is planned. The status of appoint-
ment for the chief financial controller and other vacant positions has been
reviewed with YGEC. YGEC is seeking assistance from British Electricity
International Limited (BEI) in obtaining the services of a qualified candidate
for the position of chief financial controller and will make every effort to
fill this position by July 1, 1978. Similar assistance is being sought and
efforts are being made to fill the other vacant positions.
Training
1.23      The Corporation faces a serious manpower situation arising from the
nation-wide shortage of trained personnel caused by migration to the neighbor-
ing oil-rich states. Only 20 Yemeni nationals occupy positions of any re-
sponsibility, and these are limited mostly to foreman/supervisory grades. The
low standard of maintenance is epitomized by frequent plant breakdowns and
the dangerous state of much of the low-voltage distribution system.
1.24      In an effort to improve this situation, basic training courses
have been started in temporary quarters adjacent to the main generating
station in Sana'a. An expatriate Training Officer has been appointed and he
has two expatriate instructors to assist him. However, an important long-
term improvement in the job effectiveness of the national staff can be expected
arising from an agreement, recently signed by the Government and Electricite
de France, to establish a permanent training center on the outskirts of
Sana'a. The center will provide courses for maintenance and operations per-
sonnel working in generating stations and on the transmission and distribution
system, and should, when fully operational in 1980, adequately cater for the
present and future needs of YGEC at the skilled worker and technician levels.
This project will be financed jointly by the Government and French bilateral
aid.
1.25      There remains, however, the need to increase the number of Yemeni
professionals in the Corporation, and, because of the inadequacy of the



- 8 -
higher education system, this implies the education and training overseas of
selected nationals in engineering, management, accountancy and related areas.
In addition, the reorganization of the commercial side of YGEC, as recommended
in consultant studies made in 1976 and 1977, will necessitate the retraining
on the job of personnel working in the financial, stores and procurement fields.
1.26      The proposed Project includes a sum of US$700,000 towards the for-
eign costs of such training, and to allow expatriate consultants to conduct
training programs and seminars in YAR. The question of YGEC's training
program for engineering, management and accountancy, to be financed by the IDA
credit, and the procedures for the selection of candidates to participate in
the training program have been discussed, and YGEC will endeavor to submit a
proposed training program and implementation schedule to IDA by January 1,
1979.
Planning
1.27      System planning is at present inadequate.  Recently, an expatriate,
who was previously distribution engineer in Taiz, was assigned as the head of
a statistics section, but his activities so far have been largely limited to
collecting operating data from the different regions without further analysis
or interpretation. There seems to be no one effectively in charge of study-
ing load growth and system development and preparing data for feasibility
studies. As it stands now, almost all the initiative is left to consultants.
The current Five-Year Plan is too general to point to specific areas with
specific needs. The need for an effective system planning department to
monitor load growth and prepare system development plans has been discussed
with YGEC, which has agreed to keep IDA informed of the progress in the devel-
opment of this department.
Tariffs
1.28      Electricity tariffs were unified in Jauary 1975 for all consumers
of electricity in Sana'a, Hodeida and Taiz at YRI 0.6 (USJ 13) per kWh in
accordance with the first loan agreement between the YAR Government and the
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (Arab Fund). This agreement
further provided for financing an electricity tariff study for YGEC to formu-
late tariffs based on marginal costing principles. YGEC is contracting BEI
to prepare the tariff study, work on which is expected to begin by July 1978,
with a draft report to be issued about December 1978. YGEC has agreed to
furnish the Association with the proposed terms of reference for the tariff
study for IDA's review. YGEC has also agreed to provide IDA with a copy of
the completed tariff study and to afford IDA reasonable opportunity to comment
on the recommendations. The Government and YGEC have agreed to implement by
July 1, 1979 the consultants' agreed recommendations for electricity tariffs
taking into account marginal costs of supply.

II. THE PROJECT
Objectives
2.01      The proposed Project is intended to rehabilitate, reinforce and
expand the existing urban distribution systems in the three cities of Sana'a,
Hodeida and Taiz. It would also provide assistance to YGEC for training,
engineering and consultant services and for studies to improve the corpo-
ration's organization and make it a more effective institution, including the
creation of a Distribution Department and a Planning Department.
Description
2.02      The Project consists of the following:
(a) approximately:
-    70 km of 33-kV overhead lines and underground cables
-    16 x 33 /11-kV substations totalling about 160 MVA
-    125 km of 11-kV overhead lines and underground cables
-   200 x 11/.4 kV substations totalling about 100 MVA
-   375 km of low voltage lines and cables
-    32,000 new consumer connections
-    8,000 rehabilitated connections
(b) service vehicles, communication equipment and electricity
meters;
(c) consulting services for Project engineering and construction;
(d) a rural electrification study; and
(e) a training program for engineering, management and accountancy.
Status of Engineering
2.03      Engineering services for parts (a), (b) and (c) of the Project as
described above have already been contracted to Kennedy & Donkin (K&D-UK)
as of July, 1977. The consultants prepared an initial report outlining the
proposed program of rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution systems
in the three cities. However, the terms of reference as they appear in the
contract are not clear and comprehensive enough to obviate the risk of short-
comings during Project implementation. Therefore, YGEC has agreed to expand
the terms of reference for K&D to carry out a definitive engineering study
which defines the basic system configuration and parameters in each town and
how they are related to the load forecast and the future system development.
This study to be agreed with IDA will be based on economic evaluation of
alternatives and will cover:



- 15 -
(a)  main feeder routing (33/kV, 11 kV) and configuration
(overhead versus underground);
(b)  standard 33/11-kV substation configuration and loading
criteria;
(c)  standard 11-15 kV/LV substation configuration and loading
criteria, including standard transformer size selection;
(d)  evaluation of design alternatives for voltages (15 kV
versus 11 kV) and proposed conductor sizing based on
economic selection criteria; and
(e)  identification of alternatives and selection of procedures
for rehabilitating/replacing service connections, including
meters.
YGEC has agreed that the study would be completed by August 31, 1978 and
that the results would be discussed with IDA before proceeding with detailed
specifications. Detailed engineering and construction supervision would be
the responsibility of field engineering staff using the definitive criteria
resulting from the study.
Cost Estimate
2.04      The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during con-
struction, is US$59.6 million equivalent, of which US$34.4 million would be
in foreign exchange, based on the exchange rate at the time of appraisal of
US$1 = YRls 4.5. Including consumers benefiting from the rehabilitation of
the existing systems, the Project would extend electricity service at an
average cost of US$700 per customer, which is reasonable. Table 2.1 shows
the estimated costs of the Project, which are summarized below.

2.05      Project cost estimates were developed by the consultant (K&D).  Esti-
mates for civil works are based on the cost of works of a similar nature that
have been completed recently or undertaken in YAR and in other Arabic Gulf
countries; estimates for equipment and materials are based on late 1977 inter-
national prices. Physical contingencies for civil works, equipment and
material have been estimated at about 10% on average to take into account
technical uncertainties which may be encountered during construction of
the Project. YGEC is exempt from customs duties. Price contingencies were
calculated in accordance with the following annual rates corresponding to
expected conditions in YAR.

The foreign exchange component of consultant services was estimated at US$2
million for engineering (220 man-months), US$0.4 million for the rural electri-
fication study (45 man-months) and US$1.2 million for technical assistance
in training (130 man-months).

Project Financing Plan
2.06      The Project cost excluding interest during construction is expected
to be financed as follows:

2.07      Internal sources from YGEC amount to approximately US$9 million, and
the proposed IDA credit would cover about 30% of the estimated foreign costs
of the Project; the remaining foreign costs are assumed to be covered by
bilateral financing and the remaining local costs associated with the Project
would be financed by Government equity contributions and loans from local
banks. The Government is exploring with several bilateral and multilateral
sources the possibility of providing the balance of US$24 million to cover
the financing gap. The signing of agreements with cofinanciers to cover the
financing gap is a condition of effectiveness of the credit. Government and
YGEC have agreed to guarantee coverage of any cost overruns that may arise in
carrying out the Project.
2.08      The Government and YGEC have agreed that the proposed IDA credit
would be passed on by a subsidiary loan agreement to YGEC at an interest rate
of 7.5%, with repayment over 20 years including a grace period of 5 years,
the foreign exchange risk being borne by YGEC. The signing by the Government
and YGEC of the subsidiary agreement is a condition of credit effectiveness.
Implementation
2.09      YGEC is responsible for implementing the Project and expects to
use consultant services (Kennedy & Donkin) to handle the engineering. The
Project will be executed by multiple contracts for equipment. Erection,
construction management and technical direction and supervision of erection
would be performed by YGEC's staff with the assistance of consultants
(para 2.10).



- 18 -
2.10      YGEC already has some staff, mainly expatriates, experienced in
distribution works, who are currently implementing the first Arab Fund/Saudi
Fund loan, a component of which is the reinforcement of the distribution
systems in Sana'a, Hodeida and Taiz. They were assisted in the engineering
and procurement by the consultants Engineering and Power Development Corpora-
tion (UK); the field erection was contracted to a Danish company. All
supply has been procured and delivered to site and erection has started. It
is expected that the construction experience obtained under the Arab Fund
project will provide a useful base for implementation of the proposed IDA
project. YGEC does not at present have a specific group to monitor and
control distribution development. A Distribution Department has been estab-
lished under an expatriate engineer to be responsible for the technical
planning and execution of electric distribution projects and distribution-
related activities. YGEC is holding discussions with the Electricity Supply
Board of Ireland to obtain qualified engineers by July 1978 to staff the
department. YGEC has agreed to inform IDA of progress in this matter. Given
these arrangements, no special difficulties are foreseen in implementing
the Project.
2.11      The Project will be implemented during the three year period 1979-
1981 with the rehabilitation (designated as Phase A) and the reinforcement
(designated as Phase B), taking two years each, with one year overlap between
the two phases.
Procurement
2.12      The proposed credit would finance a portion of the proposed distri-
bution equipment, service vehicles, communication equipment, meters, engineer-
ing, rural electrification study and training. Purchases under the credit
would be made by multiple contracts in accordance with the Bank Group Guide-
lines on Procurement and based on international competitive bidding with
international shopping permitted only in areas where standardization or use
of special equipment is required and for which IDA agrees that international
shopping would be more economic and efficient than international competi-
tive bidding. Total contracts awarded under international shopping would be
limited to $750,000. The civil works involved in the Project would not be of
such scope as to attract foreign competition, and will be contracted to local
entrepreneurs and financed by YGEC.
Disbursements
2.13     Disbursements from the proposed IDA Credit would be made for 100%
of the foreign expenditures for:
(a) imported distribution equipment and materials including
construction equipment, the exact nature of which is
expected to be agreed between YGEC and IDA before credit
effectiveness;
(b) installation of equipment and materials;



- 19 -
(c) consultants and technical studies; and
(d) training.
The expected disbursement schedule is shown in Table 2.3. The closing date
would be January 1, 1983. No advance contracting or retroactive financing is
assumed.
Environmental Aspects
2.14     The Project has no adverse pollution effects on the environment.
Possible adverse aesthetic effects are also kept to a minimum by the invisi-
bility of the facilities in the case of an underground system and by a suitable
routing of overhead lines. The social environment will be enhanced by the
possibility of bringing street lighting to residential areas which have not
yet been serviced.

III. FINANCE
Introduction
3.01     YGEC was created in 1975 by Law No. 12 to develop and maintain an
efficient and economical system of electricity supply for Yemen Arab Republic.
Specifically, the corporation has the responsibility to generate, transmit,
and distribute electricity and sell it at reasonable prices. As of June 30,
1977 YGEC operated the electric utilities for the regions of Sana'a, Hodeida,
Taiz and a small water utility (700 customers) in the village of Hajja. Con-
solidated financial statements are prepared in the main office of YGEC in
Sana'a with the records and billing operations maintained in the regional
offices of Sana'a, Hodeida, and Taiz. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell, and Co.
(PMM), financed by the first loan from the Arab Fund, determined the asset
values of YGEC as of 1975 and established the accounting system used by
YGEC. The accounting records are generally in accordance with the account-
ing practices of electric utilities; however, a work order system has not
been installed but is being planned by the Chief Accountant and the Chief
Engineer. The work order system is expected to be implemented by July 1,
1978, corresponding to YGEC's fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending
June 30.
Billing and Collections
3.02     Billings are prepared monthly by YGEC and are computed manually.
The bills are delivered by the meter readers and are due upon presentation
and must be paid within 15 days of presentation. A computer is located in
the National Institute of Public Administration and time is available for
YGEC's use; YGEC is investigating the possibility of using this computer,
anticipating the conversion from manual billing to computerized billing by
July 1979 when YGEC is expected to have about 50,000 customers. The computer
center is headed by an expert provided by UNDP with several years of utility
billing experience and the process of conversion from a manual system to the
computer are expected to be handled under his guidance. The conversion will
require special training of YGEC's billing clerks to use the computerized
billing. The accounts receivable of YGEC averaged about 90 days' billing at
the end of fiscal 1976; collection methods were improved and the accounts
receivable declined to an average of 54 days' billings at the end of fiscal
1977. YGEC has agreed to maintain its receivables at an average not greater
than 60 days' billings.
Past Performance and Present Financial Position
3.03     Financial statements of YGEC for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1976
and 1977 are presented in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. YGEC's financial performance
for its first year of operation ending June 30, 1976 was quite satisfactory;
net operating income was about YRls 3 million earning about 12% rate of



- 24 -
return on average net fixed assets. However, the financial performance deter-
iorated to a loss in 1977 due to a 50% increase in operating expenses that
resulted from increases in salaries of employees to maintain a competi-
tive position with salaries paid to YAR nationals working outside of YAR.
The financial position is expected to worsen by the year ending June 30, 1978
as a further increase of 33% in salaries was granted to employees in late 1977
and a costly maintenance program to rebuild much of the present generating
equipment will be reflected in the operating expenses for the fiscal year.
3.04      YGEC's financial position as of June 30, 1977 was as follows:
YRls Millions
Total Fixed Assets                                108.7
Net Current Assets                                 12.8
Total Assets                                    121.5
Equity                                             49.0
Long Term Debt                                     62.4
Other Liabilities                                  10.1
Total Capitalization                            121.5
The overall financial position was acceptable; the debt/equity ratio was 56/44
and the current ratio 2.0.
3.05      YGEC's expansion in fiscal years 1976 and 1977 was financed by loans
from the Saudi and Arab Funds. Work in progress increased substantially in
1977 to YRls 57 million from YRls 9 million in 1976 representing the construc-
tion of diesel generating facilities expected to be completed and operational
in fiscal years 1979 and 1980.
YGEC's Financing Plan and Funds Statement
3.06     YGEC's sources and applications of funds statements for fiscal years
1978-1983 are shown in Table 3.3. The construction program and financing plan
are summarized as follows:

3.07     The Plan estimates the total construction costs, including interest
charged to construction, at approximately US$227.8 million.  The construction
costs include the present diesel generation construction program, estimated
cost US$19 million (of which US$7.5 million remains for construction in fiscal
year 1978), the rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution system (Proj-
ect FY79-81) estimated to cost US$59.6 million, the steam generation plant and
transmission lines estimated to cost US$56.4 million, an interim generating
construction program estimated to cost US$38.6 million, and the further expan-
sion of distribution facilities for 1982 and 1983 estimated to cost US$54.2
millions. During the same period working capital will be increased by the
equivalent of US$30.1 million.



- 26 -
3.08     The financing plan is only tentative.  Existing loans for the pre-
sent diesel generation construction program and the steam generation plant
and the associated transmission facilities amount to US$62.8 million (25%
of the total cost of the program). Net internal resources of YGEC are
expected to finance 24% of the total cost of the program. The proposed IDA
credit would be about 4% of the total cost. The tentative plan proposes
future borrowings of about US$58 million (22% of the total cost); the Govern-
ment is expected to arrange bilateral financing with interest charges of 4
to 5% for periods of 15 to 20 years and local banks have expressed an interest
in financing about US$10 million at interest rates of 7 to 9% for periods
of 5 to 7 years. Government contributions of about US$66 million are required
to finance the balance of the construction program. The Government and YGEC
have agreed that the Government's constributions towards the proposed project
be given in the form of equity contributions. Para 3.12 discusses problems
associated with the financing plan and the incurrence of debt.
Financial Forecasts
3.09     YGEC's financial forecasts for the fiscal years 1978-1983 are included
in Tables 3.1 to 3.3, the assumptions used for the forecasts are shown in
Attachment 3.1. Because YGEC is a very small electric utility at the present
time the forecasts show a rapid expansion as the generating facilities are
added to the system. Total electricity generation is forecast to increase
from 62 GWh in 1977 to 525 GWh in 1983, the total number of customers from
some 40,000 in 1977 to about 140,000 in 1983, and the assets value from US$24
million in 1977 to an estimated US$257 million in 1983.
3.10      YGEC's assets in service as of 1975 may have been over-valued for
rate-making purposes in view of the poor condition of the existing generating
and distribution facilities. New generating units are expected to be in
operation in 1978 and 1979. Revaluation will be required to reflect the
influence of inflation on the value of YGEC's assets. The principles of
valuation and revaluation have been discussed with YGEC along with the pro-
posed methods for valuing and revaluing YGEC's assets. YGEC has agreed to
discuss the methods with its auditors and to submit their recommendations
to IDA by July 1, 1978. YGEC has agreed to review its book asset values as
of June 30, 1979, and, in consultation with IDA, to establish the base assets
to be revalued in accordance with the agreed method.
3.11     With the additional generating capacity being installed and the
selling price per kWh of YR1 0.60 (about USWl3) (para 1.28) the rate of
return on average net fixed assets in service for fiscal year 1979 is esti-
mated at 5%. Assuming that the tariff is maintained at YRI 0.60/kWh until
fiscal year 1981 (the last year of the Project construction period) the rate
of return should increase to approximately 9% for fiscal years 1980 and 1981;
these rates assume a revaluation of assets at 10% per annum commencing in
1980. To meet the internal cash generation required in the proposed finan-
cing plan, it is estimated that YGEC would need to earn an average rate of
return on revalued assets of 8% through fiscal year 1983 which would require
YGEC to increase present tariffs about 13% to YR1 0.68 in fiscal year 1982 and
about 10% to YR1 0.75 in fiscal year 1983. Agreements with the Arab Fund



- 27 -
require YGEC to maintain an 8% rate of return on historically valued average
net fixed assets. The Government and YGEC have agreed that YGEC should earn a
minimum 8% rate of return on revalued assets beginning fiscal year 1980. Any
shortfalls in a year would be required to be made up within the next two
years; an overrun would be applied to offset any shortfall in one or more of
the next three years. YGEC has agreed to submit by the end of each fiscal
year a review of earnings for the fiscal year ended, and measures proposed to
secure the required annual rate of return for the next fiscal year.
3.12     The financing plan assumed for the construction program for fiscal
years 1978 through 1983 (para 3.06) assumes a very high level of borrowing.
YGEC's debt to equity ratio for 1978-1981 would average about 65/35 which is
somewhat higher than the desired level and is above the present requirement of
the Arab Fund loan that the debt to equity ratio should not exceed 50/50. How-
ever, the ratio improves by 1982, approaching the desired level of 50/50. To
meet the terms of the existing loan agreements of the Arab Fund for the debt
to equity ratio will require either that YGEC reduce its construction program
during 1978 through 1983, consequently requiring less financing (but also
reducing YGEC's ability to meet consumers' needs and demands), or that the
Government will have to increase its equity contributions to YGEC to relieve
the company's long-term borrowing requirements. If the proposed financing
plan requiring more than the 50/50 debt to equity ratio is to be followed
YGEC would be required to obtain an agreement with the Arab Fund and the
Saudi Fund to permit the higher debt to equity ratio. YGEC's debt service
coverage for 1978-1983 is forecast to average about 1.75 based on assumed
tariffs. The favorable debt service coverage results from low interest
loans from the Saudi Fund (2 percent), the Arab Fund (4 percent) and assumed
bilateral credits (4 to 5 percent). Because of the favorable debt service
coverage, YGEC would have little difficulty in servicing the additional
debt arising from on-lending of the proposed credit (para 2.08). The agree-
ments in existing loans with the Arab Fund requires that the debt service
coverage be not less than 1.5. Further, YGEC has agreed under this credit
not to incur any debt without the agreement of the Association unless its
debt service coverage is at least 1.5 starting fiscal year 1979 and thereafter.
3.13      To maintain an appropriate level of financial viability YGEC has
agreed that during the Project construction period it will not undertake any
capital expenditure in addition to that included in the present program in any
one year in excess of US$500,000 without presenting satisfactory evidence to
IDA that the investment would not adversely affect its financial position.
Audit
3.14     The accounts of YGEC are consolidated and maintained in the main
office in Sana'a and are generally in accordance with accounting practices of
public utilities.  Internal auditing is a function under the Chief Accountant
and is performed on a regular schedule. The accounts are audited by qualified
external auditors (Abdul Latif and Eltayib, associated with Peat, Marwick,
Mitchell and Co.) acceptable to IDA. YGEC has agreed to continue to appoint
independent auditors acceptable to IDA and to furnish its audited financial
statements in English to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal
year.

Insurance
3.15     YGEC's assets are insured for casualty losses from fire, explosion,
windstorm, and other hazards by Marib Insurance Company, which re-insures with
Lloyds of London. The insurance coverage required by agreement with the Arab
Fund for YGEC's steam generating assets would provide for annual inspection by
qualified inspectors of boiler plant equipment to comply with sound public
utility practice.
Performance Indicators
3.16     The investment program is expected to make electricity more accessible
to Yemen's urban population and to be instrumental in improving the quality of
electric service through reductions in system losses and outages. The insti-
tutional and financial reforms are expected to strengthen YGEC's management and
financial development. The "Project Performance and Monitoring Indicators"
shown in Table 3.4 would be used to monitor YGEC's performance in meeting the
goals of greater accessibility of electric service, the reduction of outages
and management development.

Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
All financial forecasts are expressed in the fiscal years of YGEC
beginning July 1 and ending June 30.
Income Statements
1.   Electricity Sales:         See Table 1.1.  The annual forecasts in the
table are adjusted for fiscal year forecasts.
2.   Electricity Revenues:    Assume tariffs to average 60 fils per kWh for
1978 through 1981 and an increase to 68 fils
in 1982 and 75 fils in 1983. YGEC, in a
temporary measure to reduce losses for FY78,
started billing at 65 fils per kWh in February
1978; the average fils/kWh may amount to 62
and result in losses of YRls 3 million rather
than the forecast of YRls 5 million.
3.   Other Revenues:            Estimates as supplied by YGEC's forecasts.
4.   Personnel Costs:           Staffing is estimated to increase from the
present 888 employees to about 2000 employees
in 1983. Average annual salary increases are
estimated at about 30% through 1983.
5.   Fuel Costs:                Diesel fuel costs were derived from the 1977
price of US$134/ton (YR1 0.1417/kWh) and
escalated 10% annually for 1979-1983. Steam
fuel costs are estimated on 1977-1978 fuel
costs of US$82/ton (YRI 0.112/kWh) and
escalated 10% annually for 1981 - 1983 as the
steam units are installed.
6.   Lubricating Oils:          Expressed in YRl/kWh were estimated at an
average of 0.0177 for 1978, and escalated 10%
annually.

Balance Sheet
9.   Gross Fixed Assets:        Carried at "Book Value" through 1979, revalued
at 10% annually from 1980 through 1983.
10.  Accounts Receivable:       Estimated to average about 60 days' billings.
11.  Inventories:               Average of two months fuel requirements.
12.  Accounts Payable:          Average of 10% of annual fuel costs, plus
one month's salaries, plus 3% of gross fixed
assets.
Assumptions for the water utility were based on the policy that the
water utility would operate on a break-even policy--revenues would equal
operating costs.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Market Growth
Past Trends
4.01       The Project facilities are required for the distribution of elec-
tricity to urban consumers in the three major cities of Sana'a, Hodeida and
Taiz. Data on the past trend of electricity demand in the three cities are
available only since 1971, as shown in Table 4.1 and summarized below:
1977     Growth Rate
1971      (Est.)        % p.a.

/a   1972 figure (1971 figure for Taiz not available).
/b   1972-1977 average.
Sana'a has maintained the steadiest upward trend, at least since 1972, during
which period the annual rate of increase ranged from 24% to 33%. The trend
has been much more erratic in the other two towns: in Hodeida, the growth
rate showed a markedly downward trend in 1971-76, declining from about 66%
in 1972 to 10% in 1976, before recovering to 28% in 1977; in Taiz also the
trend was downwards over most of the period, falling from about 20% in 1972
to 8.5% in 1976, although there was a sharp reversal in 1977 to over 20%.
4.02       The great majority of the consumers served are in the private cate-
gory, which accounted for 37,434 (92%) out of the 1977 total. Most of these
are residential consumers, the number of households served being 36,842, and
the rest commercial premises. Since the total number of households in 1977



- 37 -
was 59,853, this means that some 62% of the total population in the three
cities is supplied with electricity from the public system.
4.03      These figures of past trends need to be treated with some caution
and are not necessarily a reliable guide to the future. This is mainly due
to the fact that, particularly in the last few years, supply has not kept
pace with demand, because of limitations in the capacity of the distribution
networks and in generating plant, coupled with a lack of skilled manpower
in YGEC to carry out the necessary reinforcement. All three towns have long
waiting lists of applicants for electricity supply, the backlog in 1977 total-
ing over 12,000. Because of the inadequacy and unreliability of public elec-
tricity supplies, many industrial firms, and even private individuals, have
installed their own generating capacity. In 1976, for example, auto-generation
is estimated by YGEC's consultant to have accounted for some 38 GWh (84%) out
of total industrial electricity consumption of 45 GWh.
Load Forecast
4.04      Making use of the limited data available, the consultants prepared
a load forecast to 1985 for the three cities. The method adopted was to make
separate projections for each of the categories into which YCEC classifies
its consumers viz. private (residential and commercial), Government depart-
ments, embassies, street lighting and industrial, as described below.
(a) Households
4.05       Sales to households are a function of the number of households con-
nected to the YGEC system and the specific consumption of electricity per
household. The number of households depends on the size of the urban popula-
tion and the average number of persons per household. According to the 1975
population census, these figures for the three cities were as follows:
Persons               Number
Population         Per Household          of Household
Sana'a                    134,588                5.56                  24,206
Hodeida                    78,010                5.39                  14,473
Taiz                       78,577                6.01                  13,074
Estimates of the annual growth rate of national population range from 2.3%
to 3%. However, in the present context the significant factor is the rate
of growth of urban population, which is influenced by rural-urban migration
as well as natural growth. Factors influencing rural-urban migration are,
on the "pull" side, the urban-rural earnings differential and the prospects
of urban employment, and, on the "push" side, the pressure of growing popula-
tion on scarce agricultural land and bad harvests. Both sets of factors are
expected to be strongly favorable to rural-urban migration in the foreseeable
future, indicating high rates of urban population growth. The consultants
for a recent urban planning study suggested a range of 8-10% p.a. for Sana'a,



- 38 -
the lower end of which was adopted for the purpose of the load forecasz.
and figures of 7% and 8% respectively for Hodeida and Taiz, which seem real-
istic in relation to the industrial development prospects for these cities.
4.06      By extrapolating the 1975 population figures using these growth
rates and applying the 1975 ratios of persons per household, it was possible
to project the growth in the number of households from the 1975 figure of
52,000 to about 109,000 in 1985. With the projected expansion of the power
system, it was estimated that virtually all these households would be con-
nected to the public supply by 1985, implying a connection rate of about
7,000 consumers in 1978, rising to a peak of 11,000 in 1982. The correspond-
ing annual electricity requirements were calculated by multiplying the number
of households connected by the specific consumption per household. In 1977
the latter figure was about 746 kWh in Sana'a, 1,134 kWh in Hodeida and
580 kWh in Taiz, but these figures will increase with rising private con-
sumption expenditure, projected to grow at about 3.2% p.a. under the current
five-year plan. Estimates of the elasticity of domestic electricity consump-
tion in developing countries with respect to private consumption expenditure
are mostly in the range 1.5-2, but in some cases the figure exceeds 4.5.
Since consumption is likely to grow rapidly in the early stages of urban
electrification as consumers acquire basic electrical appliances, an elastic-
ity somewhat higher than 2 was assumed in the present case, resulting in a
growth rate of specific consumption of 7% per annum.
(b) Industry
4.07      Because of the inadequacies of the public supply, most industries
at present generate their own electricity (para 4.03). Data on industrial use
of electricity are scarce, but the consultants estimated that in 1976 total
industrial consumption in the three cities was about 45 GWh, of which 57% was
in Hodeida and 21.5% each in Sana'a and Taiz. Of the total, YGEC supplied
only 7 GWh (16%), the rest being generated by industry's own generating equip-
ment. Forecasting industrial demand is difficult because of the lack of sta-
tistics on sales to industrial consumers prior to the creation of YGEC in 1975.
Such data as do exist are unreliable as a guide to the future, since supplies
to industrial consumers have been restricted for lack of generating capacity.
The approach adopted therefore was based on the relationship observed in other
developing countries between GDP growth and industrial electricity demand,
which indicated an elasticity of around 2.5.  Since, according to the current
five-year plan, GDP is projected to grow at about 8% p.a., this implies a
growth rate of industrial electricity consumption of about 20% p.a. It was
also assumed that, with the reinforcement and expansion of YGEC's system,
and its increasing reliability, a growing share of industry's requirements
would be supplied by YGEC, rising from 17% in 1977 to 44% in 1985. The com-
bination of a relatively high growth rate of total industrial requirements
and the expected increasing recourse by industry to YGEC as the source of
supply, together with the low starting base, account for the high projected
annual growth rates of YGEC's industrial sales shown in Table 4.1, ranging
from 39% in Sana'a to 58% in Hodeida. The resulting increase in industrial
demand over the period 1977-85 is about 9 MW in Sana'a, 26 MW in Hodeida
and 8 MW in Taiz, making a total of 43 MW. Details of individual new loads,



- 39 -
so far as they are known (see Table 4.2), suggest that the total figure is not
unreasonable, although the distribution of the total amongst the three cities
may be subject to more uncertainty.
(c) Water and Sewage Pumping Load
4.08      A major expected new load is water and sewage pumping in the three
cities. Estimated power requirements in Sana'a for these purposes were pro-
vided by the consultants for the Sana'a project, and corresponding estimates
were made by YGEC's consultants for the Hodeida and Taiz schemes by adjust-
ing the Sana'a loads in proportion to the populations of these two towns.
The total pumping load was projected to rise from about 7 MW in 1979 to 15 MW
in 1985.
(d) Other Consumers
4.09      The other consumer categories on which separate YGEC data are avail-
able are Government, embassies and street lighting. Sales to Government
departments have been growing at about 20% p.a. in recent years, and this
trend is expected to continue. For embassies a growth rate of 8% p.a. was
assumed, made up of 3% p.a. growth in the number of consumers and 5% annual
increase in specific consumption. Street lighting was projected to grow at
the same rate as the population in each city.
(e) Summary
4.10      As shown in Table 4.1, the resulting projections imply that sales
in Hodeida will continue to grow at the historic rate of about 26% p.a. (para
4.01), but that there will be marked increases in the growth rates for Hodeida
and Taiz (40% and 37% respectively compared with the past rates of 28% and
16%). The average annual rate of increase for the three cities together is
33% for sales and 28% for maximum demand, compared with actual rates for 1971-
77 of 24% and 20% respectively. The projected growth of industrial require-
ments, and the increasing share of YGEC in meeting these requirements, are
the main factors in the increases, as indicated in the greatly increased pro-
portion of industrial consumption in YGEC's total sales (17% in 1977, 44% in
1985). The low starting base of electricity demand in YAR also needs to be
borne in mind, as does the existence of a large suppressed demand at present
because of capacity limitations. For the country as a whole, consumption of
electricity per capita in 1977 was only 18 kWh, one of the lowest in the world,
and the forecast implies that it would rise to 111 kWh by 1985, which would
still be relatively low, since it is about the current level in PDRY and well
below the current level of about 230 kWh in Jordan and 250 kWh in Syria.
Nevertheless, in view of the incomplete data on which it is based, the various
approximations and assumptions which had to be made, and possible limitations
on YGEC's implementation capability in the early years, the forecast is sub-
ject to a fair measure of uncertainty. YGEC has agreed to make arrangements
satisfactory to IDA to monitor carefully the trend of demand and to review the
situation with IDA in 1979, so that expansion programs can be modified if
necessary in the light of actual development.

B. Least Cost Solution
4.11      The Project facilities have been planned in accordance with standard
designs.  Transformer and conductor sizes were selected by the consultants on
the basis of least initial cost. Where alternatives do exist, e.g. routing of
transmission lines, location and size of substations, extent of underground
cables versus overhead lines and the need for a 33-kV subtransmission system
in the three cities, the least-cost solution will be adopted as detailed
engineering proceeds (para 2.03), with due regard to safety and environmental
considerations.
C. Return on Investment
4.12      The rate of return on the Project is the discount rate which equates
the present values of the associated streams of costs and benefits of the
Project over its economic life. The costs are the attributable financial
costs of the Project, adjusted for taxes, internal transfers and for any
differences between the money costs of inputs and their costs to the economy.
The benefits comprise the revenues from incremental sales of electricity
attributable to the Project, plus any other incremental benefits which can
be quantified.
Costs
4.13      The attributable financial costs incurred in supplying the incre-
mental sales of electricity which constitute the main benefits of the Project
comprise the following items:
(a) the capital and operating cost (including distribution losses)
of the 1979-81 time slice of YGEC's distribution rehabilita-
tion and expansion program;
(b) the main transmission costs (capital and operating, including
losses) incurred in supplying the power needed to meet the
incremental sales distributed by the 1979-81 networks in
Sana'a, Hodeida and Taiz after the three load centers have
been interconnected (Sana'a and Hodeida commencing 1982,
Taiz commencing 1985);
(c) the corresponding costs (capital, operating plus fuel)
incurred in generating the incremental quantities of elec-
tricity needed to meet the incremental sales attributable
to the Project, after allowing for power stations' own con-
sumption, transmission losses and distribution losses.
4.14      The technical and economic assumptions used in deriving these
costs are set out in Attachment 4.1. The distribution costs comprise the



- 41 -
capital costs of the Project, including physical contingencies (but excluding
price contingencies, since the economic analysis is done at constant prices),
as set out in para 2.04, 1/ together with the associated operation and main-
tenance costs. The rehabilitated and expanded urban distribution networks in
the three cities resulting from the Project can be regarded as purchasing bulk
power from YGEC's generation and (after interconnection of the three cities)
transmission system at the marginal costs of supply. On the assumptions set
out in Attachment 4.1, these costs were estimated to be as follows:
(a) Generating Costs. The marginal capacity costs, including
annual operation and maintenance (estimated at 4% of capital
cost/kW installed for diesel stations, and 3% for steam
stations), are YRls 910 (US$202) per kW of peak demand per
year for diesel supply and YRls 722 (US$160)/kW/year for
steam station supply (3 x 20 MW).
(b) Fuel Costs. The fuel costs assumed are US$115/ton for
residual fuel oil delivered to Hodeida, US$180/ton for
gas oil at Hodeida and US$195/ton at Sana'a and Taiz,
based on the consultants' estimates of current interna-
tional prices. They differ from those used in the finan-
cial projections (Attachment 3.1), which are the actual
(Government-controlled) prices paid by YGEC. The cor-
responding fuel costs per kWh generated are YR1 0.1547
(USi 3.438) for the steam station, and YRI 0.1816
(USi 4.036) and YRI 0.1969 (USi 4.376) for diesel sta-
tions at Hodeida and Sana'a/Taiz respectively.
(c) Transmission Costs. Marginal transmission costs, including
annual operation and maintenance costs (estimated at 2%
of capital costs), are estimated at YRls 137 (US$30) per
kW of peak demand per year at Sana'a, YRls 39 (US$9) per kW/
year at Hodeida and YRls 163 (US$36) per kW/year at Taiz.
Benefits
4.15      The measurable benefits comprise the revenues attributable to the
Project from:
(a) incremental sales of electricity;
(b) connection charges for new customers served by the Project; and
(c) interest on the deposits which new consumers are required to
make on being connected to the system.
1/   The cost of the rural electrification study has been excluded, since this
is unrelated to the physical components of the Project required to improve
and extend urban electricity service.



- 42 -
4.16      The incremental demands which the Project will make it possible for
YGEC to supply in each of the three cities by 1982, when the Project facilities
will be saturated, are shown in Table 4.3, and summarized below:
Demand             Sales
(MW)              (GWh)
Sana'a                   13.9               65.7
Hodeida                  16.1               74.4
Taiz                      7.4               35.2
Total /a                35.5               175.3
/a     Assuming a diversity factor of 0.95.
The corresponding sales revenues were calculated at the tariff rate of
YR1 0.6/kWh.
4.17      As shown in Annex 4.1, YGEC levies a connection charge for each
consumer connected, the amount of the charge varying from YRls 375 for a single-
phase domestic consumer to YRls 1,250 for a 3-phase connection to a non-domestic
consumer. However, it was assumed that these charges represented the actual
costs to YGEC of making the connections; this assumption is supported by the
fact that a private operator of a diesel station in Mabar, a small town near
Sana'a, which was visited by the mission, charges YRls 360 for connecting
domestic consumers to his system.
4.18      On connection, each consumer has to deposit with YGEC an additional
amount equal to the connection charge, which is reimbursable should the con-
sumer subsequently wish to have his supply discontinued. These deposits
constitute, in effect, interest-free loans to YGEC which are available for
investment, and are assumed to earn a rate of return equal to the opportunity
cost of capital, estimated at 10%.
4.19      The resulting rate of return on the Project is 15.8% (Table 4.4).
This represents a minimum value of the rate of return, since it is based on
the tariff rate in effect at appraisal of YR1 0.6/kWh, 1/ whereas there is
evidence that private consumers are willing to pay more for electricity.
Thus, the mission found that customers of a new small diesel station in the
town of Marawa near Hodeida were paying YRI 0.75/kWh, while in Mabar the owner
of the recently installed diesel station was charging YRls 2/kWh, which all
the households in the town were willing to pay. Prior to its takeover by
YGEC, the private power company operating in Ibb was charging YRI 1/kWh.
4.20      The sensitivity of the rate of return was tested for variations
in the main assumptions. With capital costs 15% higher, the return falls
to 11.2%. At 20% higher fuel costs it would be 12.1%. Assuming a two-year
1/   Since February 1978 YGEC has been provisionally billing at YR1 0.65/kWh.



- 43 -
lag in the build-up of sales to saturate the Project's distribution capacity
(e.g. because of delays in connecting new consumers), the rate of return falls
to 11.3%. If sales to non-industrial consumers are valued at YR1 0.75/kWh,
which would seem to be the minimum measure of these consumers' willingness to
pay, the rate of return rises to 21.9%.

14. Electricity Sales
Electricity sales were valued at the YGEC rate of YRI 0.6/kWh in
effect at the time of appraisal.
15. Connection Charges
The current YGEC connection charges were assumed (para 12 above).
16. Interest on Consumer Deposits
On taking supply, domestic consumers pay a deposit equal to the
connection charge of YRls 375, returnable if the consumer wishes to discontinue
taking supply. These deposits may be regarded as an interest-free source of
capital for YGEC and may be assumed to yield a return equal to the opportunity
cost of capital (10%).
