In each of\n            these areas, the GoP has begun to implement a detailed\n            series of important policy measures as part of an integrated\n            strategy to progressively reform fiscal administration,\n            public spending and the business climate in ways that will\n            lead to specific results that have a broad impact on growth\n            and will be difficult to reverse."}, "docdt": "2006-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
