1.  Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
Peru is strengthening and consolidating its democratic political system. Following the Fujimori regime and a brief 
transitional government, the administration of former President Toledo governed a country at peace and with 
economic growth during 2001-2006. Despite many political difficulties and a generally low public approval 
rating, Toledo faced no major threats to his democratic authority, and was able to not only complete his mandate 
in office but also to muster enough support in Congress to undertake several reforms and to maintain disciplined 
control over economic policy. By the end of Toledo’s term, it appeared that a majority of Peruvians had come to 
see the benefits of a stable, democratic political system.  
 
President Alan García won the second round of presidential elections in June 2006 by 53 percent against 47 
percent for Ollanta Humala, a former military officer.  The nationalist platform of Humala failed to convince a 
majority of voters, who preferred the more democratic style of García, despite the memories of his difficult first 
presidential term in the late 1980s. At the same time, the narrowness of García’s victory and the success of 
Humala in Peru’s poorer regions—especially the southern Andes—points to dissatisfaction of many Peruvians 
with the thus-far limited improvements for the poor after years of economic growth.  
 
President García faces a fragmented Congress, which will require building coalitions to pass legislation. His 
APRA party has 37 seats, compared to 44 for Humala’s Unión por el Peru (UPP) and 39 divided among five other 
parties. UPP has said it will strongly defend their candidate’s platform, meaning it will likely form the core of 
opposition to García’s agenda, requiring APRA to seek coalitions with the other parties. García’s first cabinet, led 
by Prime Minister Jorge del Castillo and Finance Minister Luis Carranza, is a mix of APRA members and well-
respected technocrats, with a record six women in ministerial posts.  The latest poll numbers show García’s public 
support between 60 and 70 percent. The first major test for the new government will be the November 19 
elections for 26 regional presidents and all 1,832 municipal governments.  
Social protests remain an issue in Peru, but they are generally isolated and limited to specific grievances, and have 
not had a major destabilizing impact on either the economy or the political system.  One flashpoint is the mining 
industry, which has been accused by community residents near some mines of polluting, leading to protests, 
particularly in remote areas with limited state presence.  Government policies supported by this operation to 
improve the flow of resources from mining royalties to local governments are intended to help with this problem. 
In the past four years, Peru has had one of the best-performing economies in Latin America, surpassed only by 
Venezuela – an oil exporting country – and Argentina – which is coming out of a deep recession.  Based on sound 
Page  2
macroeconomic policies and strong demand for Peruvian commodity exports, GDP grew 5 percent on average in 
the four years since 2002, and reaching a remarkable 6.4 percent in 2005.  This growth has been all the more 
impressive considering the external shock of Argentina’s economic crisis as well as the political instability that 
prevailed during the Toledo administration.

Growth has been led by an impressive upswing in exports, which rose 26 percent annually on average in 2002-
2005, and the external current account posted a surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2005.  This increase was driven 
in good measure by the boom in commodity prices, particularly for mineral exports, as well as the coming on line 
of new mining and hydrocarbon projects.  Although mining production account for over half of all Peruvian 
exports, non-traditional exports have grown rapidly, 20 percent on average annually since 2000, particularly in 
specialized agricultural products such as asparagus, grapes and avocados.  Other export sectors such as fisheries 
and textiles have also posted significant gains in recent years.  Private investment, encouraged by the growing 
economy and sound policies, has also helped fuel growth, rising nearly 14 percent in real terms during 2005.  
 
Fiscal and monetary policy has been well-managed during recent years, with steady declines in public sector 
deficits and low, stable inflation rates.  The combined public sector deficit has come down every year since 2001, 
falling from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2005, lowering public debt from 46 percent of 
GDP in 2001 to 38 percent of GDP in 2005 (of which 28 percent is foreign and 10 percent domestic).  These gains 
came from increases in revenue from mining taxes, which could revert if conditions change, as well as from cuts 
in needed public investment spending.  Tax collection remains under 14 percent of GDP, low by international 
standards and below the 18 percent of GDP collected in the mid-1990s.  This indicates that improvements in 
broadening the tax base and increasing collections remain needed.  Year-end inflation for 2005 was 1.5 percent, at 
the low end of the target range of 1.5-3.5 percent.  
 
While Peru’s macroeconomic performance has been very good in the past few years, poverty remain stubbornly 
high.  The national poverty rate dropped only two percentage points between 2002 and 2004, and half the 
population (51.6 percent) lives in conditions of poverty.  However, since 2003 per capita incomes of the poor and 
the rates of poverty and extreme poverty have started showing improvements, especially in rural areas, driven by 
broadening economic growth. Average incomes of the poorest tenth of the population rose 33 percent between 
2001 and 2004, while the incomes of the wealthiest tenth of the population remained level over the same period. 
Growth has had the most impact on extreme poverty rates, especially in rural areas. Extreme poverty declined 
from 24 percent to 19 percent between 2001 and 2004 nationally, but rural extreme poverty fell from 50 percent to 
40 percent over the period, while urban extreme poverty declined from 10 percent to 8 percent.  Although no 
poverty numbers are available after 2004, recent improvements in employment in certain areas of the country 
indicate that the growth of 2005 and this year are having further impacts on poverty.  Income inequality also 
remains relatively high, with the Gini coefficient improving slightly from 0.52 to 0.50 during the same period.   
 
2. Proposed objective(s) 
 
In the short term, the DPL will have the twin benefits of: 
·
Strengthening the GoP’s fiscal position with timely budget financing at reasonable terms; and  
·
Giving the World Bank a strong position to help the GoP push ahead with its public sector reform agenda. 
Page  3
In the medium and long term, reforms supported by the proposed loan series will greatly improve the efficiency 
and quality of public sector institutions and the provision of services in Peru.  This will in turn result in budgetary 
savings that can be directed toward priority poverty programs; more and higher quality public services for the 
citizenry; and more sustainable and broad-based economic growth. 
 
3. Preliminary description 
 
The propose
d
DPL is intended to be the first in a series of four loans supporting the GoP’s reform plan to improve 
the functioning of Peru’s public sector institutions and administration.  The loan focuses on three broad areas of 
policy reform: 
·
Fiscal Consolidation and Growth 
·
Increased Efficiency Quality of Public Spending 
·
Strengthened Governance Institutions and Human Resources 
In each of these areas, the GoP has committed to a detail series of important policy changes as part of an 
integrated strategy to progressively reform public administration in ways that will show results and be difficult to 
reverse. 
 
4. Environment Aspects 
The policies supported by this DPL operation, which focus on reforming economic and social policies 
and institutions on the macro level, are not expected to entail any impact on the environment.  The Bank 
recently completed a Country Environmental Assessment, highlighting shortcomings in Peru’s 
institutional framework for environmental protection and sustainability. It also pointed to the need to not 
only continue focusing on protection natural areas such as tropical forests, but also mitigating the serious 
health impacts and high costs of environmental degradation, particularly related to air and water 
contamination.  As a result of this study and the ensuing dialogue with government authorities, the Bank 
is preparing two DPLs as part of the new CPS for Peru.  Principal topics to be addressed in the loans will 
be reordering the institutional and legal oversight for the environment, both at the national level—
possibly through the creation of a new, single authority—and at regional and municipal levels.  
Decentralized environmental oversight of the mining sector will be a priority, as well as adjusting 
spending priorities to achieve concrete results in reducing air and water contamination.
