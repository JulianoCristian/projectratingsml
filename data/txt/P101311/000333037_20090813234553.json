Broad-Based Growth Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project for\n            Guatemala were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            Guatemala programmatic DPL series played an important role\n            in helping the authorities coordinate and execute their own\n            development strategy. The DPL triggers and prior actions\n            served as a useful public commitment that helped the\n            authorities and civil society keep track of progress on key\n            development objectives. It also helped the authorities\n            coordinate program delivery across numerous government\n            agencies and projects. Government officials noted that the\n            prior actions under the DPL helped them galvanize and\n            stimulate the reform process, especially by motivating\n            various agencies to complete their prescribed tasks within a\n            broader reform agenda. In addition, the DPL supported the\n            overall country assistance strategy and investment program\n            by enhancing the policy framework in key complementary\n            areas. The operation was well coordinated with the\n            government's efforts to rekindle the implementation of\n            the 1996 peace accords reform agenda, which had slowed under\n            the prior administration, as well as support broad social\n            and political consensus building under a difficult and\n            contentious political environment. The Guatemala experience\n            with the DPL series suggests that increasing the societal\n            demand for reform improved program design and moved the\n            policy agenda forward. Reforms that increase transparency\n            and trust are likely to find support among civil society, as\n            a lack of public information frequently leads to mistrust\n            and lack of political commitment. In Guatemala, civil\n            society, the private sector and the Congress were actors in\n            either the design or implementation of various reforms\n            included in the DPL package. Civil society provided a\n            powerful voice in the demand for transparency and similarly\n            played a role in improving the effectiveness of public\n            expenditure. The dialogue with the private sector also\n            proved effective in maintaining the focus on\n            competitiveness. Bank sponsored forums for dialogue on\n            public policy effectively engaged Congress on fiscal policy\n            options. Interviews with country stakeholders confirmed the\n            important role these forums played in building a consensus\n            on the introduction of new reforms. Efforts to show progress\n            on the transparency agenda illustrates the point. The teams\n            working on taxes, customs, and competitiveness involved the\n            private sector through dialogue in the design and\n            implementation of the agenda. This involvement improved the\n            design by identifying areas that needed improvement and\n            helped facilitate broad acceptance by both public and\n            private sector participants."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
