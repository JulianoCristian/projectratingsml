The program objectives are to\n            define a long-term development policy for technician\n            training in Brazil, to adapt the quality and quantity of\n            technician training to national and local needs, and to\n            provide needed specialized skills to the agricultural and\n            industrial sectors. The project supports national programs\n            to improve the coordination and implementation of curricular\n            reforms and education planning, and specific sub-projects\n            (about 70) for federal and state technician schools."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
