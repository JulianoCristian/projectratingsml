   Russian men and women face far shorter life expectancies than people in developed countries, as
   much as 16 years shorter than their neighbors in Europe. Since 2003, the IBRD has worked with the
   Russian authorities, local institutions, and international partners to help address the social problems
   and institutional constraints contributing to this poor health picture, yielding significant results particu-
   larly in fighting tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.
