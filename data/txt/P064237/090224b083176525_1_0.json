Poverty, poor nutrition, low levels of immunity,\n            and underfunding of health services contributed to Russia\n            having one of the highest rates of TB in the world. The\n            country also had a growing HIV and AIDS epidemic. The Russia\n            TB and AIDS control project provided assistance to improve\n            access to quality services, including development of\n            guidelines for prevention and treatment of patients. Since\n            2003, improved efforts by the Russian government at the\n            federal and regional levels supported by the World Bank\n            project, contributed to a trend of stabilization and\n            decreasing annual TB notifications. New guidelines for HIV\n            and AIDS prevention, diagnosis and treatment were developed.\n            The project implemented a comprehensive nationwide strategy\n            to strengthen health care organization and service delivery\n            for the diagnosis, care and treatment of TB, HIV and AIDS\n            among civilians."}, "docdt": "2010-09-15T08:54:03Z"}
