"This second phase of the Social Sector\n            Programmatic Development Policy Credit (SSPC) series\n            continues, through a Development Policy Credit (DPC)\n            operation, to support Bolivia's efforts in achieving\n            selected Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through the\n            implementation of a number of key social sector policies\n            designed during the first phase of this program. The SSPC II\n            will support social sector policies, with three broad goals\n            in mind: 1) protecting the positive results reached in the\n            last decade on increasing access to, and quality of health\n            and nutrition, education, water and sanitation, and social\n            protection; 2) implementing the sectoral policy frameworks\n            designed under the first phase of this programmatic series,\n            to continue the progress in social outcomes, and move closer\n            to achieving a number of specific MDGs by 2015; and, 3)\n            strengthening the capacity of both the Government, and civil\n            society to monitor, and evaluate policies, increasing\n            accountability and effectiveness. However, country risks\n            include, on the political side, the changing political\n            situation, and the potential social unrest, as reflected in\n            a steady number of protests; the uncertainty on the outcome\n            of the Hydrocarbons Law; the country's different views\n            on when, and if to call a Constitutional Assembly that would\n            discuss, among other things, regional autonomies; and, the\n            current crisis related to terminating the contract with the\n            company providing water and sanitation services in the\n            populous township of El Alto, adjacent to La Paz. In looking\n            at the economy, GDP growth remains vulnerable to external\n            shocks, notably rising commodity prices and interest rates,\n            while institutional weakness aggravate the situation. To\n            mitigate this, the Government made concerted efforts to\n            address the demands of protesters without resorting to the\n            use of force, and has developed and strengthened new\n            mechanisms for popular political participation. The Bank and\n            the international community have vigorously supported these efforts."}, "docdt": "2005-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
