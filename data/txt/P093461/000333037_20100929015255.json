development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: only with\n            involvement of both central and local authorities and their\n            commitment to sustainable development of tourism through\n            capital investments, these kinds of projects can be\n            satisfactorily implemented. Capital investments should have\n            as a result the benefit for the whole local population, but\n            in the same time should secure the protection of environment\n            and sustainable spatial development, which consequently\n            requires substantial institutional strengthening. For\n            implementation of all high-risk projects from environmental\n            point of view, the domestic institutional and legislative\n            framework has to be adopted. This also includes a wide\n            public information and public awareness campaign, so that\n            each citizen of the beneficiary country realizes all the\n            benefits and all the risks of the certain project. This\n            campaign has to be realized prior or at the beginning of\n            implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
