                         (KenGen) Initial Public Offer, establishment of the Geothermal Development Company (GDC), promulgation of regulatory instruments, feasibility studies for Liquefied Petroleum Gas
                         (LPG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure, and preliminary studies for wind power development. These institutional and policy achievements have been accompanied by
                         investments in new power generation and in electricity distribution that have improved the quality of electricity service to customers. The cumulative number of households connected
                         to electricity reached 526,000 by June 2012 against a target of 420,000. The third geothermal generating unit of 35 megawatts (MW) at Olkaria II was completed on time in May 2010.
