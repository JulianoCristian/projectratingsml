3. Capacity Planning & Execution


The G2G transformation strategy is in tandem with Least Cost Power Development Plan(LCPDP) to ensure that it is consistent with Vision
2030. The Company is on course to increase its generation capacity from 918MW in 2007 to over 3,000MW by 2018 and is committed to
contribute significantly to the delivery of the envisaged 5,000+MW by 2016.


The Company has identified geothermal mode of generation as the key driver in achieving the strategic targets and is undertaking a fast tracked
geothermal drilling programme. This will ensure steam availability to support the implementation of the geothermal projects which are central
to the achievement of our strategic goal. This is consistent with the overall goal of achieving competitive tariffs as well as optimizing renewable
energy into the system.

4. Public Private Partnerships


KenGen is exploring broader modes of financing including the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). The Company will engage in a long term
contract with a private partner to develop power plants. The private partner will offer financing, project management as well as share project
risks.


Approval has now been granted for KenGen’s PPP projects including the 560MW geothermal projects. As a result, KenGen is procuring a
partner for the Olkaria VI 140MW project through this PPP framework.




                                                                                    Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited

Regulatory Strategic Focus
KenGen’s ability to deliver on its vision strongly depends on its capability to create the right regulatory environment that favours sustainable
generation growth.


The regulatory pillar in the overall Company strategy was developed with the following key targeted areas.




1. Power Purchase Agreement Regime


Power Purchase Agreement is a contract between an electricity generator (KenGen) and the power purchaser (Kenya Power). The PPA defines
all of the commercial terms for the sale of electricity between the two parties, including when the project will begin commercial operation,
schedule for delivery of electricity, penalties for under delivery, payment terms and termination.


The charge rates are based on cost plus margin, ensuring that we have captured all the costs


KenGen first signed an Interim Power Purchase Agreement (IPPA) with Kenya Power in July 1999. The IPPA was based on energy generated
which disadvantaged KenGen in dispatch decisions. The company was remunerated at an agreed flat rate of KShs.2.36 per kWh for bulk
generation. Whereas the dominant generation mode was hydro, this had a diverse effect on the company’s revenues especially when there is
a serious drought. Faced with the poor hydrology, the company aggressively pushed for negotiation of a new PPA. The IPPA was subsequently
replaced by new PPAs which recognized the capacity and energy based on the generation source.

2. Geothermal Resource Development


Kenya has a geothermal potential of 10,000MW found in fields situated in the country’s Great Rift Valley. This leaves a huge untapped potential
for base load electricity generation. KenGen intends to develop an additional 700MW of geothermal capacity in Olkaria in its strategic
expansion. Over sixteen geothermal prospects have been identified in Kenya as illustrated below:

3. Energy Policy


The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 has substantially altered the governance structure of the country. It has also enhanced participation by the
citizens in decision making processes. This has necessitated the need to review the energy sector framework in order to align it with the new
constitutional dispensation.


KenGen is a key participant and contributor to the review of the National Energy Policy and Act. The draft National Energy Policy and Energy
Bill are now ready for presentation to cabinet and parliament. The draft policy proposes the establishment of the Hydro Risk Mitigation Fund.
This Fund shall alleviate KenGen’s perennial hydro risks. Further, the Bill proposes the establishment of the Renewable Energy Resource
Advisory Committee to advise on among others the management of geothermal resources.

3. Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)


KenGen undertakes Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for
persons displaced by our projects. This is based on continual
stakeholder engagement and consensus building which enable
projected affected people to be part of decision making
particularly in areas that affect them. As a Company, we strive
to ensure that the resettlement program mirrors the desires,
aspirations and needs of all stakeholders. This is implemented
through all inclusive Stakeholder Coordination Committees
(SCCs) that focus on aspects such as Culture, Education, Health,
Water, Transport, Roads and Environmental Conservation.


Olkaria RAP
The Olkaria RAP, is a sub-project of the 280MW Olkaria
Geothermal Project in Olkaria area of Naivasha District,
Nakuru County in which over 150 families, that is, men, women
and children, referred to as the Project Affected Persons-
PAPs are to be resettled in new homes to give way for the
construction of power plant.


The Olkaria RAP was formulated for sustainability providing
livelihood restoration, with resources and skills to enable the
PAPs achieve an improved socio-economic status. The entire
resettlement area covers 1,700 acres of land bought by
KenGen and is a testimony of the Company’s commitment to
responsible corporate citizenship. The package was negotiated
with the PAPs through consultations, finally culminating in the
formation of:
(i)	 RAP Implementation Committee (RAPIC);
(ii)	 Grievance and Complaints Handling Mechanism (GCHM).


The Committees comprised community members, KenGen
and line ministries of Health, Education and Agriculture and
Fisheries.

A major milestone in this year’s Seminar was that for the first
time external exhibitors/sponsors were invited to showcase their
products and services. This was attributed to the fact KenGen is
not just a brand in Kenya but is global reknown also among our
consultants and contractors in different parts of the world. Some
of these exhibitors included The Great Wall Drilling Company
(China), Hyundai Engineering Co Ltd (Korea),Toyota Tsusho(Japan),
Mantrac Kenya Ltd, General Motors Corporation, KEC International
Ltd(India) and FARAB Energy& Water companies.

The Kenyan Companies Act requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the company as at the end of the financial year and of its operating results for that year. It also requires the directors to ensure that
the company keeps proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company.


The directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act, and for such internal controls as directors determine are necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


The directors accept responsibility for the annual financial statements, which have been prepared using appropriate accounting policies supported
by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards and in the manner required
by the Kenyan Companies Act. The directors are of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the financial
affairs of the company and of its operating results. The directors further accept responsibility for the maintenance of accounting records which
may be relied upon in the preparation of financial statements, as well as adequate systems of internal financial control.

months from the date of this statement.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

  2.	 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
  	      Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) (Continued)
         (i)	 New standards and amendments to published standards effective for the year ended 30 June 2014

      New and revised              In May 2011, a package of five standards in consolidation and joint arrangements, associates and disclosures
      standards on                 was issued comprising IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12
      consolidation and joint      Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IASs 27 (as revised in 2011) Separate Financial Statements and
      arrangements, associates IAS 28 (as revised in 2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Subsequent to the issue of these
      and disclosures              standards, amendment to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 were issued to clarify certain guidance on first
                                   application of the standards.


                                   The application of the new standard has not had any impact on the disclosures or the amounts recognised
                                   in these financial statements as the company does not have any joint arrangements.


      IFRS 13 Fair Value           The scope of IFRS 13 is broad; the fair value measurement requirements of IFRS 13 apply to both financial
      Measurement	                 instrument items and non-financial instrument items for which other IFRSs require or permit fair value
                                   measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements, except for share-based payment transactions
                                   that are within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS
                                   17 Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value (e.g. net realisable
                                   value for the purposes of measuring inventories or value in use for impairment assessment purposes).


                                   IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
                                   in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under
                                   current market conditions. Fair value under IFRS 13 is an exit price regardless of whether that price is directly
                                   observable or estimated using another valuation technique. Also, IFRS 13 includes extensive disclosure
                                   requirements.


                                   IFRS 13 requires prospective application from 1 January 2013. In addition, specific transitional provisions
                                   were given to entities such that they need not apply the disclosure requirements set out in the Standard in
                                   comparative information provided for periods before the initial application of the Standard. In accordance
                                   with these transitional provisions, the company has not made any new disclosures required by IFRS 13 for
                                   the 2012 comparative period.


                                   Other than the additional disclosures, the application of IFRS 13 has not had any material impact on the

 	      Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) (Continued)
         (i)	 New standards and amendments to published standards effective for the year ended 30 June 2014


     Amendments to IAS 1       The Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2009 - 2011 have made a number of amendments to IFRSs. The
     Presentation of Financial amendments that are relevant to the company are the amendments to IAS 1 regarding when a statement
     Statements                of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period (third statement of financial position) and
     (as part of the Annual    the related notes are required to be presented. The amendments specify that a third statement of financial
     Improvements to IFRSs     position is required when a) an entity applies an accounting policy retrospectively, or makes a retrospective
     2009 - 2011 Cycle         restatement or reclassification of items in its financial statements, and b) the retrospective application,
     issued in May 2012)       restatement or reclassification has a material effect on the information in the third statement of financial
                               position. The amendments specify that related notes are not required to accompany the third statement of
                               financial position.
                               In the current year, the company has restated the retirement benefit liability as it adopted the revised IAS 19
                               standard, which has resulted in material effects on the information in the statement of financial position as at
                               1 July 2012. In accordance with the amendments to IAS 1, the company has presented a third statement of
                               financial position as at 1 July 2012 without the related notes except for the disclosure requirements relating
                               to the impact on the application of the new standard.


     IAS 19 Employee           IAS 19 (as revised in 2011) changes the accounting for defined benefit plans and termination benefits. The
     Benefits (as revised in   most significant change relates to the accounting for changes in defined benefit obligations and plan assets.
     2011)                     The amendments require the recognition of changes in defined benefit obligations and in the fair value of
                               plan assets when they occur, and hence eliminate the ‘corridor approach’ permitted under the previous
                               version of IAS 19 and accelerate the recognition of past service costs. All actuarial gains and losses are
                               recognised immediately through other comprehensive income in order for the net pension asset or liability
                               recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position to reflect the full value of the plan deficit or
                               surplus. Furthermore, the interest cost and expected return on plan assets used in the previous version of IAS
                               19 are replaced with a ‘net interest’ amount under IAS 19 (as revised in 2011), which is calculated by applying
                               the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.


                               The above amendments are generally effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Specific
                               transitional provisions are applicable to first-time application of IAS 19 (as revised in 2011). The company has
                               applied the relevant transitional provisions and restated the comparative amounts on a retrospective basis.

         (iii)	 Relevant new and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective for the year ended 30 June 2014


  	      IFRS 9 Financial Instruments


         •	    IFRS 9, issued in November 2009, introduced new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS
               9 was amended in October 2010 to include requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for
               derecognition.


  	      Key requirements of IFRS 9:


         •	    All recognised financial assets that are within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are
               required to be subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value. Specifically, debt investments that are held within a business
               model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of
               principal and interest on the principal outstanding are generally measured at amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting
               periods. All other debt investments and equity investments are measured at their fair value at the end of subsequent accounting
               periods. In addition, under IFRS 9, entities may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an
               equity investment (that is not held for trading) in other comprehensive income, with only dividend income generally recognised
               in profit or loss.


         •	    With regard to the measurement of financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss, IFRS 9 requires that
               the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is
               presented in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk in other

            comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a
          financial liability’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Under IAS 39, the entire amount of the change in
          the fair value of the financial liability designated as fair value through profit or loss is presented in profit or loss.
     	    The directors of the company anticipate that the application of IFRS 9 in the future may not have a significant impact on amounts
          reported in respect of the company’s financial assets and financial liabilities. However, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable
          estimate of the effect of IFRS 9 until a detailed review has been completed.


 	   IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers


     IFRS 15 provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers.


     The five steps in the model are as follows:


     •	   Identify the contract with the customer
     •	   Identify the performance obligations in the contract
     •	   Determine the transaction price
     •	   Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contracts
     •	   Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.


     	    Guidance is provided on topics such as the point in which revenue is recognised, accounting for variable consideration, costs of
          fulfilling and obtaining a contract and various related matters. New disclosures about revenue are also introduced.


     	    The directors of the company do not anticipate that the application of the standard will have a significant impact on the
          company’s financial statements.


 	   Amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and the related
     disclosures


     	    The amendments to IAS 32 clarify existing application issues relating to the offset of financial assets and financial liabilities
          requirements. Specifically, the amendments clarify the meaning of ‘currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off ’ and
          ‘simultaneous realisation and settlement’.




                                                                                        Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited

      (iii)	 Relevant new and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective for the year ended 30 June 2014 (Continued)


      	    The amendments to IFRS 7 require entities to disclose information about rights of offset and related arrangements (such as
           collateral posting requirements) for financial instruments under an enforceable master netting agreement or similar arrangement.


      	    The amendments to IFRS 7 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and interim periods within
           those annual periods. The disclosures should be provided retrospectively for all comparative periods. However, the amendments
           to IAS 32 are not effective until annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with retrospective application required.
      	    The directors anticipate that the application of these amendments to IAS 32 and IFRS 7 may result in more disclosures being
           made with regard to offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities in the future.


  	   Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (Amendments to IAS 36)


      	    Amends IAS 36 Impairment of Assets to reduce the circumstances in which the recoverable amount of assets or cash-generating
           units is required to be disclosed, clarify the disclosures required, and to introduce an explicit requirement to disclose the discount
           rate used in determining impairment (or reversals) where recoverable amount (based on fair value less costs of disposal) is
           determined using a present value technique.


      	    The directors of the company do not anticipate that the application of these amendments to IAS 36 will have a significant impact
           on the company’s financial statements as the company does not have any significant financial assets and financial liabilities that
           qualify for the offset.


      	    Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle


      	    The annual improvements 2010-2012 cycle makes amendments to the following standards:


      •	   IFRS 2 — Amends the definitions of ‘vesting condition’ and ‘market condition’ and adds definitions for ‘performance condition’
           and ‘service condition’.
      •	   IFRS 3 — Require contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability to be measured at fair value at each reporting
           date.
      •	   IFRS 8 — Requires disclosure of the judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria to operating segments,
           clarify reconciliations of segment assets only required if segment assets are reported regularly.
      •	   IFRS 13 — Clarify that issuing IFRS 13 and amending IFRS 9 and IAS 39 did not remove the ability to measure certain short-term

           receivables and payables on an undiscounted basis (amends basis for conclusions only).
      •	   IAS 16 and IAS 38 — Clarify that the gross amount of property, plant and equipment is adjusted in a manner consistent with a
           revaluation of the carrying amount.

      •	   IFRS 1 — Clarify which versions of IFRSs can be used on initial adoption (amends basis for conclusions only).
      •	   IFRS 3 — Clarify that IFRS 3 excludes from its scope the accounting for the formation of a joint arrangement in the financial
           statements of the joint arrangement itself.
      •	   IFRS 13 — Clarify the scope of the portfolio exception in paragraph 52.
      •	   IAS 40 — Clarifying the interrelationship of IFRS 3 and IAS 40 when classifying property as investment property or owner-
           occupied property.


      	    These IFRS improvements are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The directors of the
           company do not anticipate that the application of these improvements to IFRSs will have a significant impact on the company’s
           financial statements.


      (iii)	 Early adoption of standards


      The company did not early-adopt any new or amended standards in 2014.


 Basis of preparation


 The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of certain items of plant
 and machinery.


 Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that
 would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement

  date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value
  of an asset or liability, the company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those
  characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.


  In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which
  the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurements in its entirety,
  which are described as follows.


  Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity can access at a measurement date.
  Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or
  indirectly.
  Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market
  data.


  The principal accounting policies are set out below.


  Revenue recognition
  Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the revenue can be reliably
  measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable excluding discounts, rebates and sales taxes
  or duty. The following specific recognition criteria must be met before revenue is recognised:


  (i)	 Electricity sales
  Electricity sales are recognised on the basis of available capacity and energy sold to the authorised distributor’s transmission systems. The
  Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) between the Kenya Power and the company stipulate that electricity sales will be agreed upfront on
  capacity and energy the company is going to produce and transmit during the year. Capacity charge is meant to accelerate the company’s
  return on investments so it can focus on future expansion programs in building capacity to meet demand. Energy charge compensates for
  the electricity produced and sold to the distributor.


  Revenue also includes realised foreign exchange adjustments as stipulated in the PPAs.

    Revenue recognition (Continued)

 (ii)	 Interest
 Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is
 the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying
 amount on initial recognition.


 (iii)	 Rental income
 Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.


 Taxation


 Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.


 (i) 	 Current tax
 The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the profit or loss because
 of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s
 liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date


 (ii) 	 Deferred tax
 Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
 and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
 temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is
 probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets
 and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business
 combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.


 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
 sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.


 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled
 or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The
 measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the company
 expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

  2.	 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
        Taxation (Continued)

  Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or
  directly in equity, in which case, the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where
  current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for
  business combination.


  Employees’ benefits


  i)	    Retirement benefits obligations
  The company operates a defined benefits scheme and a defined contributions scheme.


  Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling
  them to the contributions.
  For defined retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
  valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of
  the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the statement
  of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement
  recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past
  service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at
  the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are categorised as service costs (including
  current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements), net interest expense or income and
  remeasurment.


  The company presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in profit or loss in the line item of pension cost-defined benefit
  scheme (included in staff costs). Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs.


  The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in the company’s
  defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the
  form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.


  A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination
  benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.


  ii)	 Other entitlements
  The monetary benefits for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date are recognised as a provision.

 Property, plant and equipment


 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or valuation, excluding the costs of day to day servicing, less accumulated depreciation
 and accumulated impairment in value. Plant and machinery class of property, plant and equipment are stated at valuation whereas the
 other classes of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.


 The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into
 operation, the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The purchase price or
 construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.


 Properties, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost,
 less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised on qualifying
 assets. Such items of property, plant and equipment are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when
 completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the
 assets are ready for their intended use.


 Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity such that the carrying amounts do not differ materially from those that would be
 determined using fair values at the reporting date. Any increases arising on the revaluation of such plant and machinery is recognised in
 other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for the same asset
 previously recognised in profit or loss, in which case the increase is credited to profit or loss to the extent of the decrease previously
 expensed.


 A decrease in the carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such an asset is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it exceeds
 the balance, if any, held in the properties revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that asset.


 All productive wells are capitalized in property, plant and equipment when connected and are depreciated over their useful lives.The useful
 life is currently estimated to be twenty five years from the date of commencement of commercial operation. The cost of unproductive
 wells is transferred to the profit or loss in the year in which they are certified complete but unproductive. Where a well ceases to be
 productive before the end of its expected useful life, the net book value of the well is charged to the profit or loss in the year it ceases
 to be productive.

  Depreciation


  Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis and is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets (other than freehold
  land and Work-in progress under construction) less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method.


  The annual depreciation rates in use are:


  Buildings	                                                                            2.85%
  Transmission lines	                                                                    2.5%
  Plant and machinery:
  - Hydro plants	                                                                         2%
  - Geothermal wells, wellheads and plants	                                               4%
  - Thermal plants and wind plants	                                                       5%
  - Rigs	                                                                               6.66%
  Intake and tunnels	                                                                     1%
  Motor vehicles 	                                                                       25%
  Furniture, equipment and fittings 	                                                12½%
  Computers	                                                                             25%


  Freehold land is not depreciated and leasehold land is amortised over the lease period.


  Residual value, useful life and depreciation methods are reviewed at least annually at the reporting date. Changes in the residual value and
  expected useful life are accounted for by changing the depreciation charge for the year, and treated as changes in accounting estimates.


  Depreciation on revalued assets is recognised in profit or loss and a transfer of excess depreciation is made from the asset revaluation
  reserve to retained earnings. On the subsequent sale or retirement of a revalued property, the attributable revaluation surplus remaining
  in the properties revaluation reserve is transferred directly to retained earnings.


  An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
  from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is
  determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.


  On disposal of revalued assets, amounts in the revaluation surplus relating to that asset are transferred to retained earnings.

 Intangible assets


 Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried
 at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful life of the assets depends on the duration of
 the licences. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is
 an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with
 a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the reporting date. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption
 of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and
 are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the profit
 or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.


 An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses
 arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
 amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.


 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill


 At each reporting date the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is
 any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is
 estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount
 of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a
 reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or
 otherwise they are allocated to the smallest company of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can
 be identified.


 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
 are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
 and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.


 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
 asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless
 the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.




                                                                                      Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
  2.	 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
    Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill (Continued)

  Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised
  estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
  determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment
  loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the
  impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.


  Borrowing costs


  Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily
  take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the
  assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.


  Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted
  from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.


  Capitalised costs include interest charges and foreign currency exchange differences on borrowings for projects under construction to the
  extent that they are regarded as adjustments to interest rates.


  All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.


  Inventories


  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and comprises
  expenditure incurred in the normal course of business, including direct material costs. Net realisable value is the price at which the
  inventory can be realised in the normal course of business after allowing for the costs of realisation. Obsolete and defective inventories
  are fully written off.

 2.	 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)


 Financial instruments


 Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.


 Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition
 or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are
 added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs
 directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately
 in profit or loss.


 Financial assets


 Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held-to-
 maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and
 purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.


 Held-to-maturity investments


 Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that
 the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are
 measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment.


 Effective interest method


 The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over
 the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points
 paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the
 expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.




                                                                                           Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited
geothermal • hydro • wind                                                                     2014 Annual Report & Financial Statements        Page 113
  2.	 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

  Available-for-sale financial assets


  Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as Available-for-sale financial assets or are not
  classified as (a) loans and receivables, (b) held-to-maturity investments or (c) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.


  The company has investments in debt securities that are traded in an active market and are stated at fair value at the reporting date.
  The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market. Interest
  income calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss except for interest income earned on the temporary
  investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets which is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for
  capitalisation.


  Fair value changes in the carrying amount of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income and
  accumulated under the heading of investments revaluation reserve. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired,
  the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.


  Loans and receivables


  Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
  Loans and receivables (including trade and other receivables, bank balances and cash) are measured at amortised cost using the effective
  interest method, less any impairment.


  Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest
  would be immaterial.


  Impairment of financial assets


  At each reporting date, all financial assets are subject to review for impairment. If it is probable that the company will not be able to collect
  all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of loans, receivables, or held-to-maturity investments carried
  at amortised cost, an impairment or bad debt loss has occurred. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated recoverable
  amount either directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss incurred is dealt with through profit or loss for
  the period.


  For Available-for-sale debt securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be
  objective evidence of impairment.

 2.	 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
 	    Impairment of financial assets (Continued)

 For all other financial assets, objective evidence of impairment could include:


 •	   significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
 •	   breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 •	   it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation; or
 •	   the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.


 For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition,
 assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the company’s
 past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of
 40 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.


 For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the asset’s carrying
 amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.


 For financial assets carried at cost, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount
 and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. Such
 impairment loss will not be reversed in subsequent periods.


 The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade
 receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered
 uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against
 the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.


 When an Available-for-sale financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other
 comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.


 For financial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease
 can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is
 reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not
 exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.


 In respect of Available-for-sale debt securities, impairment losses are subsequently reversed through profit or loss if an increase in the fair
 value of the investment can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.

                                                                                        Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
  2.	 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

  Derecognition of financial assets


  The company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers
  the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the company neither transfers
  nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the company recognises
  its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the company retains substantially all the risks
  and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a
  collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
  On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration
  received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in
  equity is recognised in profit or loss.


  On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the company retains an option to repurchase part of a transferred
  asset or retains a residual interest that does not result in the retention of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the
  company retains control), the company allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset between the part it continues to
  recognise under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognises on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts on the
  date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognised and the sum of the
  consideration received for the part no longer recognised and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognised in other
  comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income
  is allocated between the part that continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the relative fair
  values of those parts.


  Financial liabilities and equity instruments


  Classification as debt or equity
  Debt and equity instruments issued by the company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance
  of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.


  Equity instruments
  An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity
  instruments issued by the company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

 	    Financial liabilities and equity instruments (Continued)


 Financial liabilities
 Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.




 Other financial liabilities
 Other financial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.


 The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the
 relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points
 paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the
 expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.


 Derecognition of financial liabilities
 The company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
 The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised
 in profit or loss.


 Accounting for leases


 Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
 lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.


 The company as lessor
 Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred
 in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line
 basis over the lease term.


 The company as lessee
 Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis
 is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising
 under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.




                                                                                                 Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited

  In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate
  benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more
  representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

  Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability and deducted from retained earnings when approved by the company’s
  shareholders. Interim dividends are deducted from retained earnings when they are declared and no longer at the discretion of the
  company.


  Grants


  Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the company will comply with the conditions attaching to
  them and that the grants will be received.


  Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the company recognises as expenses
  the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that the
  company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as deferred revenue in the statement of
  financial position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the related assets.


  Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate
  financial support to the company with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become
  receivable.


  Foreign currencies


  In preparing the financial statements of the company, transactions in currencies other than the company’s functional currency (foreign
  currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the reporting date, monetary items
  denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are
  denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary
  items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

 2.	 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
 	    Financial liabilities and equity instruments (Continued)

 Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
 •	   exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are
      included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;
 •	   exchange differences on transactions entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks; and
 •	   exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned
      nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other
      comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on repayment of the monetary items.


 Provisions


 Provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that
 an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the
 amount of the obligation.


 Comparatives


 Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the current year. In particular,
 comparatives have been adjusted to comply with IAS 19 Employee Benefits (as revised in 2011).


 3.	 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY


 In the application of the company’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
 estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.


 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the
 period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
 revision affects both current and future periods.

  3.	 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
      (Continued)

  a) Critical judgements in applying the company’s accounting policies


  The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see 3 (b) below), that the directors have made in the
  process of applying the company’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial
  statements.


  Held-to-maturity financial assets


  The directors have reviewed the company’s held-to-maturity financial assets in the light of its capital maintenance and liquidity requirements
  and have confirmed the company’s positive intention and ability to hold those assets to maturity. The carrying amount of the held-to-
  maturity financial assets is Sh 2,432 million (30 June 2013: Sh 2,437million). Details of these assets are set out in note 18.


  Deferred tax assets


  Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against
  which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be
  recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. The carrying value
  of recognised tax losses at 30 June 2014 was KShs.9,933,282,000 (2013: KShs.10,396,680,000). There are no tax losses prior to 1 January
  2010. Further details are contained in Note 29.


  Revaluation of power plants


  Power plants are stated at valuation. Revaluations are performed by professional valuers at sufficient regularity such that the carrying
  amounts do not differ materially from those that would be determined using fair values at the reporting date. At the reporting date, the
  directors assess the carrying amount of revalued property, plant and equipment and apply judgement to determine that these do not differ
  materially from that which would be determined using fair values at 30 June 2014.

 3.	 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
     (Continued)

 b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty


 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment


 The company reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment at the reporting date. The useful lives of the plants are
 then used in establishing the contracts that the company enters into under the Power Purchase Agreements.


 Impairment losses


 At the reporting date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any
 indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated
 in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.


 Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the
 cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. Any impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately. Where an impairment
 loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount. A reversal of
 an impairment loss, other than that arising from goodwill, is recognised as income immediately.


 Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets


 The company classifies certain assets as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value through other comprehensive
 income. The company treats available-for-sale investments as impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair
 value below its cost or where other objective evidence of impairment exists. The determination of what is ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’
 requires judgement. When the fair value declines, management makes assumptions about the decline in value to determine whether it is
 an impairment that should be recognised in the profit and loss account.


 Actuarial valuation of defined benefits plan


 The liability due under the defined benefit pension plan is determined using actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves making
 assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases.
 Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. See note 28.

  1In line with the provisions of the Power Purchase Agreements, the company is reimbursed by Kenya Power for fuel costs incurred
 in the production of thermal electricity based on pre-agreed plant fuel usage. The net fuel pass-through income therefore represents
 the fuel usage efficiency which varies with working condition of the thermal power generating plants, because the machines are
 presently new. As the plants get old, the net fuel pass through is expected to be a charge to the income statement.

 2
  The Water Resource Management Rules 2007 (Water Regulations) was Gazetted by the Government through legal notice No.
 171 of September 2007. The regulation provided for water use charge at the rate of 0.05 Shs/kWh for power plants with capacity
 of over 1MW. With approval from the Energy Regulatory Commission, the company is reimbursed by Kenya Power for the cost of
 water charges as a pass-through.

 3
  In line with the provisions of the Power Purchase Agreements for mobile well heads, the company provides the feed in tariff of US
 cents 8.5 per kWh . The tariff is broken down in to US cents 3.0 per kWh which is the cost for geothermal steam. A capacity charge
 of US cents 5.5 per kWh is also charged to the company. The company charges Kenya power for the capacity and the steam portion
 as a pass through cost.

 13.	EARNINGS PER SHARE

 Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average num-
 ber of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

 Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
 number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued
 on conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

 There were no potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding as at 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2013. Diluted earnings per share are
 therefore same as basic earnings per share.

 The following reflects the earnings and the share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

14.	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued)

    Plant and machinery was revalued by an independent valuer, CB Richard Ellis International valuers as at 30 June 2005, on a de-
    preciated replacement cost basis and represents the plant and machinery’s highest and best use. The directors have re-assessed
    the carrying amount of revalued property, plant and equipment as at year end and determined that these do not differ material-
    ly from that which would be determined using fair values at 30 June 2014.

    Details of the company’s buildings and machinery and equipment and information about fair value hierarchy as at 30 June 2014
    are as follows:

   25. RESERVES

      (a)	 The share premium arose as a result of the company taking over more assets than liabilities from the government during the
           Power Sector Reform Program in 2000. The capitalisation of the related excess was in the form of share capital issued at a
           premium.

      (b)	 The capital reserve relates to development surcharge received from Kenya Power for financing the development of certain
           power projects for the period 1997 and prior years. The reserve is not distributable to shareholders.

      (c)	 The investments revaluation reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses arising on the revaluation of available-for-
           sale financial assets that have been recognised in other comprehensive income, net of amounts reclassified to profit or loss
           when those assets have been disposed of. The reserve is not distributable to shareholders.

      (d)	 The property, plant and equipment revaluation reserve arises on the revaluation of plant and machinery. When revalued
           property, plant and equipment are disposed, the portion of the plant and machinery revaluation reserve that relates to that
           asset is transferred directly to retained earnings. The reserve is not distributable to shareholders.

                                         NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
 28.	RETIREMENT BENEFITS LIABILITY

 	   Up to 31 December 2000, the company operated a joint defined benefit scheme with Kenya Power, which was funded by
     contributions from both the company and employees.

 	   The company registered its own defined benefits scheme in 2000 and commenced making contributions to the scheme, alongside
     employees’ contributions, with effect from 1 January 2001. The scheme is administered by Alexander Forbes Financial Services
     (E.A) Limited while British-American Asset Managers and Co-optrust Investment Services ltd act as Investment Managers for
     the DB Scheme. Under the plan, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of 3% of Final Pensionable Emoluments for
     Pensionable Service upto 1 January 2000 and 2% of Final Pensionable Emoluments for Pensionable Service after 1 January 2000
     on attainment of a retirement age of 60 years. No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.

 	   The KenGen Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme (DB Scheme) is established under trust and was closed to new entrants and
     to future accrual of benefits with effect from 31 December 2011 in respect of members aged below 45 years. A new Defined
     Contribution Scheme, the KenGen Defined Contribution (DC Scheme) 2012 was established effective 1 January 2012, for all new
     eligible employees. All active in service members aged 45 years and over as at 31 December 2011 had an option to either remain
     in the DB scheme for future benefit accrual or join the new DC scheme. Some members have opted to join the new DC scheme
     for future benefit accrual while others opted to remain in the DB scheme. The DC scheme is administered by Alexander Forbes
     Financial Services (EA) while Stanlib Ltd act as Investment Managers for the Scheme.

     	 he company therefore only makes contributions to the DB scheme in respect of those members who opted to remain in the
     T
     DB scheme. . DB scheme member contributions are a fixed percentage of pay with the company responsible for the balance.

     A valuation of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 31 December 2011 by M/S
     Alexander Forbes Financial Services EA Limited for statutory purposes. An actuarial valuation to fulfill the financial reporting and
     disclosure requirements of IAS19 was also carried out as at 30 June 2014. On this basis, the present value of the defined benefit
     obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

     The principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
     	                                                                                                       2014	                      2013

     The company’s deferred tax balance includes deferred tax assets of KShs.9.1 billion related to accumulated losses available for offset

     2014 will be the first year that tax losses related to the year 2010 amounting to Sh 9.1 billion cannot be carried forward unless the
     Cabinet Secretary, National Treasury approves extension of the tax loss period upon recommendation by Kenya Revenue Authority.
     On 12th February 2014, the company applied for extension of the loss carried forward period. On 8 August 2014, KRA advised the
     company that the loss which relates to the year ended 30 June 2010 will be considered for extension, once the company provides
     the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2014. Separately, on 9th June 2014, the Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of
     Energy and Petroleum wrote to the Cabinet Secretary, National Treasury seeking for extension of the tax loss period for KenGen
     and other Electricity Sub- Sector players.

 35.	CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

 	   I. Disputed tax penalties
 	   On 12 August 2002, the Customs and Excise Department issued an assessment of KShs.22.2 million excise duty arising from
      electricity imported from Uganda between 1998 and 2001. The principal tax has since been settled in full except for penalties
      amounting to KShs.31 million. The company has petitioned the National Treasury for a waiver of the penalties and, in the opinion
      of the directors, no provision is required in the financial statements as the liability is not expected to crystallise.

 	   II. Letters of credit
 	   Letters of credit signify commitment by the company to make payments to third parties for contracts entered into, generally
      relating to foreign payments. Outstanding letters of credit as at 30 June 2014 amounted to KShs.1.186 billion (30 June 2013: Shs:
      3.063 billion).

 	   III. Disputed witholding tax
 	   During the year, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) performed a tax audit for the financial years 2009-2012. Subsequently KRA
      issued an assessment of Shs. 975,848, 686. The company objected to the assessment after which KRA issued a stand over notice
      pending resolution of matters in dispute. In the opinion of the directors no provision is required in the financial statements as the
      liability is not expected to crystallise.

      Introduction and overview

  	   The company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks and those activities involve the analysis, evaluation, acceptance and
      management of some degree of risk or combination of risks. Taking risk is core to the company’s business and the operational
      risks are an inevitable consequence of being in business. The company’s aim is therefore to achieve an appropriate balance
      between risk and return and minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The key types of risks include:
      •	 Market risk – includes currency, interest rate and other price risk
      •	 Credit risk
      •	 Liquidity risk

  	   The company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of changes in the business environment
      and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects of such risks on its financial performance within the options available by setting
      acceptable levels of risks.

     Risk Management Framework

 	   The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the company’s risk management framework.

 	   The company’s Finance Division identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with operating units.The board
     provides written principals for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as credit risk,
     liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk.

 	   The company does not enter into or trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative
     purposes.

     (a)	 Market risks

     	       The board has put in place an internal audit function to assist it in assessing the risk faced by the company on an ongoing
             basis, evaluate and test the design and effectiveness of its internal accounting and operational controls.

     	       Market risk is the risk arising from changes in market prices, such as interest rate, equity prices and foreign exchange rates
             which will affect the company’s income or the value of its holding of financial instruments. The objective of market risk
             management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
             Overall responsibility for managing market risk rests with the Audit and Risk Management Committee.

     	       The company’s Finance Department is responsible for the development of detailed risk management policies (subject to
             review and approval by Audit and Risk Management Committee) and for the day to day implementation of those policies.

     	       There has been no change to the company’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the
             risk.

         i)	 Foreign currency risk

         	      The company has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises when borrowings are revalued at the reporting
                date and also through purchases of goods and services that are done in currencies other than the local currency.
                The company has loans from multilateral donors, which are denominated in currencies other than the functional local
                currency. Loan payments are made by using the prevailing exchange rate as there is no forward currency contracts to
                eliminate the currency exposures. Invoices denominated in foreign currencies are paid after 30 days from the date of the
                invoice and conversion at the time of payment is done using the prevailing exchange rate.

 38.	 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (Continued)


     (a)	 Market risks (Continued)

           	      ii) Interest rate risk

           	      The company exposure to interest rate risk is with regards to fluctuation in banks’ interest rates in the market which
                  affects the borrowings by the company. The company’s variable rate of borrowings is exposed to a risk of change in cash
                  flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The company’s non current borrowings are at fixed rates thus minimising
                  the exposure to the interest rate risk. The effect of fluctuation of overdraft floating interest rate would not be significant.
                  The interest earning financial assets that the company holds include investments in government securities and short term
                  deposits whose rates of return are predetermined.

           	      Other price risk

           	      This is the risk that the rate of the tariff will decline in the future. It is the risk of losing energy revenues due to a fall
                  in the tariff. The company’s exposure to this kind of risk is highly regulated by the Power Purchase Agreement, which
                  is a product of discussion by Kenya Power and the company, with Energy Regulatory Commission as a moderator. The
                  company’s main input for thermal energy generation is fuel which is a significant cost component. The company is in an
                  arrangement to pass this cost to the customer, Kenya Power.

     (b) Credit risk

     	         The company has exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when
               due. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks, as well as trade and other receivables and
               available-for-sale financial investments.

     	         The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements representing the company’s maximum exposure
               to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained is made up as follows:

       *Cash and cash equivalents exclude cash in hand.

       The company only sells generated electricity to Kenya Power and this minimizes the credit risk exposure on amount due
       from Kenya Power. Both companies have a contract that stipulates a 40 day credit period. Receivable balances from company
       staff are recovered on payment of salaries.

       Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by company’s treasury department in accordance
       with the company’s policies. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit
       limits assigned to each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the company’s directors on an annual basis,
       and may be updated throughout the year subject to approval of the company’s audit and risk management committee. The
       limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty
       failure.

    c)	 Liquidity risk

       Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The company’s
       approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities
       when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the
       company’s reputation. Typically the company ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational
       expenses for a period of 30 days, including the servicing of financial obligations.This excludes the potential impact of extreme
       circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters and political violence. The company monitors
       its risk to shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool.

       This tool considers the account receivables from Kenya Power and the Ministry of Energy & Petroleum and maturity of
       financial instruments, together with projected cash flows from operations. The company’s objective is to maintain a balance
       between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and other borrowings.

        CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
    39. 	

      The primary objective of the company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy
      capital ratios in order to support its business and maximize shareholder value.

      The Capital Management policy as approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) is to maintain a strong capital base so as
      to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board monitors
      the return on capital, which the company defines as net operating income divided by total shareholders’ equity. The Board
      also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.

      The company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To
      maintain or adjust the capital structure, the company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to
      shareholders or issue new shares as circumstances would dictate. There were no changes in the company’s approach to
      capital management as regards the objectives, policies or processes during the year.

      The company monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The company’s
      target is to keep the self- financing ratios greater than 25%. The company includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and
      borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash equivalents. Capital includes 30% ordinary shares attributable to the public
      and 70% ordinary shares attributable to the Government of Kenya and distributable reserves.
