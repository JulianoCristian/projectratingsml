The development objectives of the project are to: (1) enhance the policy, institutional,
and regulatory environment for private- sector participation and sector development; (2)
support efficient expansion of power generation capacity to meet the economy's supply
deficits projected to occur by 2006/7; and (3) increase access to electricity in urban and
peri-urban areas, while improving the efficiency, reliability, and quality of service to
existing customers.

Revised PDOs (as approved by original approving authority)

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.       Country Context. In the late 1990s, Kenya experienced a slowdown in growth that led to
poverty increasing from 48 percent of the population in 1990 to 56 percent by 2003. Agriculture
and manufacturing stagnated, and the quality of energy and infrastructure services declined. Only
about 15 percent of the population had access to electricity. Poor economic governance and an
uncertain political environment led to a decline in official development assistance and private
capital inflows. In March 2004, the new government (which had come into office in 2002),
formulated an Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERSWEC),
which emphasized accelerating economic growth and creating employment, increasing
productivity, delivering basic services, and distributing national income equitably.

2.       Sector Policy. The Government of Kenya (GoK) recognized that energy services are a
critical input to economic activity, contribute to employment and fiscal revenue, and are
indispensable to the success of ERSWEC. To realize the energy sector’s potential, the GoK
formulated a long-term vision and policy framework to address key sector challenges. The first
generation reform, undertaken in the 1990s with support from the World Bank, included
unbundling of power generation from transmission and distribution (T&D); adjustment of tariffs;
reform of the legal and regulatory environment to open up the power subsector to private
investment; introduction of the first Independent Power Producers (IPPs); and liberalization of
importation, pricing, and marketing for petroleum products. In further expansion of this support,
it was envisaged that a second generation of reforms would be required to continue to address
challenges that remained in the sector, including the weak legal and regulatory framework, the
monopolistic industry structure and performance of the entities, and low access rates since these
issues constrained the efficient and effective operation and development of the sector.

3.       Weak Legal and Regulatory Framework. The energy sector was governed principally by
the 1997 Electric Power Act and the Petroleum Act, Cap 116. The former governed the
generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and funding for the rural electrification
program. The Electricity Regulatory Board (ERB) regulated the sector, but was subject to the
provisions of the State Corporations Act exposing it to external interference. ERB’s capacity to
set tariffs, review power purchase agreements (PPAs), and monitor and enforce regulation was
limited. The licensing of operators and dispute resolutions was vested in the Ministry of Energy
(MoE). In the petroleum subsector, several statutes apart from the Petroleum Act, Cap 116,
governed petroleum product standards, marketing, and licensing. With the deregulation of
petroleum importation, pricing, and marketing, additional operators entered the market, straining
the capacity of local jurisdictions to regulate and monitor product standards and compliance with
safety and environmental regulations.

4.       Structure of Energy Sector. Power generation was dominated by the state-owned Kenya
Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), with 88 percent of the country’s generating capacity
of 1,124 megawatts (MW); IPPs provided the remaining generation. Three IPPs were generating
power as a result of the first generation reforms undertaken in the 1990s. In transmission and
distribution, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC), a publicly quoted company, was

                                                                                                 1
the sole licensed bulk power purchaser and distributor that owned and operated the country’s
2,035 kilometers (km) of transmission network. Overstaffed and financially weak, KPLC lost
approximately US$30–40 million a year between FY2000 and FY2003. Collection of accounts
receivables was taking approximately 70 days on average. As a consequence, investment in
productive assets was taking place on a small scale.

5.       In the petroleum subsector, the Kenya Petroleum Refinery Limited (KPRL) was 50
percent owned by the GoK, with the remaining shares owned by Shell, BP, and Caltex. KPRL
was protected by import tariffs and quantitative measures, which enabled it to supply the
domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market. The National Oil Corporation of Kenya
(NOCK), also owned by the GoK, controlled petroleum exploration and oil products supply and
distribution.

6.       Low Access to Reliable Energy Services. Limited access to electricity (15 percent of the
general population and only about 4 percent of the rural population) and poor quality of
electricity service was a significant constraint to economic and commercial development as well
as to improving the quality of life. Expanding access required significant financial resources,
exceeding what was available in the public budget. Furthermore, the cost of rural electrification,
where 80 percent of the population resides, was also high. Rural electrification depended on
KPLC for distribution and access, and on the Rural Electrification Fund for financing. KPLC was
ill-equipped to serve outlying areas, lacking both financial capacity and operating standards. As a
result, even in the areas within reach of the national grid, new connections were taking place
slowly, with only between 20,000-50,000 incremental customer connections per year. Finally, the
quality of electricity supply was inadequate, with system losses close to—or in some years
exceeding—20 percent, and frequent occurrence of supply interruptions and outages.

7.       Sector Performance. Reflecting these problems, overall energy sector performance was
inadequate, with low access to modern energy services; an insufficient level of investment,
especially in power generation and distribution; poor quality of electricity supply; and weak
institutions to implement and sustain activities. The demand-and-supply balance was also tight,
and the utilities had to procure high-cost emergency power when droughts reduced hydropower
generation. Based on the medium-case electricity demand growth scenario of about 6 percent per
year from FY2003 to FY2008, additional generation capacity was forecast to be needed in
FY2007. As it turned out, the demand growth projections at the time of appraisal were accurate,
and a shortfall in power actually occurred in FY2006/07, which had to be met by the addition of a
100-MW capacity of emergency power.

8.       Development Partnerships in the Sector. The Bank took the leading role among the
GoK’s development partners on sector reform dialogue and adopted a coordinated approach in
supporting first generation reforms. A large part of development partners’ support, which was
starting to decline before the project, focused mostly on power generation and, to a lesser extent,
on off-grid energy access. In this context, a second generation of reforms—supporting further
unbundling of transmission from distribution and improving governance, infrastructure, and
institutions—was undertaken under the Energy Sector Recovery Project (ESRP), accompanied by
investments in power generation and distribution to expand access to electricity and to meet the
anticipated supply deficit. The 2004 National Energy Policy, i.e. the long-term vision and policy
framework that the GoK formulated to reform the sector, was based on a number of preceding

                                                                                                 2
studies and workshops. These included the Energy Sector Development Strategy, the Power
Market Design and Pre-privatization Study, and the National Energy Policy Workshop conducted
in February 2004, all of which were supported by the International Development Association
(IDA) with funds from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF).

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

9.       The original ESRP’s development objectives were to (1) enhance the policy, institutional,
and regulatory environment for private-sector participation and sector development; (2) support
efficient expansion of power generation capacity to meet the economy's projected supply deficits
by FY2006/07; and (3) increase access to electricity in urban and peri-urban areas, while
improving the efficiency, reliability, and quality of service to existing consumers.

10.     Progress toward these objectives was to be measured by the following indicators:

Policy, Institutional, and Regulatory Environment

(i) Adopt an adequate national energy policy, consistent with efficient development and operation
    of the sector.
(ii) Pass an adequate energy law, including regulatory arrangements designed to effectively
    support implementation of the National Energy Policy.

Efficient Expansion of Power Generation Capacity

(iii) Generate about 276 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of additional energy per year (at plant-load factor
    of about 95 percent) representing an increase in national power production of about 5 percent

Increase in Access to Reliable and Quality Electricity

(iv) Connect about 400,000 new customers by FY2008/09, thus increasing access to electricity
   from the current 15 percent by an additional 5 percent of the population by the same date.
(v) Reduce system losses from about 18.7 percent in FY2003/04 to about 14.5 percent by
   FY2008/09.
(vi) Improve the availability of transmission lines and reduce power outages to levels considered
   reasonable for KPLC’s system.
(vii) Reduce total monthly outages of 11,000 (about 1.54 per 100 customers) to no more than
   4,000 (0.41 per 100 customers) by the project completion date of September 30, 2009.

1.3   Revised PDOs (as approved by original approving authority), Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

11.     In 2009, as part of additional financing and project restructuring, the PDOs were
modified to remove one of the original objectives while the other two objectives were maintained.
The revised PDOs are to (1) enhance the policy, institutional, and regulatory environment for
sector development, including private-sector development; and (2) increase access to electricity in
urban and peri-urban areas, while improving the efficiency, reliability, and quality of service to
customers. The original objective to support efficient expansion of power generation capacity to
meet the economy’s projected supply deficit by FY2006/07 was changed to an intermediate
indicator, because that expansion was considered an intermediate outcome indicator for the

                                                                                                 3
objective on increasing access to electricity (see below). Achievement of the initial generation
objective had been delayed, and was now expected in 2010.

12.    Progress toward achieving the modified objectives was to be measured by the following
outcome indicators:

Policy, Institutional, and Regulatory Environment:

(i) Energy law supporting the implementation of the National Energy Policy is passed and
    implemented.
(ii) Increase in the number of IPPs.
(iii) The percentage of disputes and complaints resolved annually by the ERC is increased.

Increase in Access to Reliable and Quality Electricity:

(iv) Access expansion—The number of households connected to electricity under the project is
   increased.
(v) Quality improvement—The number of combined monthly distribution line interruptions per
   100 km for 66-kilovolt (kV) and 33-kV lines is reduced.


1.4     Main Beneficiaries

13.     The main beneficiaries included those people who are already connected to the national
grid and who would benefit from improved supply of electricity. The distribution component was
envisaged to connect 400,000 customers to electricity, a significant portion of whom would be
poor and economically marginalized households, farmers, and small informal business owners.
This would improve living conditions for the poor and stimulate the informal sector (called ‘Jua
Kali’ in Kenya). Other potential beneficiaries included prospective private power investors and
operators who would benefit from additional opportunities to participate in the electricity market.
MoE and utilities in the energy sector, as well as local and foreign contractors and workers for the
generation and distribution works, were also considered to be beneficiaries.


1.5     Original Components

14.     The original project had four components:

A. Institutional and Capacity-Building Component (US$6.30 million: US$6.25 million
International Development Association (IDA); US$0.05 million GoK). Activities include (1)
implementing a comprehensive Corporate Recovery Program (CRP) for KPLC through
engagement of a management services provider; (2) strengthening the sector regulator’s capacity
to review and set power tariffs, prepare secondary legislation, and enforce regulations under the
law; (3) equipping the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) with the skills, training, and
equipment necessary for effectively setting and monitoring the standards of petroleum products in
the country; (4) upgrading staff skills in MoE and KenGen; and (5) implementing a management
and staff development program for KPLC.




                                                                                                  4
B. Feasibility Studies and Engineering Services Component (US$11.75 million: US$11.06 million
IDA; US$0.54 million KenGen; US$0.15 million GoK). Activities include carrying out (1)
environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) for the generation and distribution
components of the ESRP and for the LPG import handling and storage project; (2) consultancy
services to update the Kipevu combined-cycle power plant feasibility study; (3) consultancy
services for the distribution upgrade component; (4) engineering services for the supervision of
the distribution component; (5) a feasibility study and preliminary and detailed designs for the
proposed LPG import handling and storage project; (6) a geothermal reservoir optimization study
for the Olkaria I and II sites; (7) a study to establish a geothermal development company and
preparation of a business plan for the company; (8) consultancy services for preliminary design
and supervision of the Olkaria II power plant extension; (9) consultancy services for the detailed
design and supervision of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition/Emergency Management
System (SCADA/EMS); and (10) consultancy services for preparation of future energy projects.

C. Generation, Olkaria II Power Plant Extension (US$54.93 million: US$24.01 million IDA;
US$24.01 European Investment Bank (EIB); US$6.90 million KenGen). Activities include (1)
providing civil works for the extension of the powerhouse to accommodate the third 35-MW
steam turbine generating unit, control panel and other ancillary equipment, cooling tower, and
switchyard for installing a generator transformer, support bus-bar arrangement, and switchgear
equipment; (2) supplying and installing a steam-gathering system from Olkaria I and Olkaria II
sites and connecting pipes to the third Olkaria II unit; (3) supplying and installing a 35-MW
steam turbine generating unit; (4) supplying and installing a 45-medium-voltage (MV), 11/220-
kV step-up generator transformer, complete with switchgear equipment; and (5) supplying and
installing other electrical and mechanical equipment, including control room equipment, cables,
and other ancillary equipment.

D. Distribution Upgrading (US$152.49 million: US$38.64 million IDA; US$51.09 million EIB;
US$25.00 million Agence Française de Développement (AFD [French Development Agency]);
US$12.00 million Nordic Development Fund (NDF); US$25.77 million KPLC). Activities include
(1) upgrading existing and constructing new substations; (2) reinforcing and extending the
distribution system; (3) supplying energy meters; (4) upgrading the SCADA/EMS system,
including providing a trunked radio system for the Mt. Kenya region.

1.6     Revised Components

15.    During both project implementation and the 2009 additional financing (AF) operation,
some activities were dropped and new activities were added.

A. Institutional and Capacity Building (AF—US$1.1 million IDA). The AF supported training of
(1) KPLC, MoE, and Rural Electrification Authority (REA) staff on procurement, contract
management, environmental and social impact analysis, the use of geographic information system
(GIS)-based electrification modeling and planning for electricity access scale-up preparation; and
(2) electrical installation contractors to improve and increase local capacity for installation works.

B. Studies and Engineering Services (AF—US$7.2 million IDA). The ESIA for the LPG import
handling and storage project was dropped because it was financed by a private company engaged
in construction of the facility. The following studies and engineering services were added during
project implementation: (1) a study for unbundling KPLC and establishing the KETRACO; (2) a
Transmission System Master Plan, including a study for a 132-kV/220-kV ring system for
Nairobi; (3) a study to evaluate the technical merits and assess the economic benefits of the 132-

                                                                                                    5
kV and MV (66-kV, 33-kV, 11-kV) systems needed to cope with the additional customer
connections planned in the access scale-up program; (4) preparation of tender documents for the
generating plant; (5) a study to assess the short- and medium-term impacts of the electricity
access scale-up program on the operations of KPLC (billing, meter reading, collections, etc.); (6)
development of monitoring and evaluation methods for implementing the GoK’s electricity
access scale-up program; (7) an energy sectoral environmental assessment; (8) provision for wind
masts, data loggers, software, and other equipment to assist MoE to carry out feasibility studies
on wind power generation; (9) advising on the management/concessioning of electricity systems
that are not connected to the national grid; (10) a feasibility study for an LNG regasification
plant; (11) biogas consultancy to implement pilot plants in collaboration with flower farms; and
(12) a study on the national electricity power system.

C. Generation, Olkaria II Power Plant Extension (AF—US$64.2 million: US$26.0 million AFD;
US$26.0 million EIB; US$12.2 million KenGen). 1 KenGen, AFD, and EIB financed the increased
cost for the third unit at the Olkaria II power plant.

D. Distribution (AF—US$77.1 million: US$68.9 million IDA; US$8.2 million KPLC). The AF
revived items that were trimmed from the original design: (1) reconductoring about 228 km of
11-kV lines in the areas of Malindi (25 km), Nairobi (103 km), and West Kenya (100 km); (2)
reconductoring about 270 km of 33-kV lines in West Kenya; (3) installing 11-kV switchgear at
various substations and line sectionalizes; (4) financing extensions of the distribution network,
transformers, and meters in the Nairobi, Western, Central, and Coast provinces; (5) financing four
to six transformer substations in the residential areas of Nairobi that are experiencing high
electricity demand growth; (6) installing underground cables in Mombasa; and (7) procuring
spare substation transformers, distribution transformers, conductors, insulators, stay rods, and
pole accessories.

1.7      Other Significant Changes

16.      After project appraisal and approval in 2004, prices for works, goods, and services began
increasing, requiring an AF, reallocations, and extensions of the closing date. The largest price
increase occurred with the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the third
unit at Olkaria II. The lead times in procurement processes, worldwide price increases in
commodities, and force majeure resulted in substantial price escalations for the EPC contract. The
price escalations required the AF discussed below. There were also financing shortfalls in the
study component, specifically in the contract for engineering services and the study for
optimizing geothermal resources, due to a contract extension following delays in obtaining
drilling data and with Olkaria II Unit 3 construction. In the distribution component, prices for
aluminum and copper almost doubled between 2004 and 2008, increasing the world prices of
electrical goods, such as conductors and transformers. New funding from the AF of US$80
million and reallocations, which were approved by the Bank’s Board in February 2009, addressed
these shortfalls. In addition to the AF, four reallocations were undertaken to meet changing
circumstances before project closing. The reallocations are summarized in Annex 11.



1
  IDA AF was not proposed to meet the increased costs of the third unit at the Olkaria II plant. At the time
of the AF in 2009, about US$21 million of the original financing of the costs at appraisal of US$54.93
million (US$24 million IDA; US$24 million EIB; US$6.93 million KenGen) had been disbursed. The AF
required was to be provided by EIB, AFD and KenGen.

                                                                                                               6
2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

17.     The ESRP’s design was based on a series of past Bank engagements in the sector,
together with a solid understanding and background assessment of the reform measures as well as
investment needs. A number of studies, including those supported with funding from the PPIAF,
informed the roadmap for reform measures as well as stakeholder engagement. The Task Team
Leader, who managed preparation and appraisal, had been involved in the sector since the 1990s,
and had identified and supervised the preceding Energy Sector Reform Project, which was
approved in 1997. This preceding operation contributed to first generation reforms, including the
introduction of private-sector participation in power generation, the establishment of the ERB,
and the unbundling of generation from transmission and distribution (T&D). The Bank was
involved in the process through policy dialogue and workshops, which led to the formulation of
key policies for further sector reform that address: the monopolistic structure of the sector and
performance of the main sector entities; the weak legal and regulatory framework; and the
country’s low electricity access rate. The ESRP’s design was fully aligned with the GoK’s long-
term vision and policy framework which addressed the aforementioned issues in the energy sector.

18.     The investment needs and project scope were also evaluated based on a number of studies
and reviews undertaken both by reputable consultants and the Bank. Generation expansion was
considered in the context of the Least-Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP), which, after a
series of reviews on proposed thermal expansion, placed geothermal power as the least-cost
option to meet the anticipated power shortfall at the time. Based on the assessment of least-cost
options, the generation component was changed from the initial proposal at the time of the Project
Concept Note, which was the conversion of two 30-MW gas turbines at Kipevu to combined-
cycle operation, to a 35-MW geothermal power plant installation at Olkaria. The available
information on geothermal resources at the time was based on the basic design by the engineering
consultant, who worked on the first two units at the Olkaria II site. The distribution component
was based on the feasibility studies for distribution reinforcement and upgrade, as well as for the
upgrade of the SCADA/EMS system.

19.     The ESRP took into account lessons from past operations and knowledge available at the
time. Project design also factored in the perception of the sector by private investors. For this
reason, the ESRP (1) pursued a gradual, yet comprehensive, policy reform addressing the legal
and regulatory environment as well as utilities’ performance; (2) emphasized increased autonomy
for the regulator; and (3) supported the establishment of a public, special-purpose, geothermal
company to address upfront geothermal resource risks. The government was strongly committed
to undertake ambitious and complex reform measures. Hence, the comprehensive package—
consisting of institutional and capacity building, studies and engineering services, geothermal
power plant extension, and distribution upgrading—was expected to address the main sector
challenges.

20.     The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified improvement in KPLC’s management
capacity and maintenance of cost-recovering retail tariffs as high risks. With hindsight,
maintaining the performance of KPLC over a longer period could have been given more emphasis,
in view of the deterioration in KPLC’s operational performance observed around FY2011, with

                                                                                                 7
increases in system losses. The delays encountered, particularly in procuring and implementing
the generation and distribution components, suggest that the risks of project implementation
delays and inefficient handling of procurement and contract administration were, in fact, “high”
rather than “medium” risks.

2.2     Implementation

21.     As described in Section 3 of this report, the ESRP achieved most of the ambitious
objectives that were initially set, and in some instances even exceeded them. Key factors that
affected project implementation are summarized below.

22.      Complexity of the Reform and Enabling Factors. The GoK, with the Bank’s support,
embarked on ambitious sector and institutional reforms under the ESRP. These reforms included
complex measures, such as enacting the Energy Act, and establishing and strengthening new
institutions. Notwithstanding these complexities and some delays encountered, the reform
measures were largely achieved during the project’s life. The ESRP had most of the elements
needed to make reform a success: country commitment to implement the reform was strong;
broad-based ownership and stakeholders’ buy-ins were undertaken through ad hoc consultations,
especially inviting private-sector representatives; strong local champions were present; a clear
road map was prepared under the National Energy Policy and the Energy Act; early gains were
achieved, including the adoption of the energy policy and the management services contract
(MSC) for KPLC; sustaining early success at reform was supported with relevant key studies
under the project; and appropriately tailored instruments, such as investment lending and partial
risk guarantees (PRGs) were used to follow up. The Bank also had been working closely with
local champions for long-term sector reform under the previous reform project, and had a good
understanding of the country’s political and economic context.2

23.      Price Volatility. Major increases in international prices of input materials between the
time of project appraisal in 2004 and the time of contract awards affected financing gaps
significantly. Prior to the AF operation in 2009, the pressing issue was the impending cost
overrun: major increases in international prices of materials, such as aluminum and copper, as
well as high demand for turbines, contributed to rising costs and to the financing gap in both the
generation and the distribution components. Moreover, there were not many bidders for the
investment components, often resulting in higher costs and cost overruns. For this reason, the
additional financing was prepared in discussion with the GoK and the implementing agencies,
and in collaboration with other development partners. However, after the global recession of
2008/09, the inflationary pressures on foreign goods eased to some extent, and responses to
public procurement became more competitive, which led to overestimation of contract prices,
especially for the distribution contracts tendered after 2009. This, in turn, led to cost savings for
foreign currency components. Several reallocations took place to help utilize these funds,
including burying and reinforcing distribution lines in Mombasa and purchasing additional
equipment, such as transformers and conductors.

                                                                                                        8
24.      Political Transitions. The life of the ESRP coincided with two general elections in 2007
and 2013, and the promulgation of the new constitution in 2010. Post-election turbulence in
January 2008, which followed the General Elections of December 2007, affected the project in
several ways: (1) reduced productivity of utilities due to staff absenteeism; (2) reduced electricity
sales revenue and increased nonpayment of bills; (3) triggered force majeure notices by
contractors and subsequent claims for compensation for lost time; (iv) increased the cost of letters
of credit (LOCs) because of a higher risk rating for Kenya; (5) prompted renegotiation of
contracts that led to increased cost and lengthy processes of negotiation of additional financing
from co-financiers, including new security arrangements; (6) led to travel advisories for
consultants and contractors for some nationalities that may have caused delays; and (7)
heightened risk perception of the country for international investors. In contrast, the period
leading up to and following the general elections in March 2013 was relatively peaceful. In the
process, key officials of sector entities were changed during the transition. However, sector
entities continued their activities and, after delays, a tariff review was undertaken in December
2013, which demonstrated the continuity and robustness of the reform.

25.      Procurement Capacity. While MoE and KenGen had previous experience managing
Bank projects, KPLC had not played a major part in Bank projects previously. The ESRP
incorporated measures to strengthen the project implementation teams (PITs), including
recruitment of consultants and engineering consultants, and provision of specialized training
activities for key personnel. Despite these measures, the PITs’ capacity to manage procurement
and contracts often remained inadequate, which contributed to delays in the management of
various key studies, handling of procurement for the generation and distribution components, and
the management of the distribution contracts. For example:
    • In the case of MoE’s PIT, implementation was hampered by interference of other
         organizational demands with the PIT’s day-to-day operations; turnover of staff,
         especially financial management staff; and time-consuming steps for clearance.
    • In the case of KenGen, attracting talent to the PIT from other departments was difficult,
         as reorganization was concurrently taking place. Opening of LOCs slowed down, in part
         due to the time-consuming nature of interdepartmental interactions and coordination.
    • KPLC’s performance, which was a focus of the project, significantly improved as a result
         of the MSC that was implemented in FY2007–08, with achievement of five out of seven
         performance indicators. The organization as a whole went through a major turnaround.
         However, the duration of the MSC was too short to trickle down to levels below middle
         managers and fully sustain the impact; though it removed a culture of non-performance
         that was prevailing before the project, it did not fully instill a culture of performance.
         Moreover, unfamiliarity with Bank procedures and weak coordination with other
         departments slowed down project implementation.

26.      Contract Packaging. Partly reflecting concern about the entities’ capacity to handle
complex procurement, the packaging of contracts tended to be consolidated crudely across
differing activities (e.g., civil works, steam field development, and electromechanical works for
the geothermal EPC contract) or geographical areas (e.g., distribution contracts, each covering
dispersed areas). Although the packaging of contracts saved transaction costs for the
implementing agencies, as it transferred part of the implementation risks to prospective
contractors, it may have either limited the number of responses to a tender (since some

                                                                                                   9
prospective bidders were not interested in civil works contracts as in case for the generation
component) or slowed down implementation (since contractors were logistically challenged as in
the case of the distribution contracts).

27.      Procurement Clearance. Several large, complex contracts funded under the ESRP,
including the generation component and some distribution contracts, required clearance by the
Regional Procurement Manager and the Operational Procurement Review Committee (OPRC). A
key consideration for the Bank regarding these contracts was to ensure adequate bid competition.
As commonly experienced across the Bank3 when the level of clearance is raised, it added to the
lengthy process of approvals during prior review. In the case of geothermal generation EPC
procurement, the procurement method was changed when only two companies responded to the
initial request for prequalification -from international competitive bidding (ICB) with pre-
qualification to ICB with post-qualification; KenGen was also advised to contact those companies
that did not respond. In a couple of instances, the Bank team hired independent consultants to
conduct additional investigations before making any decisions. As mentioned earlier, this lengthy
process was compounded further by the inadequate capacity of PITs to handle complex
procurement and prepare the corresponding documents. For example, it took four and nine
months, respectively, for the prequalification report and the negotiated contract for the generation
component to be cleared, following several rounds of iterations with KenGen and within the Bank.
The specific case of the geothermal EPC procurement process is discussed in detail in Annex 3.

28.      The Bank team responded to changing circumstances and challenges by regularly
meeting with senior officials and, when necessary, flexibly adjusting reform milestones while
ensuring these activities were on track. When the funding gap was identified, the team
restructured the ESRP and provided additional financing in 2009 to accommodate price increases
in the generation and distribution components, in collaboration with other development partners.
Cost savings were utilized to help ensure PDOs were met through five project restructurings and
reallocations across categories. The team facilitated various clinics and provided on-the-spot
advice to PITs for fiduciary management. In cases where the auditor’s opinions were qualified or
provided a disclaimer of opinion report for MoE, the Bank conducted an in-depth assessment of
the issues and agreed on an action plan to strengthen MoE’s capacity.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

29.     M&E Design. The M&E system was designed to monitor the performance of the three
implementing agencies at two levels: project and corporate. At the project level, KPLC would
monitor its Corporate Recovery Program (CRP) and the distribution component; MoE would
monitor its capacity building and regulatory subcomponents; and KenGen would monitor its
capacity building and the generation subcomponent. At the corporate level, the three agencies
would monitor their performance contracts as agreed with the GoK. In addition, eight legal
covenants with the GoK were closely linked to the policy reform agenda.

                                                                                                   10
30.      M&E Implementation. The agencies reported quarterly on the seven indicators that
measured their performance on policy, institutional, and regulatory reforms; generation capacity;
and access to reliable electricity. Their individual progress reports were combined into one
quarterly progress report by MoE for submission to the Bank. The progress reports comprised
detailed tables on the status of contracts, implementation schedules, and procurement plans. The
Bank and the implementing agencies regularly took stock of the compliance status with the
covenants on key sector reform measures. During the additional financing and project
restructuring, the outcome indicators were streamlined to five indicators capturing results on the
policy and the access dimensions.

31.      Furthermore, the eight policy covenants were used to monitor project implementation
progress: (1) award of management services contract before disbursement; (2) implementation of
customer connection policy before disbursement; (3) submission of the proposed Energy Act; (4)
establishment of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC); (5) preparation and adoption of
secondary legislation for the Energy Act; (6) conclusion of PPAs between KPLC and KenGen;
(7) adoption of revised retail tariff structures; and (8) establishment of separate T&D units within
KPLC. As six out of eight covenants had been met at the time of the additional financing, the
remaining two covenants-pertaining to the PPAs and the secondary legislation- were carried over
to the additional financing operation. At the time of project closing, all of the covenants were met,
except for the one on secondary legislation, because of delays in legal drafting and additional
requirements that were later introduced by the Attorney General’s office. However, drafting of all
the relevant legislation was completed before project closing, and only the gazetting process is
pending. Moreover, the Energy Act has been enforced, and the sector institutions are operational.

32.       M&E Utilization. After the 2009 additional financing, revised indicators were used to
track project implementation. The reports allowed the GoK and the Bank to oversee KPLC’s CRP
and performance contracts, modify the ESRP and provide the additional financing for additional
studies and connections, and address the financing gap. There were covenants for KPLC and
KenGen to maintain their financial viability, including current ratios, debt-service coverage ratios,
self-financing ratios, and number of days in accounts receivables (for KPLC only). Both KPLC
and KenGen were in breach of some of the financial ratio covenants in their respective project
agreements in FY2012 and FY2013. KenGen obtained approval in December 2013 from its
shareholders to increase the company’s authorized share capital. The injection of additional
equity is expected to generate revenue for KenGen’s capital expansion program and to restore the
self-financing ratio. Following the approval and gazetting of the new retail tariffs (Schedule of
Tariffs 2013) by ERC that have been applied from December 1, 2013, KPLC has submitted
financial projections for the three-year tariff period and confirmed in writing that the approved
retail tariffs will enable it to meet the targets for financial covenants (self-financing, debt service
coverage ratio, and current ratio) in the Kenya Electricity Expansion Project (KEEP) project
agreement in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016.


2.4     Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

33.    Safeguards. The ESRP followed and complied with all the safeguards’ policies and
procedures. It was rated B, triggering safeguard policies for environmental assessment
(OP/BP/GP 4.01) and involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). The potential impact was analyzed

                                                                                                   11
in ESIAs, and mitigation was addressed in the Environmental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP) and Resettlement Policy Framework. In addition, KPLC prepared a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) and environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the distribution component—
overhead lines and substations.

    •   RAP. The mitigation provisions in the RAP have been invoked only for the 66-kV
        transmission line from Nairobi North Substation to Westland. Commencing in August
        2011, KPLC paid compensation to 113 eligible owners of structures/houses along the
        right of way for this transmission line, in accordance with the RAP. The project-affected
        people (PAPs) who suffered loss of land, crops, trees, structures, or dwellings were
        satisfied with the RAP implementation and payments, which was witnessed by the Chief
        of the Karura location, whose office had verified ownership and maintained the census
        list of PAPs.
    •   ESMP. The ESMP mitigation measures for the Olkaria II geothermal plant included
        injecting cooling water below the water level, mitigating the effect on wildlife by re-
        routing pipelines to avoid wildlife corridors, and providing water troughs for wildlife.
        Experts determined that the amount of water drawn from Lake Naivasha for drilling and
        cooling was inconsequential, compared with that used by the neighboring flower farms.
        Moreover, most of the water drawn will be recycled after removal of brine, toxics, and
        non-biodegradable substances, which were encased in concrete and buried.

34.      Lavington Substation Case. Apart from the Lavington Substation case briefly described
here, in which the Inspection Panel did not recommend an investigation, there were no major
safeguards issues encountered during project implementation. On May 10, 2012, the Inspection
Panel received a Request for an inspection relating to the ESRP, which was sent by an individual
on behalf of the Njumbi Road Residents’ Association. The requesters were concerned about the
construction of an electric power substation located in Lavington, Nairobi, which was being
financed under the ESRP’s distribution component. The Inspection Panel registered the Request
for Inspection on May 24, 2012. On June 25, 2012, the Bank’s management team submitted its
Response to the Request for Inspection, along with several recommended measures to mitigate
the potential impact of the construction. On July 25, 2012, the panel submitted its Report and
Recommendation on the case, which did not recommend an investigation. Parallel to and before
the Inspection Panel process, on January 21, 2011, the residents had filed an appeal to the
National Environment Tribunal (NET) against the National Environment Management Authority
(NEMA) and KPLC for licensing and constructing the substation. After delay, on March 1, 2013,
NET issued a ruling that “the EIA licence dated 24th February 2011 issued by NEMA to the 2nd
Respondent [KPLC] is cancelled and the approval of the development in question dated 30th
December 2010 is revoked” and directed “the 2nd Respondent [KPLC] to relocate its power sub-
station to a suitable location and in the process, comply with all applicable laws and regulations.”
KPLC filed an appeal against the ruling by NET to the High Court on April 2, 2013. Even though
KPLC agreed with the Bank’s recommendations to implement additional, enhanced mitigation
measures, they could not be implemented, as the court process was still ongoing at the time of
project closing. The Lavington substation was left incomplete. Once the ruling is issued, KPLC
will handle the case appropriately and, if needed, utilize its own resources for completion of the
substation.



                                                                                                 12
35.      Kenya Olkaria II (Unit Three) Geothermal Expansion—Carbon Finance. The
ESRP’s carbon finance (CF) component was designed in 2006 and implemented under the Kenya
KenGen Carbon Finance Umbrella Project (KKCFUP). The CF component aimed at reducing
carbon emissions by generating additional geothermal energy at the existing Olkaria II
geothermal plant (Unit Three), displacing electricity that would otherwise be generated by fossil
fuel-based power plants equivalent to about 149,632 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) a
year (as per the Clean Development Mechanism Project Design Document, registered with the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] in December 2010). An
Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) was signed by KenGen and the Community
Development Carbon Fund (CDCF) on November 14, 2006, for an estimated total purchase
volume of 900,000 tCO2e. The ERPA purchase volume was subsequently adjusted to 478,533
tCO2e, to reflect the actual purchase volume at project commissioning date and the UNFCCC
registration date.

36.     Part of the carbon revenues received from the CDCF was earmarked under the ERPA to
implement a Community Benefits Plan (CBP). The CBP was prepared by KenGen in consultation
with poor communities living in the vicinity of the CF project. In June 2011, KenGen disbursed
an advance payment of US$225,000 to jump start the implementation of the CBP. As of
December 2013, the CBP has provided for the construction of six classrooms at two local primary
schools (ongoing), a water supply line (completed), and a livestock water pan (completed), which
are expected to benefit 450 pupils, 20,000 local inhabitants, and 40,000 livestock respectively.
The KKCFUP’s Implementation Completion and Result (ICR) Report is attached as Annex 11.

37.     Financial Management. Compliance with fiduciary controls for financial management
(FM) by KenGen and KPLC was satisfactory throughout the ESRP. However, MoE’s FM was
only moderately satisfactory for most of 2011 and 2012, with both financial statements given
qualified opinions by the auditor. In 2011, this was due in part to rotation of accounting staff in
MoE. In response, the Bank’s FM specialist provided FM training for MoE’s accountants in early
2011, which was followed by an in-depth review of MoE’s FM in September 2011. KKCFUP’s
ICR also revealed areas of persistent internal control weaknesses. In 2012, an FM action plan was
prepared by MoE with inputs from the Bank to address these control issues, and the Bank
supported the hiring of FM specialists at MoE in July 2013 before the ESRP’s closing, with a
view to improve FM capacity for the KEEP.

38.     The processing of disbursements was often delayed. Even though the standard
operational procedures assume three working days each for processing withdrawal applications
by the implementing agencies (MoE, ERC, KenGen, and KPLC), the process frequently took
more than a month. This was due to (1) frequent absence of signatory officers, (2) numerous units
involved in the clearance process, and (3) lack of standardization or clarity in information
required for clearance. For example, for clearance within MoE, six stages are needed (fund
manager, examiner, chief accountant, internal audit, cashier, and the MoE internal External
Resources Department [ERD]). In the case of MoE, the accounts controller, ERD disbursement,
and World Bank office are all involved in the process. The implementing agencies were subject to
numerous information requests from the Ministries of Finance and Energy that were not always
standardized.




                                                                                                13
39.     Procurement. During the ESRP’s implementation, the initial 2004 procurement plan was
regularly updated. Although ESRP procurement complied with Bank requirements, it was often
delayed. Adherence to procurement plans for the distribution component by KPLC slowed in
early 2012. In response, KPLC added engineers and accountants in the implementation unit,
which expedited work. Procurement in general and contract management, in particular by KPLC,
was moderately satisfactory in 2012 and 2013. The difficult procurement process, involving
KenGen, for the geothermal generation EPC contract is described in Annex 3.

2.5       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40.    The institutional and regulatory reform measures supported under the ESRP, as well as
investment in power generation and distribution, continued to be supported by the GoK, utilities,
Bank, development partners, and the private sector. The entities established as part of, or in
conjunction with, the ESRP (ERC, Kenya Electricity Transmission Company [KETRACO],
Geothermal Development Company [GDC], and REA) are carrying out their respective sector
mandates.

41.     Building on the achievements of the ESRP—including strengthened institutional and
regulatory frameworks for private-sector participation in the sector, viable utilities, and expanded
annual connection targets—the Bank, in its March 2010 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS),
continued supporting mobilization of concessional and private sector financing, expansion of
generation preferably of renewables and IPPs, as well as, of transmission and distribution, and the
ambitious on- and off-grid connection targets. In May 2010, in line with the CPS, the Bank Board
approved the KEEP—co-financed by AFD, EIB, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),
and German Development Bank (KfW)—with PDOs of increasing the capacity, efficiency, and
quality of electricity supply, and expanding access to electricity in urban, peri-urban and rural
areas. Hence, the approach adopted in the ESRP is being replicated and scaled up in the KEEP.

42.     The private-sector perception of the Kenyan energy sector improved considerably. In
February 2012, the Bank Board approved the Private Sector Power Generation Support Project,
which aimed to increase electricity generation through IPPs in Kenya. The project provided PRGs
for four IPPs, facilitating private investment in thermal and geothermal power generation. The
Eastern Electricity Highway Project, approved in July 2012, supports regional integration and
cross-border trade of electricity implemented by KETRACO, which was established based on the
study supported under the ESRP. In summary, these projects build on and extend the measures
carried out under the ESRP.

43.       Several challenges remain that call for post-completion operations:

      •   First, there is a continued need to clarify the roles and functions of the new entities
          established, continue to develop technical and institutional capabilities, and support their
          activities. This includes delineation of roles to remove conflict, regulatory affairs,
          financial strategies in public-sector entities, system operations of the national grid,
          development of geothermal resources, and rural electrification.

      •   Second, the ESRP supported creating an environment conducive for private investment.
          With an increase in successful financial closures of IPPs, the need for a significant

                                                                                                   14
          volume of investment in the sector, and emphasis on value-for-money of public services
          through public-private partnerships, there is a need to coordinate investment with the
          LCPDP, and to refine and establish procedures for soliciting and concluding private-
          sector transactions.

      •   Third, the reliability of electricity supply is one of the main infrastructure bottlenecks
          affecting Kenyan enterprises. The ESRP did not achieve the system losses targets, in part
          because of the delays in investments in T&D rehabilitation, and the GoK’s aggressive
          expansion of the electricity network to rural areas, which was not anticipated. Hence,
          there is a need to ensure funding for expansion of access to electricity in rural areas on a
          sustainable basis.


3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

44.      The ESRP’s development objectives, design, and implementation remain highly relevant
to the government’s development priorities, which are reflected in the Bank’s CPS for Kenya.

45.     The GoK’s long-term strategy—“Vision 2030”—includes expanding infrastructure
access as a key element in achieving a higher level of economic growth and the middle-income
country status by 2030. The Medium-Term Plan (MTP) and MTP-2 to implement the 2008–12
and 2013–18 phases of the Vision 2030 strategy, respectively, call for, among others, expanding
access to electricity. In an effort to improve equity, the strategy, include access of the rural and
urban poor to electricity. The Electricity Access Investment Prospectus 2009–14 supports
geothermal generation expansion, expanding the transmission network and substations, and
extending distribution to urban and peri-urban areas, including urban slums and rural areas. IDA
is supporting the prospectus through the ongoing KEEP, which continues to advance the reforms
and investment embarked on under the ESRP (and even earlier with the Energy Sector Reform
Project in 1997). The approach taken was effective in advancing the reforms and implementing
necessary investment to achieve the goals in the energy sector.

46.      Given the current and future GoK and Bank strategies for the sector, the objectives of the
ESRP in 2004 to improve policies, regulation, and institutions, as well as expand geothermal
generation capacity and access to reliable electricity, were, and continue to be, relevant at project
closing and beyond. In addition, the ESRP’s design, building on IDA’s long-term involvement in
the sector, its leadership in sector reform, and its capacity to collaborate with development
partners and integrate lessons learned, resulted in a project that, despite procurement difficulties
and cost escalations, helped establish a viable policy and regulatory environment for expansion of
electricity generation, transmission, and distribution; reduced losses and improved quality of
electricity; and greatly expanded access. Consequently, the relevance of the project development
objectives is rated high.

47.    The modification of the PDOs and indicators and the additional financing carried out in
2009 represented a Level One project restructuring. Therefore, the achievement of the PDOs
needs to be assessed both at the time of project restructuring and project closing. The
achievement status of the PDO indicators is summarized in Table 1.

At Project Restructuring

48.      At the 2009 restructuring, approximately four years after project effectiveness, most of
the activities for enhancing the policy, institutional, and regulatory environment were either
achieved or on track. The institutional and regulatory framework was in place and implemented,
new institutions were established, a cost-recovery tariff was introduced in 2008, and KPLC’s
performance had improved significantly. However, physical investments in the generation and
distribution components were lagging behind. Work at Olkaria II was about 25 percent complete
at the time of project restructuring. The number of new connections in the distribution network
was 60 percent along: i.e. 240,000 connections versus the initial target of 400,000 by FY2009.

49.     With the achievement of only one of the three original PDOs and disbursement of the
original IDA credit at 26 percent (only 15 percent, if the additional financing is included) 4 in
2009, the achievement of the PDOs at project restructuring is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
However, it was for these considerations that the project was restructured.

At Project Completion

50.     In contrast, by the project closing in November 2013, the investment activities under the
generation and distribution components caught up with the policy reforms, and the project had
achieved—or had exceeded in some cases—most of the five PDO targets:

(1) The Energy Act was enacted in 2006, and drafting of all the relevant legislation was
completed before the project closing. Even though the gazetting process was pending at the time
of project closing, this did not affect the act’s enforcement significantly, as it was implemented
through the sector institutions established. Moreover, the new government that assumed office in
2013 is in the process of amending the act, which makes the secondary legislation less relevant.

(2) The number of IPPs increased from three in 2004 to seven at project closing. Even though this
falls short of eight as initially targeted, the three IPP plants that were under construction at project
closing are expected to be online in 2014.

(3) The target on dispute resolution has been largely met, as ERC has managed to resolve all
disputes brought before it. The target fell short in some years, as some complaints were filed
toward the end of the reporting period.




4
  Disbursements of the EIB, AFD, and NDF loans were, respectively 15, 80, and 60 percent. However, it is
difficult to attribute the achievement in 2009 to the source of financing, and the IDA disbursement will be
used for weighting the ratings.

                                                                                                        17
(4) The number of households connected to electricity under the project is 526,000, exceeding the
original target of 400,000 by 17 percent.

(5) The number of monthly interruptions per 100 km for 66-kV and 33-kV lines was reduced
from 4.7 to below 2.0 in FY2010–12; improvement in the quality of electricity supply was also
observed. Even though the number of interruptions increased to 2.9 a year later in FY2013 and
fell short of the target of 2.0, it is expected to improve again with distribution reinforcement
measures being undertaken.

51.      With the reform measures implemented and the expansion in the generation and
distribution network, the sector’s performance has improved significantly. The reform of the
electricity sector in Kenya has progressed much farther than reform programs in most other Sub-
Saharan African countries. The elimination of the government’s monopoly on the power industry
has progressed with KenGen and KPLC listed in the Nairobi Stock Exchange and operating on a
quasi-commercial basis. Private investment has become vibrant in the sector. As a result, the
number of operational IPPs has increased steadily. With 19 IPPs licensed, including the seven
IPPs already operational at the time of project completion, the trend of increased private-sector
participation is expected to continue. Kenya has the most advanced geothermal subsector in
Africa. In 2013, installed geothermal power generation capacity was 215 MW which places the
country’s subsector as ninth largest in the world. The Olkaria II Unit 3 has been operating
satisfactorily close to the rated output since its commissioning in May 2010. KPLC, which was
constantly realizing losses before the project, is now making profits to sustain its investment and
operations. The company has connected 200,000–300,000 households per year since 2010,
compared with the slow pace of 20,000–50,000 connections per year that prevailed before the
project.

52.      The ESRP’s main shortcoming was in meeting the necessary quality and reliability of the
electricity network, and the sustainability of KPLC’s improved performance. The reduction in
system losses that was on track until 2010 deteriorated, due to the government’s aggressive
expansion of the national grid into rural areas, which was introduced after the project, as well as
to delays with transmission network reinforcement implemented outside the project. Moreover,
sustaining KPLC’s improved performance will still require further improvement in its corporate
governance. These issues are being addressed in subsequent operations. Overall, with substantial
achievement of the PDOs, a disbursement of more than 93 percent, and with only moderate
shortcomings, the achievement of the PDOs at project closing is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.3     Efficiency

53.      Based on the same methodologies used with updated assumptions, reevaluation of the
cost-benefit analyses undertaken at the time of both appraisal and additional financing reveals
that the project’s efficiency remains substantial and is justified economically.

54.      For the geothermal generation component, the reevaluated economic internal rate of
return (EIRR) at the time of project completion is 22 percent, with a net present value (NPV) of
US$53.8 million (Table 1), despite the project delays and cost increases. The EIRR is largely
attributable to the level of electricity tariffs that increased more than what was assumed in the

                                                                                                18
previous two analyses. The estimated life-cycle cost of the plant remains at US$0.077 per
kilowatt-hour, which suggests its comparative cost advantage over other generation options is
sound.

55.     For the distribution component, the reevaluated EIRR at the time of project closing is 32
percent, with an NPV of US$120.8 million (Table 2). This result suggests that the economic
rationale for the distribution upgrading remains sound, even when applying conservatively

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

56.      The project’s objectives, design, and implementation are still highly relevant in the
current sector issues and government priorities. Most of the indicators achieved or exceeded the
targets, though the network reliability target was not fully met. Through the project, the electricity
sector has become one of the best performing sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to
catalyzing other development partners’ financing, investors’ perception has improved
substantially as a result of the project, which has led to increased private investment in the sector.
As mentioned above, the targets on the quality and reliability of electricity supply fell short due to
some unforeseen expansion into rural areas and delayed reinforcement of the transmission
network, both outside the project. However, these are considered as moderate shortcomings in the
context of the project’s achievement of its objectives, its efficiency, and its impacts that go well
beyond the project. Therefore, the overall outcome rating is rated moderately satisfactory, based
on the calculations in Table 3.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

57.      While there are no beneficiary surveys to substantiate poverty or social impact, incidental
evidence suggests that the urban and rural poor consider electricity access as an improvement in
the quality of life by facilitating students’ study at night, providing security through street
lighting, and permitting small businesses to stay open longer to serve clients. KPLC’s customer
satisfaction survey, which has been conducted periodically since FY2009, suggests that there has
been a steady improvement in the overall satisfaction index: 5 64 percent in FY2009, 65 percent in
FY2010, 70 percent in FY2011, and FY2012, and 72 percent in FY2013. However, connection
charges and electricity tariffs are still very high for the poor, and subsidies and cross-subsidies are
not targeted well to those in need. Businesses benefit from access to electricity, but also note the
frequent outages and costs.


(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

58.      As noted in the GoK’s Vision 2030 and the Bank’s CPS, the ESRP has helped create a
viable policy and regulatory environment and an unbundled sector with viable electricity
generation, transmission, and distribution companies. It has also supported the establishment of a
public company dedicated to development of upstream geothermal resources. Provision of
specialized training helped improve the companies’ technical and institutional capabilities. The
partial privatization of KenGen and KPLC and their listing on the Nairobi Stock Exchange have
enhanced their disclosure of corporate information for market scrutiny, which has increased their
ability to raise capital.


(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)

59.     The rigorous process involved during the NET and the Inspection Panel case regarding
construction of the Lavington substation strengthened KPLC’s awareness and preparedness for
conducting environmental and social safeguard measures thoroughly. Heightened standards are
applied to activities implemented by KPLC, even when the Bank is not directly involved. Some
of the measures are as follows:

•     Any notice for requests for zoning changes, or potential purchases of land for residential
      areas, is communicated in writing to all PAPs, those in the vicinity of the proposed
      substation, with particular emphasis on PAPs in residential areas.



5
 The overall satisfaction index is constructed by converting 10-point scale responses to a number of
questions that capture customers’ satisfaction with KPLC into a percentage scale, and taking the average.

                                                                                                        20
•     Transparent and interactive consultations are held with all PAPs. Adequate notice is provided
      for these consultations, and they are documented in the final Environmental Management
      Plans.
•     KPLC intensifies efforts to ensure that noise regulations (Kenya's are stricter than those
      suggested by the Bank Group Performance Standards) and fire safety protection measures
      (fire walls, siting of generators) are monitored and enforced during construction and
      operation.
•     KPLC intensifies efforts to ensure that landscaping around potential substation sites
      minimizes their aesthetic impact.

60.       Not applicable.

4.        Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

61.     The major risks to the development outcomes concern the sustainability of the reform
measures undertaken, including (1) weak sector governance that does not yet allow the utilities to
be managed and operated on sound commercial principles; (2) irregular and insufficient
adjustment of tariffs, due to lack of acceptance by consumers and political interventions, which
could jeopardize the financial viability of the utilities; (3) incoherent sector and system planning
and inadequate coordination of prospective investment with the LCPDP to meet the country’s
energy and technology requirements; (4) increases in the cost of connections and failure to put in
place a sustainable mechanism for funding new connections through subsidized funding; (5)
inadequate investment in the distribution system to meet increased access to electricity; and (6)
inadequate capacity of the government and utilities.

5.        Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1       Bank Performance
(a)       Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

62.      The Bank team that identified and appraised the ESRP had the required expertise as well
as knowledge of the energy sector in Kenya to ensure quality at entry. It also benefited from the
preceding energy sector operation. While no independent quality at entry assessment was
undertaken by the Quality Assurance Group to confirm this assessment, the project was in line
with the GoK and IDA strategies for the sector, took into account lessons learned, and made it
possible to mobilize co-financing from three development partners—AFD, EIB, and NDF. The
team ensured that the GoK allocated funds not only for the expansion of generation and
distribution, but also for policy, regulatory, and institutional development activities without which
the expansion objectives would not have been possible. The long-term engagement with the
clients; persistence with making the reform happen; provision of necessary inputs, including
analytical work and convening of consensus-building workshops; and in-depth knowledge of the

                                                                                                  21
political economy surrounding the reform helped the team navigate the initial phases of reform.
With hindsight, packaging of the geothermal EPC contract may have excluded some prospective
bidders, limiting competition, and later leading to delays in implementation. However, it would
have been difficult to foresee this at the time of the project design, especially given that the
contract was designed based on the previous project’s experience and on recommendations by the
consultant employed by KenGen. Overall, Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated
satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.      The task team’s attentive project supervision was instrumental in keeping the project’s
implementation on track. The team held implementation support missions regularly, kept track of
project implementation, and proactively addressed issues identified, which contributed to the
substantial achievement of PDOs. When a funding gap was identified, the Bank engaged with
clients and development partners, and provided the additional financing needed to enhance
project activities. The team was persistent and patient in following the reform processes and was
flexible in adjusting milestones as needed. Additional inputs and support were provided based on
regular discussion and requests from the government, including the study to establish KETRACO,
a biogas consultancy, and a number of feasibility studies. Extension of the project closing date as
part of project restructuring and frequent reallocations of credit proceeds also reflected the Bank’s
flexibility in responding to changing circumstances.

64.     At the same time, implementation was hampered by slow procurement and disbursement,
most notably in the generation and distribution components. While some of the issues were
outside the control of the task team—such as the worldwide inflation of input materials and
turbines increasing the price of geothermal turbines, and the time-consuming process involving
OPRC—the failure to find a pragmatic solution for the procurement process for the EPC contract,
which led to a three-year delay, was a Bank institutional shortcoming that adversely affected the
implementation of a key project component. The GoK’s ICR mentions the difficulties in sorting
out procurement issues efficiently and agreeing on the appropriate procurement procedures to
follow in the case of multiple financiers for the same contract. Nevertheless, the plant achieved
the target after its commissioning, and the component was still economical at project closing.
With these moderate shortcomings, Bank supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.      The Bank’s long-term engagement throughout the reform process and its persistence
were instrumental in achieving the ambitious reform goals. The team flexibly responded to the
need for additional financing and change of scope. While the generation component achieved its
objective, delays in the procurement of the EPC contract have adversely affected subsequent
client relations. Even though the delays were due to a number of factors, some outside the control
of the Bank, they were compounded by the Bank’s failure to find a pragmatic and timely solution
to address the issue. For this reason, more weight in the rating is given to this aspect during
project implementation; hence, overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

                                                                                                 22
5.2     Borrower Performance
(a)     Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.      The governments that came into power in 2002 and 2007 were both strongly committed
to the policy of providing reliable electricity to the people and businesses to improve their quality
of life and to lower the cost of doing business. It is remarkable that the bold decisions in
implementing the ambitious sector reform were made and sustained throughout the process. By
approximately 2011, the consistent effort by the government to improve the sector’s governance
and viable utilities had enhanced the sector’s performance. Occasionally, there were difficulties in
getting timely approval and processing by the National Treasury and MoE for counterpart funds
and disbursement, as well as in obtaining approval from local governments for right of way and
access to construction sites. For these moderate shortcomings, the overall government
performance is rated moderately satisfactory.


(b)     Implementing Agency’s or Agencies’ Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.      MoE’s performance was moderately satisfactory. MoE promoted and coordinated the
ambitious reform measures implemented as part of the project. For a period of project
implementation, MoE’s financial statements received qualified opinions from the auditor,
reflecting chronic weaknesses in fiduciary management.

68.      KenGen’s performance was satisfactory, especially once the construction started where
management of the contract led to commissioning of the generation plant in time. However,
before the construction, the low quality of the procurement documents prepared, the considerable
time it took during iterations of the documents, and the delay in opening the LOCs (triggered by
unavailability of funds from other development partners) in part contributed to the delay.

69.     KPLC’s performance was moderately unsatisfactory. The initial outcome targets for
system reliability were not fully achieved, the impact of the MSC was not fully sustained, and
management of distribution contracts and contractors encountered challenges. However, the
company performed well in terms of exceeding the original target of 400,000 additional
connections.
(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.     The GoK and the implementing agencies had a strong commitment to expand electricity
supply and improve its quality in the country from the low levels at the time of appraisal. The
government’s support for the policy and regulatory improvements and for unbundling the sector’s
public companies was effective. While there were some moderate shortcomings noted above, the
borrowers adhered to their performance contracts and implemented the policy, regulatory and



                                                                                                  23
institutional, and generation and distribution components satisfactorily. Therefore, the overall
borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned

71.      Sector Reform. Sustaining sector reforms requires continuous government commitment
through different administrations as well as strong stakeholder engagement. As summarized in
Section 2.2 above, the ESRP benefited from the strong country commitment, broad-based
ownership and stakeholders’ buy-ins, the presence of strong reform champions, a clear road map
embodied in the 2004 National Energy Policy, a combination of quick-wins, various inputs in the
form of studies and workshops, and follow-up investment closely tailored to support reform. The
project was designed in an environment of limited funding availability from development partners
but with a coordinated policy dialogue between partners. Together, these factors enabled the
complex reform process to be successfully implemented in a relatively short period. The choice
of lending instrument i.e. a specific investment loan, was also effective as the investment helped
attain specific sector development goals, while facilitating on-the-job capacity building through
learning by doing. Given that sector reform is a long-term endeavor with many factors outside the
Bank’s control, the following additional aspects need to be taken into consideration to ensure its
sustainability: (1) persistence, patience, and flexibility in adjusting the course; (2) a long-term
approach to succession management in the sector (development of a cadre of next-generation
leaders and managers); (3) improvement of corporate governance of the utilities to ensure that the
reform initiated is institutionalized; (4) standardization of business processes to ensure
institutional memory and to free up time for strategic decision making; and (5) strong engagement
of stakeholders—especially consumers and trade unions.

72.      Geothermal EPC Procurement Process. KenGen and the Bank had fundamentally
different views about the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the procurement method to be
followed. In future, it would be useful to consider the following aspects: (1) agree among project
stakeholders early on to hire independent consultant(s), with experience in geothermal business
and technology, and assess up front the costs, benefits, and risks of the procurement method,
including direct contracting; (2) carefully design the package of EPC contracts so that a particular
way of packaging does not hamper competition, and give consideration also to concerns raised by
prospective bidders, separating out where possible contracts for the geothermal steam field,
power plant, and transmission lines; (3) enhance coordination among co-financiers if joint co-
financing is unavoidable, especially on funding coverage of contract costs as well as conditions
precedent for financing, since opening LOCs entails significant risks and costs for implementing
agencies; and (4) encourage informed risk taking in procurement decision making, taking into
consideration timing factors. In this connection, a Performance Audit Report in the 1990s 6
recommends that “[f]or geothermal projects the Bank needs to be more flexible in its procurement
processes,” mainly in the context of geothermal drilling operations. Based on experience with this
project, this applies to geothermal power generation as well.

73.      Implementation Capacity. Several lessons can be learned from the capacity building
experience with the implementing agencies: (1) continuous engagement with the implementing
agencies makes a difference in project implementation. MoE’s and KenGen’s prior experience
and continued engagement with Bank operations helped ease the launching of the project
activities during the early stages. By comparison, it took longer for KPLC, which had no
substantive prior engagement, to set up the PIT and develop the required technical and project
management capabilities. (2) In addition to fostering the technical and management capabilities
of key officials, training programs turned out to be important tools for the PITs to strengthen
collaboration across organizations. In this sense, continuous capacity building throughout project
implementation was important for improving project performance. (3) KPLC’s MSC was a timely
and effective intervention that helped to turn around the company’s performance. With hindsight,
(a) the duration of the contract could have been longer, (b) the number of experts from outside
(three people) was too small for a large utility, and (c) performance targets could have included
non-technical aspects, such as operational processes and corporate culture, so as to instill a
culture of performance at lower levels and make the reform more sustainable. (4) Turnover of
fiduciary management staff at MoE, whose job rotation is managed by the National Treasury, had
a detrimental impact on the quality of financial reporting. A lesson is that the National Treasury
needs also to be engaged further to ensure continuity in fiduciary management officers.

74.     Other operational lessons include the importance of (1) government intervention
whenever issues arise with local governments (permits, urban planning) or with its own
procedures (tax exemption clearances, delays with numerous clearance for release of funds); (2)
allowing time for land and right-of-way acquisition; (3) retaining a substantial portion of the
contractual amounts for installation to address the often weak capacity of local subcontractors;
and (4) keeping a good record of interactions with stakeholders (including consultations on
environmental and social safeguards and contractual issues with contractors).


7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a)     Borrower/Implementing Agencies

75.      The comments of the GoK and the implementing agencies focus on the difficulties
encountered with Bank procurement procedures (discussed above). The government’s report
(Annex 7) also focuses on achievements, challenges, and lessons learned. The discussion on
achievements is detailed and suggests a level of satisfaction among government agencies with the
results of the ESRP.
(b)     Co-financiers

76.     EIB provided comments on the early draft ICR that covered two aspects of project
implementation: (1) the conclusion of financing agreement between KenGen and co-financiers,
and (2) the procurement challenges of the geothermal EPC contract. The comments are
incorporated in this report and are summarized in Annex 9.

Annex 2. Status of Outputs

Component A: Institutional and Capacity Building.

Original Scope

The planned outputs were (1) implementing a comprehensive CRP for KPLC through
engagement of a management services provider; (2) strengthening the energy sector regulator’s
capacity to review and set power tariffs, prepare secondary legislation, and enforce regulations
under the law; (3) equipping the KEBS with the skills, training, and equipment necessary for
effectively setting and monitoring the standards of petroleum products in the country; (4)
upgrading staff skills in MoE and KenGen; and (5) implementing a management and staff
development program for KPLC.

Outputs

(1) The MSC that KPLC entered into as part of the CRP was in place from June 1, 2006, until
June 30, 2008. It enabled KPLC to greatly increase electricity connections, reduce power system
losses, diminish outages, and lower receivables.

(2) The Energy Act was enacted in 2006, under which ERC and REA were established in 2007.
The organizational structure, staffing, financing, strategic plan, and human resource policy
manual for ERC were prepared and implemented. An MIS was installed, which supports ERC’s
operation and management. As a result of the cost-of-service study, the new and cost-reflective
tariff was introduced in 2008. Moreover, as part of the project, the regulations, codes, procedures,
guidelines, licenses, and permits were developed to be enforced by ERC, including (a) proposals
on draft regulations; (b) pro-forma licenses, license application forms, and permits; (c) model
PPAs for various electricity-generating technologies; (d) and legal and technical audits and
proposals for reviewing the grid code.

(3) The Petroleum Standards Monitoring Unit of KEBS was equipped with laboratory equipment
to enforce its surveillance and testing of petroleum products.

(4) and (5) More than 1,200 staff members from KPLC, KenGen, MoE, ERC, KEBS, REA, and
the Energy Tribunal have been trained in planning, modeling, environmental and social impact,
GIS, procurement, and contract management. Staff members from KenGen, KPLC and MoE were
trained in computer modeling for power system planning in support of updating the LCPDP. On a
small scale, electrical installation contractors were trained in contract management and
environmental and social impact and mitigation.

(13) A transmission master plan was undertaken that identified medium-term (2012–17) and
long-term (2018–30) reinforcements needed to accommodate the existing network development
in Kenya.

(14) Development of an M&E method, which was added at the time of additional financing, was
dropped from the project activity because it was taken up in KEEP.

(15) A sectoral environmental assessment was completed in 2009, which was integral to the
investment prospectus prepared for the sector.

(16) A total of 95 wind masts and data loggers were installed to validate and update the wind atlas
and data collection.

(17) The study on isolated diesel stations was transferred to the Privatization Commission
(dropped from the project activity).

                                                                                             30
Annex 3. Case of the Geothermal Generation EPC Procurement

1.       A difficult procurement process that led to a considerable delay in awarding the turnkey
contract for the extension of the Olkaria II geothermal power plant demonstrates how a series of
decisions led to delays and, in this particular instance, increased cost, and produced a suboptimal
result. The case is presented in a chronological order, highlighting key factors affecting the
process.

2.       ICB versus Direct Contracting. In 2004, KenGen, with a brief analysis of the consultants
hired by KenGen, proposed direct procurement to save time and ensure that the third unit at the
Olkaria II site would be from the same manufacturer as the first two installed units. A preliminary
cost estimate at the time was US$46.0 million for civil works, power plant installation, electrical
works for the switchyard, and civil and mechanical works at the steam field. However, with a
view to ensuring competition, the agreed method of procurement at the outset was an ICB with
prior prequalification. At the time, it was unknown if other prospective bidders could deliver at a
lower cost but, either way, a key consideration was that inviting them would ensure competition
and enhance efficiency. It was thought that there are other potential suppliers who could supply
and install the third unit. Moreover, the project was prepared in the context of the 2004 Country
Assistance Strategy for Kenya that prioritized improving governance as a pillar of the strategy.

3.      Contract Packaging. KenGen also proposed a single turnkey EPC contract, including
civil works, steam-gathering system, steam turbine, generator transformer, switchgear, and cables
and control room panels, to avoid having to manage a large number of contractors, as had been
the case with the two earlier installed units. This was based on the past project experience in
which KenGen encountered difficulties managing numerous separate contracts, causing delays.
The Bank therefore concurred with the proposal.

4.        Market Structure. When the tender process started, there were only two responses to the
initial request for prequalification in August 2005. One of the companies subsequently did not
respond to the invitation to bid, explaining that it would not bid if the contract were packaged as
one EPC contract, as it would give the existing contractor an advantage. The limited response was
due to the market structure of geothermal turbine manufacturing, with only a limited number of
suppliers worldwide, as well as the packaging of the EPC contract mentioned earlier.

5.      Changed Method. While the team proposed to prequalify the two firms, OPRC instructed
the team to change the procurement method so as to undertake an ICB with post-qualification and
also to invite non-prequalified companies. In the meantime, efforts were made to research the
geothermal industry, and solicit opinions from an independent consultant. The consultant
recommended that the team reach out to other potential bidders.

6.       Quality of Documents. The preparation of the bidding documents was delayed by a few
months, due to iterations over the quality of the documents submitted, resolution of a difference
in the fraud and corruption language to be applied to the documents between co-financiers, and
the delayed completion of the Steam Availability Report supported under the ESRP (Olkaria
Geothermal Resources Optimization Study), which was to confirm the geothermal resource
availability. When the bidding documents were distributed in July 2006, despite several rounds of


                                                                                                31
extension of the deadline for submission, only one bid was received, which was the same
company that installed the first two units.

7.       Price Escalation and Additional Financing. In the meantime, the international price of
turbines had soared. KenGen eventually signed the contract with the bidder (a consortium of
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Corporation) in August 2007 at US$87.5 million, a
price considerably higher than the US$53.5 million expected at project appraisal in 2004. As a
result, KenGen applied for additional financing from AFD, which approved a loan of Euro 20
million in December 2007. Following KenGen’s payment of the 10 percent advance payment to
the contractor in September 2007, the contractor started mobilization to the site in December
2007 and began manufacturing equipment.

8.      Post-election Turbulence and Delayed Letters of Credit. However, due to the civil
commotion following the disputed December 2007 general elections, the contractor issued a
notice of force majeure in January 2008 and demobilized. In addition, in February 2008, the
contractor issued a notice of intent to terminate, due to KenGen’s failure to issue the required
LOCs, which was delayed in part because KenGen did not meet the conditions precedent for the
effectiveness of the EIB and AFD financing, including financial security arrangements. Even if
the financing had come in time, however, KenGen would still have had the difficulties in opening
the large value LOC because other co-financiers did not provide the Special Commitment
arrangement that the World Bank did. This arrangement allowed project implementing agencies
to open an internationally acceptable LOCs through their local banks without having to provide
high value collateral that would otherwise be required by their banks. KenGen subsequently
placed the LOCs in February 2008, and the contractor remobilized in March 2008.

9.       Negotiated Settlement. As a consequence of the force majeure and the delay in placing
the LOCs, the contractor submitted change proposals seeking to revise the contract price, time for
completion of works, and amendment of certain conditions of the contract. KenGen then
requested IDA not to object to the renegotiated contract in May 2008. OPRC instructed the task
team to hire an independent consultant to review the contract in September 2008. The case was
finally resolved in February 2009, with the negotiated amounts be treated as the ceiling amounts
and the contractor required to document its actual expenditures for relevant items before final
payments were released. The amended contract amount was US$119.1 million, more than double
the original cost estimate.

10.     Conclusion. KenGen and the Bank had fundamentally different views about the costs,
benefits, and risks associated with the procurement method to be followed. In future, it would be
useful to consider the following aspects: (1) agree among project stakeholders early on to hire
independent consultant(s), with experience in geothermal business and technology, and assess up
front the costs, benefits, and risks of the procurement method, including direct contracting; (2)
carefully design the package of EPC contracts so that a particular way of packaging does not
hamper competition, and give consideration also to concerns raised by prospective bidders,
separating out where possible contracts for the geothermal steam field, power plant, and
transmission lines; (3) enhance coordination among co-financiers if joint co-financing is
unavoidable, especially on funding coverage of contract costs as well as conditions precedent for
financing, since opening LOCs entails significant risks and costs for implementing agencies; and
(4) encourage informed risk taking in procurement decision making, taking into consideration

                                                                                               32
timing factors. In this connection, a Performance Audit Report in the 1990s 7 recommends that
“[f]or geothermal projects the Bank needs to be more flexible in its procurement processes,”
mainly in the context of geothermal drilling operations. Based on experience with this project,
this applies to geothermal power generation as well.

Annex 4. Economic Analysis

Generation Component

1.      Results. The original estimated EIRR in 2004 for the generation component was 19
percent, and the NPV at a 12 percent discount rate was US$25.9 million. The reevaluated EIRR at
the time of additional financing in 2009 was 14 percent and with an NPV of US$20.4 million.
Based on the same methodology described below, the reevaluated EIRR at the time of project
completion is 22 percent with an NPV of US$53.8 million.

 Table A4-1: NPV and EIRR for Generation: 2004(PAD), 2009 (Additional Financing) and
                                    2013 (ICR)

         NPV in US$ million (@12%)              25.9              20.4             53.8

         EIRR (%)                                19                14               22

2.        The revised estimates with updated assumptions produce results higher than those in the
2004 PAD and the 2009 additional financing. This is largely attributed to the level of electricity
tariffs that increased more than what was assumed in the previous two analyses (most of the other
assumptions are similar to the ones adopted in the 2009 analysis). The incremental benefits
arising from the tariff increase more than offset the adverse effects of more than doubling the
originally estimated project costs. This confirms the analysis in 2009 that the economic viability
of the project is particularly sensitive to the retail electricity tariff.

3.      The estimated life-cycle cost of the plant remains at US$0.077/kWh, which suggests its
comparative cost advantage over other generation options is solid. The assumptions used in the
2009 analysis are still valid: capital cost of US$119.1 million, net available capacity of 33 MW,
85 percent load factor, annual fixed operations and maintenance (O&M) cost of US$1.19 million,
steam replenishment cost of US$2 million every five years, and variable cost for consumables of
US$0.0055/kWh.

Economic Reevaluation Methodology

4.        The analysis is carried out over a 15-year horizon with the following assumptions.

     Costs:
     •    Capital costs: The capital costs of the components are based on the actual cost totaling
          US$119.1 million, which reflects the more than doubling of the costs from the time of
          appraisal.
     •    O&M costs: In the absence of the O&M cost data exclusively for the power plant, the
          O&M cost is estimated at 2.5 percent of the total capital costs (the same assumption as in
          2004 and 2009).
     •    Steam replenishment: A steam replenishment cost, estimated at $2 million every five
          years, is applied in accordance with the 2009 assumptions.
     •    Incremental investment in T&D: Incremental investment in T&D is assumed at US$25
          million, and an associated annual O&M cost of about US$1.25 million, to enable the

                                                                                                 34
        delivery of the incremental power to final consumers. These assumptions are in line with
        the 2009 analysis.

   Benefits:
   •    Sales to final consumers: Incremental sales to final consumers were used to calculate the
        benefits. The volume is derived from actual sales starting in 2009, when the unit became
        operational, and with gross generation of 276 GWh projected into the future, adjusted for
        T&D losses reported by KPLC and projected into the future at 17.9 percent, which
        reflects the average of recent T&D losses in the system.
   •    Average electricity tariffs: The average electricity tariffs were used as a proxy for the
        willingness to pay in accordance with the original PAD assumptions. These were derived
        from annual retail tariffs reported in KSh/kWh, converted to US$/kWh at relevant
        average yearly exchange rates and projected into the future at an average retail tariff of
        0.17 US$/kWh, which exceeds the initial PAD assumption of 0.14 US$/kWh.


Distribution Component

5.      Results. For the distribution component, the original estimated EIRR was 30 percent and
the estimated NPV at a 12 percent discount rate was US$246 million. The reevaluated EIRR at
the time of additional financing is 27.4 percent with an NPV of US$31.4 million. Based on a
similar methodology as the one applied to electricity access expansion described below, the
reevaluated EIRR at the time of project closing is 32 percent, with an NPV of US$120.8 million.


Table A4-2: NPV and EIRR for Distribution: 2004(PAD), 2009 (Additional Financing) and
                                    2013 (ICR)
                                              2004              2009             2013

       NPV in US$ million (@12%)              246.0             31.4             120.8

       EIRR (%)                                30                27               32

6.       The result suggests that the economic rationale for the distribution upgrading remains
solid, even when applying conservatively estimated willingness to pay by consumers.


Economic Reevaluation Methodology

7.      This ex-post reevaluation applies a method used for evaluating the electricity access at
the time of additional financing to the distribution component as a whole, because substation-
level data were not available. The analysis is carried out over a 15-year horizon with the
following assumptions.

   Costs:
   •    Capital costs: The capital costs of the components are based on the actual cost of IDA-
        funded distribution contracts totaling US$105.7 million.




                                                                                               35
•   O&M costs: In the absence of the O&M cost data exclusively for the distribution lines,
    the O&M cost is estimated at 10 percent of the total capital costs (the same assumption as
    in 2009).
•   Cost of energy: The cost of incremental energy supply is derived as follows: the average
    consumption level of grid-connected consumers multiplied by the number of incremental
    customers due to the project (i.e., incremental demand), multiplied by average cost of
    grid-connected electricity supply (including capacity payments).
•   T&D Losses: T&D losses are derived from the actual system losses.

Benefits:
•   Consumers’ willingness to pay: The analysis maintained the same willingness-to-pay
    assumption adopted in the 2009 analysis, which was US 22 cents/kWh, as the
    incremental demand started at about the same time. This assumption is based on a survey
    of peri-urban households that took place in preparation of KPLC’s customer connection
    policy in 2006.

                                    DECEMBER 2013
1.0        Executive Summary

1.1     Using the background section from the PAD, the GoK Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) describes the declining economy and services in the 1990s and the increase in
poverty. For the sector, the report discusses the low level of connections, the monopolistic
structure of the sector, the weak policy and regulatory environment, and the GoK’s strategy to
improve the performance of the sector as part of the ERSWEC of March 2004.

1. 2     The PDOs of improving the policy, regulatory, and institutional environment, expanding
generation capacity, expanding electricity distribution, and improving the quality of services
provided are given, along with the indicators for measuring achievement of the PDOs. The 2009
restructuring—dropping the generation PDO and streamlining the indicator—is described next.

1.3     Project Achievements. The detailed list of achievements at closing for the PDOs in the
policy area includes new tariff structure; KenGen initial public offering; promulgation of
regulatory instruments; more than 1,200 staff benefitting from various capacity-building
programs at KPLC, KenGen, MoE, ERC, KEBS, REA, and the Energy Tribunal; a geothermal
reservoir optimization study establishing the feasibility of implementing 280 MW of power
generation in Olkaria; a geothermal business plan study forming the basis of splitting KenGen to
form the Geothermal Development Company in 2009; and preparation and implementation of an
Organizational Structure, Staffing, Financing, Strategic Plan and Human Resource Policy Manual
for ERC.

The list of achievements also incorporated ERC development, implementation, and enforcement
of regulations, codes, procedures, guidelines, licenses, and permits, including proposals on draft
regulations for implementation of the Energy Act; pro-forma licenses, license application forms,
and permits; model PPAs for various electricity-generating technologies; legal and technical
audits and proposals for review of the grid code; development of regulations for downstream
petroleum, electricity tariffs, and regulatory accounts; ERC implementation of MIS; and a study
of the Kenyan electricity supply system that identified medium-term (2012–17) and long-term
(2018–30) reinforcements required as part of the LCPDP for enhancing the KEBS Petroleum
Standards Monitoring Unit’s capacity for monitoring and testing petroleum products.

The following feasibility studies were completed: the KPLC unbundling study, enabling the
establishment of KETRACO in 2009; the LNG regasification plant study, which is the basis for
the ongoing tendering to select a concessionaire to construct an LNG regasification plant in
Mombasa; the biogas consultancy report; sector-wide environmental impact assessments; and

studies for developing MoE’s capacities in power engineering, petroleum, renewable energy, and
biogas.

1.4     The achievements of the increasing access PDO are:
• Installed 95 wind masts and data loggers have been. Obtained, analyzed, and used data to
    validate and improve the wind atlas.
• Constructed/rehabilitated 48 substations and 2,114 km of distribution lines.
• Connected an additional 526,000 households to the national electricity grid, benefiting
    2,630,000 Kenyan citizens.
• Completed a modern control and data acquisition system,, energy management system, and
    radio communication system that has improved the efficiency and quality of electricity
    supply.
• Installed 1,360 km of fiberoptic cable in the T&D system.
• Completed a 35-MW unit at Olkaria II, in May 2010, generating an average of 287 GWh
    annually.
• Completed the following feasibility studies; the Kipevu Combined Cycle power plant study,
    which led to identification of the Olkaria II third unit as the best option; an LPG import
    handling and storage facility study, which led to the African Gas and Oil Company
    constructing an import handling and storage facility with a capacity of 20,000 MT in
    Mombasa; a study for a 300-MW coal-fired power plant in Mombasa, whose findings
    KenGen used to advertise for a public-private partnership for implementing the project
    (which could not proceed after the site recommended by the consultant was found to be
    unsuitable because of its close proximity to the Moi International Airport in Mombasa);
    studies for twelve 132-kV transmission lines of which three lines—the 230-km Kindaruma-
    Mwingi-Garissa, the 60-km Eldoret-Kitale, and the 44-km Kisii-Awendo—are being
    constructed under the Kenya Electricity Expansion Project; and the study for a 220-kV
    transmission ring around Nairobi, which is under construction.


1.5     Project Challenges and Implementation Problems. The executive summary lists the
following issues:
• A three-year delay in the generation component, and a capital increase of about US$18
    million, because of the Bank’s requirement for a feasibility study to be undertaken before
    procurement could proceed. The resulting prolonged procurement led to further cost
    escalation of more than US$7 million.
• Delays by KenGen in meeting the preconditions for disbursement by AFD and EIB resulted
    in funding delays for the generation component, and a depletion of KenGen’s cash reserves.
    Consequently, the contract price had to be renegotiated and was increased by US$10 million.
• Delays in obtaining tax and duty exemptions from the National Treasury.
• Delays with connecting new equipment to the grid.
• The negotiation for a lease of land for the Olkaria II project with the Kenya Wildlife Service
    took more than a year to reach an agreement. The land was part of the security for EIB and
    AfD, which led to delays in obtaining the securities for the loans. KenGen failed to open an
    LOC within the specified contract period for the Olkaria II project due to unavailability of
    funds. This in turn led to a re-negotiation of the contract agreement. In addition, the Bank
    delayed its No Objection ruling for the renegotiated agreement between KenGen and the
    contractor. In 2008, due to the global financial crisis, the distribution component attracted

                                                                                              42
      bids that were significantly below engineering estimates, leading to major challenges by the
      winning bidders. Moreover, challenges associated with land acquisition, rights of way, and
      permits from local authorities led to delays in site handover and commencement of works.
•     Limited availability of experienced subcontractors to implement the local works led to delays
      in implementation and, in some cases, court cases.
•     Heightened vandalism of electrical infrastructure, including theft of contractors’ materials
      from stores, affected completion of projects.
•     Delays in obtaining tax and duty exemptions led to delays in clearing imported equipment at
      the port of entry.
•     Bureaucratic approval processes in the line ministries caused delays in processing
      disbursements.


1.6      Lessons Learned. Direct borrowing from development partners by KenGen was
complicated, resulting in delays in reaching financial closure and negatively affecting the overall
project schedule. The GoK should mediate in land issues between government agencies to
minimize delays in reaching agreement. Agencies should not proceed with signing contracts
unless full funding is secured. When seeking donor funds, it is important that bankable documents
(feasibility study reports) have been prepared. It was a challenge combining distribution lines and
substations in one contract, as the two require different sets of expertise. Bidders tend to put most
of the costs into materials and reduce installation costs significantly (front loading). For
distribution projects located in geographically widespread locations, it is necessary to package the
contracts into manageable lots, and restrict the number of lots a bidder can participate in.

2.0       Implementation and Procurement Issues, Challenges, and Lessons Learned

2.1      Implementation Issues. PITs were established within the organizational units that are
normally responsible for implementing similar projects. On commencement of the project, the
PITs had sufficient staff and/or consultants with experience and skills in project management. In
addition, a management oversight committee was established comprising executive directors
from KPLC, KenGen, and MoE. An experienced consulting engineering firm was competitively
procured for the design, review, and supervision of construction works. The agencies for the
subcomponent for strengthening regulatory capacity—ERB (which later became ERC) and
KEB—each appointed focal point persons assisted by two or three other designated staff in
liaising with MoE.

2.2     Challenges and Lessons Learned. The creation of the Geothermal Development
Company led to the migration of key staff from KenGen, creating work overload within the PIT.
Also, the oversight committees of the implementing agencies did not provide the required
supervision. The turnover of staff in the accounting and procurement departments of MoE (now
the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum [MOEP]) was very high. The accountants and procurement
staff were all seconded from the National Treasury to MOEP, and whenever staff changes were
made, MOEP got new accountants and procurement staff who had no experience in preparing
Financial Management Reports/Interim Financial Reports (FMRs/IFRs) and procurement
guidelines. The PIT had to arrange training for these new staff members, but often would lose
them again because of interministerial staff transfers. As a result, the quality of procurement
documentation, preparation of FMRs/IFRs, and project accounts preparation in MOEP suffered.
The hiring of consultants for MOEP’s PIT improved overall project management coordination,
and reporting; informed decision making; and enhanced capacity in petroleum standards,
renewable energy, rural energy, and power development.

                                                                                                  43
2.3     Procurement. During project appraisal, a procurement plan for the first 18 months of
implementation was developed spelling out the procurement methods that had to be used. This
plan was discussed in detail and refined as appropriate during negotiations and approved by the
World Bank. The Plan was updated by the GoK on an annual basis. The agreed thresholds for
procurement methods and prior review were included in the plan, among other methods, that for
works, supplies and installations (the Olkaria II unit) greater than US$500,000, ICB with prior
review was required.

2.4      Procurement Issues. The schedule for the procurement of the generation component was
affected due to a requirement by IDA that KenGen prove the adequacy of available steam for the
additional unit. The project’s initial budget escalated due to cost increases of several contracts
that occurred as a result of the unforeseen rise in international prices for construction materials at
the time of contract award, and other factors significantly impacted the procurement schedule. In
addition, delays in approval of contracts by IDA, and subsequent changes to contract conditions
led to prolonged delays in implementation.

Among the lessons from this experience is the quality and relevance of initial assumptions during
the planning stage will determine to a large extent how well the project will be managed. Also,
inadequate funding of the project adversely affects the quality of its management. For instance,
KPLC experienced delays in acquiring land for new substations because of lengthy internal
procurement logistics. This resulted in some contracts commencing before land was made
available to the contractors, causing delays and creating additional costs. KPLC learned the need
to tender for projects only after land had been obtained and all necessary legal requirements had
been met. However, at times, KPLC did, not factor in the right-of-way acquisition processes in
the project schedules. Hence, any delays in right-of-way acquisition led to delays in completing
projects.

KPLC had also decided to prepare separate contracts for lines and substations, so that the
contracts could run concurrently to avoid a scenario where substations are completed before the
lines are completed. Another complication was that initially the distribution project component
did not require NEMA licensing; however, because of a 2006 change in environmental licensing
requirements NEMA had to issue licenses for individual sites, which caused delays. KPLC also
experienced delays in acquisition of local authority clearances for its project sites, leading to
delays in the handover of project sites to contractors. KPLC has now adopted a consultative
approach and close working relationship with the various local governments to enable fast-
tracking of the clearance documents.

2.5     Additional Lessons. The Bank’s refusal to allow KenGen to sole source an existing
contractor who was at the Olkaria II site led to prolonged delays in securing a contractor. In the
end, that same contractor was the only bidder. In addition, the Bank’s insistence on the
confirmation of adequate steam resulted in a procurement delay of two years with the EPC
contract for the Olkaria II Unit 3. However, where an existing contractor is in place carrying out
similar work, there is no guarantee of a low-price bid from either the existing contractor or new
bidders for an increased scope of work. During fundraising for future energy projects, the
implementing agencies should carry out a cost-benefit-analysis of the available financing options
and select those that are most favorable for the smooth implementation of projects.

Delays developed in obtaining internal approvals from tender committees and boards of the
implementing agencies. The quality gaps in procurement documents submitted to IDA for review
and approval contributed to the delays in obtaining No Objection rulings. However, in some

                                                                                                   44
instances, the Bank took longer than the agreed time to provide No Objection rulings without any
apparent reason.

Delay in obtaining tax and duty exemptions led to demurrage costs, time extensions, and
attendant costs. The lesson learned here was that future loan agreements from development
partners should include financing of taxes and duties. In an effort to win the tenders, some bidders
underquoted and then wasted time looking for cheap sources of materials and subcontractors, or
presented designs that compromised on specification. Hence, significant time was wasted going
back and forth during design approval. The lesson learned here was that a credible engineer’s

Annex 9. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


1.      EIB provided comments on the early draft ICR. Their comments covered two aspects of
project implementation: (1) the conclusion of financing agreement between KenGen and co-
financiers; and (2) the procurement challenges of the geothermal EPC contract.

2.      In relation to the delays in finalizing financing agreement between KenGen and co-
financiers, the EIB’s comments clarified that “the procurement process took much longer than
expected, and required special consideration on the background of the World Bank’s standard
rules. The contract price had to be re-negotiated and the work site was closed down during the
civil unrest, which increased the cost further and led to a lengthy process of negotiation of
additional financing from EIB and AFD, including new security arrangements. Also, the financial
covenants had to be re-negotiated in order to enable EIB and AFD to disburse loans. In the
meantime, in order to continue the project works, Kengen had to raise its own funds and
Government funds (which were used to back up letters of credit).” These points were taken into
consideration in finalizing this ICR.

3.      On the issue of geothermal EPC procurement, the EIB’s comments fully support the
description of issues in the early draft, which is substantially retained in this final report.

4.     Other co-financiers did not have comments on the draft ICR.

G. Supervision of Carbon Finance Operations Guidelines

According to the Bank Guidelines (Office Memorandum, December 1, 2011) oversight
(supervision and monitoring) of Carbon Finance operations is conducted in two phases: (1) the
implementation phase, from effectiveness of the ERPA to project completion; and (2) the
monitoring phase, from project completion to termination of the ERPA. Between these phases,
oversight responsibility is transferred from the region to the Climate Change Group–Carbon
Finance Unit (CCGCF). Since the Kenya KenGen Carbon Finance Umbrella Project is fully
operational and capable of generating emission reductions, the present ICR summarizes the
project’s achievements, issues encountered, and lessons learned, in order to transfer it to CCGCF
for the monitoring phase.

2. ACHIEVEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

2.1    Basic project description and summary of any significant changes since Emission
Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) signature

2.1.1 The Kenya KenGen Carbon Finance Umbrella Project (KKCFUP) reduces greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions by displacing fossil-fuel based electricity generation to the grid following
the installation of a third 35-megawatt (MW) clean geothermal generating unit at the existing
Olkaria II power plant.

2.1.2 The Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) owns and operates two
geothermal power stations, Olkaria I and Olkaria II. The original Olkaria II power plant had two
units with a combined capacity of 64 MW. However, there was an estimated steam surplus of 53
MW, which was sufficient for the implementation of a third unit of 35 MW at Olkaria II.

2.1.3 The KKCFUP was designed in 2006 to support the development of an estimated 600,000
certified emission reductions (CERs) and 300,000 verified emission reductions (VERs). An
Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) for CERs and VERs from Olkaria II (Unit 3)
was signed on November 14, 2006, with the Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF).
The ERPA was amended to, among others, adjust the CER/VER volume according to the
amended registration date of the project of December 4, 2010. The CER volume was reduced to
257,671 CERs in the third amendment, and the VER volume was reduced to 220,861 VERs.

2.1.4 As part of the ERPA between KenGen and the CDCF, the project supports the
implementation of Community Benefit Plan (CBP), by earmarking a portion of the emission
reduction (ER) payments for community projects that enhance access to basic infrastructure and
services to poor local communities living in the vicinity of the carbon finance (CF) project site.
The CBP was developed by KenGen in close consultation with the local Maasai, Luo, and
Kikuyu tribes. The CBP components include the construction of a livestock water pan, six
classrooms, and local road repairs, as well as a water pipeline extension to the community health
center and employment of local youth. An advance payment of US$225,000 was disbursed to
KenGen in June 2011 to help start the CBP implementation. As of January 2014, most of the
components have been completed, except for the construction of the six class rooms, which is
ongoing. The CBP is estimated to benefit 450 pupils, 20,000 local inhabitants, and 40,000
livestock. As more CERs are certified by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) and VERs are verified by an independent auditor, more resources will be
used for the implementation of the CBP.

2.2 Project implementation and commissioning


2.2.1 Original Project Development Objective (PDO): The original PDO of the KKCFUP was
to reduce GHG emissions by displacing fossil fuel-based electricity generation in Kenya with
clean geothermal power generation at the existing Olkaria II (Unit 3) power plant. The
construction and operation of the clean geothermal power generation unit at Olkaria II are
supported by financing from the International Development Association under the Kenya Energy
Sector Recovery Project (ESRP), from the European Investment Bank, and from the Agence
Française de Développement. The third unit of the Olkaria II geothermal plant, with an installed
capacity of 35 MW, started delivering electricity to the grid on September 1, 2010, and thus
displacing electricity from existing fossil fuel-based plants in Kenya.


                                                                                               54
2.2.2    The Olkaria II Unit 3 was registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
project on December 4, 2010. So far, 152,198 CERs have been issued (149,154 CERs delivered
to the CDCF), corresponding to the first verification, which covers the period from December 4,
2010, to December 31, 2011. The first payment under the CDCF ERPA for the purchase of CERs
was completed in November 2013. As of March 2014, approximately two-thirds of contract ERs
remain to be delivered under the CDCF ERPA.

2.2.3 In accordance with the ERPA, KenGen committed to spend part of the CER/VER
revenue toward the implementation of a CBP. The CDCF participants visited Olkaria in 2006
when members from the surrounding communities presented priority projects for funding under
the CBP. However, as a result of the delays in the project commissioning and CDM registration,
the CBP was revised by the Olkaria Corporate Social Responsibility Committee during a meeting
on September 6, 2010, as follows.

2.2.4 During the implementation phase of the CBP, KenGen has put in place Steering and
Management Committees, with members from the Olkaria Geothermal Project as well as staff
from the KenGen Head Office.

2.2.5 In accordance with the ERPA, the CDCF made an advance payment of US$250,000 to
KenGen to be used for the early implementation of the CBP, in advance of the delivery of ERs.
KenGen has reimbursed this advance payment to the CDCF.

2.3    Monitoring, reporting, verification, and issuance of emission reductions




                                                                                            55
2.3.1 The monitoring of Olkaria II projects has been carried out by KenGen in accordance with
the Monitoring Plan as described in the Project Design Document (PDD). 9 KenGen has prepared
all monitoring reports.


3. BANK AND PROJECT ENTITY PERFORMANCE

3.1     Assessment and rating of overall Bank performance

3.1.1 Overall, the Bank’s performance has been satisfactory. The Bank’s involvement was
critical in the CDM registration and verification stages. Since the beginning of the project, the
Bank has collaborated closely with KenGen and has built the capacity needed to overcome many
of the obstacles the project encountered, such as the concerns raised by the designated operational
entity (DOE) during the verification stage on the project’s boundary.

3.2     Assessment and rating of overall project entity performance

3.2.1 The performance of KenGen is rated satisfactory. KenGen has complied with all of the
obligations and requirements expected, such as assisting with the development of the PDD and
maintaining good relations with local stakeholders (i.e., municipalities, communities, and
nongovernmental organizations). KenGen monitors the performance of the equipment to ensure
compliance with the PDD and implements the Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans.
KenGen is implementing the CBP in a timely manner and is complying with the safeguards of the
ESRP (the parent project).


4.      BENEFITS, TARGET POPULATION, AND RATE OF SUCCESS

4.1      The KKCFUP was the third CDM project registered in Kenya, and the first project to
issue CERs. ERs have been calculated using information verified by a DOE, an “independent
auditor accredited by the CDM Executive Board to verify whether implemented projects have

4.2     As of January 2014, the project’s CBP is estimated to benefit 450 pupils, 20,000 local
inhabitants, and 40,000 livestock. As more CERs are certified by the UNFCCC and VERs are
verified by an independent auditor, more resources will be used for the implementation of the
CBP activities.

5.       COMMENTS FROM PROJECT ENTITY AND OTHER PARTNERS

5.1     KenGen contributed to the preparation of this Implementation Completion and Results
(ICR) report, providing the Bank ICR team with information and data, and facilitating site visits.
KenGen also provided the lessons learned section, and the information to describe KKCFUP’s
commissioning and implementation experiences. KenGen participated in regular Bank
supervision and safeguard missions.

6.       COMPLIANCE WITH SAFEGUARDS

6.1     The KKCFUP is in compliance with the environmental and resettlement safeguards of the
ESRP, specifically the mitigating measures for the Olkaria II generating unit. The ESRP was
rated B and triggered the Safeguard Policy for Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and Natural
Habitats (OP 4.04). The opinion of the independent consultancy firm (accredited by the Kenyan
National Environmental Management Authority) who reviewed the environmental and social
implications of Olkaria II in April 2004, was that the environmental and social impacts from the
expansion are likely to be moderate to negligible. They would be manageable, given KenGen’s
demonstrated capacity for environmental management.

As noted, the expansion of the geothermal generation unit uses a renewable and environmentally
clean fuel. The ESRP’s environmental staff conducted a mission in 2010 and examined the
potential impacts of Olkaria II on wildlife, water availability and quality, and soil and water
pollution. The mission consulted with the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA)
consultant, the Deputy District Commissioner, the Kenya Wildlife Society (KWS), and the
nearby Maasai community. KWS and the Maasai elders confirmed that Olkaria II has had no
effect on wildlife. In fact, the troughs provided by KenGen for wildlife have lessened stress for
animals that previously had reduced access to Lake Naivasha. The ESIA consultant found that the
use of water from Lake Naivasha for the Olkaria plant, which is being recirculated and only
refilled once a year during maintenance, is inconsequential (compared with the nearby flower
farms).

KenGen analyzes the brine and sludge levels of discharge water and has agreed to reinject the
brine underground in reinjection well pads. Sludge that may contain toxic non-biodegradable
substances will be encased in concrete and buried. Finally, KenGen will ensure that transmission
lines do not loop back into the nearby Hells Gate Park, and instead will go straight to Suswa,
minimizing the risk of electrocution of raptors and nesting birds.

7.       LESSONS LEARNED

7.1     Communication with local communities and stakeholder is key in CF projects. To
ensure successful delivery of the CBP, KenGen:

     •   Conducts regular meetings with key stakeholders, including the Climate Change
         Coordination Committee, the local communities, and the Ministry of Environment,
         Water and Natural Resources.


                                                                                               57
    •    Conducted early consultation, which is key to community ownership and sustainability.
        In the Olkaria CBP, the community identified and prioritized 4 of the 26 proposed
        projects. Early on, KenGen conducted meetings with the district officers of Narok and
        Naivasha. The involvement of the officers was important, because they control channels
        of communication and information dissemination during public consultation, and can
        reconcile differences as they are deemed to be impartial. It also helps to involve relevant
        ministries in technical support activities to ensure that these activities are sustained.
        KenGen has involved the communities in the selection of committee members who will
        implement the activities, including the representatives from ministries, such as education
        and water. Moreover, gender consideration was key during the selection of the
        committee members. KenGen’s Corporate Social Responsibility Officer, Beatrice
        Kipingo, who has been based at Olkaria for more than seven years, took care to ensure
        that females from the community were invited to meetings. Meetings attended by CF
        and Bank staff can confirm that these female community members made their views
        known, and their concern for education is reflected in the selection of classroom
        construction in the CBP.
    •   Carried out capacity building for committee members to help them understand how to
        manage the implementation of projects. In addition, using local labor increases the
        project’s benefits. In the case of the Olkaria CBP, the workers were paid. This was
        necessary because of the high poverty levels of the communities.
    •   Did not raise expectations of local communities. Given the lag between project
        commissioning and ER generation (both triggers for Community Benefit fund release)
        local communities may become suspicious that the project sponsor (KenGen) is
        retaining funds. It is also important to manage timing of consultations until the amount
        of ERs to be generated is known with some degree of certainty, as the amount of
        Community Benefit funding is dependent upon the amount of ERs generated.


7.2      Independent nature of CDM project cycle and Bank capability to deal with it.
Access to project development financing and CDM project registration is key to maximizing the
benefits from CDM projects. In this case, a Project Idea Note was submitted to the Bank in July
2006, and the project was registered in December 2010. However, several changes occurred in
CDM procedures and regulations, and the PDD had to be updated to reflect the new changes. The
registration delay was mostly caused by the validation process, and led to reviews of the ERPA
and subsequent reduction in the expected revenue generation from the contract CERs and
corresponding VERs. Measurable and certified ERs require a rigorous verification process.

7.3      Direct sustainable development benefits of Olkaria II geothermal project. The
development of geothermal energy not only leads to low carbon growth, but also improves access
to electricity, reduces overdependency on hydropower electricity, and provides energy security.
The dependence on hydropower in Kenya represents a risk due to recurrent droughts and
deforestation of the catchment areas. Frequent droughts are causing power rationing and require
expensive emergency diesel-powered generation. Growing geothermal energy reduces the
dependence on hydropower and emergency power generation. The community fund increased the
acceptability of the geothermal expansion project. Distributing indirect benefits among the
communities around the plants ensured fairness and avoided controversy. In the case of Olkaria,
benefits were distributed between Maiella and Suswa. Suswa is a largely Maasai area, whereby
Maiella has a mixed population of Kikuyu and Maasai.


                                                                                                58
    7.5      Replication effect. The geothermal expansion project was the third CDM project to be
    registered and the first to issue CERs in Kenya. The project participants are currently sharing the
    lessons learned from this project with other Kenyan projects that are at different verification
    stages.

    7.6     Partnerships are a key instrument to boost the effects of community plans. KenGen
    partnered with World Vision International in the Maiela water supply project, which brought
    synergy.

    8.            JUSTIFICATION FOR MOVING TO THE SECOND PHASE (CARBON
                  FINANCE MONITORING) AND SAFEGUARDS COMPLIANCE

    8.1     Compliance with safeguards and implementation challenges in the first phase—
    supervision phase

    8.1.1 The project was rated B due to environmental and social safeguards that were triggered
    during implementation. During implementation, suitable measures were taken to mitigate these
    safeguard issues.

    8.2           Project entity’s capacity to carry out key functions related to safeguard requirements

    8.2.1         KenGen’s capacity to address safeguards is satisfactory.

    8.3      Potential issues in post-completion operation, including project entity’s capacity and
    ability of the project to deliver the contracted ERs

    8.3.1 No issues are likely to arise in the post-completion of the project. ERs are on schedule for
    delivery, as estimated.

    8.4           Justification for moving to the second phase—carbon finance monitoring phase

    8.4.1 All safeguard requirements are fulfilled, and the Environmental Management Plan is fully
    complied with. No outstanding material issues exist, and no potential issue is anticipated during
    the remaining term of the ERPA.

    8.4.2 For the remaining monitoring activity, KenGen has the capacity to operate the project and
    to carry out key functions related to safeguard requirements. The monitoring system is proven to
    be suitable, and the risk was assessed as minimal at the time of the ICR.
