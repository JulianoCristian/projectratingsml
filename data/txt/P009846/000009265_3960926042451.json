The main element of this water\n            management project is to initiate a seven-year program to\n            plan, implement and monitor improved operation and\n            maintenance in selected irrigation schemes. Although focused\n            on three states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu),\n            this program also provides for smaller pilot efforts in\n            other states. The principle components will be: 1) scheme\n            investments including repairs, renovation, additional\n            control structures, measuring devices and upgraded operation\n            and maintenance facilities required to execute improved\n            operational plans in up to 20 schemes with a total of almost\n            600,000 ha of irrigated area; 2) institutional\n            strengthening; 3) scheme specific training programs; and, 4)\n            special studies. The project will also include two other\n            components related to the general objectives of improved\n            water management in India. First, the Maharashtra Induction\n            Training Program, which will provide training for engineers\n            recruited into the Maharashtra Irrigation Department; and\n            second, the Institutional Strengthening and Training Fund\n            will finance studies, data collection and other preparation\n            activities for possible future irrigation projects."}, "docdt": "1987-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
