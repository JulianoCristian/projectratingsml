The objectives of\n            the Shuikou Hydroelectric Project were to: (a) develop a\n            major hydroelectric site to serve the Fujian and East China\n            grids; (b) introduce the latest technology for dam and power\n            station construction; (c) link the East China and Fujian\n            power grids, and promote effective integrated operation of a\n            major regional grid; and (d) upgrade Fujian Provincial\n            Electric Power Bureau (FPEPB) capability in financial\n            management and management of large civil works contracts.\n            Both Bank and Borrower performance are rated as highly\n            satisfactory from identification to appraisal. The\n            objectives of the project were consistent with those of the\n            Chinese Government and the Bank and the project achieved its\n            major objectives. The outcome is rated as highly\n            satisfactory, and sustainability as likely. The key lessons\n            to be learned from this project are: (a) It is important\n            that prequalification criteria with respect to joint\n            ventures ensure that each partner of the joint venture is\n            qualified to carry out its responsibilities; (b) The\n            two-stage loan approach achieved its objective in reducing\n            the early repayment burden before power plant commissioning;\n            and (c) Resettlement activities are continuing and it is\n            intended to produce a detailed report on positive and\n            negative lessons learned from the process which will be\n            summarized in the ICR for the Second Shuikou Hydroelectric Project."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
