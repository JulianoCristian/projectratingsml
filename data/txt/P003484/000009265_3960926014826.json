Shuikou Hydroelectric Project seeks\n            to support economic growth in East China and Fujian province\n            through development of a major hydroelectric site on the Min\n            river. The project is the Bank's first involvement in\n            the power subsector in Fujian province and the fifth Bank\n            loan for development of the power subsector in China. The\n            project comprises the construction of a 101 m high concrete\n            gravity dam, spillway, powerhouse and navigation lock. It\n            also includes provision and installation of seven generating\n            units of 200 MW each, construction of a single-circuit 500\n            kV transmission line and installation of equipment at an\n            associated substation. Further to this, the project entails\n            provision of consulting services for design and construction\n            management; resettlement of the reservoir area population\n            and a program for its economic and social reestablishment;\n            and carrying out of studies and a training program."}, "docdt": "1986-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
