There are four project components. The first,\n            rehabilitates and improves irrigation facilities, flood\n            control and drainage facilities, and irrigation reservoirs\n            and headworks, as well as supporting field surveys, project\n            design, and construction supervision. The second component\n            continues support provided under the first project for\n            developing a sustainable irrigation sub-sector by 1)\n            strengthening and expanding the transfer of irrigation\n            management to water users' associations; 2) assisting\n            the restructuring of water enterprises into more sustainable\n            institutions responsive to their users; and 3) assisting the\n            construction industry to encourage better contract practices\n            and construction quality. The third component improves\n            irrigation technologies like gate and pump station design,\n            develops design manuals, commissions sector studies, and\n            conducts annual dam inspections. It also improves\n            environmental management by piloting the communal management\n            of micro-catchments, training farmers in best agricultural\n            practices and extension services, and funding environmental\n            monitoring. The fourth component supports project\n            implementation including developing an investment program."}, "docdt": "1999-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
