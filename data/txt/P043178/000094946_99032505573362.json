It analyzes the relatively narrow\n            environmental impact of the proposed irrigation\n            rehabilitation, emphasizing a wider impact on the\n            surrounding environment, since the long-term impact on the\n            subprojects' viability is of higher relevance. The\n            study includes eight volumes, considering, in general,\n            positive assessments on the impacts of the rehabilitation of\n            deteriorated irrigation and drainage facilities. In\n            particular, the rehabilitation will restore efficient\n            irrigation and increase farm incomes among an impoverished\n            rural population. Drainage will facilitate growth in the\n            cooler months, reducing fertilizer and agro-chemical\n            run-offs. However, soil erosion from surrounding areas is a\n            major environmental concern, and it is expected to be\n            addressed through the proposed watershed management\n            component. This component will also address the soil\n            salinity issue, which, even though salinity may not be\n            present in most subproject areas, adjacent slope watershed\n            areas may contain infertile acid soils, conducive to poor\n            quality vegetation and high erosion degrees. To mitigate\n            these impacts, the study suggests the need for irrigation\n            and water quality to be monitored annually. Drainage water\n            samples should be analyzed for pesticide residues."}, "docdt": "1998-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
