ANNEX D Environmental Assessment
D.A  Introduction
Environmental aspects covered here include firstly the relatively narrow environmental
impact of the proposed rehabilitation. Secondly, the wider impact of the surrounding
environment on the sub-project is analysed, as this may have a more important long-
term impact on the viability of the sub-project.
An Environmental Assessment Summary for the sub-project is presented as Table D.2.
Monitoring and mitigation measures necessary to overcome any identified problems
are discussed in the final section.
D.2   Description of the Proposed Sub-Project
The sub-project BRU3 is located in the Berat District in the south-central part of the
country, approximately 15-30km to the south-east of Lushnje City along a reasonably
good surfaced road. It is some 40km inland from the Adriatic coast, and lies in the wide
alluvial plain of the Osumi River between the Shpirag Goricani Hills (1 IOOm elevation)
to the west and the Berat Kucove Hills to the east. The sub-project is some 19km long,
following the river in a NNW direction, and a maximum of some 5km wide. The
elevation of most of the sub-project varies from some 20-35m amsl. Soils in the
commanded areas are all of alluvial or colluvial origin, and are deep, of high to
moderate nutrient and water retention capacities.
The main BRU3 sub-project area comprises some 3,960ha and the main canal system
of over 25km in length is supplied by a barrage on the Osumi River just below Berat
City. The layout of the system is complex the main canal crosses the Osumi at
Vajgurore and numerous pump irrigation schemes either supplement this canal water
by further pumping from the Osumi River, or pump up to irrigate further areas above
the canal. The overall layout of the sub-project area is shown in Figure D.1, together
with locations of water samples taken for analysis. Figure D.2 is a schematic diagram
showing the relative locations of the different components.
In addition to the 3,960 ha, there are additional areas totalling 935ha which are
included in the rehabilitation project These include:
* Uznova scheme, on the right bank of the Osumi, some 6km upstream of Berat City.
Some 165ha are irrigated by gravity offtake, and a further 120ha are supplied by
pumping up from this gravity canal;
- left bank schemes totalling some 650ha and comprising:
- gravity canal offtake at Velabisht, just above Berat City, and gravity and
pump schemes running from this canal;
- gravity schemes running from the Sadovice Reservoir, some of these
overlapping with the above pump schemes;
- Veterik pump scheme;
- Manastri Reservoir Scheme, also overlapping in part with the Manastiri
Pump Scheme;
- Males Grope Reservoir Scheme.

In total, of the 4,895ha considered in this rehabilitation, 4,325ha are supplied by
gravity, and 570ha by small pumping stations. Of the gravity-supply areas, 1,600ha can
receive supplemental pumped water when gravity supply is insufficient during the peak
period, usually of some 30 days/year.
Agriculture in the area tends to be somewhat more intensive than average, with a
higher proportion of land under vegetables, vines, and fruit trees than occur on other
schemes.
Full details of the sub-project's location, resources, agriculture, irrigation and drainage,
and proposed rehabilitation activities are presented in Chapters 2 to 6 of this sub-
project feasibility study.
D.3   Conclusions
As the proposed project essentially comprises the rehabilitation of deteriorated
irrigation and drainage facilities its impacts are generally positive in nature. In
particular, the rehabilitation will restore efficient irrigation and increase farm incomes
which will benefit the rural population, amongst whom there is considerable poverty.
Drainage rehabilitation will facilitate growth in the cooler and wetter months, and will
reduce surface run-off of ferUliser nutrients and agro-chemicals. The improved
distribution of irrigation water will increase social equity, removing the disparity
between those at the head of the system and those without water at the tail.
However, a major environmental issue which will significantly impact on the sub-project
is soil erosion and flash run-off from surrounding areas of land. Most of these areas are
farmed by land owners of the sub-project. This issue is expected to be addressed by a
proposed watershed management component of SIDRP. Other issues, somewhat less
serious, include soil ferbtlity, soil structure breakdown, and water quality, and these are
included in the proposed monitoring programme.
In the following sections D.4 to D.7 the environmental aspects of the sub-project are
reviewed in more detail. In the final section, D.8, a monitoring programme is proposed.
DA   Irrigation Water Quality for BRU3
The original source of water for the BRU3 sub-project is the Osumi River, which has a
large watershed of some 225,000 ha upstream of the scheme. This watershed drains
mainly limestone country, with only a small area of uttrabasic materials and virtually no
industry or mining. Three lowermost pump schemes in the BRU3 sub-project are below
the confluence of the Osumi and Devolli Rivers.
The Devolli drains water from the KOUI sub-project and adjacent irrigation areas, and
includes significant areas of ultabasic rock materials. However the substantial Banje
Dam and reservoir trap the water and any sediment. The Devolli River drains some
270,000 ha.
Sediment levels observed in the source water and the rivers in September, 1998, were
very low, but the eroded surrounding hillsides suggested that current erosion rates are
high in places, and much of the eroded material is accumulating in the main canals.



Watershed management in the main watershed and the local watersheds above the
main canals thus is of great importance.
Ten water samples were taken on 27th September, 1998 to represent irrigation and
drainage water qualities for the two Berat Sub-projects. Locations of these samples are
shown in Figures D.1 and D.2. Samples were analysed at the laboratory of the Soils
Institute, and results were analysed by the Consultants' Irrigation Water Quality
Analysis spreadsheet
Both Irrigation and Drainage water quality is extremely good, with very low EC (0.3-0.6
dSlm), TDS (240-400 mgR) and SAR (0.1-0.9) values. According to the FAO (1985)
irrigation water classification, this water would have no problems for most parameters
of salinity. However, with bicarbonate being the dominant anion, there may be some
problem over a long period with carbonate incrustation for sprinkler or drip irrigation.
Also, with very low ECw values, there may be a tendency for soil structure breakdown
and dispersion of clays. However, with well structured soils of high carbonate and
organic matter content, this tendency should be very small. Nevertheless, soil structure
and yields should be monitored over a long period to verify that this is so.
Comment Monitoring requirements are included in the monitoring programme.
D.5   Drainage Water Quality from BRK1 and BRK2
D.5.1 Drainage Water which may be re-used for irrigation
The above water quality values also covered drainage water, and no significant
problems would be experienced. The worst' drainage water sample analysed showed
an EC value of 0.6dS/m, TDS of 410mg/l, and SAR of 1.0, which would still be
considered as excellent quality water.
D.5.2 Drainage Water passing through the sub-project areas
No problem waters were encountered. Even sample 4, covenng effluent from a textilei
factory, showed very good quality water.
D.5.3 Drainage water passing out of the sub-project areas
The net increase of salinity of waters passing out of the BRK1 and BRK2 sub-project
areas is extremely small, and no downstream problems should be encountered which
could be attributed to the sub-projects.
D.6  Soil Salinity
No saline soils are present in the Berat area, and the immediate sub-project areais
contain no significant extents of 'problem soils'.

D.7  Long-term  Impacts of the Wider Environment on the Proposed
Development
D.7.1 Erosion and flash run-off
Of greatest concern to the sustainability of these, and other sub-projects, is the very
severe problem of erosion and flash run-off from surrounding upland areas which are
the immediate watershed areas to the sub-projects. The problem is threefold:
* due to a high run-off coefficient of these upland areas, excessive run-off water flows
into the sub-projects areas, particularly during the months when it is not wanted
(October to March); this run-off flows into the main canals, which also act as high
level interceptors found on many other sub-projects;
* with the run-off water considerable quantities of eroded soil and rock are taken into
these canals, the reservoirs and the drainage lines; this material needs periodic
removal from the canals, at considerable cost;
- much of the resulting sediment ends up in the major rivers.
The surrounding upland areas above the sub-projects show very variable standards of
land use management, with an estimated current rate of erosion varying from
3tonnes/lalyear (c.0.2mm depth of soil removal) with the best land management, to
some 300tonnes/halyear (c 2cm depth) in the worst. Nationally, average rates of net
erosion have been placed at some 30tonnes I ha / year over the entire landsurface of
the country (Korvaci, 1998). The best land uses are natural forest and well-established
treecrop plantations, with complete canopy cover and dense understorey vegetation.
The worst land uses under the communist period used to be cultivation on sloping
land: the current problem is more one of uncontrolled grazing by villagers on any
available adjacent land. The most worrying cases of this involve grazing in terraced
areas, where full-scale destruction of terraces in now occurring due to stabilising grass
and bush vegetation being eaten out, and animals and people forming pathways in a
slopewise direction which rapidly lead to gullying.
The severity of this problem varies enormously from area to area, but is closely related
to distance from settlements, and to nature of parent materials. The worst problem
areas appear to be those of Pliocene marine clays: many ultrabasic soil areas are also
bad. Pliocene marine materials occur in the watersheds to the East of the BRU4 sub-
project, and there may well be smaller areas included in the watershed areas above
the BRU3 sub-project.
A high proportion of erosion may be associated with extreme rainfall events - for
example 1-in 5 24-hour rainfall amounts, which vary from about 80mm to 190mm over
the country, and are at the middle to upper part of this range within the sub-project
watersheds.
A programme urgently needs to be instigated in integrated watershed management,
which together with the existing irrigation and drainage rehabilitation programmes,
should promote long-term sustainability of agriculture in these districts. The main thrust
of such a programme would embrace six components:



i)    undertake studies on run-off/erosion, existing land use, and land tenure within
the sub-project watershed, and, based on these studies, devise a long-term
land zoning plan for the watersheds.
ii)   undertake reafforestation activities on publicly-owned land.
iii)   promote security of tenure on a long-term basis for all other appropriate upland
land areas. Ideally the same families farming land in scheme areas would also
have plots in adjacent upland areas. Granting of title could be conditional on the
following three measures being carried out by the prospective land owners;
iv)   promote planting and management of perennial vegetation, with excellent
groundcover (olives, timber and fuelwood plantations etc);
v)   impose strict controls on grazing animals, particularly on areas which had been
previously terraced, and on steeper slopes and more erodible parent materials;
vi)   promote further active soil and water conservation measures, particulardy
contour grass strips and hedges, tied contour drains, check dams and gully
plugs etc.
Comment A watershed management component for SIDRP has been proposed.
D.7.2 Flooding
Flooding may be a seasonal problem in both areas, due to both local flooding and main
rivers bursting their banks. The velocity of water passing through the BRU3 area would
suggest that a considerable amount of scourng could occur in the worst years, with a
tendency for the river bed to change course. This problem may worsen if upstream
watershed management issues are not tackled.
D.7.3 Under-use of Agricultural Chemicals, particularly Fertilisers
Under the excellent soils of the scheme areas, and provision of drainage and irrigation,
yield potential should be considerable: 8-7 tonnes J ha for wheat, and 8-9 tonnes / ha
for maize should be achievable. Actual yields, which are currently well under half of
these, are being constrained by several interacting factors. On removal of drainage,
flooding, and irrigation supply constraints, it is then increasingly important that yields
are not allowed to be limited by fertility constraints or outbreaks of pests and diseases.
Overall use of fertilisers are well under half of what they were under communist times,
and soil fertility is being 'mined' in most areas. Of particular long-term concem for this
area, which is noted for its treecrop and horticultural produce, is the K and Mg-status of
the soils, as these crops are particularly demanding of these two elements. Fertilibt
status needs careful monitoring.
Increased use of fertilisers and pesticides, up to recommended levels, and according to
recommended practices, will enormously increase income and long-term sustainability
of the scheme, at relatively little environmental cost By making the economics of the
schemes more attractive, they will relieve pressure on the uplands, the problems of
which are more severe by a very large factor (see discussion above).
Comment Long term monitoring of soil fertility status is included in the monitoring
programme.



D.8   Monitoring Programme
The monitoring programme should be undertaken by a technical staff member with
agronomic experience. This could be an agronomist or technical person attached to the
WE or federation of WUAs, or a member of the Soils Institute.
D.8.1 Irrigation and Drainage Water
Monitoring of irrigation water flows in the main canal needs to be undertaken in relation
to local rainfall. This is expected to be a routine responsibility of the WE.
Irrigation and drainage water quality needs to be monitored on an annual basis (late
summer) at the end of the first complete year of sub-project operation, with analyses
undertaken for all major anions and cations. A total of eight samples would be required:
three for irrigation water and five for drainage. This analysis would serve as useful
baseline data for the scheme. Thereafter only EC needs to be monitored, ideally by a
technical staff member from the WE or federation of WUAs.
The same drainage water samples need to be monitored for pesticide residues, with
the first year being taken as baseline data. On confirmation of any problems arising
downstream (eg fish kills, algal blooms) further monitoring of these sites should be
undertaken.
D.8.2 Soil Fertility Monitoring
Routine soil fertility testing needs to be undertaken both as essential baseline data for
the project, and also on a 2-yearly basis as the project progresses in order to follow
fertility changes in relation to yield levels and applications of fertiliser and manure.
These sites can also be used to follow soil structure changes, including possible
deterioration of surface structure as a result of long-terrn use of low-EC irrigation water,
and tendencies of soils to show sub-soil pan formation, restricting root growth and
water movement
A minimum of six farmers fields should be selected within the sub-project area,
representative of he best (most intensive) and worst (least intensive) farming
management Cropping history of these fields should be recorded, including crops
grown, rainfall (local stabon), irrigation water, pesticides, fertilisers, manure, and other
ameliorants used, and yields obtained. Composite soil samples should be taken to
represent topsoil (0-20cm) and subsoil (20-60cm) of each field.
Samples should be analysed at the Soils Institute laboratory for full fertility analyses,
including exchangeable cations and pH(H20).
Plant tissue samples should be taken for trace-element analysis, including Fe, Mn, Zn,
Cu, Co, Mo, and B.
Soil pits to 2m depth should be excavated at each of the sites and routine descriptions
made. These should also include detailed description of soil structure, pore space and
continuity, and root density and continuity. This should also be related to water table
and drainage features.



D.8.3 Watershed Management
Monitoring of soil erosion and watershed management issues are extremely important
but need to be considered more as a separate project rather than a monitorng
requirement for this sub-project
Advantages of inclusion of this sub-project in such a programme include: * most
upstream areas are managed by those farmers with irrigated land in the sub-project;
* with upland areas showing some areas of Pliocene marine clay parent materials,
the erosion problem is particularly severe in this area;
* areas of degraded, acid soils could be improved by applications of fine, calcareous
silt materials cleared from drains and canals downslope.
Apart from implementation acfivities on soil conservation measures, monitoring
activities would include:
* accumulation of materials in canals and drains. This would be undertaken as a
routine activity by WE staff, and a map compiled showing the relative severity of the
problem in different areas;
*  studies on small plots on run-off and erosion, determining terminal sprinkler
infiltration rates and soil erodibility factors for the major soil types.
*  studies on land use and land use changes in the upper watershed areas.
The last two studies should ideally be undertaken as MS-level thesis projects, but
under supervision from experienced land use and watershed management staff under
the SIDRP watershed management component
0.8.4 Equipment Needs
Standard soil and water monitoring equipment only is required for most analyses and
this is readily available in Albania. A maximum of US$400 per year would be needed to
undertake this routine analysis for this sub-projecL
Analysis of pesticide residues requires more sophisticated (gas chromatography)
equipment, but this is available in the laboratories of the Institute of Public Health. It
would be advantageous to undertake some duplicate sampling (say 10% of the total)
and correlate results with those obtained from an experienced laboratory elsewhere in
Europe. This work would be undertaken as part of a country-wide programme: some 50
local samples at $50 per sample and 5 duplicate (foreign-lab) test samples at $200 per
sample would be required. (This would total $2500 for local costs and some $1000 for
foreign costs for a national programme.)
Sprinkler infiltration rate testing and soil erodibility testing, also undertaken in other
sub-project areas, would need supervisory assistance which would form part of the
watershed management component of SIDRP.
