            Re:   Loan 3082 UR (Second Technical Assistance Project)
                        Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Mr. Minister:
      We refer to the Loan Agreement, dated July 19, 1989, between the
Republica Oriental del Uruguay (the Borrower) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), as amended.  We are pleased to
inform you that the Bank agrees to your request to amend the Loan Agreement
in order to redefine the description of the Project, and to revise the
allocation of loan proceeds accordingly.
      Therefore, the Bank proposes to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
      1.    The first paragraph of Schedule 2 is hereby revised to read as
follows:
      "The Objectives of the Project are to strengthen effective competition
in domestic banking activities and the Borrower's capital markets; to
improve the regulatory framework of, and Banco Central's supervision over,
said activities; to reduce impediments to investment, economic competition
and foreign commerce; to strengthen Central Government decision-making and
price analyses; and to attain further rationalization of the social security
and tax systems, improvement of public sector administration and more
comprehensive public investment programming."
      2.    The following sub-paragraph is hereby added to the description
of the parts of the Project:
      "Part H.  Policy Studies
      Execution of studies to examine the requirements for and means of
advancing policy changes in the following areas: public administration
reform, regulatory framework governing economic activity, obstacles to
foreign investment and trade, tax structure and administration, social
security, commercial integration with the Borrower's neighboring states, and
capital market development."
      3.    The Table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is
amended to read as follows:
                                Amount of the
                                Loan Allocated

the original allocation of funds is still appropriate.
