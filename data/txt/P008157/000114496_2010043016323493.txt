      2.    Section 2.03 is amended to read as follows:
      "Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be December 31, 1993 or  such

      notify the Borrower of such later date.".
      3.    A new Section 3.04 is added to read as follows:
      "Section 3.04: (a) in order to assist the Office in carrying out Part
      I. 1 of the Project, the Borrower shall establish a committee (the

      selection of Eligible Applicants.
      (b) Immediately after an Eligible Applicant has been selected by the
      Inter-ministerial Committee, the Borrower, through the Office, shall
      enter into a Contrato with the Eligible Applicant in terms and
      conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including, inter alia, the
      obligation of the Eligible Applicant to work for the Borrower for a
      period of at least twice the period taken by such Eligible Applicant
      to complete the post-graduate studies.".

      Borrower has established the Inter-ministerial Committee; and
      (d)   expenditures under Part I. 1 of the Project with respect to
      each Eligible Applicant, unless the Bank has been furnished with
      evidence satisfactory to the Bank that such Eligible Applicant has
      been admitted to a post-graduate program acceptable to the Bank, and
      has signed the respective Contrato.".
      6.    A new Part I is added to Schedule 2 which shall read as follows:
