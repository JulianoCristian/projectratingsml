Attainment of these objectives will be sought\n            through design and implementation of community land\n            management plans, using an innovative participatory and\n            holistic approach that has been tested and developed in\n            about 20 pilot operations initiated in the last five years.\n            The project consists of:  (a) design and implementation of\n            community land management plans for 120 rural communities in\n            three provinces; (b) design and implementation of combined\n            forest and community land management plans for 47\n            communities and three protected forests in two provinces;\n            (c) technical support to existing operations in 18\n            provinces; (d) establishment of national environmental and\n            project impact monitoring systems; (e) development of human\n            resources; and (f) management and studies."}, "docdt": "1991-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
