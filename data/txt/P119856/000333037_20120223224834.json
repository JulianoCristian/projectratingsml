satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the effectiveness of the single-tranche\n            operations is enhanced by a design that balances addressing\n            short-term challenges with concern for mid-term\n            sustainability. The debt restructuring made it possible for\n            banks to write down foreign debts by about US$11 billion.\n            The financial community considers these deals to be a fair\n            distribution of losses between unsecured foreign creditors\n            and the government, which spent US$10 billion to support the\n            banking sector in 2008-2009. The debt restructuring also\n            reduce banking sector external indebtedness by about a\n            third, from US$30 billion at the end of 2009 to about US$20\n            billion currently. A well-designed DPL can send a powerful\n            signal to the international community about the capacity and\n            commitment of the authorities to mitigate the impact of a\n            crisis. The DPL came at a point critical for Kazakhstan,\n            which had been hit by successive crises that required\n            considerable expenditures. The operation translated the\n            trust of the Bank in the commitment and capacity of the\n            authorities into a clear statement to the international\n            community that Kazakhstan could surmount the crises and look\n            forward to renewed growth and stability over the medium term."}, "docdt": "2012-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
