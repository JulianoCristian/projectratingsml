The\n            Asian financial crisis of 1998 dampened somewhat the effects\n            of Cape Verde's promotional efforts to attract Asian\n            foreign investment, especially in the manufacturing sector.\n            Moreover, high levels of internal government debt restricted\n            public expenditures and had negative impact on project\n            implementation, both in terms of delays in the disbursement\n            of counterpart funds and the allocation of government\n            resoures for important complementary activities. Several\n            lessons were learned from implementing the project: a) Open\n            and constructive dialogue with Government ensures prompt\n            corrective actions when needed. b) Careful assessment of\n            weaknesses of partner institutions and or beneficiaries is\n            essential for successful implementation of project\n            activities. c) Government commitment and collaboration with\n            other donors and key stakeholders is essential for project\n            success. d) Complex issues require considerable involvement\n            and proactivity."}, "docdt": "2001-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
