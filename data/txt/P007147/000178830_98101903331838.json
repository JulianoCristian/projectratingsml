This program\n            will not be finalized until priorities have been\n            established, which will require further studies during the\n            next two years, including the conclusion of a survey of El\n            Salvador's geothermal resources which is being carried\n            out with UNDP assistance. The Bank, in 1969, expressed its\n            special interest in this survey. Whatever the outcome of the\n            studies, the project is a firm part of the development\n            program. The gas turbine plant is essential to ensure\n            provision of adequate stand-by capacity in the system\n            particularly for the capital city of San Salvador, which is\n            also the dominant industrial, commercial and financial\n            center. The 115 kV transmission line connecting San Rafael\n            Cedros and San Miguel will represent a considerable and\n            needed improvement over the present 69/46 kV lines that\n            supply the eastern part of the country."}, "docdt": "1970-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
