INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIviENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMET CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC
OF EL SALVADOR FOR A FIFTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed development credit from the Association in an amount in various
currencies equivalent to Us$5.6 million to the Republic of El Salvador.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed project was submitted to IDA in January 1970 and
was appraised in June/July 1970. Negotiations took place in Washington
on November 9 through November 13, 1970. The Borrower was represented
by Mr. Alfredo Noyola, Vice-Minister of Economy, and iMr. Manuel Arce,
Deputy-Secretary of the Planning Council, and the Comision Hidroelectrica
del Rio Lempa (CEL) by Mr. Max Homberger, Director, and Mr. Enrique Lima,
General Manager.
3.        The proposed lending would bring total Bank/IDA lending (net
of cancellations) to US$71.5 million, consisting of nine loans and two
credits, of which US$30.3 million would be for the power sector. Total
loans now amount to US$57.9 million with one IDA credit of US$8.0 mil-
lion. The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
to El Salvador as of October 31, 1970.

-2-
4.        A total of US$6.7 million remains to be disbursed on two
loans. The 1inal stages of construction on a highway project for
which a supplementary loan was made in December 1967 (Loan 521-ES)
have been delayed by changes in the project, adverse weather condi-
tions and the war with Honduras. The project is now progressing sat-
isfactorily with about 70 percent of the work completed; howlever, some
postponement of the present Closing Date (June 30, 1971) may have to
be considered. An education loan (Loan 609-ES of June 11, 1969) has
been slow in starting because of institutional difficulties steming
from poor coordination within the education sector and inexperience in
international bidding procedures. Budgetary pressures in the immediate
post-war period also held back work on this project. These difficul-
ties have now been overcome, and bids for the first phase of construc-
tion have been received.  Meanwhile, however, the Government has de-
cided to restructure thie country's education system, and this will
require further changes in the project wihich are at present being exam-
ined. If the suggested changes seem appropriate, the Executive Direc-
tors will be invited to consider them.
5.        On January 21, 1969, the IFC approved an investment in
Hoteles de Centro America, S.A., consisting of a loan of US$0.6 million
and a share subscription of US$0.3 million, for the construction of a
hotel.  A second project in the tourist sector, which was under dis-
cussion eighteen months ago, has since been dropped.
6.        A number of projects are being prepared for consideration
by the Bank, including projects in telecommunications, highways and
irrigation. The telecommunications project should be ready for pre-
sentation to the Executive Directors before the end of the current
fiscal year.
7.        A claim of around US$250,000 in respect of certain debts owed
by the Salvador Railway Company arose when the Company's assets were
transferred to the Republic of El Salvador in 1962. During the past
two years discussions have been proceeding between representatives of
the bondholders, the Government of El Salvador, and the Government of
the United Kingdom with a view to a settlement of the claim that would
call for payment by the Salvadorans in government bonds, and an early
agreement now appears to be in prospect.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENJT CREDIT
8.        Borrower:           The Republic of El Salvador.
Beneficiary:        Comision Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del
Rio Leipa (CEL).
Amount:             Various currencies equivalent to US$5.6
million.



-3-
Purpose:            To cover the foreign exchange cost of a
33 M;W gas turbine plant (two 16.5 Y,J units)
at Soyapango; and a 115 kV transmission
line 115 kilometers long.
Amortization:       In 50 years, including a 10 year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments of
1/2 of one percent from April 15, 1981
through October 15, 1990 and 1-1/2 per-
cent from April 15, 1991 through October 15,
2020.
Service Charge:     3/4 of one percent per annum.
Relending Terms:    The proceeds of the credit to be relent to
CEL for 20 years including a 2-1/2 year
period of grace, at a rate of interest of
7-1/4 percent. CEL would carry the exchange
risk.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of the Fifth Power
Project" (PU-55a)is attached. It points out that per capita energy
consumption in El Salvador is 153 kN1h per year, slightly below the
Central American average, and that only 23 percent of the population
(roughly in line with the regional average) has access to electrical
service. CEL provides about 86 percent of all electricity generated
in the country (620 GWh in 1969) and owns over 80 percent of -total in-
stalled capacity. The company's electricity production has grown at
an average rate of 11.3 percent over the period 1959-1969, reflecting
the rapid rate of economic growth, increased urbanization and the sub-
stantial backlog in demand for power.
10.       The project is part of CEL's tentative development program
through 1976. This program will not be finalized until priorities have
been established, which will require further studies during the next
two years, including the conclusion of a survey of E1 Salvador's geo-
thermal resources which is being carried out with UNDP assistance. The
Bank, in 1969, expressed its "special interest" in this survey. What-
ever the outcome of the studies, the project is a firm part of the dev-
elopment program. The gas turbine plant is essential to ensure provi-
sion of adequate stand-by capacity in the system   particularly for
the capital city of San Salvador, which is also the dominant industrial,
commercial and financial center. The 115 kV transmission line connect-
ing San Rafael Cedros and San Miguel will represent a considerable and
needed improvement over the present 69/46 kV lines that supply the
eastern part of the country.
11.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$7.0 million,
with a foreign exchange cost of US$5.6 million which would be met by
the proposed credit. Procurement of goods and services would be on the



basis of international competitive bidding. Disbursements would be
made for the CIF cost of imported equipment and materials and for the
foreign currency cost of consultants' services.
12.       CEL, which would be responsible for the execution of the pro-
ject, is a government-owned corporation engaged almost entirely in the
generation of power, with only minor distribution activity. Retail dis-
tribution of electricity in El Salvador is almost entirely carried out
by privately owned companies, the largest of which is the Compania de
Alumbrado Electrico de San Salvador (CAESS), which operates in the capi-
tal San Salvador and its environs. CEL has successfully implemented
four Bank-financed projects for power expansion, its management is
sound and, with some continued consultantst assistance in major plan-
ning and project supervision, the company is fully capable of execu-
ting the project and operating the neu facilities.
13.       CEL's financial position is satisfactory.  It has undertaken
to maintain tariffs that would ensure a return on net fixed assets in
operation of at least 9 percent per annum (Section 4.03 of the Project
Agreement). It has also agreed not to incur any long-term debt unless
its net revenue for the previous year is at least 1.5 times the maxLraun.
debt service requirements of any subsequent year (Section 4.04).
14.       CEL proposes *to pass on the results of its increasing effi-
ciency by lowering its wholesale tariff by about 5 percent in early 1971.
Part of this reduction would be retained by the distributing agencies
and the balance would be passed on to the ultimate consumer mainly through
a reduction in the industrial tariff. The details of implementing the
proposed wholesale tariff reduction are under discussion between the Gov-
ernment, CEL and the distribution companies.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUhIENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of El Salvador and the Association and the draft Project Agreement be-
tween the Association and CEL, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Development Credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. the draft Agreements conform substantially to the pattern
of those used for projects of this kind. Before signing the Credit
Agreement, the Government has to be authorized to do so by the National
Assembly. The Agreement subsequently requires ratification by the
National Assembly.
PART V - THE ECONOIvIY
16.       A basic data sheet is annexed and an economic memorandum is
being distributed separately. The report on "Economic Development and
Prospects of Central America" (WH-170a dated June 5, 1967) concluded



- 5 -
that El Salvador's economy was faced with a period of deceleration of
growth and balance of payments and credit restraints, and that the Gov-
ernment had to strengthen its financial. position and expand investment
expenditures to counteract the contractionary tencdencies and lay the
basis for sustained growth in future years. The "Memorandum on Recent
Economic Development and Prospects of El Salvador" attached to the
President's Report to the Executive Directors of Play 21, 1969 (P-70M)
for the presentation of Loan 609-ES (Education) observed that in 1967
and 1968 the rate of GDP growth did, in fact, substantially decrease,
and that a policy of credit restraint was followed in order to avoid
balance of payments deterioration. The Government introduced during
the period new revenue measures; these were insufficient, however, to
prevent a drop in government savings, and public investment dropped
considerably instead of increasing as planned.
17.       In the first six months of 1969 El Salvador's economy gave
signs of recovering, but the disruption of trade that followed the
conflict with Honduras in July severely hit El Salvador's exports to
the Central American Common Market.  Higher cotton and coffee exports
made up for only part of the losses in Central American trade, and the
growth rate of GDP remained low. Public investment increased moderately
in 1969, but the fiscal burden arising from assistance to refugees and
military expenditures prevented a further increase of public investment
in 1970. The present economic memorandwm observes that El Salvador
must still resolve fiscal and institutional problems of the public sec-
tor as a key condition for sustaining an accelerated development effort;
but it also notes that fiscal and legislative measures introduced during
the last few months have laid the basis for a new step forward.  With
external debt service currently representing less than 4 percent of
foreign exchange earnings and with adequate foreign exchange reserves,
El Salvador is in a position to contract some additional foreign debts
on conventional terms. However, El Salvador is a poor country with
heavy population pressures and without great natural resources. Its
problems have been accentuated by the repercussions of the 1969 con-
flict. In these circumstances some external assistance on concessional
terms is justified.
PART VI - CO2PLIANCE 1TITH ARTICLES OF AGREEfENT
18.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.



- 6 -
PART VII - RECOIIMENDATION
19.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
