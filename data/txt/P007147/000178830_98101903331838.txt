APPRAISAL. OF THE SOYAPANGO GAS TURBINE PROJECT
(FIFTH POWER PROJECT)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Comision
Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa (CEL) consisting of a 33 MW gas
turbine station to be constructed at the Soyapango substation near the capital
San Salvador and a 115 kV transmission line 115 k:m long between San Rafael
Cedros and San Miguel for which the Government of El Salvador has requested
an IDA Credi-t.
ii.       The recipient of the IDA Credit would be the Government of El
Salvador. The proceeds would be relent to CEL, an autonomous wholly Govern-
ment owned corporation which is responsible for virtually all electricity
generation in the country. Four Bank loans totalling some US$25 million
have been made to CEL between 19h9 and 1963 and are fully disbursed. Ex-
perience with these loans has been satisfactory and CEL is capable of
carrying out this project with the help of its consultants and of operating it.
iii.      The project is expected to cost US$7.0 million of which the proposed
Credit of US$5.6 million represents the foreign exchange cost comprising US$3.7
million for the gas turbine plant and US$1.9 million for the line. This would
be some 21% of CEL's assumed developnent program through 1974.
iv.       The least cost means of meeting KE  %Slvador's long term future
generation requirements has been the subject of detailed studies by CEL's
consulting engineers, Harza Engineering Company International. Available
alternative power sources include hydro, geothermal and additional steam
electric plant. With the help of the UNDP, a study has been made of the
geothermal resources of El Salvador and the conclusions of the second phase
of this study are being awaited before CEL's future development plans can
be decided in detail.
v.        Irrespective of the type of plant selected for the longer term
generation development, the gas turbines included in the project are justified.
The transmission system supplying the Eastern part of El Salvador is expected
to be fully loaded by 1972 and the 115 kV line included in the project is the
least cost solution of meeting the transmission requirements of this area.
vi.       In the 9 years since 1960, when CEL agreed with the Bank to maintain
a minimum 9% rate of return on its average net fixed assets, CEL has almost
doubled its gross fixed assets to -the 1969 level of some $162 million and has
financed over half of this expansion from its internal cash generation after
debt service. In this period CEL's equity has quadrupled due to the absence
of any repayment, interest or dividend requirements on its equity and to its
having consistently exceeded the 9% agreed minimum rate of return. CEL's
liability for long term debt has decreased during this period so that by 1969,
its debt equity ratio had reached the conservative level of 34:66.



- ii -
vii.      At current tariff levels CEL would continue to generate more funds
than is necessary for the normal financing of its expansion program and the
Government and CEL intend to reduce CEL's wholesale tariffs by about 5% in
early 1971, part of which would be passed on to the retail consumers. This
report assumes that such a reduction wi1l be implemented.
viii.     Over the 5 years 1970 through 1974 58% of CEL's estimated capital
expenditure of US$33 million is expected to be financed from its net cash
generation after debt service. The remainder is expected to be financed
from foreign loans including the proposed IDA Credit.
ix.       The project would be suitable for an ILA Credit of US$5.6 million
to be relent to CEL at not less than the prevailing IBRD interest rate for
a term of 20 years including a grace period of 2-1/2 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE SOYAPANGO GAS TURBINE PROJECT
(FIFTH POW-ER PROJECT)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of El Salvador has requested a Credit from the
International Development Association (IDA) to assist in financing the
expansion program of the Comision Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa
(CEL), the Government owned autonomous corporation. CEL is responsible for
the development and operation of power facilities in the country. An IDA
Credit of US$5.6 million equivalent is proposed to cover the foreign exchange
cost of a project, the total cost of which is US$7.0 million. The Borrower
would be the Government of El Salvador, which would relend the proceeds to
CEL on conventional terms.
1.02      The Project would comprise the construction of a 33 MW gas turbine
station at the Soyapango substation to ensure an adequate supply of power to
San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, and the construction of a 115 kV
transmission line to strengthen CEL's system supplying the eastern half of
the country.
1.03      Since 19h9 CEL has received 4 Bank loans totalling US$25.4 million
to cover the foreign exchange cost of projects as follows:

unit and the construction of the
30 NWAcajutla Thermal Plant.
The Bank's experience on the above loans has been satisfactory.
1.04      This report is based on a feasibility study prepared by CEL's
consultants Harza Engineering Company International and on an appraisal by
Messrs. W.F. 1Cupper and A.J.D. Hutchins who visited E1 Salvador in June/July
1970.

2. THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
General
2.01      El Salvador, the smallest but most densely2populated Central
American country, has a land area of about 21,009 km .  Its population,
estimated at 3.4 million (160 inhabitants per km ) in mid 1969, is growing
at an annual rate of about 3.7%. Gross national product (GNP) increased
some 5.6% in real terms between 1961 and early 1969 when an armed conflict
with Honduras caused a general slowdown in the economy. This slowdown is
expected to be temporary. Per capita GDP is about US$280 (1969), somewhat
lower than the average for Central America. Prices have been remarkably
stable. The colon has maintained its present rate of exchange of 2.5 to the
US dollar since 1934; during the 7 years prior to early 1969, cost of living
rose less than 1% per annum.
2.02      Although one of the most industrialized of the Central American
nations, El Salvador still depends to a large extent upon agriculture, which
amounts to about 30% of GNP. The two main crops are cotton and coffee and
the latter accounted for about 40% of the 1968 exports. Up to 1969, the
industrial sector has been expanding at an annual rate of about 10%, con-
tributing some 20% to GNP. Major industries are vegetable oils, yarns and
fabrics, cigarettes, beer and wheat products. In recent years, a cement
factory, fertilizer plant, an oil refinery, a synthetic fiber plant and a
glass factory have started operation.
2.03      Per capita energy consumption increased at a rate of 7.5% per year
from 80 kWh in 1960 to 153 kWh in 1969, slightly below the estimated average
of 165 kWh for Central America. Almost 23% of the population receives electric
service, which is about equal to the average for Central America.
Background
2.04      The regulatory procedures for the power sector function satisfactorily.
The basic law for Electric Services dates from 1936 and together with the sub-
sequent interpretations, regulations and laws passed to cater for specific
situations such as the provision of the legal basis for Municipal Electricity
Companies and for CEL, forms a reasonably comprehensive basis for regulation
of the power sector. The regulating agency is the Inspeccion General de
Servicios Electricos under the Minister of Economy, whose powers, however, are
restricted to the practical work involved in the financial and technical
inspections of the private sector companies. The Minister of Economy decides
all policy questions concerning the power sector and is advised by CEL's
General Manager, the Director of the regulating agency and an officer of his
ministry.
2.05      Prior to the creation of CEL in 1945, the country was exclusively
served by private companies of which the Compania de Alumbrado Electrio *lc  e
San Salvador (CAESS), a Salvadorar. company which is a suboidiary of t~h! (narTiaarn
International Power Company of Montreal, serving the capital and its environ; was;
the most important. CEL was established as a Government institution to study the
possibilities of developing the hydro resources of the Rio Lempa to meet the
country's power requirements. With the assistance of the Bank, CEL has provided
practically all generating and transmission facilities since 1954 and has



-3-
interconnected all except one of the companios serving the country. In
1196]., CEL also initiated a village electrification program and by the end
of 1969 supplied power to some 220 villages and major consumers. Practically
all villages of 300 inhabitants or more are now connected to the integrated
network.
2.06      The 1969 statistics for the power sector, shown in Annex 1, illus-
trate the importance of CEL in meeting electricity requirements. CEL provided
about 86% of the 620 GWh generated in El Salvador; the private companies
generated only about 9% and captive plants the remaining 5%.
CEL's Market and Facilities
2.07      CEL's interconnected system serves the whole country, with the
other companies serving mainly as distributors. The attached map shows the
principal details of the transmission system and the zones served by the
various companies. CAESS is CEL's largest customer, retailing about three
quarters of all electric energy in the country, and providing an adequate
service.
2.08      The interconnected system presently comprises about 200 km of
115 kV lines, 90 km of 69 kV lines and 400 km of subtransmission lines at
,44, 35, and 22 kV. CEL's generating plant, totalling 166 MW, is detailed in
Annex 2 and comprises:
-    The "15 de Noviembre" hydro plant at Guayabo on the Rio Lempa - 81 MW
-    The Guajoyo hydro plant at Lake Guija - 15 MW
-    The Acajutla thermal plant on the Pacific Coast - 70 MW
These plants are all interconnected by the 115 kV lines which also connect
San Salvador, the capital, to the system at the Soyapango substation. All
generating plants belonging to the other companies, except for one, are
connected to the system by lines operating at 44 kV and less.
2.09      Under its village electrification program, CEL has built since 1961
about 900 km of 13.2 kV lines and practically all the distribution facilities
in the villages to which service has been extended. The eastern half of the
country is presently supplied by means of a 69 kV line between San Rafael
Cedros and San Miguel (see map).
Electric Power Rates
2.10      CEL is not subject to the general regulating law (seepamgraph 2.11) but
its charter gives it the authority, with approval of the Minister of Economy,
to establish power rates to cover its costs and meet its obligations under
agreements with its creditors. Existing Loan Agreements with the Bank specify
a minimum rate of return of 9% on net fixed assets in operation and during
negotiations it was agreed that this rate of return provision would be repeated
for the proposed Credit. CEL has exceeded this requirement consistently since
1960 and has been able to finance major parts of its planned expansion (see
paragraph 3.04).



- 4 -
2.11      All other electricity companies in El Salvador are subject to the
general regulatory law, which provides that tariffs should be reduced if any
company's return on its "patrimonio"l (substantially equivalent to net equity)
exceeds 8%. If this return is consistently below the 8% the companies may
request a tariff adjustment. Only CAESS has initiated such a request recently.
2.12      Annex 3 shows the main bulk and retail power rates for CEL and for
the four largest distributors in El Salvador. CEL's bulk rates are the major
factors controlling the retail tariffs in the country. Generally the retail
tariff structures in El Salvador produce adequate revenues and are consistent
internally. They show acceptable block rates for domestic tariffs and two
part rates for commercial and industrial tariffs; the energy charges in the
lowest block rates being somewhat higher than the marginal cost of production.
2.13      At current tariff levels CEL would continue to generate more funds
than is necessary for the normal financing of its expansion program. The
Government and CEL intend to reduce CEL's wholesale tariff by about 5% in 1971.
2.14      During negotiations the Government informed the Association that it
intended to sharze CEL's proposed reduction in wholesale tariffs between the
industrial retail consumers and the distribution companies. The respective
shares will depend on the outcome of discussions now going on between the
Government and the distribution companies, but present indications are that
about 50% of the total reduction is likely to be retained by the companies.
Such a reduction in CAESS' cost of purchased electricity could provide a substi-
tute for its request for a retail tariff increase (seeparagraph 2.11).
PFture Developments
2.15      CEL's main concern over the next five years is expected to be
the provision of adequate generating capacity and the reinforcement of its
present transmission and distribution system to improve reliability and to
carry heavier loads. Major extensions of the transmission system are not
likely to be required in this period.
2.16      CEL's consultants have shown, after considering several alterna-
tives (see paragraph 5.03), that the development program should include a
gas turbine plant as a first step to ensure reliability of service until
the necessary studies can be made to determine the priorities of the subse-
quent steps of development (see paragraph 4.04). Possible future developments
include another large hydro project, a geothermal plant and further extensions
of CEL'sAcajutla steam-electric station.
2.17      In 1965 the United Nations Special Fund approved a grant towards a
survey of the geothermal resources of El Salvador by a team of consultants.
Large quantities of steam and hot water were found to be available in the
Ahuachapan area near the border of Guatemala. In 1969 the UNDP approved a further
program comprising detailed surveys and the preparation of a final feasibility
study of geothermal generation within the context of CEL's development program.
In May 1969 the Bank expressed its "special interest" in the further exi{.-jtion
of the geothermal investigation and is accordingly receiving regular report3i
on the feasibility study which is expected to be completed by mid 1971 (see
paragraph 4.o4).



2.18      The decision on the power sources and their sizes in CEL's future
generation program depends on the result of the above geothermal feasibility
study and on finding a solution to the land acquisition problems of the
proposed hydro project (see paragraph 4.04), so it is unlikely that any firm
decision will be made much before mid 1971.

3. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      CEL; an autonomous corporation created by Congress in 1945 and
wholly government owned, is financially sound, effectively managed and em-
ploys a reasonably sized staff for its stage of development and activities.
It is responsible for the development of El Salvador's hydro resources, par-
ticularly those of the Rio Lempa, and for any other means of generating
electricity. Since 1959, CEL has also been responsible for the development
of distribution facilities in those parts of the country not served by other
companies, but 96% of its sales in 1969 were still on a wholesale basis and
distribution is expected to remain a marginal activity.
Organization and Management
3.02      The Board of Directors is composed of seven persons of high stand-
ing. The Chairman is appointed by the Minister of Interior, three members are
appointed by the Ministers of Economy, Agriculture and Livestock, and Development
and Industry, one by the country's banks, one by the local bondholders of CEL
and one member is selected by the Minister of Economy from a list of six candi-
dates presented by specified commercial organizations in El Salvador. The
members serve staggered terms not exceeding four years and are eligible for re-
appointment. The Chairman has held office since 1950. The Board controls broad
policy. It appoints a General Manager who is responsible for all administrative
functions. The present General Manager is very capable and has been in office
since 1956.
3.03      CEL employs about 640 regular staff of whom some 15% are engaged in
the operation of its direct distribution system. CEL formerly employed an ex-
patriate adviser on utility operation who retired recently and is not being
replaced because its staff is now capable of meeting the operational and tech-
nical requirements of its expanding system. CEL uses the services of its
consultants, Harza Engineering Company International of Chicago, for major
planning and construction supervision and with their assistance is, on the
basis of past performance, fully capable of carrying out the construction of
the Project and of operating it.
Present Financial Position
3.04      In the 9 years since 1960, when CEL agreed with the Bank to maintain
a minimum 9% rate of return on its average net fixed assets, CEL has almost
doubled its gross fixed assets to the 1969 level of some 0162 million and
has financed over half of this expansion from internal cash generation after
debt service. In this period CEL's equity has about quadrupled due to the
absence of any repayment, interest or dividend requirements on its equity
and to CEL having consistently exceeded the 9% agreed minimum rate of return.
CEL's long term debt has decreased during this period so that by 1969, its debt
equity ratio had reached the conservative level of 34:66.

3.o6      Depreciation is on a straightline basis and the present overall
accumulated depreciation at 20% of the 1969 gross fixed assets is reasonable
although some rates of individual classes of assets appear to be on the low
side. During negotiations CEL agreed that as of 1971 it would increase its
depreciation rates from 3% per annum for gas turbines and steam-electric plant
to 5% and 4% respectively and would when applicable depreciate any future
geothermal, electric plant an an annual rate of 4%.
Pa,, b,arnin-s
3.07      CEL's return on its average net assets in operation has averaged
11.2% over the past three years and was 12% in 1969 (Annex 5). The main
features of the 1969 Income Statement are:

3.08      In the period 1966 through 1969, CEL's sales increased from 015.3
million to 020.2 million (32%) whilst its operating costs (excluding fuel
and depreciation) rose from 02.3 million to 03.3 million (h4%). This un-
favorable trend of operating cost is not expected to continue as the major
increase in the 1966/1969 period was due to a sharply increasing activity



in distribution in rural areas, where sales almost tripled. Total monthly
employed staff increased by 59 (35%) of which 22 were for village distribution,
21 for planning, 12 for administration, 3 for transmission and one for gener-
ation. This staff is now adequate to handle the work for several years.
Debt Limitation
3.09      Section 5.09 of IBRD Loan 3h2-ES prohibits 5EL from incurring long-
term debt without the Bank's agreement unless net revenue for the preceding
fiscal year, plus part of the estimated net revenues to be derived from current
works and from the proposed project, are together not less than 1.5 times CEL's
maximum future total debt service requirements on all loans including the
proposed loan. During negotiations CEL agreed that for the proposed credit the
above covenant be substituted by a more simple one requiring that future debt
service be covered not less than 1.5 times by the previous fiscal year's net
revenue.
Auditors
3.10      CEL is required under the existing Bank loans to have its accounts
audited by independent public accountants satisfactory to the Bank, and
Salvadoran law requires that auditors of Government-owned undertakings be
appointed annually by the Central Reserve Bank. During negotiations the
Government undertook to use its best efforts to cause independent auditors
acceptable to the Association to be appointed as CEL's auditors, although
it was pointed out that the Government was legally not in a position
to require the Central Reserve Bank to appoint a specified auditor. CEL
itself has undertaken to have its accounts audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association.

14. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed IDA project would comprise the So./apango gas turbine
station with two 16.5 MWJ units of the standard industrial type and the
construction of a 115 kV lattice steel tower supported, single circuit trans-
mission line 115 km long between San Rafael Cedros and San Miguel (see map);
both facilities would be commissioned by early 1973. The IDA project includes
only the first two firm steps in a much larger development program which is
otherwise still tentative (see paragraph 4.04).
Present Frogram
4.02      GEL's present program consists only of the continuing electrification
of small villages and the completion by the end of 1970 of a 115 kV transmission
line linking the Acajutla steam-electric plant to the Guajoyo-San Salvador
transmission line at Nejapa, and the construction of a second substation for
San Salvador at San Antonio Abad.
Future Program
4.03      CEL's consultants have defined a tentative development program for
generation and transmission to meet power requirements through 1976 (see
paragraph 5.03). This program comprises the following works:
(i)  a 33 MW geothermal plant at Ahuachapan (see paragraph 2.17) to be
commissioned by the end of 1974 together with a 115 kV transmission
line, 35 km long, to connect the plant to CEL's system;
(ii) the extension of the Acajutla thermal plant by a 66 MW unit in 1975
and another in 1976, together with a 230 kV line, about 80 km long,
between Acajutla and San Salvador;
(iii)  a 115 kV line paralleling the existing line which connects the
t"5 de Noviembre" hydro plant at Guayabo with San Salvador, scheduled
for construction in 1974/1975.
L.04      The above program, however, requires further study and possible
revision in the next two years, in view of the following uncertainties:
i)   The report on the first phase of the UNDP study for geothermal
development has estimated that capacity of about 120 MW would be
available for a period of 25 years in the Ahuachapan geothermal
field and it recommended that a final study be made to investigate
the feasibility of installing a 33 MW plant to start with.  The
second phase of the study is presently in execution (see paragraph
2.17). One of the major prcblems of the whole proposed geothermal
program still to be resolved, is the disposal of the highly salted
and boron contaminated water component of the geothermal effluent;
the feasibility of returning some of the effluent to earth through
recharging wells is being investigated. Since the timing, stages
and degree of developnent of the geothermal field depend on the
outcome of these investigations, the assumption that the first
geothermal unit would be of 33 MW capacity and on the line in 1974
can still only be regarded as tentative; and,



- 10 -
ii)   CEL has studied the further developnent of the Rio Lenpa, and
the most promising hydro project appears to be the "Poza del
Silencio" plant upstream from the "5 de Novniobrell plant at
Guayabo (see map) which would take about five years to build,
Initial capacity would be 126 MW but extuensions up to 350 MW
appear feasible. CEL, however, does not wish to begin final
studies unless the problems of land acquisition and displacEment
of farmers and sugar-mill workers are satisfactorily solved.
Should the geothermal or hydro projects be delayed, the capacity of the
Acajutla thermal generating station can readily be increased.
4.05      The plan for proceeding with the Soyapango gas turbine station is
firm and this installation would be independent of any of the alternative
future generation developments. All of the programs investigated (see para-
graphs 5.03 and 5.04) show this station to be the most economic means of
meeting CEL's immediate power requiremients.
Project Estimated Cost
4[.o6     Details of the cost estimates are shown in Annex 7.  The following
is a summary:
Foreign    Local    Total    Foreign   Local    Total
_______-- 01,000        -       ------ US$1,000 -
'Gas Turbine plant         8,0oo        800    9,200      3,360        320   3,680

4.07      The proposed IDA Credit would finance the foreign exchange cost of the
Soyapango gas turbine station (US$3.7 million) and of the San Rafael Cedros/San
Miguel transmission line (US$1.9 million).
h.o8      The estimates for the gas turbine plant are based on recent quotat-ions
obtained by the consultants from various manufacturers; costs for the transmission
line and substations are based on current experience for similar work in E1
Salvador.  A contingency allowance of about 8% of the estimated foreign exchange
construction cost and about 24% of such local cost (mainly to cover uncertainties
in right of way payments for the line) has been included and should be adequate.
It is not considered necessary to make a separate provision for possible nrice
escalation during the construction period since it is expected that the maJor
contracts involving foreign exchange wlil  be awarded in the near future on a
firm price basis.

Engineering and Construction
14.0)9    Engineering design and the supervision of construction would be
carrje(i out by UJI,'L7 consultants, Harza Engineering Company International,
wt,o wouldl continue to be engaged under its present contract with CEL. This
is; acceptable to IDA.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.10      Procurement of equipment, and selection of civil works and erection
contractors, would follow the Bank Group's international bidding procedures.
No contracts are expected to be awarded before the signing of the Credit.
4.11      Disbursement, expected to be completed before the end of 1973, would
be made for the foreign exchange component of the Project. Annex 8 shows the
estimated quarterly disbursements for the proposed Credit. The closing Date
would be December 31, 1973. Should the Project cost less than estimated, any
savings from the Credit would be cancelled.



- 12 -
5. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      Historic and forecast salesare shown in Annex 9 ana Annex 1(0.
The trend in CEL's sales for the last decade shows an average anmual 11.3%
growth rate.  During the same period however, a minimum of 2% and a mraxinum
of 18% occurred.  fue to the slowdown in economic activity (see paragrapi
2.01) the growth rate dropped from 11% in 1968 to 7% in 1969.
5.02      To forecast GEL's future sales through 19741, it was conservatively
assumed (see Annex 11) that CEL's growth rate would be 8% in 1970 increasing
each year by 1%, stabilizing again at about 11% in 1973. The systemi load
factor, which increased from U8* in 1963 to about 56% in 1969, reflecting
an increased proportion of industrial sales, is satisfactory and is expected
to average 55%.  Losses, including station supplies, averaging about 6% in
the past five years are assumed to rermain at this low level in view of the
improved transmission and substation facilities to be completed during the
period.
5.03      The power development program tentatively defined by the consultuants,
as detailed in paragraph 4.03, is based upon a computerized analysis of 25
alternative programs which include combinations of geothermal, steam-electric
and hydroelectric plant.  As stated in paragraph  .   a final detenninaDLon
of the priority of future steps involves further on-site studies during the
next two years.  In the meantime it is essential to provide adequate reserve
capacity for the system and in particular for the capital San Salvador, a
city of 300,000 inhabitants, to ensure continuity of service in the event
of a transmission line failure, an unscheduled outage at -the generating
plants, or unusual drought conditions.  Under the present system con;iitions
supply to San Salvador is by means of a single circuit transmission -ine
which could become disconnected during a system equipment failure and couli
result in a total loss of power.
5.0L      The consultants have compared the alternative types of plant
which would be suitable for this reserve and have shown that for discolni
rates of up to 15%, a 33 PIN gas turbine plant would be the least cost
alternative and is ideally suited for the standby duty required. It has
a low capltal cost and is suitable for quick and frequent starts and. stops.
It is the type of equipment universally employed for this duty.
5.05      Three alternative transmission schemes were studied to imnrove the
supply to the eastern part of the country (see Annex 11) where the o9 kV
system and part of the 46 kV system are expected to be fully loaded by the
end of 1972 at the assumed load growth.  The least cost solution of meeting
the transmission requirements would be the completion of a new 115 kV line
by the end of 1972 and the conversion of the 69 kV line to 115 kV by the
end of 1977.
5.06      The incremental financial return on CELIs 1970-1976 syster, expanslon
program is estimated to approximate 11.5%. (Annex 11.)

6. FINANCING PLAN AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Financing Plan
6.ol      Despite an assumed reduction of 5% in tariffs (see paragraph
6.07), CEL is expected to finance 58% of its 1970-1974 capital program from
its own resources after debt service. The main features of the proposed
financing plan (Annex 6) are:-
Equivalent    Capital

1/ Balance of a US42 million 1969 IADB loan borroiwed through the Central
Reserve Bank towards the construction of the Acajutla/Nejapa line.
The loan is repayable by CEL by 1973.



- 14 -
6.02      The proposed IDA Credit of US$5.6 million advanced to the Govermnent
of El Salvador on standard IDA terms would be relent by the Government to CEL
at an assumed 7-1/4% interest with a commitment charge of 3/4% for a term of
20 years including a grace period of 2-1/2 years.
6.03      A future foreign loan of Oll million (US$5.6 million) has been
assumed in 1971 to cover the foreign exchange cost of the proposed Geo-
thermal No. 1 unit. The foreign exchange costs of the two proposed Acajutla
units would be met by a second future foreign loan of 037 million (US4.'l.8
million) assumed to be obtained in 1973. Froml these two loans, assumed to
be on terms similar to Bank loans, a13.3 million and ¢4 million respectively
would have been drawn down by 1975.
6.o04     CEL's cash position through 1971 is expected to be adequate with
the last ¢0.5 million of an existing short-term advance from t-he Central
Bank being repaid in 1971. From 1971 a rapid build up of cash is projected
until 1974, when heavy local expenditure on the Acajutla No. 3 and No. 14
plant is expected to reduce the cash balance to a normal required working
capital level of about ¢2.2 million.
6.05      In the period 1970 through 1974 CEL's internally generated cash is
expected to average more than twice its debt service requirement for the period.
The lowest coverage is expected in 1971 when debt service is covered 1.6 times.
Income Statemnt Projections
6.o6      CEL's rate of return of net operating income on its average net fixed.
assets in operation is expected to average 10.9% for 1970 through 1974. The
lowest rate of return is expected to be in 1971 with a return of 9.9%.
6.07      The forecast sales revenue in Annex 5 assumes a tariff decrease in
1971 which would reduce CEL's revenue from 1971 through 19714 by some 57 or about
05.5 million below the amount it would be with the present tariff (paragranh
2.13).  CEL's sales in GWh are expected to increase by 8%, 9c and 10% in 1970,
1971 and 1972 respectively and by 11% in both 1973 and 1974 although its
revenue for 1971 shows an increase of only 3.3% because of the assumLed rate
reduction. The forecast average sales return of 14.00 centavos (US01.6) per
kliE in 1970 drops to 3.79 Ctvs. in 1971 due mainly to the assumed rate reduction
and then continues to decline slowly to 3.76 Ctvs. per kWh by 19714.
6.08      CEL's exoected costs of operations other than fuel, reflect normal
increases due to expanding activities with a specific increase in 1970 because
of the new head office building occupied in late 1969. Fuel costs are based
on the addition of Acajutla No. 2 for 1970, the Soyapango gas turbine in
October 1972 and Geothermal No. 1 in late 1974. Depreciation is based on
existing rates as anended by the agreement with CEL during negotiations
(see 7.01 (d)). During 1971 through 19714, almost %0.5 million of past non-
productive preliminary studies have also been amortized.



- 15 -
Balance 3     Pe- Projections
6.09     MIajor additions to CEL's fixed asse-ts in operation for 1970 through
197Th include the new office building and Acajutla No. 2 (both physically
completed in late 1969), and t>he 115 kV Acajutla/Nejapa line in 1970, the
Soyapango gas turbine station in 1973 and the Geothermal No. 1 plant in
1974. W!ork in progress at December 31, 1974 of $27.9 million would cormprise
the Acajutla No. 3 and No. 4 steam plant ($24 million), the 230 kV Acajutla/
San Salvador line (02 million) and miscellaneous substations, distribution etc.
(01.9 million).
6.10      Intangible assets at December 31, 1974 include $3.7 million balance
of costs for geothermal studies after capitalizing some $1.5 million of the
study costs with the No. 1 unit.  "Other" studies of 0h.5 million reflect an
additional ¢1.6 million expected to be spent after 1969 on further studies
for hydro generation and miscellaneous other projects less about $0.5 million
written off.
6mll      CEL's equity is expected to continue to grow from its $88 million
in 1969 to 41L9 million in 1974 through the accumulation of increasing
surpluses each year. The total debt, ¢46 million in 1969, is expected
to be   1.)4 million in 1974 resulting in a still lower debt equity ratio of
26:74.  The debt would comprise the balance of the existing IBRD loans
($19.9 million), the proposed Govermnent loan fron the IDA Credit (M3.3
million), the assumed 1971 and 1973 future foreign loans ($13.3 million and
A¢40 million respectively) and the balances of miscellaneous bonds and
suppliers' credits (some 00.9 million).

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED DUJRING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
a.  the covenant in existing Bank loans requiring a rate of return
of 9% on average fixed assets would be repeated for the proposed Credit
(paragraph 2.10);
b.  the debt covenant in existing Bank loans would be replaced by a sijrn>ler
covenant for the proposed Credit, requiring the future debt service
to be covered not less than 1.5 times by the previous fiscal year's
net revenue (paragraph 3.09);
c. CEL will have its accounts and financial statements audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association.  The Government
will use its best efforts to cause such auditors to be appointed
(paragraph 3.10);
d.  CEL will increase as of 1971 its depreciation rates for gas turbiries
and steam-electric plant to 5% and 4% per annum respectively and
would, when applicable, depreciate any future geothermal-electric
plant at an annual rate of 4% (paragraph 3.06).
7.02      During negotiations CEL informed the Association that it expects
to decrease its tariffs in early 1971 by about 5%; the Government and CEL
are presently discussing with the distributing companies the portion of
CEL's expected tariff decrease which will be allocated to a reduction in
retail tariffs, the remainder being retained by the distributing companies
to recover accumulated past deficits and to obtain an 8% return on
"patrimonio". Such discussions are proceeding satisfactorily. (Paragraphs
2.11, 2.13 and 2.14.)

THE ELECTRIC POWER RATES
i.        The main existing electricity tariffs are detailed on the
attached list on page 2. CEL's bulk tariff consists of two parts:
(a)   a demand charge of A5 per kW per annum to the larger retail
companies (CAESS, CLESA, CLES, CLEA, DEUSEM and DESSEM, see Annex
1 for each compary's full name), a demand charge J50 per kW per
annum to the remaining distributors, the Government Water Supply
Company and Minas Monte Cristo, which is in accordance with the
present incremental cost of supplying additional power.
(b)   an energy charge of three centavos per kWh, which is somewhat
higher than the short-run cost of production.
The fact that the demand charge is based on the annual peak, which due to
seasonal factors generally occurs in December, causes retroactive billing.
CEL is presently studying the possibility of changing to a monthly demand
charge of one twelfth of the above amounts.
ii.       The retail tariffs of all companies including CEL itself are
grouped consistently subject to slight modifications to take into account
the particularities of the various systems, consuners and relative levels
of demand. For this reason some companies have special tariffs (not shown
on the attached list) to cater for special consumers. For instance, CAESS
has a special tariff for Government and Municipal connections which, however,
is basically in accordance with the domestic tariff.
iii.      All retail tariffs have a rational structure with stepped energy
rates. The commercial and industrial tariffs (except F5 of CLES) reflect
a demand charge in that the energy charges are specified per kW of demand
or connected load. Since, with only a few exceptions, demand as the basis
for billing, is not metered but is calculated on the basis of connected
load, an annual demand charge exists throughout the system for the relevant
tariffs.

Justification of the Proposed IDA Project
This Annex is in four parts:
A.        Basis of the Forecast of CEL's Sales and Demand;
B.        Comparison of Alternative Development Programs;
C.        Justification of the Gas Turbine Plant; and
D.        Justification of the 115 kV Transmission Line - San Rafael Cedros/
San Miguel - Determination of the least cost situation.
A. Forecasts of Sales and Demand
1.        CEL's consultants, in their feasibility study of May 1969, have
forecast CEL's sales and demand on the basis of the country's overall
electricity statistics. They have assumed a close correlation between CEL's
market and the electricity market of the whole country because CEL has
generated 80%-85% of m Salvador's requirements over the last decade. The
exponential fitted trend line for this period shows a country growth rate
of 10.4% with a standard deviation of h.7% as compared with that of CEL of
11.3% with a standard deviation of 4.8%.  The consultants assumed a slightly
higher growth rate of 12% for CEL's future sales, taking into account both the
country's stable economic development over the past ten years, and CEL's
recent extensive development in the rural areas.
2.        Due to the economic slowdown in 1969 (see Paragraph 2.01) CEL's
growtii rate dropped to about 7% for that year; for this reason the consultants'
estimates of future growth rates of sales and demand were modified during the
appraisal.  In the past, the country's annual growth rate of sales has varied
between a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 18%. The power market fluctuations
are increasingly reflecting the wide variations in industrial sales (which,
for example, dropped from an 11.6% growth rate in 1968 to 6.3% in 1969
compared with 10.8% to 7.4% for residential sales) since the share of
industrial sales in the market thas been steadily increasing from 32% in
1959 to 44% in 1969; this is illustrated in the following table.

3.        Since the growth of industrial sales may be assumed to depend on
the growth of the economy and in view of the fact that the share of industrial
sales in the market is relatively high, total sales are expected to depend
to a major degree on the rate of recovery of the economy. Prospects point
to a moderate improvement of the economy during the next few years and it
was therefore assumed during appraisal that CEL's annual growth rate of
sales would increase from the 1969 figure of 7% to 8% in 1970, increasing
each year by 1%.  This results in an average annual rate of increase of
about 10% for the period 1970-1974 (see Annex 9 and 10).
14.       CEL's load factor improved from 48% in 1963 to 56% in 1969, again
reflecting the increased share in the market of industrial sales. Because
no good reason could be seen for departing from the consultants estimateof
a load factor of 55%, this estimate has been used in Annex 9 to forecast
demand.
5.        CAESS's share of CEL's total sales has been decreasing slowly
(to 81.5% in 1969) due to CEL's expansion in the rural areas. Forecasts for
each of the smaller distribution companies, and for CEL's rural supplies
were not available so the trend of CAESS diminishing share of the market
(about 1% annually) has been assumed to continue throughout the forecast
period. A tentative estimate of CEL's sales to the various distributing
companies is shown in Annex 10.
6.        For the comparison of alternative development programs, the
consultant's estimate of a 12% growth rate in demand (see paragraph 1 above)
was used to schedule future generation additions.
B. Comparison of Alternative Development Programs
7.        CEL has systematically and continuously explored the hydro power
sources in the country and three projects, all on the Rio Lempa, appear
to be attractive:
(i) Poza del Silencio - Initial capacity would be 126 MW but further
extensions to about 350 MW would be possible. This project has
been fully studied, but, the future reservoir site in part covers
a sugar cane plantation and some farms for which expropriation



AMNEX 11
Page 3 of 6 pages
problems have arisen. Also the practical and social problems of
displacing farmers and sugarmill workers have not yet been solved.
(ii) La Pintada - The 58 MW capacity of this run of the river project
could be raised to 80 MW if the Poza del Silencio project is
executed. Preliminary studies have been made for this project.
(iii) El Tigre - This plant offers the largest hydro electric power
potential in El Salvador with 280 MW initial capacity and 1,300 GWh
annually (double the country's present requirements for electricity).
With Poza del Silencio built up-stream, El Tigre's capacity can
be increased to about 400 MW.  Preliminary studies have shown that
the reservoir area would extend into Honduras and the project would
require an international agreement.
8.        Only thermal plant could be completed in time to meet the minimum
standby requirements at the end of 1972 and the consultants considered the
following plant possibilities as the first step in CEL's development program:
- 33 NW steam electric,
- 66 MW steam electric.,
- 33 MW gas turbine,
- 66 MW combined (gas turbine/steam) cycle
9.        The consultants defined 25 development programs for computerized
analysis, comprising the above alternative thermal plant as the first step
with subsequent suitable combinations of thermal plant (including a 33 MW
geothermal plant) and the 3 hydro projects.  Due attention was paid to
reserve requirements, required transmission facilities, operational costs,
and system effects. The total cost of these programs were compared using
the discounted cash flow method for various discount rates.
C. Justification of the Gas Turbine Plant
10.       The comparisons show that 33 MW gas turbine plant would be the
least cost choice for the first step in any development program regardless
of the plant to follow, for discount rates up to 15%. Since the opportunity
cost of capital in El Salvador may reasonably be expected not to exceed 15%,
the consultants' recommendation to install this plant appears justified.
11.       In accordance with sound electric utility practice CEL, since 1963,
has followed the principle of having available reserve capacity equal to the
size of its largest unit (presently the recently commissioned 33 MW unit
at Acajutla). In line with this principle, 33 MW in reserve capacity would
be required by 1972.  It should be noted, however, that the 81 MW "5 de
Noviembre" hydro plant at Guayabo is connected to the system by means of a
single circuit line. A second line will not be constructed before 1975.
Thus a restriction of the reserve capacity to the capacity of the largest
(33 MW) unit increases the risk that demand may not be met during outages.
This danger is further increased during dry years when the Guayabo plant firm



ANNEX 11
Page 4 of 6 pages
capacity may be reduced to about 60 Nd in the period December through May, and
so a reserve capacity of 33 MW appears to be no more than marginal. The
consultants, however, have shown that the probability of total system forced
outage is unlikely to exceed the equivalent of 0.5 days annually and on this
basis KEL has decided to continue its practice of limiting the reserve to
the capacity of the largest unit in the system.
12.       The consultants' forecast of operations shows that under average
conditions the propcsed gas turbine plant would generate only relatively
small amounts of energy equivalent to a few hundred hours of use annually.
This is because the plant is expected to operate only during unusual dry
periods, during exceptional system outages, and during periods prior to the
installation of new plant. Depending upon the type of capacity added in the
future, load dispatch analyses may show economic advantages in the use of
the gas turbines for peaking purposes.
13.       It would be difficult to calculate the plant's economic worth as
reserve capacity. However, the value of reserve capacity can be considered
as analogous to the premium one would be willing to pay for an insurance
policy. This would depend upon the number of hours which the power system
is likely to be at risk without reserve capacity. On a system such as that
in El Salvador this is likely to be of the order of 500 hours per year.
Given that the total annual cost of the gas turbine is about US$320,000,
then the "insurance" being paid against total collapse of the major part
of the power system is US$640 per hour at risk, which is very low. On the
other hand, the plant is the initial stage of an extensive program which
has been shown (see paragraph 10 above) to be the least cost choice. A
calculation has therefore been made to determine the incremental financial
return on the program.
14.       Incremental capital expenditures were taken as the cash expenditures
for the first seven years of GEL's most likely development program. Incremental
revenues were based on the tariffs in the financial forecast (see Annex 5)
assuming a lowest average rate of 3.76 Ctvs/kWh from 1974 onward and the
incremental supply reaching its maximum limit of about h00 GWh by 1976.
Incremental operating costs were taken as the increase in the cash operating
expenses of the CEL system. These costs were assumed to reach their upper
limit by 1976. On the basis of the above assumptions, the incremental
financial rate of return on the program is expected to range between 7.8%
and 15.2% with a mean of 11.5%.

D.  Justification of the 115 kV Transmission Line San Rafael Cedros - San IIiguel
IJ.I L,,tcrrriJrj.,i,or of t..e least, cost solution
15.       The present 69 kV line supplying the eastern part of the country
is expected to be fully loaded by the end of 1972. Transformer capacity
could then be added, requiring substation extensions. Capacitor banks would
be required to hold voltage drop to a reasonable level. Even so, by 1975, this
line would have to be converted to 115 kV and an additionalline would have to
be commissioned before the end of 1977.
16.       A comparison was made of the following alternatives to meet the
same sales forecast:
Alternative 1 - The program as described in paragraph 18 above.
Alternative 2 - A program comprising the conversion of the 69 kV line to 115 kV
by the end of 1972 and completion of an additional 115 kV line by the end of
1977.
Alternative 3 - The commissioning of a new 115 kV line by the end of 1972, as
included in the IDA project1 and conversion of the present 69 kV line to
115 kV by ttie end of 1977.
17.       The basic assumptions used in the comparisons were:
1.  Alternative 1 only:
a. Cost of additional transformer capacity and substations extensions-
01.6 million
b.  Additional L6 kV line Triunfo - Usulutan - 00.4 million.
c. The new transmission line would be conmissioned in 1975
(immediately prior to converting the 69 kV line) instead of
1977 because the present value of the temporary installation
in San Miguel of a gas turbine in 1977 to provide uninterrupted
service,for a period of L months, would greatly exceed the
present value of the earlier construction (in 1975) of the
115 kV line.
2.  Alternative 2 _onl:
Cost of temporary installation of one of the Soyapango gas turbines
at San Miguel for a period of about h months to allow for uninter-
rupted service:
a.  ¢1.0 million for installation, temporary facilities and removal.
b. 00.7 million for operational cost including fuel.
3. Common to all Alternatives
a. Cost of conversion of the 69 kV line to 115 kV - 02.3 million.



ANNEX 11
Page 6 of 6 pages
b.  Cost of the new 115 kV line - 07.1 million.
c.  Operational cost of one line 00.190 million per annum and for
two lines 00.360 million.
d.  An annual growth rate of 10%.  Annual sales are assumed to be
equal for all alternatives.
18.       For discount rates up to 12% the present worth of Alternative 3
is the lowest.
