Rural and Social Policy Reform\n            Credit Development Policy Lending (DPL) Project, as part of\n            a series of two to three operations, aims to help the\n            Government of Niger improve service delivery to the poor,\n            while continuing reforms in public sector management to\n            secure adequate financing in critical sectors of the\n            economy. Within this medium-term framework, and building on\n            the previous three budget support operations, as well as\n            ongoing investment projects in agriculture, education, and\n            health, the project will focus on selected policy and\n            institutional aspects towards a) improving public sector\n            management, through expansion of reforms in public\n            expenditure management - increasing links between budget\n            allocations and Government priorities, strengthening\n            sectoral ministries' involvement in budget regulation\n            and cash management, modernizing the Treasury, and,\n            strengthening budget controls; and b) enhancing the national\n            statistical information system, ensuring the preparation of\n            national surveys on a regular basis. The project will also\n            promote rural development and agricultural growth through\n            programs implementation within the rural development\n            strategy, promote local governance of natural resources\n            (agricultural land, irrigation water), adopt a single\n            medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), and, release the\n            funds allocated in the 2006 budget to ensure adequate food\n            availability during the pre-harvest period. Furthermore,\n            improvements in service delivery in social sectors will be\n            enhanced through an adequate human resource management.\n            Budget preparation and execution will be improved, as will\n            accountability and governance at the school level, and the\n            provision of publicly financed basic health services to the\n            poor and vulnerable groups."}, "docdt": "2006-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
