   of the second tranche of the Rural and Social Policy Reform\n            Credit (RSRC-1) (Credit No. 4189) for Niger. The memorandum\n            argues that the Government of Niger has made satisfactory\n            progress overall in implementing the program supported by\n            the credit as set forth in its Letter of Development Policy\n            and has fully met eight of the nine prior actions for\n            release of the second tranche. A partial waiver for one\n            prior condition related to the regional recruitment process\n            for qualified health staff is being requested which was\n            prior action number 8: Pass the ministerial arrete\n            (published in the Official Gazette) for the launching of a\n            regional recruitment process for qualified staff (national\n            total of 715 contractual agents and civil servants) to\n            address the human resource deficit in the public health\n            sector in accordance with the recipient's strategic\n            objectives. Given the shortage of qualified available health\n            staff; this gap could not be filled, but the provision is\n            waived based on Niger's efforts in still trying to meet\n            this objective and Niger's satisfactory progress overall."}, "docdt": "2007-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
