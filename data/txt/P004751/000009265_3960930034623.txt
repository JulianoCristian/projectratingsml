HEMORANDUN AND RECO)i3NDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED lOAN
TO THE ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
FOR A THIRD POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
for an amount of US$54 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be extended to the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (EOAT) at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a 17-
year maturity including a grace period of five years. The Kingdom of
Thailand would guarantee the loan. The proceeds would help finance a
Third Power System Development Project.
2.       Bakgxo=d. Thailand has been experiencing an economic boom
since 1987. over the last three years, GDP growth bas averaged 9X per
annum. The outlook is for continued robust growth over the next several
years. The rapid economic growth has resulted in a concomitant growth in
power demand, averaging 141 p.a. in the past three years. Demand for
electricity is forecast to grow at a rate of 11 p.a. over 1990-1993.
With approval and support of the government, SCAT has embarked on a major
program of investments averaging over US$1 billion per year. BOAT's
performance on the implementation of this large expansion program has been
highly satisfactory, meeting all physical implementation and performance
targets.
3.        While in the short-term there has been no alternative other than
a rapid expansion of the public investment program in the sector, for the
longer-term the government is promoting private sector participation in
power generation to supplement efforts by EGAT. However, actual progress
in implementation of private sector projects has been slow due to EBAT's
concerns about system integrity and opposition from its unions. During
the appraisal of the Second Power System Development Project (Loan 3138-
TH), the Bank had assisted BOAT and the government in oxamining options
for both the incorporation/privatization of BGAT and for the introduction
of private power on a Build/Own/Operate/Transfer basis. EGAT soon will be
undertaking a detailed consultancy study on its incorporation (which could
lead to a future offering of EGAT's shares on the capital markets) based
on terms of reference provided by the Bank. As recommended by the Bank,
it will simul':aneously undertake a consulting study to evaluate its
operational efficiency. In addition, BGAT has drafted guidelines for the
introduction of private power producers and has engaged consultants to
prepare solicitation packages for large privately constructed thermal
plants. The Bank would be closely associated with these studies.
4.        Concerned with the rapid growth in energy consumption and its
impact on the economy and the snvironment, the government is: (a) making
serious efforts towards fostering energy conservation in all sectors of
the economy; and (b) paying greater attention to the environmental aspects
of power generation. Conservation, which had to date been accomplished
mainly through economically efficient pricing of resources, is now being
more forcefully addressed through a series of government directives that
are currently being translated into concrete action plans. In the
electricity subsector, the government has formulated a plan which



- 2 -
envisages t wverall savings potential of 600 MW and a three-year savings
target of about 160 MW. In keeping with the government's thrust towards
energy conservation, E¢AT would be undertaking under the proposed project
a consulting study to formulate a master plan for devand-side management
and electricity conservation. Environmental concerns in the next few
years will focus on: (a) the impacts of rapid expansion of power and
lignite mining facilities at Mae Koh; (b) the ecological acceptability of
hydropower projects; and (c) the adequacy of the environmental agencies in
the power and mining sectors for setting standards and regulations,
enforcing compliance and monitoring the quality of the environment. The
proposed vroject would assist EGAT and the government in addressing these
issues not only by ensuring that the project components meet the necessary
environmental standards, but also through specific agreements to examine
the longer-term implications of Mae Moh, which is the most significant
part of EGAT's future plans. In addition, the project would assist in
strengthening some of the key agencies responsible for environmental
monitoring and enforcement, and in the establishment of national emission
standards. Measures for strengthening the capabilities of BOAT's
environmental division commenced under the Second Power System Development
Project would be continued under the proposed project.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank has a close working
relationship with key entities in the energy sector and EGAT and the
government continue to borrow from the Bank, though in modest amounts, to
benefit from Bank technical assistance. The B4nk has been closely
involved in the financing of EGAT's power generation, transmission and
lignite mining investments in the past. Its ongoing participation
assisting in the formulation of sound investment decisions in a rapidly
changing economic environment is a logical continuation of this
involvment. The proposed loan to E6. "would continue the time-slice
financing approach initiated under thon two previous recent Power System
Development Projects (Loans 3027-TH and 3138-TH). Through the proposed
loans, the Bank would continue its ongoing work with the power subsector
and expects to provide a continuous revlew of EoAT's Power Development
Plan (PDP) to ensure that optimum investment programs are evolved which
can be supported by various lenders. The Bank's continued involvement
would also ensure that, through adherence with agreed financial covenants,
EGAT and the power subsector aro financially able to undertake and operate
future system expansions effectively. The Bank also expects to continue
to assist MOAT and the government in addressing some of the important
sectoral issues, including privatization, strengthening of environmental
capabilities and environmental regulations, and energy conservation.
6.        Proleet Objectives. The main objectives of the proposed project
are: (a) to assist EGAT in optimizing ita investment decisions and help
meet the growth in power demand over the medium-term at least cost; and
(b) to strengthen the environmental regulatory agencies in the power and
mining sectors.



7.        Proleet De ptiop   The project comprises two parts - Part A,
which would be carriod out by GA? and financed from the Bank loan, would
comprise subprojects from EQAT's investment plan for its fiscal years 1991
sad 1992, including: (a) the Pak Sun Hyropower project; (b) second stago
of the Mae Mob Mine expansion for power units number 8 and 9; and (c)
installation of an environmental monitoring network at Mse Moh; and - Part
B, which would be carried out by Government and flnanced from bilateral
sources and Government budget, would comprise technLcal asslstance,
training and procurement of environmntal monitoring equipment for the
National Environmental Board (NIB), the Department of Industrial Works
(DIV), the Department of Lineral Resources (DM1) and the Public Works
Department (PUD). IGAT's investment program involves expansion of its
generatlng capacity, lts transmission system and lts lignlte mintng
facilities. The program is based on EG&T*s latest Power Development Plan
(PDP), which was reviewed by the Bank and found to represent the least-
cost alternittive for meeting EGAT's needs. The proposed Bank loan would
finaneo subprojects selected in accordance with agreed lnvestment and
environmental arceptablity criteria.
8.        Total fLiancLng required for EGAT's Lnvestment program is
estLmated at about US$2,933 million, with a foreign component of US$1,511
mllion. The proposed Bank loan of US$54 million will finance about 3.51
of the foreign component. Total financing required for strengthening the
environmental regulatory framework is US$5.7 million. Retroactive
fi-mncing of up to US$6.0 million will be provided for project related
expenditures incurred after October 18, 1990. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plans are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement nchedule are shown in
Schedule B. A tiLetable of key processing events and status of Bank Group
operatlons in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No.9173-TH, dated July 29, 1991 is being
distributed separately.
9.        A eds Actiona. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
EGAT and the government on the following:
(a)  the procedures related to the evaluation of subprojects to
determine their eligibility for Bank financing;
(b)  studies for demand-sLde management and for the environmental
regulatory agencies in the power and mining sectors;
(c) enviromental impact mitigation plans and resettlement plans for
the project's hydropower component;
(d) oevironmental studies and actions on potential adverse
environmental impacts of expanding power generation at Mae Koh;



- 4 -
(a) establishment of appropriate standards for atmosphori¢ emissions
from Lidustries;
(f) a continuation of previous financial covenants spetifying that
both ZGAT and the pmwer sector as a whole will earn a self-
financing ratio of not less than 25X, based ot' a three-year
average of capLtal expenditures; and
(g) a debt-to-equity ratio not exceeding 60:40 and a ratio of short
and medium-term debt to total debt not exceeding 15X for EGAT.
10.           romntal Imost               . Environmental impact
assessments, environmental impact mitigatLon plans, and resettlement plans
pertaining to the Pak Hun Hydropower project and the Hae Moh lignite mine
expansion were reviewed at appraisal and were found to be acceptable. The
Mae Moh development is a major mine-mouth power plant development and
raises particularly serious environmental Issues whlch must be manaed
carefully. In addltion to the mitigation measures necessary for the
immediate development financed under this project, EGAT has agreed to
carry out studies of the longer-term effects of sulphur dioxlde emlssions
on acLd rain and on plant ecology. These studles will provide an
important lnput in developing a longer-term development plan for Ma Noh.
The Bank will work closely with EGAT in reviewing the findlngs of these
studies and ensuring that the environmental aspects are fully taken into
account in future developments at Mae Nob.
11 .rn&tLonal Waterwa   The Pak Mun Hydropower project is
located on the Nam Nun river, which is a tributary of the Mekong river, at
a location 5.5 km upstream of the Mekong river, which is an international
waterway. The downstream riparians in this case are Lao PDR, Cambodia and
Viet Nam. Together with Thailand, these countries are members of the
Mekong Committee, established by them as an autonemous liter-governmental
agency to promote, coordinate, supervise and control the planning,
iLmestigation and implementation of water resources development projects
on the lower Mekong basin (including international projects on the Mekong
river as well as national projects on tributaries). Thailand has notified
the Mekong Committee and representatives of Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam
to the Comittee, about details of the Pak Nun project, and the Mekong
Committee consisting of the four riparians, has included the project in
its plan since 1970. On the basis of this notification and the actions of
the downstream riparians in the Mekong Committee, ti., Bank staff are
satisfied that the international waterways issues involved in the project
have been adequately covered.
12.       Benfits and Risks. In supporting the timely development of the
power sector, the loan to EGAT would help sustain Thailand's economic
growth. Further, as the bulk of EGAT's proposed investments in power
generation is based on the use of domestic lignite and natural gas with
some amount of hydro, the proposed development plan would lead to
substantial savings in the import of fuel. There are no major risks
associated with the program. Although EGAT's PDP is ambitious, the
utility's demonstrated experience with system expansion and its state of



- 5 -
preparedress indicate a successful implementation of the program. The
strengthening of the environmental regulatory agencies for the power and
mining sectors would contribute towards an environmentally sound
development of these sectors. So major risks are foreseen in the
implementation of this project component except delays which may occur in
obtaining a consensus on the environmental standards.
13.       Reca2mUdatlon.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
