objectives of the Third Power\n            System Development Project are: (a) to assist the\n            Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) in\n            optimizing its investment decisions and to help meet the\n            growth in power demand over the medium term at least cost;\n            and (b) to strengthen the environmental regulatory agencies\n            in the power and mining sectors.  The project consists of\n            two parts. Part A comprises sub-projects from EGAT's\n            investment plan for its fiscal years 1991 and 1992, such as:\n            (a) the Pak Mun Hydropower project; (b) the second stage of\n            the Mae Moh Mine expansion; and (c) installation of an\n            environmental monitoring network at Mae Moh.  Part B\n            comprises technical assistance, training and procurement of\n            environmental monitoring equipment."}, "docdt": "1991-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
