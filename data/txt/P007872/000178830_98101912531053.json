{"cdata!": "The Livestock Development Project for\n            Paraguay will consist of a countryside agricultural credit\n            and technical assistance program aimed at increasing\n            production of livestock (beef, dairy, swine, and poultry) in\n            general and at increasing the production of agricultural\n            crops, mainly soybeans and cotton, produced under a mixed\n            crop/livestock farming operation carried out by small-scale\n            farmers. A possible risk is an unexpected deterioration of\n            beef prices that could deter ranchers from seeking credit at\n            the levels assumed under the project. In the case of the\n            small-scale farmers, the project's expected benefits\n            will depend on FG's (Livestock Fund of Central Bank)\n            ability to provide the technical assistance required for the\n            intensive farming system considered under the project,\n            thereby substantially increasing lending for small farmers\n            as envisioned under the project."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
