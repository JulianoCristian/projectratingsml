increasing production of\n            livestock (beef, dairy, swine and poultry) in general and at\n            increasing the production of agricultural crops, mainly\n            soybeans and cotton, produced under a mixed crop/livestock\n            farming operation carried out by small-scale farmers. A\n            possible risk is an unexpected deterioration of beef prices\n            that could deter ranchers from seeking credit at the levels\n            assumed under the project. In the case of the small-scale\n            farmers, the project's expected benefits would depend\n            on FG's ability to provide the technical assistance\n            required for the intensive farming system considered under\n            the project, thereby substantially increasing lending for\n            small farmers as envisioned under the project."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
