social fund mechanism as\n            a means of improving the standards of living among the poor\n            and unemployed during the economic transition. The project\n            has three components. The Microprojects component finances\n            about 100 microprojects identified and prepared by\n            municipalities, nongovernmental organizations, and other\n            intermediaries. The majority of microprojects would include\n            civil works to improve water supply, sanitation, solid waste\n            management, soil recovery, rehabilitation of local health\n            units, schools, feeder roads, and irrigation works. The\n            second component, Labor Market Analysis, includes two labor\n            force surveys, a net impact evaluation of active labor\n            market programs (Lamps), and investigation of legal and\n            administrative changes conducive to microcredit. The third\n            component, Project Management, includes operating costs\n            costs, training, and technical assistance as well as\n            monitoring and evaluation of microprojects and work by the\n            Project Management unit to design and develop the RIF on\n            behalf of the government."}, "docdt": "1998-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
