the other half by about 20; (b)\n            improve nutrition by helping increase rice and pork\n            production in the Vientiane Province through improved water\n            management,

      agencies involved in rural development. Specifically, the\n            project will include: (i) construction and rehabilitation of\n            about 48 small gravity and pump irrigation schemes, varying\n            from 100 to 300 ha each, over a total of about 8,300 ha;\n            (ii) establishment of 10 pig multiplication units of 120\n            sows each; (iii) production of improved rice seeds and\n            research and development of rice cultivation techniques;\n            (iv) credit for agricultural inputs and pig feed; (v)\n            procurement of equipment, vehicles, materials, pig breeding\n            stock and agricultural inputs; and (vi) technical assistance\n            for project planning and execution, and studies to prepare a\n            program of small irrigation works for other priority areas."}, "docdt": "1977-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
