directly benefit about 10,000\n            poor farm families by raising incomes of nearly half of them\n            above poverty levels and of the other half by about 20%; (b)\n            improve

   establishment of a regular supply of piglets for fattening;\n            and (c) strengthen planning and implementation capacity of\n            agencies involved in rural development. Specifically, the\n            project will include: (i) construction and rehabilitation of\n            about 48 small gravity and pump irrigation schemes, varying\n            from 100 to 300 ha each, over a total of about 8,300 ha;\n            (ii) establishment of 10 pig multiplication units of 120\n            sows each; (iii) production of improved rice seeds and\n            research and development of rice cultivation techniques;\n            (iv) credit for agricultural inputs and pig feed; (v)\n            procurement of equipment, vehicles, materials, pig breeding\n            stock and agricultural inputs; and (vi) technical assistance\n            for project planning and execution, and studies to prepare a\n            program of small irrigation works for other priority areas."}, "docdt": "1977-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
