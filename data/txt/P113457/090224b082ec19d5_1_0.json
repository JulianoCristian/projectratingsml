Significant progress was\n            achieved in three key structural areas: oversight of\n            state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which together received 30\n            percent of government spending; improved tax collections;\n            and strengthened internal controls across the\n            administration. While improving these core aspects of fiscal\n            management, the government was also able to provide greater\n            attention and financial support to social initiatives, such\n            as its cash transfer program. In addition, the Government\n            introduced competitive and transparent processes for\n            recruitment and promotion of civil servants with oversight\n            from the Civil Service Secretariat in several institutions.\n            While achieved on a partial basis, the introduction of these\n            processes represented an important milestone considering\n            Paraguay\u2019s history and the program\u2019s baseline."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T00:43:01Z"}
