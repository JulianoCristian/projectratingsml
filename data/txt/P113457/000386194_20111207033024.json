follows: outcomes were satisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate to significant; the\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory; and the\n            Borrower's performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the importance of strong national\n            ownership of the operation is fundamental to the success of\n            a Development Policy Loan (DPL) program. Coalitions of\n            political support for a DPL program must be carefully\n            assessed before undertaking ambitious reforms. Both\n            political feasibility and depth of reform must be taken into\n            account for the DPL series to be successful. From a\n            technical standpoint, reforms that strengthen small\n            'concentrated' teams with important leverage\n            provide opportunities for large pay-offs. Sustained\n            engagement on the part of the Bank is critical to\n            effectively support reform processes over the medium and\n            long term. Combining technical assistance and DPLs generate\n            mutual leverage for achieving development objectives."}, "docdt": "2011-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
