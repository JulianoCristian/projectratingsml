                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The overall development objective of the proposed Programmatic Development Policy Loan (PDPL) is to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of the
                         public sector while maintaining a stable macroeconoimc policy framework. This will be achieved by: (i) improving revenue collections and the equity of the tax
                         system; (ii) improving the effectiveness of Central Administration internal and financial control; (iii) exerting effective SOE oversight to ensure sound and
                         transparent financial management; (iv) improving the efficiency and equity of social capital expenditures; and (v) contributing to the professionalization of the
                         civil service. These objectives are inter-related and address three main public sector outcomes: revenue stablity, accountability, and public sector efficiency.
