          social expenditure during execution, as a contribution of\n            the anti-crisis plan; and b) paving the way for the reform\n            process in the areas supported by the loan. The operation\n            has been conceived within the context of the FY09-13 CPS to\n            support the implementation of the Government plan and the\n            anti-crisis plan. Building on the dialogue developed with\n            the Government, the Bank intends to contribute through this\n            operation to the Government plan's overall objective of\n            achieving sustainable and more equitable growth by providing\n            direct support to three of its pillars: 1) macroeconomic\n            policy; 2) state-owned enterprises; and 3) state\n            modernization. The Bank operation will also be included in\n            the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) contingency\n            package totaling US$300 million, which is one of the\n            components of the anti-crisis plan aiming at creating fiscal\n            space to soften the impact of the crisis through an increase\n            in public investment and prioritized social expenditures.\n            The operation will focus on four program components: 1) tax\n            system; 2) public sector financial control; 3) expenditure\n            management; and 4) human resources management."}, "docdt": "2009-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
