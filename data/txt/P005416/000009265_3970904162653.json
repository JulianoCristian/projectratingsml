alleviate the effect of\n            the energy deficit on the country's\n            balance-of-payments. The Jerada mine project aims to\n            strengthen CdM's organization and planning\n            capabilities, and to increase production from 0.8 mtpy to\n            1.0 mtpy by 1988. It would concentrate production in a\n            single mine; simplify the mine's infrastructure for\n            increased productivity and production; and improve safety,\n            health and working conditions. The project would comprise:\n            (a) a drilling program to prepare underground development\n            work and shaft sinking; (b) underground development work to\n            prepare future mining areas and to simplify existing mining\n            areas. It would further include; (c) sinking of an\n            additional vertical shaft to maintain production capacity\n            after completion of the project and depletion of CdM's\n            smaller mines; (d) installation of underground and surface\n            equipment to increase efficiency, production capacity and to\n            improve safety and health; and (e) technical assistance to CdM."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
