Stage II\n            provides an irrigation and drainage system on 39,250\n            hectares and on-farm development on these and on an\n            additional 9,000 hectares. Stage III, if found to be\n            economically justified, would complete the plan with the\n            development of the remaining 83,000 hectares. This last\n            stage covers the lowest lying parts of the plain where the\n            technical problems are the most difficult. Work on Stage I\n            is now progressing satisfactorily after some initial\n            difficulties.
