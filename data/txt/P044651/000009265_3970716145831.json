The project comprises two components:\n            (1) Infrastructure strengthening studies, including a\n            feasibility study and environmental impact assessment to\n            determine design and construction standards for road\n            rehabilitation and upgrading, followed by detailed\n            engineering designs for civil works; and a national bridge\n            condition and structural strength survey to develop a\n            prioritized program of bridge works. (2) Institutional\n            strengthening, including technical assistance and training\n            for RTCD personnel in contract administration organization,\n            systems and procedures; hands-on training to upgrade\n            mechanical skills, including spare parts for the training\n            program; training of trainers (both in-house and overseas);\n            and construction of a small training facility and workshop,\n            including basic workshop equipment and training aides."}, "docdt": "1997-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
