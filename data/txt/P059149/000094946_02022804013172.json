in fiscal policy,\n            and public expenditure management; 2) administrative\n            reforms; 3) reforms to promote private sector development;\n            and, 4) strengthening of poverty monitoring, and statistical\n            capacity. These comprehensive reforms will benefit the\n            restoration of the state's financial health, governance\n            and services delivery, and will help in achieving higher\n            levels of private investments, and higher economic growth,\n            in reducing poverty, and in improving social indicators.\n            Nonetheless, risks remain over a potential slippage in the\n            fiscal framework due to the global, and India's\n            slowdown, and implementation delays of key sectoral reforms,\n            particularly in the power sector. Further risks include the\n            resistance to institutional, and governance reforms;\n            however, such risks have been contained to date."}, "docdt": "2002-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
