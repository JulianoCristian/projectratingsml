Republic of\n            Yemen, and to prepare detailed plans of new water production\n            facilities for this city. It provides for an immediate\n            increase in water production to meet water demands up to\n            1985 and for expansion of the water distribution network\n            into the poorer sections of Al Mukalla. The project also\n            provides for the formulation and implementation of a health\n            education program designed to encourage the population in Al\n            Mukalla to improve health practices and sanitary conditions.\n            It further includes: hydrogeological studies needed for the\n            design of the water production facilities; an urban growth\n            study to forecast the pace of urbanization in the Al Mukalla\n            area and to plan for the expansion of basic urban services\n            in this area. A total of 122 man-months of consulting\n            services is provided. The project would provide substantial\n            health and environmental benefits to the population of Al Mukalla."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
