There were\n            some delays in project implementation mainly due to delays\n            in equipment procurement and fuel shortages. Shortfalls\n            occurred in targets for production of nonteak hardwood logs\n            and sawnwood, and for construction of all-weather and\n            extended logging season roads. The Timber Corporation, which\n            was the principal implementing agency, was considerably\n            strengthened through the project. The outlook for\n            sustainability appears good, at least over the assumed\n            economic life of the several processing facilities.\n            Throughout the project period, management was of a high\n            professional standard. The performance of contractors and\n            suppliers was adequate. IDA's supervision of the\n            project was also generally satisfactory. The main lessons\n            which emerge from the project are as follows: (i) the\n            economy-wide problem of foreign exchange scarcity, as\n            evidenced by shortages of fuel and building materials, was\n            underestimated at appraisal; (ii) in view of the slow and\n            cumbersome procurement procedures in the country, more lead\n            time should be allowed for procurement activities; (iii) the\n            scope and timeframe for bulding up an export market for\n            nonteak hardwoods have proven to be overoptimistic; and (iv)\n            in the plantation program, the effectiveness of the Taungya\n            silvicultural method, using landless hill people and thus\n            eliminating shifting cultivation and the resulting loss of\n            forest, was established."}, "docdt": "1988-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
