The project will introduce the concept of slum\n            upgrading in the Government's urban development program\n            strengthen existing institutions, and provide site-specific\n            assistance to artisans to increase productivity.

The project, to be\n            implemented over a 6-year period, will consist of the\n            following main components: (i) development of Douala-Nylon,\n            the city's least developed squatter area, by: (a)\n            providing basic infrastructure for 90,000 residents, as well\n            as community facilities, pilot health education program, a\n            retail market and technical assistance to artisans; and (b)\n            carrying out a complete slum upgrading program for 13,000\n            inhabitants; (ii) community facilities in Yaounde-Northwest,\n            one of the city's least developed areas, such as\n            schools, health centers, markets and artisan center; and\n            (iii) technical assistance, training and studies for project execution."}, "docdt": "1983-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
