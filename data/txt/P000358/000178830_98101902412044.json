appropriate standards and reasonable cost in the\n            country's two largest cities and economic centers. The\n            project would introduce the concept of slum upgrading in the\n            Government's urban development program strengthen\n            existing institutions, and provide site-specific assistance\n            to artisans to increase productivity. The infrastructure and\n            building credits to be provided by the project are expected\n            to be an important incentive to private sector and self-help\n            house construction. The project, to be implemented over a\n            6-year period, would consist of the following main\n            components: (i) Development of Douala-Nylon, the city's\n            least developed squatter area, by: (a) providing basic\n            infrastructure for 90,000 residents, as well as community\n            facilities, pilot health education program, a retail market\n            and technical assistance to artisans; and (b) carrying out a\n            complete slum upgrading program for 13,000 inhabitants; (ii)\n            Community facilities in Yaounde-Northwest, one of the\n            city's least developed areas, such as schools, health\n            centers, markets and artisan center; and (iii) Technical\n            assistance, training and studies for project execution."}, "docdt": "1983-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
