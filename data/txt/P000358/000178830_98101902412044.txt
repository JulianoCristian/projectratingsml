URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
-Borrower:      United Republic of Cameroon
Beneficiaries: Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MINUH)/Credit
Foncier du Cameroun (CFC)/Mission d'Amenagement et d'Equipement
des Terrains Urbains et Ruraux (MAETUR)
Amount:        US$20.0 million including capitalized front end fee
Terms:          Twenty years including a five-year grace period, at an annual
interest rate of 11.6 percent.
Co-Financing:  Government of Switzerland
Project
Description: The first,Bank Group-financed urban project in Cameroon is
designed mainly to provide basic infrastructure, school and
health facilities and improved shelter to lower urban income
groups at appropriate standards and reasonable cost in the
country's two largest cities and economic centers. The project
would introduce the concept of slum upgrading in the Government's
urban development program, strengthen existing institutions,
and provide site-specific assistance to artisans to increase
productivity. The infrastructure and building credits to be
provided by the project are expected to be an important incen-
tive to private sector and self-help house construction.
The project, to be implemented over a 6-year period, would
consist of the following main components:
(i)  Development of Douala-Nylon, the city's least developed
squatter area, by: (a) providing basic infrastructure
(roads, drainage, water supply, street lighting, refuse
points) for 90,000 residents, as well as community facil-
ities, pilot health education program, a retail market and
technical assistance to artisans; and (b) carrying out a
complete slum upgrading program for 13,000 inhabitants,
including housing loans and land tenure;
(ii) Community facilities in Yaounde-Northwest, one of the
city's least developed areas, such as schools, health
centers, markets and artisan center; and
(iii) Technical assistance, training and studies for project
execution, preparation of follow-up projects and urban
investment planning.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their oMcial duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



Benefits
and Risks:   Direct quantifiable benefits would be better sanitary andw
infrastructure conditions, particularly for the poorer segments
of the population in the country's two largest economic centers.
Indirect benefits include improvements in the beneficiaries'
health status, generation of unskilled construction employment
and incentives for house construction. The project would
support private sector initiatives and activities, and would
help strengthen institutions and policies. A major risk
relates to the innovative nature of the country's first slum
upgrading operation. To minimize the risk, technical assistance
will be provided to the executing agencies, particularly during
the start-off period, to reinforce coordination of project
activities and improve the training of counterparts.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF CANEROON FOR
AN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT          _
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the United Republic of Cameroon for the equivalent of US$20 million
to help finance an urban development project. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including a five-year grace period, at an annual interest rate of
11.6 percent. The Swiss Government has agreed to participate in the financing
of the project with a loan of US$5.5 million equivalent, on terms similar to
IDA's.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         A report entitled "United Republic of Cameroon--Economic Memorandum"
(No. 2877-CM), was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 30, 1980.
Since then, three economic missions, as well as a number of sector missions,
have visited Cameroon. Their major findings are incorporated in the following
paragraphs. Annex I provides basic country data.
Background
3.         Cameroon has a population of 8.9 million and covers an area of
475,000 km2. It is one of Africa's most diverse countries, with a wide
range of climatic zones, ecological conditions, population densities, ethnic
groups and traditional cultures. Its main opportunities for development lie
in the expansion of agricultural, livestock, and forestry production; the
exploitation of energy and mineral resources; and the processing of agricul-
tural, forestry and mineral products for domestic consumption and export.
Cameroon became an oil producer in 1978 and is estimated to have produced some
6 million tons of crude petroleum in 1982. In 1981, Cameroon began producing
refined petroleum products.
4.         Cameroon' s main economic centers are separated by large areas of low
population density, and the country's port facilities and transport network
also serve landlocked Chad and the Central African Republic. Adequate port
and trunk transportation systems are essential for promoting agriculture,
forestry and industry, and for strengthening internal and external communica-
tions. With the growth of manufacturing industry, government, transport,
construction and services, Cameroon is becoming increasingly urban. About 35
percent of the population now live in towns, with the heaviest concentrations
in Douala, the major port and industrial center, and Yaounde, the capital.



- 2 -
5.        Cameroon subscribes to a philosophy of "planned liberalism" and the
country's economic development has been pursued within a five-year investment
planning framework. The Fourth Plan period ended in June, 1981, and the Fifth
Plan (1981-86) is now in effect. Cameroon's macro-economic policies have been
cautious and the Government has concentrated on fostering a sense of national
unity among the different regions of the country. Thus, while until the
second half of the 70's growth was comparatively moderate, the country has
enjoyed exceptional economic and social stability.
6.        Growth.  Over the past fifteen years, Cameroon has experienced
accelerating output and population growth. Real annual GDP growth during the
Second Plan Period (1966-71) averaged 4.2 percent; in the Third (1971-76),
4.5 percent; and in the Fourth (1976-81), an estimated 7 to 8 percent.
Population growth in the three periods was, respectively, about 1.8, 1.9 and
2.3 percent a year. Per capita GNP rose between 1966 and 1980 at an annual
rate of about 3.1 percent.
7.        Investment and Savings.  Underlying the longer term rise in GDP
growth have been rising proportions of investment. The investment/GDP ratio
averaged over 15 percent during the Second Plan, close to 20 percent during
the Third, and about 23 percent during the Fourth. Despite rising investment/
GDP ratios, the mobilization of domestic savings more than kept pace, due
largely to increased public savings. Gross domestic savings rose from about
84 percent of total investment under the Second and Third Plans to about 94
percent during the Fourth Plan.  After allowing for net factor service and
current transfers and the amortization of foreign loans, reliance on foreign
financing fell from about 33 percent of total investment during 1966-71 to
about 30 percent during 1976-79.
8.        Public Finance.  Budgetary revenues amounted to about 15 percent of
GDP during the Second and Third Plans but increased to close to 17 percent
during the Fourth Plan. Public savings after debt service declined from about
39 percent of total public investment during the Second Plan to about 36
percent during the Third; however, they rebounded to 55 percent during 1976-79,
thanks to substantial contributions from the agricultural export stabilization
funds.
9.        Balance of Payments.  Overall, the balance of payments has not posed
particular problems, apart from some short-term deterioration during the
1974-76 period. In 1977-80, exports rose substantially (at an average annual
rate of 26 percent), but imports also increased (at an average annual rate of
20 percent) because of more rapid economic growth and higher investment.
International reserves were rebuilt in 1976-80, rising in 1980 to a gross
level equivalent to about seven weeks of imports. This was low by interna-
tional standards, although still acceptable given Cameroon's membership in the
Central African Monetary Union. Since late 1980, Cameroon's official reserve
position has fluctuated, reflecting variations in short-term capital transac-
tions.



- 3-
Development Prospects and Issues
10.       Short- and Medium-term Developments.  Oil production is having a
significant impact on the Cameroonian economy. Historically, Cameroon has
been dependent on the export of agricultural products for the bulk (72 percent
in 1978) of its export earnings. Cocoa and coffee alone accounted for 53
percent of the value of 1978 exports. However, oil exports, which represented
about 1 percent of total exports in 1978, had risen to an estimated 63 percent
in 1982, with the share of agricultural products as a result dropping to about
28 percent. Exports of oil have continued to rise in 1983, further reducing
the proportional importance of agricultural exports. The structure of output
is also changing, with production of the agricultural sector falling from 32
to 26 percent of GDP between 1978-1981, and oil production rising from less
than a half to over 11 percent.
11.       The Government is nonetheless projecting significantly rising
agricultural production in the years ahead. Its targets for the Fifth
Plan period are based on 3 percent annual increases in cocoa output; 5 percent
for robusta coffee; and 7 percent for arabica coffee; increased production of
food and other crops, as well as livestock; and expansion of forestry produc-
tion. An impact on the structure of the economy is expected from the Fifth
Plan under which the proposed investment/GDP ratio is 23 percent. The Plan
stresses increased support to agriculture and expansion of the supply of
technical and professional manpower, while energy, mining and industry are
to receive diminished emphasis. However, apart from appearing ambitious,
the Government's targets, especially for agricultural production and invest-
ment, are not based on explicit identification of the probable patterns
of hydrocarbons development and oil revenue-use and are, therefore, subject to
more than the usual margin of uncertainty. The projected annual GDP growth
rate of 7 percent over the Fifth Plan period is in line with estimated recent
growth in the 7 to 8 percent range and appears comfortably attainable.
12.       Longer-Term Developments.  Cameroon's promising potential in areas
outside agriculture implies a longer-term structural shift towards a more
diverse industrial base, with expanded mining, manufacturing, power and
service sectors. Agriculture will probably play a still critical but less
dominant socio-economic role; within agriculture, a gradual shift in the
composition of output towards increased food production for the growing urban
population appears likely.
External Borrowing and Creditworthiness
13.       Total public external debt outstanding and disbursed rose from
US$514 million at the end of 1976 to US$2.0 billion at the end of 1981. Debt
service payments rose from US$39 million in 1976 to US$200 million in 1981,
while exports increased from US$770 million to about US$2.2 billion during the
same period. Notwithstanding a hardening of average loan terms in the 1970s,
Cameroon's debt service ratio was still about 9.1 percent in 1981 and is
projected to stay in the 12 to 14 percent range throughout this decade.



- 4 -
Borrowing on non-concessionary terms is expected to account for about two-
thirds of total new commitments and average terms are expected to harden
during the period. Because of higher debt service payments, projected net
disbursements will probably be less than in the past but, with Cameroon's
favorable export and savings prospects, are expected to be sufficient to allow
an investment rate above 25 percent of GDP, as well as the maintenance of a
strong foreign reserve position.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
14.       Bank and IDA commitments in Cameroon as of September 30, 1982,
amounted to US$746.2 million and covered 41 projects: 19 in agriculture,
12 in transportation, 3 in education, 3 in public utilities, 2 small- and
medium-scale enterprise projects and 2 technical assistance projects.
Transport and agriculture each account for about 40 percent of these commit-
ments. IFC has invested in five enterprises, with total net loan and equity
commitments of US$12.7 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1982, including
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       Although implementation delays and setbacks have occasionally been
encountered, the Government has consistently shown willingness to collaborate
with the Bank in finding solutions. In the past, Cameroon's disbursement rate
compared very favorably with that of most other countries. Recently, however,
performance has deteriorated somewhat, apparently partly symptomatic of admin-
istrative difficulties, notably in the central procurement agency. Several
steps, including the provision of technical support to expedite procurement
procedures, are underway to improve the situation.
16.       The Bank's initial investment strategy in Cameroon was to support
the Government's development efforts in three main directions: (i) strength-
ening and extending the road and rail trunk systems and improving the Port of
Douala; (ii) raising agricultural output and exports; and (iii) improving
education. Through 1975, apart from one water supply project, Bank lending
was concentrated entirely in the transport, agriculture and education sectors.
Since 1975, the Bank has diversified its lending, extending it into other
areas, including forestry, small- and medium-scale industry, and technical
assistance.
17.       For the future, projects are being prepared in agriculture, to
extend rural development efforts and strengthen agricultural research,
and in transport, to rehabilitate or expand the road system. Additional
education/manpower and technical assistance projects are also planned, as
well as further port, small- and medium-scale industry, urban, and water
supply/sewerage projects. The Bank has carried out sector studies in energy,
industry, telecommunications and health, and additional projects have been
tentatively identified in these areas. The Bank's lending strategy is essen-
tially determined by the country's growing need for project-related assistance,



-5 -
its evident creditworthiness, and the need for the Bank to maintain an ade-
quate overall and sectoral presence in order to remain a major source of
macro-economic and sector policy advice. Thus, the trend towards further
sectoral diversification of Bank lending, reflecting the growing complexity of
Cameroon's development, will continue and the overall volume of lending will
rise.
18.       The Government's main current need is to convert the transient
windfall of oil-augmented revenues into a permanent enhancement of national
productivity and income. This will call for a strengthening of the Govern-
ment's policy-formulating capabilities, the identification of economically
sound development options, and the evolution and adoption of an explicit
oil-revenue-use strategy to guide decision-making throughout the economy. Of
particular importance will be sound decisions concerning the size and composi-
tion of the domestic investment program and the identification and removal of
the major development bottlenecks.
19.       In response to Cameroon's changing needs, the Bank's economic and
sector work program is now emphasizing a broadening of the macro-economic
and sectoral policy dialogue with the Government and the implementation of an
integrated program of technical assistance to the central and technical
ministries. With regard to short- and medium-term policy options, the dialogue
is expected to include: the pace and pattern of oil and gas development; the
size and composition of the public investment program; improvements in resource
allocation; the roles of the private and public sectors; technical and other
skilled manpower constraints and needs; and Government administrative reform.
The dialogue on longer-term issues will probably cover basic agricultural and
industrial policy options and related manpower development needs. A study on
agricultural policy options is nearing completion and will be discussed with
the Government shortly. The Bank earlier completed a basic study of indus-
trialization and incentives leading to the provision of technical assistance
to strengthen the Government's capacity to analyze and reformulate industrial
policies. Studies and dialogue on the role of the public sector in industrial
development and on the framework of industrial, agricultural and housing
financial intermediation are also planned.
Donor Activities
20.       Disbursements of official development assistance during the second
half of the 1960s amounted to about US$45.0 million a year, mostly in the form
of grants. France provided most of the assistance. In the 1970s, foreign aid
increased to about US$90 million a year, with only one-fifth in the form of
grants. Bank and IDA financing amounted to about 23 percent of total disburse-
ments and the Bank Group became the major public donor. Bank Group lending to
Cameroon has been closely coordinated with that of other donors; in 20 of the
41 Bank projects, joint or parallel financing was arranged and expanded
cofinancing is being actively sought for several projects under consideration.
21.       Cameroon is now borrowing increasingly from private sources; such
borrowing rose to over 40 percent of external financing in 1975-79, from only
11 percent in 1967-69. Public external debt outstanding and disbursed as of



- 6 -
December 31, 1981, amounted to US$2.0 billion, 8.2 percent of which was in the
form of Bank loans and 8.5 percent in IDA credits. Bank loans in 1981
accounted for 7.8 percent of public external debt service and IDA credits for
3.2 percent. By 1985, Bank loans and IDA credits are projected to account for
about 26 percent of debt outstanding and about 14 percent of debt service.
PART III - THE URBAN SECTOR
Stage of Urbanization
22.       With an estimated 3.1 million urban residents out of a total
population of 8.9 million in 1982, Cameroon is the fourth most urbanized
country in West Africa after Congo, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. The high growth
rate of 10 percent is expected to decrease to about 5 percent by the year 2000
when Cameroon's estimated 9 million urban residents will represent 65 percent
of total population versus 35 percent in 1982.
23.       Cameroon divides roughly into three principal economic regions,
corresponding roughly to the main ethnic groupings. Douala, the country's
main port and largest city (some 600,000 inhabitants), is also the economic
center of the western region. The second largest city, Yaounde (some 400,000
citizens), is the economic center of the southern and eastern regions as well
as the nation's capital. The secondary towns of Garoua and Maroua serve as
economic centers of the sparsely populated northern savannah lands.
24.       Even though Cameroon is still a predominantly rural society,
the country's changing economic structure--illustrated by growing petroleum
production and an expanding industrial sector--will have important repercus-
sions on the urban sector in the years to come. Current and projected urban
needs are substantial, in particular basic infrastructure, land registration
and tenure, and development of new areas. Almost half of all urban residents
lack access to piped water, and existing standpipe systems are mostly sub-
standard. Less than 10 percent of urban residents hold registered land
titles. The needs for improvement were particularly felt in the two largest
cities, and the Government's initial efforts to define and implement a more
systematic urban policy were, therefore, concentrated on these two centers.
Principal cities: Douala and Yaounde
25.       More than one million people live in the two largest cities or about
12 percent of the total population. An estimated 150,000 people or 25 percent
of Douala's population live below the absolute poverty level in Douala of
approximately US$290 per capita. In Yaounde, some 100,000 residents--or
25 percent of total population--have an estimated annual per capita income
of less than US$320 which is considered to be the poverty income threshold
there. In squatter areas, however, the proportion of the population below the
absolute poverty level is much higher than the 25 percent average share for



- 7 -
both cities indicates: in Douala-Nylon the principal project area, the share
is 55 percent, and in Yaounde's squatter areas, the share is 33 percent.
Urban infrastructure and services in both cities are seriously deficient,
notably in low-income areas. Inadequate drainage, insufficient water supply
and solid waste disposal, limited road access and lack of basic health and
education facilities pose severe socio-economic problems, including reduced
labor productivity and sub-standard sanitation and health conditions.
26.       Urban conditions are particularly poor in Douala-Nylon which is
mostly composed of Bamileke migrants from the western part of the country who
are noted for their cohesive social structure. Nylon's area of some 600 ha
houses about 90,000 people who represent about 15 percent of Douala's popula-
tion, about one third of the city's poor. Nylon's inhabitants contribute
significantly to rapidly expanding informal sector activities and the growing
urban labor market in Douala. Demand for urban services is specially acute
because previous development plans called for Nylon's transformation into a
reserve or green belt, and virtually no infrastructure or urban services were
provided for a prolonged period of time. By the mid 1970s, however, Nylon was
selected as a priority area for upgrading in the framework of the Government's
evolving urban program. Until very recently there were no public schools in
Nylon, and there are currently no public health facilities or organized local
market facilities at all. In the past, Nylon's minimum basic infrastructure
was essentially provided through considerable self-help by 13 neighborhood
action committees and organized work groups of its inhabitants.
Institutions and Policies
27.       The Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MINUH) has overall
responsibility for the Government's urban development program and policies
including land registration and management and regional planning. Several
specialized semi-public agencies carry out most of the day-to-day operations:
SIC constructs and manages houses primarily for higher income residents;
MAETUR implements land development programs; CFC is primarily in charge of
housing finance; and FEICOM finances municipal infrastructure investments and
local training programs.
28.       Other Ministries such as Ministries of Education, Health and
Social Affairs and some semi-public agencies participate in urban development
programs. The municipalities of Yaounde and Douala have traditionally only
limited responsibilities for urban development. The bulk of their relatively
small budgets, funded mainly by centrally collected taxes, are principally
earmarked for basic urban services such as street lighting and garbage collec-
tion.
29.       Recognizing the expanding needs for urban infrastructure and housing,
the Government started to develop a more systematic program during the second
half of the 1970s. Earlier, some of the most pressing needs were addressed by
projects with selected urban components including projects financed by the
Bank Group. Parallel to the evolving urban policies, new institutions were
established to help implement the expanding development programs. At the



- 8 -
Government's request, the Bank has played an active role in developing appro-
priate policies through project preparation and sector work, provision of
technical assistance and funding of feasibility studies under the First
Technical Cooperation project. The Government has generally been receptive
to Bank advice and has indicated its intention to continue to seek the Bank's
assistance. Areas of future priorities include provision of basic infrastruc-
ture, land development and upgrading, housing finance, strengthening of
institutions, and streamlining of procedures. Private initiative and self-
help should support and complement public programs both in larger cities and
secondary centers.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The proposed project would be the first Bank-financed urban develop-
ment project in Cameroon, expanding and complementing ongoing Bank Group
projects with selected urban-related components in water supply, transport,
small-scale enterprise and technical assistance projects. Following identi-
fication in 1978, a feasibility study was initiated under the First Technical
Cooperation Project and completed in September 1980. Appraisal took place in
November 1980 with brief follow-up missions during 1981 to firm up institu-
tional arrangements. Negotiations were held in Washington from February 24 to
March 4, 1982. The Cameroonian delegation was led by the Minister of Urban
Development and Housing. While project implementation began as envisaged in
1982, final Government agreement was delayed. In February 1983, the Govern-
ment agreed to the project as negotiated (including a fixed interest rate of
11.6 percent, reflecting the financial terms in effect at the time of nego-
tiations). The Staff Appraisal Report No. 3455-CM is being circulated
separately.
Project Objectives and Description
31.       The proposed project is designed mainly to provide infrastructure,
community facilities and improved shelter to lower urban income groups at
appropriate standards and reasonable cost in Douala and Yaounde. The project
would introduce the concept of slum upgrading in the Government's urban
development program, would strengthen the institutional framework for a
continuing upgrading and low-cost housing programs, and would provide site-
specific assistance to artisans to increase their productivity. The infra-
structure and building credits to be provided by the project are expected to
be an important incentive to private sector and self-help construction.
32.       The project, to be implemented over a 6-year period, would consist
of the following main components:
(i) Development of Douala-Nylon, the city's least developed squatter
area, by:



- 9 -
(a) providing a primary network of basic infrastructure (roads,
water, drainage, street lighting, refuse collection) for 90,000
residents on the entire 600 ha area as well as community
facilities, pilot health education program, a retail market and
technical assistance to artisans; and
(b) carrying out a more complete slum upgrading program through
provision of secondary and tertiary infrastructure for 13,000
inhabitants in a 50 ha pilot zone, including housing loans and
land tenure.
(ii) Community facilities in Yaounde-Northwest, one of the city's least
developed areas, such as schools, health centers, markets and artisan
center; and
(iii)  Technical assistance, training and studies for project execution,
preparation of follow-up projects, and urban investment planning.
33.       Development of Douala-Nylon.  Major roads, drainage, refuse bins,
street lighting and water will be provided to the entire 600 ha area to ensure
basic access, to solve the major drainage and garbage removal problems and to
increase the availability of potable water. The drainage system in Nylon,
which is the largest single component in the project, also serves a significant
portion of the city of Douala outside Nylon. The project includes financing
to dredge and straighten the Mgoua river, main drain of the Nylon watershed.
As a first phase of long-term complete slum upgrading, a first tranche of
50 ha (13,000 residents in one of the oldest and best organized of Nylon's
13 neighborhoods) has been chosen, and upgrading here would serve as a model
for other neighborhoods. On-site infrastructure would be installed in order
to demonstrate how full upgrading, including delivery of tenure, should be
carried out. In addition, 600 loans will be granted for plot purchase and
home improvement, with an average loan amount of about US$2,400.
34.       The project will also help finance two primary schools, Nylon's
first public health facility, and a health and nutrition education program.
Five community centers will be built and equipped by residents using materials
financed under the project, and a retail market will be constructed. Site-
specific technical assistance to artisans and small entrepreneurs will be
provided through CAPME and CPN, to be complemented by an US$1 million line of
credit through BCD financed by the ongoing Second SME Project.
35.       Community Facilities in Northwest Yaounde.  Upgrading of Northwest
Yaounde was considered in the feasibility study but implementation was post-
poned because of financial constraints and lack of appropriate resettlement
and land tenure arrangements. However, a component consisting of community
facilities such as primary school classrooms, health, dispensary and youth
centers, as well as a market and artisan center, was retained for this first
project. Further assistance to artisans will be provided through CAPME and
UCPY.



- 10 -
36.       Technical Assistance, Training and Studies.  A total of 20.5 staff-
years of consultant support will be provided to assist in project implemen-
tation, to promote institution-building, and to increase sector knowledge and
prepare follow-up projects. Technical assistance to facilitate project
implementation will be provided to MAETUR (3 staff-years) and MINUH (5 staff-
years). 12.5 staff-years of technical assistance have been earmarked for
project preparation, including feasibility studies for possible follow-up
projects and for urgently needed studies in urban investment and financial
planning.
Cost and Financing
37.       Project cost is estimated at US$54.7 million of which US$27.8
million (51 percent) represent foreign exchange cost. Government taxes amount
to US$9.5 million. Project costs are based on December 1981 prices. Physical
contingencies are estimated at 15 percent on civil works and construction, and
10 percent on other project components. Price contingencies are estimated at
15 percent per year for local purchases of domestic and foreign goods and
services and between 8.0 percent and 12.6 percent per year for direct foreign
procurement. The proposed loan would provide for a total of 20.5 staff-years
of technical assistance at an average monthly cost of US$11,000 per expert.
The unit costs are in line with prevailing and projected billing rates of
consulting firms operating in Cameroon.
38.       The proposed loan of US$20.0 million would finance 44 percent
of project cost net of taxes and 72 percent of foreign exchange cost of the
project. Swiss cofinancing would provide US$5.5 million or 10 percent of
total project cost. Thus, together with the proposed Bank loan of US$20.0
million, external financing would cover 85 percent of the project's foreign
cost or 47 percent of total cost including taxes.
Financial Arrangements
39.       On-lending arrangements are as follows:  US$1.0 million of the
loan would be on-lent through CFC to MAETUR for slum upgrading in Douala-Nylon
at 5.5 percent p.a. for four years including two years of grace. US$18.7
million for primary infrastructure, community facilities and technical assist-
ance will be channeled to the executing agencies through budgetary allocations
of the Cameroonian Government.
40.       Agreement has been reached on the on-lending arrangements of the
loan to the financial intermediaries and executing agencies on terms satis-
factory to the Bank. This would include that CFC would recycle the loan
proceeds repaid by MAETUR by making further loans to it for urban projects.
CFC would also make available purchase and house construction/improvement
loans for all plots provided under this project (Sections 3.02 and Schedule 6
of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 11 -
41.       Cost Recovery.  The project will introduce the slum upgrading
concept in Cameroon and at the same time the recovery of costs from bene-
ficiaries in upgraded areas through plot sales with full title. The project
will also introduce municipal participation in the financing of improved
conditions for the urban poor. In terms of affordability, the project will
reach to the 5th to 10th percentile of the income spectrum for final bene-
ficiaries of the upgrading component. Thus the project would have a sub-
stantial poverty impact. To ensure replicability, the project will rely
essentially on existing institutions and will strengthen them through tech-
nical assistance.
42.       85 percent of project costs which includes primary roads, major
drainage, other non-allocable infrastructure, and community facilities would
be charged to the central government. Small amounts for street lighting,
standpipes and garbage disposal would be charged to the municipality of
Douala. The relatively large central government share reflects the substan-
tial drainage expenditures associated with this project because Nylon is a
swampy area through which drainage for a large part of the city of Douala
passes. The whole city, therefore, benefits from expenditures on the primary
network.
43.       15 percent of project costs would be recovered.  Costs of market
facilities (ten percent) would be fully charged to the beneficiaries in the
small business community. The remaining five percent of project costs
would be recovered from beneficiaries in upgraded areas through plot sales
with full title. In addition to attributable infrastructure and land costs,
beneficiaries will be charged costs of housing construction financed by
the project as well as interest during the construction period. Financing
for plot purchase and house construction would be consolidated in a single
loan from CFC to each final beneficiary to be repaid over 15 years including
one year of grace, at an average annual interest rate of 4.5 percent and with
a required ten percent downpayment.
44.       The interest rate charged to final beneficiaries appears low in
relation to past and anticipated inflation rates of approximately ten percent.
However, the housing credits from CFC would be financed entirely through a
para-fiscal mechanism involving a housing tax levied by the Government on all
salaried employees. These tax revenues are channeled through CFC exclusively
for social housing. Thus CFC's sources of funding for housing credits is the
salaried workforce which is also a target group of its lending operations.
To the extent that borrowers--who will be closely monitored by CFC--are
low-income or unsalaried, this para-fiscal system results in a cross-subsidy
benefitting low-income target groups.
45.       The existing financing system permits CFC to cover its operating
costs and a margin for risks and profit. If in future, however, CFC, due
to increased demand for housing credits requires to borrow funds, then the
need to adjust interest rates will become more urgent to maintain CFC's
financial viability. The Bank discussed these issues with Government, and
assurances were obtained that CFC would apply lending terms that would



- 12 -
preserve CFC's sound financial position. In addition, a five year investment
program for CFC was agreed which defines housing development programs in terms
of currently known resources. The Government has indicated its intention to
review lending conditions including interest rates based on an ongoing study
of CFC's financial policies, and to discuss future actions with the Bank. The
Bank will continue to encourage Government to adjust interest rates and other
lending terms in a manner compatible with sound management of financial
intermediaries, and in line with prevailing economic and financial conditions
in the country.
Project Execution and Management
46.       The proposed project makes maximum use of existing agencies and
procedures with modifications, as appropriate, to help increase efficiency.
Project execution responsibilities can be summarized as follows: (i) MINUH
for general project coordination and overall supervision; and for studies,
technical assistance and training; (ii) MAETUR/ARAN for Nylon slum upgrading;
and community facilities in Yaounde NW; (iii) CFC for housing loans for slum
upgrading; and (iv) CAPME for technical assistance to artisans.
47.       MINUH.  MINUH will create a Project Office and appoint a qualified
Project Coordinator who will be responsible in particular for monitoring the
execution of the project and the preparation of progress reports (Section 3.04
(a) of the draft Loan Agreement). He will also focus on replicability and
affordability and will initiate corrective measures, if necessary, during
project execution. The Project Office will also be responsible for overall
supervision and coordination. Assurances have been obtained that appro-
priate monitoring responsibilities for the project will be set up (Section
3.07(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
48.       MAETUR/ARAN.  MAETUR management and staff are considered competent.
USAID provided technical assistance for project planning and development for
several years. Further technical assistance will be provided under the
proposed project. MAETUR created recently the Nylon upgrading unit ARAN
tailored to the specific needs of the first complete upgrading operation
in the country--to implement infrastructure upgrading works, to sell plots,
and to assist in house improvements. ARAN's activities will initially be
limited to Nylon, however, if this arrangement proves to be successful,
ARAN's activities could be extended to other upgrading activities elsewhere
in the country. ARAN will be managed by a Cameroonian director assisted by
a Steering Committee consisting of representatives of urban development
institutions and two representatives of the Nylon residents. This broad
representation will ensure the widest possible participation of all parties
concerned.
49.       CFC.  It is well managed and has had no major default in its mort-
gage portfolio; technical assistance is being provided by Credit Foncier of
France. CFC's revenues from housing tax proceeds amounted to about US$21
million in FY 79/80. By mid-1980 CFC made about 150 housing loans totalling
nearly US$2 million, and lent US$16 million to MAETUR and SIC for some 1,700



- 13 -
plots or houses. CFC's new management recently decided to start general
savings operations, and is considering mobilizing external financing to blend
with housing tax proceeds to expand CFC's future operations. CFC would
on-lend proceeds of the proposed loan to MAETUR for infrastructure works, and
would provide loans to individual beneficiaries for plot purchase and house
construction and improvement. The house construction loans are included in
the project but are not financed from the proceeds of the loan.
50.       Other Participating Agencies.  Other participating agencies such
as SNEC, SONEL, CAPME, CPN and UCPY will collaborate with MINUH and other
executing agencies in project implementation in their specific fields of
activity. The neighborhood action committees in Nylon will be involved in
pilot upgrading and the construction of community centers. These committees
have proven to be very effective in mobilizing local resources, channelling
them into community development activities, and coordinating community
projects.
Procurement
51.       Contracts for an aggregate value of US$16.7 million base cost for
procurement associated with major civil works and equipment would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding. If possible, contracts
would be grouped to permit bulk procurement and to meet targets. For bid
evaluation, a preferential margin of 15 percent or the value of the applicable
customs duties, whichever is lower, would be allowed for products made in
Cameroon.
52.       Small contracts totalling US$6.4 million not likely to attract
foreign suppliers would be awarded after competitive bidding advertised
locally but open also to bidders without local representation. These would
include small supplies for ARAN and the land registry offices, the Swiss-
financed market and facilities in Nylon, and the civil works of pilot upgrad-
ing except for the drainage works to be carried out by force account by
the Nylon neighborhood action committee. Small items totalling no more than
US$1 million could be purchased locally based on at least three quotations.
Consultant services totalling US$7.6 million would be procured according to
Bank Group's guidelines. Dredging of the Mgoua river requires special equip-
ment which is already in place for the Douala port dredging. Since it would
prove more expensive to bring in other equipment for this operation only, a
contract of US$1.6 million was negotiated directly with the contractor
based on competitive rates obtained for the ongoing port contract. An
extension of this contract of US$0.9 million with similar unit costs has
been negotiated.
Disbursements
53.       The loan proceeds would be disbursed within 6 years to cover the
following expenditures: (i) 50 percent of total expenditure for civil works
for the upgrading component; (ii) 60 percent of total expenditure for material
and equipment for project executing agencies and for technical assistance; and
(iii) 70 percent of total expenditure for consultant services and studies.



- 14 -
All disbursements would be fully documented except for local expenditure
(US$0.2 million) for force account work to be done by the Nylon neighborhood
action committee to be supervised by MAETUR/ARAN.
Reports and Auditing
54.       Separate project accounts will be maintained by each executing
agency; comprehensive project accounts will be kept by the Project Coordinator
who will prepare quarterly progress reports to be sent to the Bank. Assurances
have been obtained that no later than six months after the close of the fiscal
year, financial statements of CFC and MAETUR would be submitted to the Bank
(Section 3.07(b) of the draft Loan Agreement and Section 4.02 of the draft CFC
Project Agreement and Section 4.02 of the MAETUR Project Agreement). These
financial statements would be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to
the Bank, and would be submitted to the Bank no later than 12 months after the
close of the financial year.
Benefits and Justification
55.       Direct quantifiable benefits of the project would be better sanitary
and infrastructure conditions for the poorer segments of the population in the
two largest cities. Some 90,000 residents would benefit from the provision
of basic infrastructure in Douala-Nylon, and 13,000 inhabitants from a first
complete slum upgrading operation in a 50 ha pilot zone where residential
infrastructure would be provided on a non-subsidized basis. Other improve-
ments would include some 10,000 new primary school places, market facilities
and workshops for artisans. Indirect benefits include improvements in the
beneficiaries' health status, generation of unskilled construction employment,
and incentives for house consolidation. The project would have a substantial
poverty impact; about half of total project cost is estimated to create direct
benefits to some 50,000 residents of the urban poverty group. This project
would introduce the concept of slum upgrading in the country's urban develop-
ment program, would support private sector initiatives and activities, and
would help strengthen institutions and policies.
56.       Economic rate of return computations were made separately for
individual project components. An overall rate of return of 18 percent was
obtained on about 70 percent of project costs for which benefits have been
quantified. Sensitivity analyses show that the overall rate of return did not
fall below 14 percent in any of the sensitivity tests.
Risks
57.       A major risk relates to the innovative nature of the country's first
upgrading operation. Also, the varied nature of project components involved
will require careful coordination and supervision. To minimize these risks,
appropriate technical assistance will be provided to the executing agencies,
particularly during the startoff period, to reinforce MINUH's control and
coordinating functions, and to train Cameroonian counterparts.

C.  Status of Projects in Execution (as of September 30, 1982) I/
Loan No. 1734       Fourth Railway Project:  US$27 million Loan of
Cr. No. 936         August 23, 1979; Effectiveness Date:  January 22, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983; and US$20 million Credit of
same date; Effectiveness Date: January 22, 1980; Closing
Date: December 31, 1982.
All contracts have been awarded except for the maintenance facili-
ties near Yaounde, the engineering studies for which have been delayed by
Consultants. Civil works in Douala Station are nearing completion and the
works in the workshops (Phase I, Part I), are progressing well. Procurement
of all equipment, including training equipment, is nearly completed. Remain-
ing contracts for workshop remodeling (Phase I, Part II) are likely to be
awarded early 1983. Technical Assistance for designing training programs is
being organized. Due to the excessive staffing and investments, the financial
situation of the Regie continues to be serious, but due to 12 percent traffic
increase in FY 82, it has recently improved. Regifercam's management is still
weak, but improvements are expected through technical assistance, to be pro-
vided under the project, and to be discussed early 1983.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regard-
ing the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No-          Third Education Project:  US$17 million Loan of July 2,
1245-T-CM         1976;  Effectiveness Date:  December 31, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1982.
Project implementation is about two years behind schedule because of
weak management and problems in dealing with a 34 percent cost overrun in
civil works, now covered by Government budgetary provisions and the US dollar
rise. Construction is completed or underway at 11 of 12 institutions, and the
contract for the 12th is being approved. Equipment procurement is completed
at one school; for all others, most contracts have been approved or awarded,
and the few remaining tender documents are being prepared. The technical
assistance program is mostly completed; some essential services are being
prolonged under Government financing. Two schools are in operation, six are
expected to open in early 1983, and the remaining four later in 1983. The
Project Unit has improved its performance and recruited three specialists, a
condition which we had set up to finance the proposed fourth project prepara-
tion from Third Project funds. Last year, we agreed to extend the Closing
Date by one year to December 31, 1982, and to consider a further one year
extension if good progress was made toward a revised implementation schedule.
However, one more year would be necessary to complete disbursements for the
preparation of the proposed fourth project. Since the main issues have been
resolved and significant progress has been made, an extension of the Closing
Date is under consideration.
Cr. No. 673       Technical Assistance Project:  US$4.5 million Credit of
June 15, 1977; Effectiveness Date: November 14, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Project's funds have been fully committed and most pre-investment
studies financed by it--largely in agriculture, transport and planning--have
been completed. Long-term advisory consultants are continuing to assist
Cameroonian staff to improve project generation and supervision capacity,
which is being supplemented by on-the-job training and formal training
courses.
Cr. No. 723       Rural Development Fund Project:  US$7 million Credit of
August 4, 1977; Effectiveness Date: January 30, 1978;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1982.
The project's organization and progress continues to accelerate and
to consolidate; construction standards of all but one sub-project are good, as
are their planning. budgeting and accounting. It is expected that with the
available funds about 60 percent of overall objectives will be achieved at
completion. However, implementation has been slow, and Government has asked
that the closing date be extended for an additional year to make full use of
the remaining funds. A follow-up project is under consideration.

Ln. No. 1392        Second SOCAPALM Project:  US$18 million Loan and US$7
million Third Window Loan of August 25, 1977; Effectiveness
Date: November 23, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The initial loans of US$25.0 million have been reduced to US$23.6
million by elimination of the coastal estate center component. Both loans are
fully disbursed as of October 1982. Further upkeep of immature trees and
completion of processing facilities will be carried on under the Oil Palm and
Robber Consolidation Project (Loan 2160-CM). Main achievements under the
Second SOCAPALM Project have been the planting of 6,639 ha of oil palms at
Kienke estate (95 percent of the appraisal target) and of 1,746 ha by
smallholders (87 percent of appraisal). The cost to completion is estimated
at US$37.3 million against an appraisal estimate of US$32.2 million.
Cr. No. 749         Feeder Roads Project:  US$6.5 million Credit and
Ln. No. 1494        US$4.6 million Loan of December 7, 1977; Effectiveness
Date: March 7, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
Implementation of the Feeder Roads Project started in 1978. The
project includes creation of the Central Feeder Roads Unit within the Depart-
ment of Highways and a four-year construction program for 2,200 km of feeder
roads. Project implementation is behind schedule because the organization in
charge is understaffed and because of shortage of local funds. The Government
has submitted a modified program for project execution reflecting cost in-
creases, and a decentralized organizational structure, which should permit a
faster project implementation.
Cr. No. 763         Second SEMRY Rice Project:  US$14.5 million Credit of
Ln. No. 1512        February 1, 1978; Effectiveness Date:  April 14, 1978;
Closing Date: September 30, 1984; and US$14.5 million Loan
of February 1, 1978; Effectiveness Date: April 14, 1978;
Closing Date: September 30, 1984.
A satisfactory solution to the problems of dike erosion and piping
has been found, and no new erosion or piping has occurred in a test zone that
was protected. Permanent dike protection is now proceeding. Paddy yields
continue at appraisal estimates. Further irrigation works have been suspended
until existing land is fully used. Thus funds from the original financial
envelope appear to be sufficient to complete dike protection and the project
as far as is presently feasible. The program of resettlement of farmers from
neighboring, over-populated zones is proceeding at a rate consistent with
SEMRY's ability to provide adequately serviced town sites near paddy fields.
The Loan and Credit have been fully disbursed.
Ln. No. 1508        Second CAMDEV Project:  US$15 million Loan of February 1,
1978; Effectiveness Date: June 30, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
Disbursements covering CAMDEV's estates investment program have been
completed by June 1982 with a cost overrun of 29 percent in spite of reduced
planting targets: 6,300 ha of rubber (against an appraisal estimate of 7,900
ha; and 281 ha of oil palm compared to an initial estimate of 1,000 ha.  The

Page 5 of 8
closing date has been extended by one year to allow further disbursements
related to the vegetable oil marketing study and the management reorganization
study, both considered essential preconditions for the Oil Palm and Rubber
Consolidation Project (Loan 2160-CM).
Cr. No. 784         Western Highlands Project:  US$13 million Credit of
April 17, 1978; Effectiveness Date: December 8, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project is achieving its objectives and technical and financial
management is good. Although physical execution was lagging behind appraisal
schedules, owing to organizational problems encountered during the first pro-
ject year, improvements have been made in all components with corresponding
increases in procurement and disbursement rates. Government's contributions
to project financing continue to be regular, and liquidity problems due to
delays in preparation of withdrawal applications have been partly rectified.
Government has requested Bank group assistance for a follow-up project extend-
ing coverage to the entire Western Province and the project has been appraised.
Ln. No. 776         ZAPI East Integrated Rural Development Project:  US$8.5
million Credit of April 17, 1978; Effectiveness Date:
October 4, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
Project execution has deteriorated significantly since January 1983,
for a number of reasons which result from an over-ambitious and very complex
design, and a less-than-full support from some Government departments. This
has led to poor production and financial performance. Major problems now in-
clude: (i) lack of efficient, cost-effective management and staffing, whereas
the range and complexity of operations involved would require strong staffing
and control; (ii) structural deficiencies in ZAPI's marketing and credit
operations, exacerbated by inadequate and untimely Government financial sup-
port; (iii) generally insufficient and uncoordinated support from agencies
providing the needed overall support services for agriculture, such as input
supply, marketing and crop protection services. In view of this, a detailed
Aide-Memoire has been sent to the Government requesting specific corrective
actions to the problems. Additionally, the Bank recommended and drafted TOR
for an in-depth study focussing on an assessment of viable options for ZAPI in
the future. Government has responded positively to these requests, has
appointed a new ZAPI director and has accepted the principle of the study.
Cr. No. 926         Fourth Highway Project:  US$10 million Credit of
Ln. No. 1723        August 23, 1979; Effectiveness Date:  November 15, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1986; and US$38 million Loan of
same date; Effectiveness Date: November 15, 1979; Closing
Date: June 30, 1986.
The project comprises training of staff and workers for road main-
tenance, maintenance of about 17,000 km of roads and rehabilitation of 1,700
km through force account and domestic contractors, technical assistance to the
domestic construction industry, two permanent weighing stations, and pre-
investment studies for the proposed project and forestry evacuation roads.

Implementation of the Fourth Highway Project has started after initial diffi-
culties with recruiting consultants, equipment procurements, setting up the
training brigade and the training center. Equipment has been delivered to
three regions and road maintenance operations have started.
Cr. No. 975         Second HEVECAM Project:  US$15 million Credit of
Ln. No. 1791        April 18, 1980; Date:  September 16, 1980; Closing Date:
December 31, 1985; and US$16.5 million Loan of same date;
Effectiveness Date: September 16, 1980; Closing Date:
January 30, 1985.
As of June 30, 1982, total plantings amount to 9,429 ha against an
appraisal target of 9,650 ha with a cost overrun of 18 percent mainly due to
higher than expected salary increases (annual average of 15 percent against
appraisal estimate of 10 percent) and costs associated with social programs
not included in the SAR. Growth and upkeep are of acceptable standards, the
management team is good and HEVECAM's financial situation is sound and dis-
bursements are 97 percent of appraisal estimates.
Ln. No. 1753        Second Water Supply Project:  US$21 million Loan of
December 11, 1979; Effectiveness Date: Kay 12, 1981;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
The aims of the project are to improve and extend water supply sys-
tems in 13 secondary centers and two major cities, Douala and Younde; lay the
groundwork for organizing urban development planning for Douala and Yaounde;
initiate a pilot public health educational project; and strengthen the organi-
zation of the water supply sector. Engineering studies and bidding documents
are completed. Contracts for Douala and Yaounde have been awarded. However,
procurement problems are being encountered with award of contracts for the 13
centers.
Cr. No. 1010       Second Livestock Development Project:  US$16 million Credit
of June 20, 1980; Effectiveness Date: May 12, 1981;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project faces a number of moderate managerial and technical
problems. Parastatal ranches are under improved supervision which has de-
tected considerable animal losses threatening the ranches' financial viabi-
lity. A review of possible measures to be taken in dealing with the ranches
is underway. One of two slaughterhouses has begun operations. Management and
technical problems continue to make the tse-tse fly eradication program less
than fully successful and corrective measures are being discussed with Govern-
ment. The credit component has not become effective owing to difficulties in
making co-financing effective. However, restructuring of animal health ser-
vices is proceeding satisfactorily in the Adamoua Plateau Zone.

Ln. No. 1919        Northern Province Rural Development Project:  US$25
Cr. No. 1075        million  Loan of January 27, 1981; Effectiveness Date:
June 1, 1981; Closing Date: June 30, 1986; and US$12.5
million Credit of same date; Effectiveness Date: June 1,
1981; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
Since effectiveness on June 1, 1981, this project has achieved
remarkable results. Despite lower than normal rainfall during 1981, seed
cotton production with 93 percent of the buying campaign completed, is expect-
ed to reach 47,000 tons or about 85 percent of the SAR target of 56,000 tons
for PY1. Food crop production during the first year was negligible, for
1982/83, however, the project estimates to plant about 1,200 ha and 250 ha,
respectively, of improved maize and groundnuts. The project accounts are kept
by computer and the system developed permits the Financial Controller monthly
balances and comparison with annual budgets for each project component. More-
over, reimbursement applications are produced on a monthly basis by means of a
simple program established by the project's Financial Controller. Key local
personnel and expatriates have largely been recruited.
Cr. No. 1168        Second Technical Cooperation Project:  US$10 million Credit
of November 5, 1981; Effectiveness Date: June 16, 1982;
Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
The project aims at improving Government capacity to execute the
Fifth Development Plan. It is expected to strengthen existing national plan-
ning and external debt management systems, to help define better policies and
investment programs in key sectors, and to generate sound projects by stress-
ing the training of Cameroonian experts. Recruitment of 10 experts in various
sectors is underway and further subprojects (procurement and legal advice) are
being prepared.
Ln. No. 2073        Post and Telecommunications Technical Assistance Project:
US$7.5 million loan of March 19, 1982; Effectiveness
Date: July 21, 1982; Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
The purpose of the project is to reorganize and strengthen the Post
and Telecommunications entity so as to improve its financial situation and the
quality of service and to pave the way for a sound long term development of
the sector. It provides for establishment of a new operating entity, prepara-
tion of an investment program and improved technical training. The consul-
tants have submitted their diagnosis and proposals for a new entity (Part I of
the Project) which are being reviewed by Government. A decision on a follow-
up course of action (Part II of the Project) is expected shortly.
Ln. No. 2092        Forestry Project:  US$17 million loan, not yet signed.  Not
yet effective.
The project's objectives are to strengthen the contribution of the
forestry sector to the economy through the establishment of plantations for
fuelwood and pulp industry raw material. It is also expected to increase the
capacity of Government agencies to continue the regeneration of forests and to
control the logging operations of forestry concessions. Signing has not taken

Ln. No. 1920         Second Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprise Project:  US$15
million Loan of September 30, 1981; Effectiveness Date:
October 29, 1982.
The project s objectives are to expand the provision of financial
and technical assistance to artisans and small- and medium-scale enterprises
and to further strengthen institutions responsible for the promotion of the
small enterprise sector.
Ln. No. 2160         Oil Palm and Rubber Consolidation Project:  US$50.8 million
Loan of July 26, 1982; Not yet effective.
The project aims at consolidating investments made under previous
Bank Group-assisted projects. It will help strengthen the financial situation
of SOCAPALM and CAMDEV and will allow the structural improvements needed for
oil palm and rubber development. The project also includes provision for
technical assistance, training and studies and continued support to small-
holder schemes.
Ln. No. 2180         Fifth Highway Project:  US$70 million Loan of July 26,
1982; Not yet effective.
The purpose of the project is to assist the Government in the con-
struction of the Edea-Yaounde section of the Douala-Yaounde road. It also
provides for technical assistance to improve the management of the transport
sector, and to help prepare a national transport plan and future projects.
Implementation of the project is so far on schedule with the exception of the
civil works for lot 7 of the Douala/Yaounde road, where a procurement issue
has delayed start up of construction works.
