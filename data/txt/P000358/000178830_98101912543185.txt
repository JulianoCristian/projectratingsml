STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. The Urban Setting
1.01      With an estimated 2.6 million urban residents out of an estimated
total population of 8.4 million in 1980 (31%), Cameroon has the fourth largest
urban population of countries in West Africa and is the fourth most urbanized
country in the region after Congo-Brazzaville, Ghana and Ivory Coast. The
sector has been characterized by rapid growth and a polycentric structure.
From a peak of around 10% in the 1960s, the annual urban growth rate averaged
around 7% in the 1970s and is expected to taper off to around 6% over the
1990s and to 5% by the year 2000. These growth rates imply that half of
Cameroon's population will be urban by 1990, 65% by the year 2000, and that
80% of total net overall growth in the total population from 1980 to 2000
(about 6.3 million out of 7.6 million) will be absorbed by towns and cities
(see Table 1).

1.02      In contrast to a number of other West African countries such as
the Ivory Coast where a single city dominates, Cameroon divides roughly into
three distinct economic spheres of influence, corresponding roughly to the
main ethnic groupings. Douala, the country's main port and industrial center
and its largest city (600,000 population in 1980), is also the regional
economic center for the provinces of the western region, Cameroon's agricul-
tural and commercial heart and its most densely settled region (see Maps
15562, 15625). The second largest city, Yaounde (420,000 in 1980), is the
economic center of the south-central and eastern regions as well as the
nation's capital. The secondary towns of Garoua and Maroua, (90,000 and
85,000 in 1980) 500 kms up-country, serve as centers of the third economic
sphere of influence, the sparsely settled northern savannah lands. Besides
this polycentric structure, Cameroon's urban sector is notable for the marked
importance of the secondary centers, which play as large a role in absorbing
urban migrants as the two main cities put together.
1.03      Cameroon's agricultural sector produces 30% of GDP, 70% of export
revenues and employs three-quarters of the labor force. Though there are
no direct estimates of the share of GDP produced in urban areas, the urban-
based labor force probably accounts for over 45% (or 50%, including oil),
considering the higher productivity of urban-located manufacturing as com-
pared to the agricultural labor force. Manufacturing and public administra-
tion alone account for 17% of GDP, and a substantial part of trade (16%),
transport, communications and other services are also urban-based, as is the
rapidly growing petroleum sector, with wells located offshore of Douala and a
new major refinery in nearby Victoria. In terms of the country's maturing
economic structure--increasing manufacturing and processing for export, and
substitution of local manufactures for imports--Cameroon's cities have an
important role to play.
1.04      The main issues common to all urban areas are provision of adequate
water supply, drainage and sanitation, land registration and tenure, and
development of periurban land to absorb new growth. Forty-five percent of
urban residents lack access to piped water; particularly in low-income areas,
even piped water is often unsafe. More than 90% of urban residents do not
hold registered title to the land on which they have built, though they must
pay occupation rights to the customary landowner. Densification of poorly
serviced traditional residential areas predating independence has reached
saturation and structures are springing up on unserviced periurban sites.
The gradual extension of infrastructure networks is poorly coordinated and
poorly planned and lags behind spontaneous house construction. These problems
are both most visible and more easily addressed in Yaounde and Douala which
are also the headquarters of the major Government institutions active in
these fields.



B. Douala and Yaounde
1.05      Douala and Yaounde presently contain about 38% of urban residents and
12% of Cameroon-s population. Assuming annual growth rates of 6% for Douala
and 6.5% for Yaounde, Douala will pass the one million mark by 1990 and
Yaounde by 1995. Douala, located at the mouth of the Wouri River on the Gulf
of Guinea, is the country's industrial, commercial and financial center.
It has been a major trade center since the arrival of the Portuguese in the
sixteenth century and its port now handles virtually all import-export traffic
as well as goods en route to or from land-locked Chad and the Central African
Republie. Yaounde has served as the administrative center of Cameroon since
1915. Located on the borders of the coastal forest where the northern savannah
begins, the settlement was established as a staging point by the Germans in
the late 1880s and became the country's crossroads.
1.06      In both cities, the city boundaries, which initially included only
the administrative and commercial centers, have been progressively extended
outward to include the numerous low-income residential areas which had grown
up spontaneously on either side of major highways (see Maps 15292R, 15293R).
Though Douala's population is half again as large as Yaounde's, the built-up
areas of both cities cover about the same area (4,800 ha) because densities
in Douala are higher. More of Douala s flat river basin terrain is buildable
than is the case in hilly Yaounde. Work to update Yaounde's master plan has
been underway with French technical assistance since the 1960s but no plan
has yet been completed nor has work begun to update Douala's master plan.
Plans have been drawn up recently for a large area of undeveloped land known
as North Douala and a smaller site at South Yaounde. Thus there is a need
for comprehensive, up-to-date structure plans to be drawn up, which requires
key decisions on growth alternatives.
Employment and Poverty
1.07      Industry and commerce each employs a quarter of the work force in
Douala while employment in Yaounde is dominated by government and service
sectors (48%). About three-quarters of the work force in Yaounde and two-
thirds in Douala receive a salary; the rest are independent, mostly self-
employed. Extensive studies of the informal sector have shown that it plays a
number of important roles. It is a point of entry for new workers, a source
of income to supplement minimum wage earnings, and it produces a wide range of
goods and services for low-income groups. This sector's productivity has been
limited by lack of access to credit for working capital and equipment, and
lack of marketing information and basic management skills. Demand for its
products and services, which must compete with better quality manufactured and
imported goods, could be expanded with improvements in production techniques,
especially product finishing, and with better distribution and marketing
mechanisms.
1.08      The proportion of households below the absolute poverty income
threshold in Douala (CFAF 36,300 per household per month or $290 per person
per year) is about 25% or 150,000 out of 600,000 residents. The poverty thres-
hold is higher in Yaounde because households there are slightly larger and the



- 4 -
cost of living is about 10% higher than in Douala. A quarter of Yaounde-s
population, or 105,000 out of 420,000 persons, falls below that city's poverty
income threshold of about CFA 40,000 per household per month ($320 per person
per year). Average income figures mask variations between neighborhoods,
particularly in Douala: the percentage of households falling below the
poverty level is 55% in Douala's Nylon squatter area and 33% in Yaounde's
traditional low-income areas. Average GNP per capita in Cameroon is $668
(1979). Income distributions based on recent surveys for Yaounde, Douala
and Nylon are shown below:

75               97,600            94,000          53,200
Urban Infrastructure and Services
1.09      Two-thirds of the population of both Douala and Yaounde live in
older, denser residential areas which grew up before 1960 along main roads
leading into the center city. New-Bell in Douala and Briquetterie in Yaounde
are examples of such traditional areas which have similar problems in both
cities: inadequate drainage, water supply, solid waste disposal, and lack of
clear and permanent title to land. The drainage network is far from adequate
to absorb runoff. In Douala where large areas of the city lie only a few feet
above the water table there is widespread flooding during the rainy season; in
Yaounde, the result is erosion of stream-beds and roads and flooding in low-
lying areas. Standpipes and a small number of private water connections are
used by about two-thirds of residents; however leakage and overflow from pit
latrines and septic tanks has polluted the water table, which particularly
affects the remaining third who draw their water from wells and streams. An
insufficient number of garbage collection points has meant a chronic buildup
of solid wastes in streams and drains and between houses. There is a need for
city water and drainage plans and for major investment to correct infrastructure
inadequacies, and for improved road access and expansion of municipal garbage
services to deal with the waste problem.
1.10      Primary health and education facilities in both cities are generally
well-distributed and accessible, except on the urban periphery. Around 90% of
primary school-age children are enrolled compared to a nationwide average of
60%. However, the public sector is providing only a portion of these services
and private education and health costs can be a considerable financial burden
to low-income groups. Thus there is a need to extend the coverage of public
services in these sectors into outlying areas and, over time, to increase
availability of low-cost services.



-5-
Housing
1.11      Most house construction in Cameroon is done by very small firms or
individual building tradesmen (tâlcherons) working with homeowners. The local
construction industry is well developed, private sector housing construction
has kept pace with demand, and there are no major constraints affecting the
supply or cost of locally produced building materials. A temporary structure,
wattle and daub (poto-poto) in Yaounde and wood scrap in Douala, usually
roofed with sheet metal, costs about $25/m2 to build when the owner shares the
work or $30/m2 if he does not (1981 prices).  A semi-permanent structure of
cement-faced poto-poto or milled wood planks costs two to three times as much
and a permanent cement block structure five to six times as much (about
$140/mJ). House construction is a major goal of savings--up to a third of
income for young households--and home ownership is widespread.  However, the
quality of construction is low:  about two-thirds of housing stock in the
traditional neighborhoods is made of temporary materials.  This is only partly
due to low incomes: there is a reluctance to invest in permanent construction
in the absence of secure tenure.
Land Tenure
1.12      Between 40% and 60% of households own the houses in which they live
but only about 10% of residents hold registered title to the land, and most
of these are the well-to-do.  In the traditional areas about half the land is
officially in the public domain, with specific sites assigned to the munici-
pality or to the ministries in charge of education, health and other social
services, but the other half is controlled by a small number of customary
landlords.  Occupation rights paid to these landowners by residents often run
as high as outright purchases but give no protection from eviction and cannot
be used to obtain either construction loans or building permits. There is
also an active market in untitled or illegally titled plots. The staffing
and organization of the land survey and registry departments of the Ministry
of Urbanism and Habitat (MINUH) are inadequate to deal even with the small
number of transactions which come to them, much less with tackling the
larger problem. These services need more resources and more efficient
procedures in order to do their job.
The Nylon Area of Douala
1.13      The above portrait applies generally to the older traditional areas
where most residents of Yaounde and Douala live. Infrastructure networks have
been gradually extended into peripheral areas postdating independence, which
are less dense; roads and water are the first to arrive with schools and
health facilities lagging well behind.  There is one major periurban settlement
in Douala, however, which has been bypassed, and conditions tiere have no
counterpart in Yaounde. First established in 1950s as a resettlement area for
residents of next-door New-Bell displaced by road construction, the Nylon area
has grown rapidly within the last ten years through the influx of primarily
Bamileke migrants, who are noted for their cohesive social structure.  The
area, now covering 600 ha and located 3-4 km west of city center on the
airport road, houses about 90,000 persons, or 15% of the city's population,



-6-
and a third of its urban poor (see Map 15298). For many years, Douala's
city administration, dominated by the original Douala ethnic group, main-
tained that since this low-lying, swampy area had been designated as reserve
or green space in the 1968 master plan, no infrastructure or services were to
be installed. However, since 1975 in the context of preparing a national
urban development policy, Nylon was identified by both city and national
officials as a top priority area for upgrading, and both now fully recognize
the importance of starting action there to get such a program underway.
1.14      The area is presently served by a single standpipe, a single low-
tension line, and lacks street lighting. The unpaved roads are inaccessible
to buses or garbage vehicles. Though there are two private dispensaries and
20 private primary schools, there were no public schools until 1979 and there
are still no public health facilities. Food and drink vendors abound but
there is no market, since these are built and run by the city and in any case
trucks could not get through. Its greatest physical problems are internal
road access and drainage, since its rudimentary network receives runoff and
waste from the adjacent industrial zone. Thus unlike its quick-drying name-
sake, Nylon during the rainy season never dries out. Its greatest strength is
an effective and well-organized system of thirteen neighborhood action commit-
tees which have for ten years organized work groups to fill the swampy land
and construct and maintain bridges, drainage canals, and roads.
C. Institutions, Policies and Programs
Urban Institutions
1.15      Urban management, administration and investment functions have
traditionally been shared by three levels of government--the ministries' and
parastatals' central offices; their provincial offices; and the municipalities
which are the third tier of the Ministry of Territorial Affairs after the
provinces. In general, policy development and preparation of final budget
submissions to the Finance and Planning Minis tries are the prerogative of the
central offices, on the basis of local submissions; the provincial offices
administer central government sponsored programs at the local level; the
municipalities deal primarily with maintenance and the operation of local
facilities such as markets.
1.16      Urban policy, planning and housing functions are vested in the
Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MINUH).  Formerly part of the
public works ministry, MINUH was established as a separate ministry in 1977,
and shortly thereafter also incorporated land registry and land management
functions and regional policy and planning functions, previously attached to
other ministries. MINUH is assisted by three parastatals created by presiden-
tial decree: SIC (Societe Immobiliere du Cameroun), MAETUR (Mission d'Amenage-
ment et d'Equipement des Terrains Urbains et Ruraux), and CFC (Credit Foncier
du Cameroun). SIC, which dates back to the 1960s, constructs high-cost units
for rent, sale, or lease-purchase to civil servants and other high-income
individuals. MAETUR and CFC were created in 1977 to finance and carry out



- 7 -
large land development and housing finance schemes. MAETUR is a national
urban and rural land development agency with authority to carry out its own
residential land developments as well as those destined for subsequent
housing development by SIC. The housing finance institution, CFC, receives
earmarked funds from a housing tax on all wage employment and lends to MAETUR
for infrastructure works and to SIC and to individuals for house construction.
1.17      A fourth parastatal, FEICOM (Fonds Spécial d'Equipement et d'Inter-
vention Intercommunal), came into operation in 1978 under the dual direction
of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Territorial Affairs. It is
designed to channel certain earmarked local and central government monies into
specific municipal investments such as markets and into training programs for
local personnel. Other agencies responsible for urban services are SNEC
(Societeé Nationale des Eaux de Caméroun) and SONEL (Societe' Nationale d'Elec-
tricite), the financially autonomous water and electricity parastatals
which build and manage the utility networks under the direction of the Ministry
of Mines and Energy. Community facilities are built and run by the Ministries
of Education, Health, Social Affairs, and Youth and Sports. The small enter-
prise sector receives credit from the BCD (Banque Camérounaise de Développement)
and technical assistance through the CAPME (Centre National d'Assistance au
Petites et Moyennes Entreprises), which reports to the Planning Ministry.
1.18      The municipalities of Yaounde and Douala are headed by presidentially
appointed mayors assisted by municipal councils. They have traditionally
restricted their activities to road and market construction and maintenance
(except for urban portions of the national highway system), garbage collection,
standpipes and street lighting. Yaounde has also recently built a new city
hall and municipal market. Roughly 30% of municipal revenues come from locally
collected taxes and fees and 70% from the portion of centrally collected urban
taxes which are returned to the municipalities. There is no property tax in
Cameroon. Though both Yaounde and Douala manage relatively well the limited
budgets at their disposal, these budgets are too small even to maintain
adequate service levels: they total roughly $10 million a year in Yaounde and
$20 million in Douala (1980). The exception is Douala's roads, which absorb
half of the city's budget and are generally in good repair (see also para.
5.04).
Government Policies and Programs
1.19      The Government of Cameroon first became active in the housing sector
in the late 1970s. Prior to that time, major urban-related investments were
made by Government in the water sector and in port and highway infrastructure.
The Bank and IDA participated in these through the First Water Supply, SME
and Port Projects and a series of Highway Projects.  Initiative for new
housing finance and construction was left to the private sector, and central
government's own housing activities were limited to the construction of a few
hundred high-standard units by SIC and housing construction loans to high-
income groups through BCD. Yaounde municipality also laid out about 45 ha a
year of unserviced plots for families displaced during the 1970s by inner
city redevelopment.



- 8 -
1.20      Major government institutional objectives in the sector were first
set out in plan documents and ministerial working papers prepared for the
Fourth Plan (1976-1980). MAETUR and CFC were created in 1977 and began
operations in the following year, the first year that CFC began receiving
funds from the housing tax. MAETUR began civil works in late 1980 and is now
active on five sites in Yaounde and Douala totalling about 350 ha, 35 of
which are now ready for allocation. Government already holds land reserves
for a long-term program, and approval of MINUH budget proposals for the Fifth
Plan Period (1981-86) would provide financing for infrastructure to service
2,500 ha for MAETUR site and service lots and 350 ha for SIC houses over the
Fifth Plan Period. Cameroon's national sites and services program is thus
already well-launched, and realization of this program would go a long way
towards satisfying new demand above the 50th income percentile over the plan
period, with less of an impact between the 25th and 50th percentiles.
1.21      The role of the municipalities is not expected to change over the
Fifth Plan Period since MINUH estimates their resources will not allow them to
do more than concentrate on limited local services and maintenance. Yaounde
plans to continue to provide minimally serviced plots to residents dislocated
by inner city redevelopment and Douala has initiated a similar program, but
these programs are very small and their only objective is to free land for
non-residential uses.
1.22      The Bank has played an advisory role in urban and housing policy
since 1975, when the Government of Cameroon extended an invitation to send
an urban sector mission. Important aspects of the sector mission's findings
were used in the formulation of urban and housing sections of the Fourth Plan.
The Government-Bank dialogue on policy issues and investment programs has
continued since that time through project preparation missions and with the
assistance of the Resident Mission and of an advisor to the Director of
Urbanism and Habitat in MINUH provided from 1979-1981 through the First Tech-
nical Assistance Project. The issues which have been stressed in the past
and which will continue to be major themes in this and possible follow-up
projects are the strengthening of institutions capable of sustaining long-term,
land development, housing finance and area upgrading programs; coming to grips
with land administration problems; and the adoption of standards and of cost
allocation and recovery mechanisms such that sustainable government infrastruc-
ture investment can derive a program which is affordable to all income groups.
1.23      By and large, the Government has been very responsive to Bank con-
cerns; the new institutions have been soundly organized, staffed and financed;
and standards and cost recovery concerns are reflected in the design of the
start-up program. MAETUR's site and service existing program include options
affordable down to the 25th percentile; MAETUR lot sale prices are calculated
to recover on-site infrastructure and land costs; temporary land rights
granted with MAETUR plot allocation qualify allottees for CFC housing loans
and permanent title is granted once a house is built. Government is aware of
the budgetary implications of financing off-site infrastructure for the MAETUR
program, and the growth of Government revenues, especially once energy produc-
tion takes off, is expected to provide a sound financial base for continuing
substantial public investment in primary urban infrastructure, among other



priority investments. Governrment is also very much aware that the private
sector must continue to finance and carry out the bulk of land development
even after MAETUR reaches its target of servicing 700 ha a year. To facilitate
this, MINUH proposes to spend $35 million in the Fifth Plan Period to simplify
and speed up land administration procedures and to turn out useable land use
and infrastructure network plans. The Bank-assisted Second Water Supply
Project also includes funds for water and drainage master plans for Yaounde
and Douala.
1.24      Three broad sector issues have emerged and will require attention:
the municipalities' limited technical and financial base compared to their
potential role in urban development; incipient traffic problems fed by increas-
ing motorization, and inadequate public transport capacity; and the dearth of
technical and management skills to handle MINUH's burgeoning programs.
1.25      The Bank's strategy in the sector is to continue policy and program-
ming support to MINUH through a full-time advisor and to provide specific
project support which complements the Government's program and reinforces
it where necessary. This means, for the first project, addressing the need
to strengthen institutional, financial, and land tenure mechanisms for up-
grading. Assuming reasonable progress, subsequent operations could build on
experience gained in the first project, and could also address the shelter
needs of the secondary centers and provide specific support to strengthen the
technical capabilities of the municipalities and their ability to mobilize
local resources.
II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Objectives
2.01      The main objectives of this project are to get a major upgrading
effort underway in Cameroon to raise infrastructure standards to an environ-
mentally acceptable minimum, and to strengthen the institutional base for
a continuing upgrading and low-cost housing program in Cameroon. The project
is designed to attain these objectives by (a) bringing up to an acceptable
minimum standard the environmental sanitation conditions and road access in
Douala's worst urban squatter area, Nylon; (b) carrying out complete upgrading
in a smaller zone within Nylon for the first time in Cameroon; (c) estab-
lishing an institutional mechanism for upgrading which can subsequently be
transformed to continue upgrading in other areas; and (d) strengthening other
existing institutions on which the future of urban development depends, in
particular MINUH's land administration sections.  A secondary objective to
increase productivity of self-employed artisans in project areas would be
achieved by providing site-specific assistance to artisans designed to
complement a concurrent IDF small- and medium-sized enterprise project
(Second SME Project).

C. Detailed Features and Design Standards
Development of Nylon (Douala)
2.03      The project feasibility study developed a long-term plan for upgrad-
ing the 600 ha Nylon area, beginning with priority major infrastructure works
in order to quickly bring road access, environmental conditions and community
facilities up to an acceptable minimum. This would be followed by a much
slower process of completing the upgrading through the provision of secondary
and tertiary infrastructure and regularizing land tenure. Only a first stage
pilot program of complete upgrading, in one neighborhood, would be carried out
in the proposed project. The latter would serve as a first step in the total
upgrading of Nylon which is expected to extend beyond the project period,
possibly for 10 years. The two-stage process in Nylon also would demonstrate
the feasibility of this approach for other areas where some basic infrastruc-
ture is already in place. Project subcomponents described below are shown
on Map 15298.



- il -
2.04      Primary Infrastructure in Nylon.  Major roads, drainage, refuse
bins, street lighting and water will be provided to the entire 600 ha area to
ensure basic access, to solve the major drainage and garbage removal problems
and to increase the availability of potable water. About 20 km of surfaced
road (17 km of 12 m right-of-way (ROW) and 3 km of 30 m ROW); 17 km of drains
(7 to 35 m2 cross section, 14 km earth, 3 km concrete); 39 refuse bins
(7 m3 capacity); 9.4 km medium and low-tension electrical lines with trans-
formers for public lighting and eventual private connections; and 10 km
of water pipes (100-300 mm diameter) and 40 public standpipes will be pro-
vided. Financing is also included for improvements to an adjacent area of
30 ha (900 lots) for people to be resettled from infrastructure rights of way,
and community facility sites. The extensive works and the associated high
costs are necessary because of the unique situation of Nylon. Because it is
very low-lying, it drains a large part of the surrounding area and is often
subject to flooding. The drainage system in Nylon, which is the largest
single element in the project, thus serves a significant portion of the city
of Douala beyond Nylon itself. Roadworks also are extensive because of the
extremely poor condition of existing road access. These improvements will
benefit all 90,000 area residents at a base cost of $14.5 million, or $161
per capita ($850 per household).
2.05      Major Drainage Mgoua.  The Mgoua River is the main draini of the
Nylon watershed.  It cannot absorb outflow from an improved drainage network
in Nylon unless major works are undertaken. The project includes financing
to dredge and straighten the river downstream of Nylon and to reinforce the
river banks where it flows through Nylon, including construction of a passage
under the airport access road. Base cost of this element is estimated
at $4.6 million.
2.06      Pilot Neighborhood Upgrading in Nylon.  As a first phase of long-
term complete upgrading, a first tranche of 50 ha (13,000 residents) has been
chosen, corresponding to a neighborhood organization unit (quartier). The
neighborhood chosen is one of the oldest and best organized of Nylon's 13
neighborhoods and upgrading here would serve as a model for other neighbor-
hoods. Secondary and tertiary infrastructure would be installed in this zone
in order to demonstrate how full upgrading including delivery of tenure should
be carried out. This infrastructure involves about 2 km of surfaced roads
(12 m ROW), 4.2 km of laterite roads (12 m ROW), about 6 km of drains (5 km
earth, 1 km concrete), about 3 km of PVC water pipes (80-150 mm diameter), and
30 public standpipes; 10.5 km of medium- and low-tension electrical lines which
provide street lighting along this zone's major road axis and sufficient
capacity for eventual 100% private connections; and 24 refuse bins of 7 m3 capa-
city. The base cost is $1.2 million or $90 per capita ($490 per household).
2.07      Housing Loans for the Pilot Uipgrading Area.  In the pilot neighbor-
hood upgrading area in Nylon (Douala) 600 loans will be granted for plot
purchase and home improvement, pit latrines and, where affordable, individual
electrical and water connections. This will cover the anticipated loan demand
in the area (about 50% of the plot holders). The loans will vary according
to the financial capability of the beneficiaries. The average loan amount is



- 12 -
expected to be about $1,370 ($2,371 for both plot acquisition and house
construction) and the range is expected to be from about $750 ($1,200 including
plot acquisition) to about $1,860 ($3,740 including plot acquisition). The
total amount reserved for home improvement is $0.8 million. Construction and
improvement loans will be secured by plot title (see Chapter IV for details on
tenure procedures).
2.08      Community Facilities.  The provision through the project of $1.2
million to build and equip two 18-classroom primary schools will permit
reduction of average class size from 80 to 65 with no increase in double
sessions and will also increase the share of public classrooms from 18% to
30%. The project provides Nylon with its first public health facilities: a
dispensary and an MCH center, each about 250 m2, at a base cost including
equipment of $123,000 each. Additional sites will be reserved for future
schools and health centers. A sum of $75,000 has been included for start-up
costs of a health and nutrition education program prepared by the provincial
Social Affairs and Health Offices, including a demonstration program to build
various types of improved pit latrines. This program would be suitable for
continuing financing reserved in the Second Water Supply Project. Five small
(200-300 m2) neighborhood community centers will be constructed by residents
using materials financed under the project and equipped including a vehicle
for the resident Social Affairs worker in Nylon (total cost $165,000). In
addition to primary school sports fields intended for student use, three
community sports fields are to be financed, one with a small youth center
(total cost $123,000).
2.09      Retail Market.  A large retail market of 10,000 m2 would be
constructed in an area presently utilized for an open-air market, including
enclosed and covered market areas and parking, and stalls for meat and fish,
at a base cost of $2.8 million. Mobile stalls to be used for other goods
would be built of wood by the vendors. Total land area reserved for the
market (20,000 m2) would also provide parking space for taxis, buses and
private vehicles. Additional land area of 16,000 m2 to the south of pro-
posed market would be reserved for future market expansion.
2.10      Artisan Assistance.  Technical and managerial assistance to arti-
sans and very small entrepreneurs in Nylon would be provided at a base cost
of $0.6 million by financing (a) equipment, supplies and staff for Nylon
offices to be opened by the Centre National d'Assistance aux Petites et
Moyennes Entreprises (CAPME), and (b) 48 staff-months' salary for an experi-
enced Cameroonian manager and a trained bookkeeper for the Caisse Populaire de
Nylon (CPN). This site-specific technical assistance in the proposed urban
project is complemented by access to an existing $1 million artisan line of
credit (maximum loan $25,000), through the Banque Camerounaise de Developpe-
ment (BCD) financed by the Second SME Project approved in November 1980. The
content and implementation arrangements for this component were worked out
during project preparation in close collaboration with Bank IDF Staff who
prepared the Second SME Project (see para. 4.17).

Community Facilities and Artisan Assistance in Yaounde Northwest
2.11      As mentioned above, primary infrastructure and pilot upgrading
in the Northwest area of Yaounde, part of the project feasibility study,
was dropped from the project at pre-appraisal but it was decided to include
the financing of certain community facilities in the area as well as support
to artisans. The following community facilities would be constructed and
equipped under the project: 24 primary school classrooms, one MCH center, one
dispensary, a youth center with a sports field, renovation of a social center.
Total base cost of these facilities amounts to $1.2 million. Construction of
a simple market and an artisan center for $1.0 million would also be included.
These facilities are to be located on land belonging either to the state or to
the municipality of Yaounde, which has agreed to transfer the specific sites
to the relevant ministries (see Map 15293R). Artisan assistance similar
to that for the Nylon area in Douala would be offered in Northwest Yaounde
through extension agents working from small CAPME offices in the area through
the Yaounde Credit Union Association (Union des Caisses Populaires de Yaounde
or UCPY) at a base cost of $570,000.
Technical Assistance and Studies 1/
2.12      A total of 20.5 staff-years of consultant support will be provided
for two purposes: (a) to assist in project implementation; and (b) to increase
sectoral knowledge and prepare follow-on projects. Total base cost is $6.8
million including provision for cost of equipment, vehicles, local travel and
a lump sum for detailed engineering studies of the second project. The
average staff-month cost based on individual fees, social benefits, interna-
tional travel and real allowances is expected to be about $11,000.
2.13      Technical Assistance for Project Implementation.  A total of 96
staff-months of technical assistance is proposed to complement existing
technical assistance and aid Government in building its urban development
institutions and in carrying out the project.
(a) MAETUR/ARAN. Thirty six staff-months for a technical assistant-
director for development, experienced in managing upgrading
projects, to act as counterpart to the Cameroonian director;
$200,000 to equip the offices of ARAN and $37,000 for tools and
equipment for the Nylon community committees' continuing work
program.
(b) MINUH/DUH. Twenty-four staff-months for an urban economist experi-
enced in project management to assist MINUH with project coordina-
tion and supervision and 12 staff-months of periodic auditing
1/   In addition to the Technical Assistance described above, other elements
of technical assistance which were originally part of this project will
now be financed under the Second Technical Assistance Project (Credit
No. 1168 CM) and therefore, do not appear in the description of this
project or in the costs tables. These elements involve a training expert
for 24 staff-months with related training equipment as well as vehicles
and equipment for MINUH's regional offices.



- 14 -
services to audit the various agencies concerned by the project in
order to fulfill the audit requirements.
(c)  MINUH/Land Registration Service.  Twenty-four staff-months for an
expert in land tenure management systems, for the provincial land
registration services in Yaounde and Douala, to reorganize the land
registry offices dealing with the project areas; $310,000 will also
be provided for mini-computers and other equipment necessary to
mechanize the land registry offices. This support will initially
be used to assure implementation of land tenure objectives in the
upgrading areas but subsequently will form the basis for improved
city-wide performance by the land registry offices.
2.14      Studies.  The phasing of study execution will be precisely defined
with Government in order to optimize their usefulness for both the training
program and the preparation of future projects.
(a)  A 60-staff-month feasibility study for the preparation of a Second
Urban Development Project which will involve Douala, Yaounde
and some secondary cities and associated detailed engineering at a
total base cost of 1.8 million.
(b)  Thirty staff-months for a feasibility study to prepare an urban
transport project for Douala and Yaounde. The total base cost of
this element amounts to $370,000.
(c)  Thirty-six months for a study to help define a 5-year investment
and recurrent cost program for Douala and Yaounde at a base cost
of $440,000.
(d)  Twenty-four months for urban studies and technical assistance to be
specified during project execution at a base cost of $293,000.
III. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Cost Estimates
3.01      Total project cost including contingencies is estimated at CFAF
14,769 million ($54.7 million) of which 51% or CFAF 7,493 million ($27.8
million) is the foreign exchange component. Summary cost estimates are shown
in Table 2 and detailed cost estimates are included in Annex 1. Base cost
estimates are as of December 1981 prices and are based on:
(a)  preliminary engineering for civil works for upgrading (see para.
3.12);
(b)  unit costs of similar works recently undertaken as well as
of construction of markets and other buildings;



- 15 -
(c) prices supplied by MINUH, MAETUR and the ministries respon-
sible for community facilities;
(d) current costs of consulting services in Cameroon.
3.02       Physical contingencies have been estimated at 15% on civil works
and construction and 10% on other elements. Price contingencies for local
costs are based on inflation in the local construction industry during the
project implementation period estimated by the mission at 15% for FY82 and
the following years. The rate of inflation for price contingencies for
foreign costs has been estimated at 12.6% for 1982, 9.5% for 1983, 1984 and
1985 and 8% for 1986, which is the appraisal mission's best estimate of
expected price increases on the foreign cost element of the project in
Cameroon based on current and projected cost increases in France, which is
Cameroon's primary supplier of goods and services.  The estimated cost of land
acquisition including compensation to be paid to customary occupants amounts
to CFAF 88 million ($330,000).
B. Financing Plan
3.03       The proposed IBRD loan of $20 million, which includes the capitalized
1.5% front-end fee, would finance 36% of total project costs (44% of total
cost net of taxes). Swiss Government parallel financing would provide approxi-
mately $5.5 million or 10% of total project costs for the retail market and
community facilities of Nylon and the Nylon health and nutrition education
program. The Government of Cameroon would provide the balance of project
financing, $29.5 million or 54% of total requirements. The financing plan is
summarized in Table 3 below.

3.04     CFC will finance long-term plot acquisition and house construction!
improvement loans from its own tax resources using its current program terms
(see para. 5.08). At negotiations, in order to ensure adequate funding for
those components of the project to be financed by CFC, agreement was reached
with the Government and CFC on a 1982-86 investment program. Such a program
has been designed to utilize all currently identified resources available to
CFC.
C. Flow of Funds and On-Lending Terms
3.05     The flow of funds is shown in Chart 1.  The Government of Cameroon
will pass on to the project executing agencies the proceeds of the IBRD loan,
the parallel financing, and its own contribution in the form of loans where
cost recovery is required or grants where no cost recovery is required in
accordance with current Government practice. For on-site civil works, costs
of which are to be recovered from beneficiaries, financing will pass through
the financial intermediary, CFC, which will bear the foreign exchange risk for
this element of financing.  For project works in Nylon, financing for non-
recoverable items such as primary infrastructure, community facilities and
technical assistance, will pass directly to the agency concerned, that is
MAETUR/ARAN. Financing of small business promotion will pass through the
appropriate ministry (MINEP) directly to the agency concerned (CAPME).

3.06        On-lending terms for project funds to the financial intermediaries
and executing agencies are shown in Table 5 below as agreed at negotiations.
Terms for recoverable infrastructure costs are based on the current rate in
the low-income shelter sector (5.5%). In the case of infrastructure, the
duration is that required to complete construction and sale of plots serviced
(4 years). Terms to the financial intermediary (CFC) are based on the margin
required for risk and operating costs: 2%. A repayment period of 30 years is
suggested to permit recycling of the IBRD funds in the sector through this
institution in order to allow continuing financing for further projects.
3.07        In addition to the project agreements between IBRD and the primary
agencies concerned with the project (MAETUR, and CFC), subsidiary financing
agreements will be executed between the Government and CFC and between CFC
and MAETUR.   Separate agreements will be entered between the Government of
Switzerland, MAETUR/ARAN, FEICOM and the Municipality for the market of
Nylon.

D. Procurement
3.08      Contracts for an aggregate value of $16.7 million equivalent (base
cost) for procurement associated with major civil works ($15.2 million) and
equipment ($1.5 million) would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines. To the
extent practicable, contracts would be grouped both to permit efficient bulk
procurement and to meet implementation targets. For bid evaluation purposes,
a preferential margin of 15% or the value of the applicable customs duties,
whichever is lower, would be allowed for materials and equipment manufactured
in Cameroon.
3.09      A number of small contracts each less than $0.50 million per unit
works and less than $0.1 per unit goods totalling $6.4 million equivalent
not likely to attract foreign suppliers or contractors would be awarded after
competitive bidding advertised locally (open also to bidders without local
representation for Bank financed elements). These would include (a) office
equipment, furniture and suppliers for ARAN and the land registry offices; (b)
the retail market and the community facilities of Nylon financed by Switzer-
land; and (c) the civil works of the pilot upgrading area (tertiary road and
drainage network) ($200,000). The latter could be carried out by force
account using work groups of Nylon residents organized by the neighborhood
action committees (see para. 4.18 and 4.24) as these groups have been doing
for years.
3.10      Small items of equipment and material costing less than $50,000 each
and which would total no more than $1.0 million could be purchased by local
shopping after solicitation of quotations from at least three suppliers.
Building material loans, which will not involve IBRD financing, will be dis-
bursed in cash to borrowers who will be responsible for individual procure-
ment of goods and services. Consultant services for technical assistance and
for studies (totalling about $7.6 million) would be procured according to
procedures acceptable to IBRD.
3.11      Some drainage works were urgently needed in the Nylon area before
the rainy season (starting in July). They include: (a) construction of a
resettlement zone (30 ha) and 2.5 km of drains (through the Nylon area)
for drainage of water from a recently completed industrial zone above the
Nylon area, and (b) the dredging of the Mgoua River. Given the urgency,
special procedures have been followed. The drains and the resettlement zone
($1.1 million) were procured by limited tendering amongst three contractors
engaged in similar work. The prices are competitive with recent similar works
being done in Douala. The dredging portion of the Mgoua River drainage works
requires special equipment which is now in place in Douala for the dredging of
the port. Since it would prove more expensive to bring in other equipment for
this element, a contract of $1.6 million has been negotiated directly with the
firm owning this equipment based on competitive rates which were quoted on the
dredging element of the Port contract. An extension ($.87 million) of this
contract with similar unit costs has been recently negotiated.

E. Project Preparation and Implementation Schedule
3.12      Overall project implementation will take about 6 years beginning
FY82 (see Chart 2). Civil works have been completed on the resettlement zone
and on the Mgoua drainage works in Douala.
F. Disbursements
3.13      Disbursements of the IBRD loan proceeds would be made on the basis
of:
(a)  50% of total expenditure for civil works and construction for the
upgrading component;
(b)  60% of total expenditures for material and equipment for the
technical assistance; and
(c)  70% of total expenditures for consultant services and studies.
All disbursements would be fully documented with the exception of disburse-
ments of local expenditures for force account work done by the Nylon neighbor-
hood action committee supervised by MAETUR/ARAN (see para. 3.09) for which
disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure, since full
documentation of these expenditures will not be practicable. Documentation
for these expenditures would be retained by the borrower and made available
for IBRD review during supervision. In accordance with interim guidelines
covering disbursements under this procedure, arrangements satisfactory to IBRD
for the staffing of MAETUR/ARAN's accounting section and for its accounting
system will have to be made before disbursements can begin on this component.
In addition arrangements for independent audit of MAETUR/ARAN's accounts will
have to include specific reference to the audit of statements of expenditure.
3.14      The schedule of estimated disbursements of the proposed IBRD loan
is shown in Table 6 below. This rate of disbursement is consistent with the
West Africa regional and Cameroon profiles for all sectors.

IV. PROJECT EXECUTION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Executing Agencies
4.01      Project execution makes maximum use of existing and operating
agencies, housing finance mechanisms and cost recovery procedures. Overall
responsibility for project execution would lie with the Ministry of Urban
Development and Housing (MINUH). A project coordinator has been designated
in MINUH's Directorate of Urban Development and Housing (DUH) to be respon-
sible for project coordination and supervision. The executing agency for the
primary infrastructure and upgrading component, MAETUR, is under MINUH control
and supervision. MINUH will execute the technical assistance component of the
project. In short, components accounting for 97% of total project costs will
be carried out by MINUH or agencies reporting to it. Virtually all works will
be done by contractors supervised by the executing agencies mentioned below.
4.02      A summary of project execution responsibilities by component is
shown below:
Project Components                             Executing Agency
1.   General project coordination and supervision           MINUH Project Coordinator
2.   Nylon Upgrading:
Primary infrastructure, pilot upgrading and
community facilities including a large retail
market                                               MAETUR/ARAN
3.   Community facilities in Northwest Yaounde              MAETUR/ARAN
4.   Housing loans for upgrading                             CFC
5.   Technical assistance to artisans                        CAPME
6.   Technical assistance and studies                       MINUH
These institutions  are considered to be capable, with help from technical
assistance provided under the project, to implement the proposed project.
The main executing agencies are described in the following paragraphs.
MINUH
4.03      As mentioned above, MINUH currently has under its direct control or
supervision the following responsibilities: land acquisition and disposition
for urban and industrial development, urban planning, industrial and residen-
tial land development, housing development, and the financing of residential
development including individual mortgage finance.



- 25 -
4.04      In its recent reorganization MINUH has created a subdirectorate of
programming and studies within DUH. The project coordinator will be part
of this unit and will assume coordination responsibility with the expert in
urban development to be provided through the project (see para. 2.13). The
coordinator will be responsible for the overall supervision and coordination
of all aspects of project execution as well as for liaison with all agencies
and ministries involved in executing the project: those under MINUH's control
as well as the municipalities of Douala and Yaounde, FEICOM, SNEC and SONEL,
and the agencies involved in small business promotion and community organi-
zation.
4.05      In addition to this overall coordination role DUH will also be
responsible for all urban development studies financed under the project:
that is (a) the preparation of a Second Urban Development Project; (b) the
preparation of an Urban Transport Project; and (c) investment programming
studies in Douala and Yaounde.
MAETUR
4.06      MAETUR is currently composed of four divisions:  administration
and finance, construction, marketing and programming. The current staffing
strength is 40, including 5 expatriates, 9 Cameroonian architects and engi-
neers. The administration and finance division is responsible for personnel
and administrative matters, financial management, payments, collections and
accounting. The new planning division is responsible for planning and program-
ming each operation, securing necessary approvals and liaison with local
authorities and other agencies concerned with each operation, establishing
type plans for individual plot development and providing technical assistance
to plot allottees. The construction division is responsible for supervision
of works (infrastructure and community facilities including markets)
undertaken by contractors. The marketing division is responsible for publi-
cizing the sale of plots, receiving and processing applications for submission
to the Selection Committee, and receiving cash sale payments. MAETUR currently
has a central office in Yaounde and a regional branch in Douala.
MAETUR/ARAN
4.07      Background.  Sites and services is a relative well understood and
accepted concept in Cameroon; some useful experience has already been gained
and the institutional framework is already in place. This is not the case
with upgrading in existing neighborhoods which has never been attempted
before. During the preparation of the project several alternative institu-
tional arrangements were considered: (a) giving the task to the municipali-
ties, (b) creating a new institution, or (c) extending MAETUR's mandate to
include upgrading and infrastructure in existing communities. The munici-
pality of Douala has a technical department but it is very understaffed
and essentially limited to contracting out municipal services to private
companies. Further, the municipality admitted its lack of adequate exper-
tise and stated its reluctance to be heavily involved in managing upgrading
operations, but also demanded a voice and a role in the Nylon components.



- 26 -
Initially it was planned to create a completely new agency adapted to the
needs of the concerned parties because it was felt that the sites and services
program was already challenging enough for a young institution and that MAETUR
should not be distracted from its role or run the risk of being overburdened
by an overly ambitious program.
4.08      However it was finally decided to limit as much as possible the
creation of new agencies in Cameroon and to give the responsibility of this
project component to MAETUR. Thus the proposed solution is to have MAETUR
create a branch in Douala tailored to the needs of the concerned parties, to
be known as the MAETUR Nylon Upgrading Unit (Agence de Restructuration et
d'Amenagement de Nylon - ARAN).
4.09      Creation, Role, Supervision Responsibility.  ARAN will be the first
functional branch of MAETUR. Its role will be to plan, design, tender and
supervise basic infrastructure and upgrading works in Nylon, including the
community facilities and market. ARAN will also sell the serviced and de-
marcated plots in the pilot upgrading zone to the residents and assist them in
improving their homes. ARAN will have a life limited to the duration of Nylon
project operations to ensure that its goals and scope of operations remain
modest and achievable. If this institutional arrangement is a success, its
life could be extended to continue upgrading of secondary networks, as in the
pilot zone, in other neighborhoods in Nylon and elsewhere in Douala.
4.10      Responsibilities.  ARAN will be managed by a Cameroonian director
assisted by a Steering Committee. While responsibility for ARAN and its
operations will lay with MAETUR's General Director and its Board of Directors
headed by the Minister of Urban Development and Housing, it is clearly the
Minister's intention that the MAETUR Board delegate certain responsibilities
to the Steering Committee which will supervise ARAN, and that the Director of
MAETUR delegate some responsibility to the Director of ARAN. The Steering
Committee will include the Mayor of Douala; representatives from MINUH and the
Ministries of Interior and Social Affairs; two representatives of the Nylon
residents and the Director of MAETUR. This will ensure that all parties
concerned have a voice and a chance to participate in reviewing proposals
for the Nylon operations and in the running of ARAN. While the day to day
operation will be the responsibility of the Director of ARAN, the Steering
Committee will be responsible for approving the work program and the budgets
of the branch. MAETUR will provide technical and financial backing as well as
financial, accounting, and other administrative services.
4.11      Internal Organization of ARAN.  The Cameroonian Director of ARAN
will be assisted by a deputy, who will be an experienced municipal engineer.
ARAN will be organized in three sections plus a secretariat. The infrastruc-
ture section will deal with all the infrastructure work within Nylon. It will
include a Cameroonian municipal engineer and an expatriate hydraulic engineer.
The community facilities section will be responsible for the central market
and community facilities financed by the Swiss Technical Cooperation. It will
include an expatriate architect and a site work engineer (Swiss technical
assistance) as well as two Cameroonian architect/engineers. The community
relations section will be responsible for dealing with the beneficiary popula-
tion, seeking their views and securing their cooperation, as well as providing



- 27 -
a focal point for coordination among the agencies involved in the Nylon the
agencies involved in the Nylon neighborhood. It will play a particularly
important role in the relocation of families affected by infrastructure works
and in the tenure regularization operation in the pilot upgrading area. It
will include a coordinator (Swiss Technical Cooperation) and a part-time
tenure specialist with the necessary interviewers.
CFC
4.12      Proceeds from the housing tax on salaries received by CFC during the
1979-80 financial year amounted to approximately CFAF 5.2 billion ($21 million).
This amount is expected to grow at an annual rate of 10% to 15%. CFC's use of
housing tax proceeds is limited to lending for "social" housing either to
MAETUR and SIC or to individuals. By mid-1980 CFC had made about 150 loans to
individuals for plot purchase and/or house construction totalling $1.5 million
and a total of $14.6 million to MAETUR and SIC for a total of 1,650 plots or
housing units. CFC has not yet developed an open savings function but main-
tains tied savings accounts for loan applicants building up their downpayments.
Since late 1980 CFC's new management has decided to develop in the following
directions:
-    Open savings operations;
-    Investigation of additional sources of external financing to mix
with housing tax proceeds in order to increase the size of future
CFC programs.
4.13      Organization.  CFC is managed by a director general and deputy and
is divided into two departments: finance and operations. Aside from the main
office in Yaounde, it opened branches (one each) in Yaounde, Douala and Garoua
during the 1979-80 financial year. These branches correspond to the main foci
of MAETUR operations. In the next year a branch will be opened in Bamenda.
Current staff strength is 57, of which 16 are qualified professionals.
4.14      CFC would on-lend IBRD proceeds to MAETUR/ARAN for secondary and
tertiary infrastructure works. CFC will also provide loans to individual
beneficiaries in the upgrading area for plot purchase from MAETUR/ARAN
and house construction and improvement. The house construction loans are
included under the project but are not financed from the proceeds of the
IBRD loan (see para. 3.04). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
sufficient funds will be available for these housing loans.
4.15      CFC is considered to be able to implement its part of the project.
Since its inception CFC has received technical assistance from the Credit
Foncier of France in the form of the director and finance department chief.
This assistance is expected to continue for the next several years. CFC
maintains proper accounts and produces statements regularly and on time.
It is well managed in general and currently has no arrears of more than six
months in its mortgage portfolio.
Other Participating Agencies
4.16      In the upgrading component the installation of water pipes and
reservoirs, and the electrical network and street lighting will be undertaken



- 28 -
by contractors under the supervision of MAETUR with SNEC, the state water
company and SONEL, the state electric company, reviewing and approving the
design and supervision of the works.
4.17      The assistance to be provided to artisans in project areas was iden-
tified in collaboration with IDF staff and is intended to complement and build
on IDF experience in and objectives for the small business and artisan sector
in Cameroon during the first and second SME projects. This assistance will
be undertaken primarily by the Centre Nationale d'Assistance aux Petites et
Moyennes Entreprises (CAPME), an autonomous agency under MINEP with a broad
mandate for promotion of artisans and small- and medium-scale enterprises.
CAPME was involved in the first IDF project and will play a greater role in
the second IDF project. The Nylon Credit Union (CPN) and the Yaounde Credit
Union Association (UCPY) will also assist artisans in project areas in
obtaining credits. Both organizations have been lending to artisans on a
small scale for the last several years.
4.18      The neighborhood action committees in Nylon, although they do not
have official standing, will be involved with the pilot neighboring upgrading,
with employment creation, and with the construction of community centers.
Each of Nylon's 13 neighborhoods has its own action committee which is
represented on the higher level committees which coordinate community work
projects. Over the past ten years, these committees have been very effective
in generating local resources and channelling them into community development
activities. MINED, MINSAN, MINAS and MINJ&S will approve designs for commu-
nity facilities and will staff and maintain them, and MINAS' Douala office
will be responsible for executing the health and nutrition education program.
B. Project Execution
Land Acquisition
4.19      All but 3.8 ha (presently in the course of acquisition) of the land
in the 50 ha pilot upgrading area in Nylon is in the public domain. MAETUR/
ARAN will, with residents' participation, be responsible for reblocking
(realignment of plot boundaries and attribution of provisional land title) the
plots in the area as well as the compensation and resettlement of those
current residents displaced by the reblocking and the installation of infra-
structure and community facilities. The Government has also acquired and
developed 30 ha for the resettlement requirements in Nylon and additional land
is available for its extension as needed. This has been confirmed at negotia-
tions.
Primary Infrastructure and Upgrading
4.20      The institutional framework for primary infrastructure and upgrading
(MAETUR/ARAN) is tailored to the specific situation of Nylon. MAETUR/ARAN
will be responsible for the land development, that is, subcontracting and
supervision of the detailed engineering and bidding documents to private engi-
neering firms; calling for bids and evaluation of the contractors proposals



- 29 -
and preparation of the documents for the contract award by the Central Tender
Board. In order to speed up project start-up, MINUH has already awarded some
detailed engineering studies and has started works in the resettlement zone
and on the Mgoua River. MAETUR/ARAN will also be responsible for providing
technical assistance to families for self-help house improvement and to the
community groups for mutual-help road and drainage works and garbage collec-
tion procedures. In addition to the responsibilities described above, MAETUR/
ARAN will have attached to it a Swiss technical team responsible for the
construction of a large retail market and the community facilities in Nylon
and for the coordination and supervision of all technical assistance provided
to the Nylon community.
Plot Purchase and Housing Loans
4.21      In the pilot 50 ha action zone in Nylon, plot occupants would be
encouraged to start savings accounts with CFC in order to âccumulate an
amount sufficient to make a cash payment for the plot on completion since
some occupants are not expected to be able to satisfy CFC criteria for
lending. MAETUR/ARAN's community organization and marketing divisions will
inform the residents about the necessity of the savings program and the
monthly amount to be saved. In addition, CFC has started discussions with the
Nylon community and the Credit Union to develop specific criteria and proce-
dures for the neighborhood. Some plot holders will already have appropriately
constructed housing to be eligible for plot development certificates and full
titles, once having purchased the plot from MAETUR/ARAN. Most will have to
make improvements. Loan applications will be presented to CFC individually by
residents or in groups through the Credit Union of Nylon which will assist
residents in establishing good credit histories and in demonstrating stability
of income. Upon approval, CFC will disburse loan proceeds to individual
borrowers in tranches. Upon completion of construction, residents will apply
for certificates of plot development and then for titles. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that plot/loan allocation criteria and proce-
dures will be as described above.
Community Facilities and Markets
4.22      Arrangements for construction and equipment of community facilities
were worked out in close collaboration with the technical ministries follow-
ing the principle of using the quickest and most efficient means for getting
the construction done while leaving design review to the ministries involved
(Education, Health, Social Affairs, Youth and Sports). The conclusion reached
was that construction of all facilities in Yaounde Northwest will be the
responsibility of MAETUR, but MAETUR staff will fully consult with the techni-
cal ministries and the municipalities and will obtain their approval on
facility design. In Nylon, where all facilities are to be financed by the
Swiss Government, the Swiss intend Lo use very small neighborhood contractors
and trainees as part of an employment promotion program under the supervision
of MAETUR/ARAN. Staffing of facilities will be the responsibility of the
ministries and specific staffing and budgetary implications have been reviewed
with them. These ministries are considered to be capable of carrying out
their responsibilities during execution.



- 30 -
Artisan Assistance
4.23      The project would make technical and managerial assistance available
through CAPME offices to the artisans in the two target areas. The project
would hope to attract more artisans from Nylon, as well as Yaounde Northwest,
into the credit unions and assist them in obtaining managerial and technical
assistance as well as credit from the existing BCD artisan line of credit (see
also para. 4.17 above).
Community Participation
4.24      The Nylon neighborhood action committees, which were consulted at
all stages of project preparation, will continue to be involved in project
execution through their representation on the MAETUR/ARAN Steering Committee
throughout the project period. They will continue to organize community works
projects to complement large-scale civil works financed under the project,
particularly in the pilot neighborhood upgrading area, as well as building the
five community centers. They will also work with the MAETUR/ARAN staff
to develop a detailed plan for community garbage collection procedures.
Maintenance
4.25      Responsibility for maintenance of the project elements will be
carried out following existing arrangements now in place in Cameroon. The
community facilities will be staffed and maintained by the concerned tech-
nical ministries; the water supply and electrical networks will be maintained
by SNEC and SONEL; the road and drainage infrastructure works and the markets
by the municipalities. The Government is also presently studying a new
institutional and financial framework for the maintenance of the primary
drainage works.
C. Audit, Monitoring and Supervision
Audit
4.26      Separate projects accounts will be maintained by each implementing
agency and a comprehensive project account will be kept by the project coor-
dinator in MINUH. Quarterly progress reports will be prepared by the coordi-
nator and furnished to the Bank. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that no later than six months after the close of each Government fiscal year,
suitable financial statements reflecting the financial operations and position
of the chief project entities (MAETUR, and CFC) would be made available to
IBRD. These financial statements would be audited by an independent auditor
acceptable to IBRD (see para. 2.13) and would be made available to IBRD no
later than twelve months after the close of the respective fiscal year.
Following the close of disbursements Government would prepare a Project
Completion Report.



-31 -
MorLito ing
4.27      The project will be monitored by the project coordinator to (a)
test whether the various project components are replicable and affordable for
intended beneficiaries and (b) initiate corrective actions to remedy weak-
nesses arising during implementation of the project. In particular, given the
pecularities of the Nylon upgrading area, MAETUR/ARAN will be responsible for
a close monitoring of this project element (population, income, plot demarca-
tion, tenure). During negotiations, assurances were given that monitoring
responsibilities would be set up as proposed.
Supervision
4.28      Supervision by Bank staff during the six year implementation period
will require an estimated 25 staff-weeks annually, starting in summer 1983.
It will involve specialists in civil works, urban planning, financial analysis
and municipal management as well as in urban transport and traffic.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
5.01      The project will introduce the upgrading concept in Cameroon and
with it the recovery of costs allocated to beneficiaries in upgraded areas
through plot sales with full title. The project will also introduce municipal
participation in the financing of improved conditions for the urban poor in
upgrading area. In terms of affordability, the project will reach to the
5th percentile of the income spectrum, in effect extending by two deciles the
lower end of the income range served by the formal housing sector. To ensure
replicability, the project relies essentially on the existing institutional
framework while providing technical assistance to strengthen weak points in
this framework.
B. Allocation of Costs
5.02      The cost allocation among beneficiaries, municipalities and Central
Government which results from applying the above approach is summarized in
Table 7 below. In Nylon, $23.8 million of the total $39.7 million to be
invested in this area, or about 60%, is for primary infrastructure which
is not normally charged to beneficiaries. Roughly 81% of total Nylon costs,
which includes primary roads and major drainage, other non-allocable infra-
structure, and community facilities, is charged to Central Government. The
cost of the market, about 11% of total Nylon costs, is charged to the users
of these facilities. Approximately 2%, involving street lighting, standpipes
and garbage depots, is allocated to the municipality of Douala. The remain-
der, or 5% of Nylon costs, $2.0 million for on-site roads, drainage and



- 32 -
other neighborhood-level infrastructure in the 50 ha pilot zone as well as
house construction loans, will be recovered from the beneficiaries through
payments for a complete upgrading package including tenure regularization.
The large Central Government share reflects the large drainage expenditures
associated with this project because Nylon is a swampy area through which
drainage for a large part of the city passes. The whole city therefore
benefits from expenditures on the primary network. Because the primary
infrastructure in Nylon also serves other areas of the city and is of a type
that other high income areas of the city do not pay for, the above approach is
reasonable both from the point of view of the incidence of benefits as well as
equity.

5.0:3     Central Government will also bear the costs of technical assistance
for project implementation and training as well as small business support
(which is entirely technical assistance and operational support), and that
portion of land costs attributable to community facilities and primary infra-
structure.
5.04      The municipality of Douala will bear the costs of street lighting,
public water standpipes and garbage collection depots. The participation of
the municipality in recovery of capital costs of the project and in covering
costs of maintaining project areas and facilities would be achieved through
revenues from existing tax measures which include taxes collected by the
Central Government which revert back in part to the municipality (income tax,
licences, business turnover tax, garbage collection, ambulance operation and
street lighting) and other taxes collected by the municipality (18 different
measures, the most important being market stall rental and vendor fees,
building permits, parking and entertainment). Of these sources, tax receipts
from the Central Government account for about 70% of total receipts in the
case of Douala. The total tax receipts from the Central Government and the
municipality have been adequate to cover the operating costs of the city and
its small capital project activities.
5.05      In addition to attributable infrastructure and land costs, benefi-
ciaries of upgraded plots will be charged interest during construction and the
full costs of house construction financed by the project, including pit
latrines and individual water and electric connections (installation of
latrines and private connections will be at the option of the individual
beneficiary). Full costs of markets in project areas (Nylon and Yaounde
Northwest) will be charged to the beneficiaries of these facilities: shop-
keepers, vendors, small businessmen and artisans, by means of stall and
workshop rents and daily charges for mobile vendors which will be based on
charges and rents in similar facilities which already exist.
C. Cost Recovery
5.06      In the upgrading area, plot sale prices would include the cost of
land acquisition (compensation payments); costs of secondary infrastructure;
design, supervision and overhead charges of the executing agency (IAETUR/ARAN);
interest during construction at 5.5%. House construction/improvement loans in
the Nylon pilot upgrading area would cover the costs of materials and labor
(including pit latrines and optional private connections and assuming some
self-help contribution). Financing for plot purchase and house construction
would be provided from CFC to each beneficiary to be repaid over 15 years (1
year grace) at an average rate of 4.5%. A 10% down payment would be required.
5.07      As for other lending for housing finance, the Cameroon Development
Bank (BCD) was recently charging 8.5% over 7-10 years for house construction
and housing and residential plot purchase loans for high-income groups (CFAF
200,000/mo. and up, or 97th percentile plus). The interest rates applied to
housing finance for low-income groups can also be compared with the approxi-
mately 10% past and anticipated rate of inflation for the economy as a whole
in Cameroon.



- 34 -
5.08      The terms proposed for housing loans to beneficiaries, are the
current terms of the Government. The proposed rates are currently the highest
politically acceptable, given the fact that the CFC is financing these loans
entirely from its own resources which are the proceeds of a housing tax passed
on to CFC at no cost. The tax is a payroll tax deducted at source from the
wages of all salaried employees at a rate of 0.5% of salary and is matched by
an equal contribution of the employer (with the exception of Government
agencies which make no matching contribution). The tax proceeds are allotted
solely to CFC to be used for social housing and may not be lent to the higher
income groups which have traditionally absorbed virtually all of housing
finance prior to CFC's creation in 1977. Thus CFC's source of funding for
housing credits is the salaried work force which is also a target group of
its lending operations. To the extent that CFC borrowers are low-income and
unsalaried, this system results in a welcome cross-subsidy benefitting low-
income target groups.  Higher income groups have access to loans at 8.5% from
BCD as mentioned in para. 5.07 above.  If in future CFC is required to borrow
from capital markets because of increasing demand then the need for higher
interest rates will become critical. The Bank has discussed this with CFC
which has indicated its willingness to apply lending terms necessary to cover
the cost of resources and operations. A CFC five-year investment program was
also agreed at negotiations which defines housing development programs in
terms of ciurrently known resources.
D. Affordability
5.09      In the Nylon pilot upgrading area, for those households desiring a
loan, total costs per plot (including average infrastructure costs and con-
struction loans) range from about $1,300 to $3,500 and are affordable below
the 10th percentile, and plots alone are also affordable at the 5th percentile
(see Table 8). In the unlikely case that by 1984, in Nylon, the cost of the
smallest plot has increased by 45% and income by only 25%, it would still be
affordable by the 5th percentile.
E. Replicability
5.10      The project relies to the maximum extent possible, on existing
institutions and implementational arrangements. All the major executing
agencies will receive technical assistance, with a view to strengthening their
capacity to carry out similar projects in the future.
5.11      The high degree of recovery in the pilot neighborhood upgrading area
in Nylon would ensure the repetition of secondary and tertiary infrastructure
installation and home improvement in the other neighborhoods in Nylon. The
lack of direct recovery of the costs of primary infrastructure in Nylon is a
constraint but the fact that this infrastructure serves a much wider area of
the city of Douala and that the investment can be treated as a transfer of
resources justifies this approach.

5.12      The degree of cost recovery achieved in the upgrading component of
this project is felt to be adequate in a first project effort which is regarded
as a first step towards establishing a continuing upgrading program within
which cost recovery will be improved over time. Replicability will depend on
actual cost recovery performance and on land tenure regularization, partic-
ularly in the upgrading component. For this reason, cost recovery and land
registration will be the main object of technical assistance to ensure rational
and workable procedures and their supervised application. It also depends in
the long run on the willingness and ability of Government to commit the funds
necessary to maintain a steadily expanding primary infrastructure program.
MINUH investment program requests for the Fifth Plan Period (1981-86) appear
to provide the necessary funds: about $120 million or 20% of the total
MINUH budget is expected to be allocated for primary infrastructure over the
five-year period.
5.13      In Douala, the upgrading component will provide basic services to
25% of the urban poor (families below the poverty income threshold--see para.
1.08) while pilot neighborhood upgrading will reach 5% of Douala's urban
poor.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Justification and Project Benefits
6.01      Experience through this project with neighborbood upgrading should
pave the way for more cost-effective Government programs in the sector. In
the longer run, strengthening of the land management and registration func-
tions should help to increase future private investment in housing since lack
of secure tenure is a major factor constraining private investment, both in
permanent house construction in existing traditional neighborhoods, and in
development of new urban subdivisions.
6.02      The direct and tangible benefits which will be generated during
the project period are:
(a)  better environmental conditions and better access to roads,
water and health facilities for all of Nylon's 90,000 residents
(14,300 households);
(b)  tenure regularization and a much higher level of service
for the 13,000 residents (2,200 households) of the Nylon
pilot upgrading zone; and
(c)  provision of about 5,400 new primary school places in Nylon
and Yaounde Northwest.



- 37 -
6.03      Important indirect benefits generated by the project include im-
provement of residents' health status in Nylon, where most health problems
are related to poor environmental sanitation, and generation of unskilled
construction employment. On the basis of the proportion of project civil
works costs for unskilled labor and present wage levels, the project will
generate an estimated 800 man-years of unskilled labor through upgrading
works. It is also expected that the upgrading of Nylon will trigger a process
of house consolidation throughout the larger area which families have been
postponing pending provision of infrastructure and the prospect of secure
tenure.
B. Rate of Return Calculations
6.04       Internal economic rates of return were calculated for (a) basic
upgrading of Nylon, and (b) upgrading of the pilot neighborhood in Nylon.
Cost streams for both components include on- and off-site civil works, housing
loans, project-related technical assistance and physical contingencies (net of
taxes, foreign exchange shadow priced). Non-project costs included in the
cost streams are the value of land, annual maintenance expenses for infra-
structure and houses (all components), estimated cost of additional induced
house improvements in the whole Nylon area, the cost of utility connections in
the pilot zone, and infrastructure cost of the resettlement site for Nylon
households displaced by new infrastructure and community facilities.
6.05      Benefits were estimated on the basis of expected increases in the
rental value of property in Nylon, with these increases being based on observed
rental differences between units with different accessibility, service levels,
and construction materials. The residual value of the land in the 25th year
was taken to be zero.
6.06      The rate of return for the upgrading component is estimated at 18%.
The table below shows the IRR for the basic infrastructure in the entire Nylon
area (16%) as well as the IRR on additional investment in the pilot zone over
and above that provided in the zone by the basic infrastructure investment
(64%). The IRR for total investment in the pilot zone is 38%. This latter
rate is the rate of return most applicable to the longer term program of
upgrading which the project initiates. The high return to the incremental
pilot zone investments alone is due to the large jump in land and rental
values due to granting of secure tenure.
6.07      The sensitivity analysis shows that component IRRs are about as
sensitive to a 20% reduction in benefits as to a 15% increase in costs,
and that the justification of the project is not jeopardized by these kinds
of changes. It is unlikely that costs would increase by as much as 15% since
they are based on detailed engineering for the first year's works and benefits
have been conservatively estimated so that a 20% decrease is also unlikely.
The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the return to the combined
upgrading components in the project would not fall below 14%.

- All Upgrading                    18        15               14
C.  Distribution of Benefits and Poverty Impacts
6.08       Since about 55% of the Nylon area's residents are below the poverty
threshold for Douala, and all area residents will benefit directly from
project investments in Nylon, 55% of the cost of works and loans in Nylon and
technical assistance to MAETUR/ARAN can be considered to directly benefit the
urban poverty group. All of the benefits generated by markets and assistance
to small entrepreneurs and artisans is estimated to accrue to the urban poor.
On this basis, about a half of total base costs will create direct benefits to
the urban poverty group.
6.09       The total number of beneficiaries in the urban poverty group is
about 35,000: that is all those in that group in Nylon and 25% of all the
poor in Douala; 3,200 vendors, shop and stall renters in the markets; and
100 artisans in the Yaounde Northwest artisan center.
D. Risks
6.10       The major risk involved in the project relates to the innovative
nature of the upgrading component. Also, the varied nature of the project
components will require careful coordination and supervision. To minimize
this risk, adequate technical assistance is being provided to the executing
agencies and to develop a strong project execution and coordination capability
in MINUH. Another area of weakness, land registration and management, is to
be obviated by having these functions (up to delivery of provisional land
title) carried out on behalf of MINUH by the agencies responsible for project
site development while technical assistance strengthens this capability in the
relevant divisions within MINUH (see para. 4.21).
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01       During negotiations, assurances were given that:
(a) proceeds of the IBRD loan would be on-lent to the financial inter-
mediaries and executing agencies on terms satisfactory to IBRD;
(para. 3.06). CFC would also make available purchase and house
construction/improvement loans for all plots provided under this
project as described in this report (para. 4.14);



- 39 -
(b) the necessary counterpart funds would be made available to the
executing agencies (paras. 3.03 and 4.14), and that these agencies
would use the funds for project execution and recover the costs as
described in this report (paras. 5.06 to 5.08);
(c) a project coordinator acceptable to the IBRD has been
nominated within MINUH (para. 4.04);
(d) resettlement zones would be provided as needed (para. 4.19);
(e) tenure conditions, lot allocation criteria, and terms and conditions
of lot sales and house consolidation would be as described in this
report (para. 4.21);
(f) quarterly progress reports would be prepared; and financial state-
ments and audit reports for the main executing agencies, prepared by
auditors acceptable to IBRD, would be submitted to IBRD no later
than twelve months after the close of each Government financial year
(para. 4.26); and
(g) arrangements for the monitoring of the project in particular for
the Nylon component would be discussed and agreed with IBRD
(para. 4.27).
7.02      Condition of loan effectiveness will be that subsidiary financing
agreements are signed between (a) the Government and CFC, and (b) CFC and
MAETUR (para. 3.07).
7.03      With the assurances and conditions indicated above, the project is
suitable for an IBRD loan of $20 million equivalent to the Government of
Cameroon.
