FELCRA I PROJECT
(LOAN 2013-MA)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the FELCRA I
Project in Malaysia, for which Loan 2013-MA was approved on June 16, 1981
in the amount of USt; 37.0 million.   The loan was closed on December 31,
1987, one year behind schedule.   It was fully disbursed and the last
disbursement was on April 13, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by FELCRA, the project executing agency and
was supplemented by an Overview and an Evaluation Summary prepared by the
Agriculture Operations Division, Country Department II of the Asia Regional
Office.  The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Loan Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower and internal Felcra and Bank documents.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
to the Report as Attachment I.

PROjECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
FELCRA I PROJECT
(LOAN 2013-_A)
EVALUATION SUNMARY
Introduction
1.       The Government of Malaysia has for many years pursued a vigorous
policy of land development for smallholders to generate economic growth,
create employment and raise the living standards of the rural population.
The principal vehicles have been parastatal organizations set up for the
purpose, which in turn have based their development strategies on
Malaysia's strong comparative advantage in tree crops production. The
Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) was
established in 1966 to rehabilitate r develop State land schemes and
smallholdings with land titles. The Governmenc requested a Bank loan to
help implementation of FELCRA's core program over the Fourth Malaysia Plan
period (1981-1985).
Objectives
2.       The main objectives of the 5 year project were to rehabilitate
about 34,000 ha of smallholder lands by group farming systems, with rubbeL
and oil palm in about 90 small schemes scattered throughout the Peninsula,
for the benefit of about 12,000 rural households; provide these schemes
with access roads and office infrastructure; construct two palm oil mills;
and strengthen FELCRA's institutional capabilities. Total project cost was
estimated at US$139.08 million. The Bank provided a loan of US$37.0
million.
Implementation Experience
3.       Overall implementation was very satisfactory and the project
attained its major targets after a time overzun uf abou. o.,e ar.d a half
years. The standard of works was good. Thte loan was fully disbursed but
the total project cost was about 23% less in US dollars than appraised. the
reduction being due to both delayed and reduced implementation and the
effects of the declining ringgit/US$ exchange rate. The main
implementation delay occurred in the early years of the project in the land



development program. This was the result of a change to industry
recommended technology in respect of the type of rubber planting material
used and to a very strong farmer preference for planting with oil palm in
place of rubber which led to an early shortage of oil palm planting
material. FELCRA's adoption of these changes was commendable,
demonstrating both institutional flexibility and concern for project
effectiveness. Agricultural implementation proceeded rapidly in the later
project years. Arising from the delay however, much of the scheme
infrastructure program which was linked in timetable to the progress of
land development, could not be implemented within the project period and
will be completed under the Second FELCRA project.
4.       During the project, FELCRA developed into a strong and well-run
organisation, building up a large cadre of skilled and strongly motivated
staff. Its organisational structure was strengthened in accordance with
the Loan Agreement and further modified with good effect in 1986 to meet
the challenges of FELCRA's newly expanded mandate to take responsibility
for th. rehabilitation of extensive areas of idle smallholder land.
5.       A most valuable and successful project feature was the
implet .tation of a structured intensive and extensive staff training
program which contributed significantly to upgrading of the agency's
management and operational capabilities and staff morale. A very
impressive quantity of training was achieved. The project financed
Training Advisor over a period of five years enjoyed strong management
commitment to the training program and established an improssive network of
relationships with outside training resources from which FELCRA staff
continue to benefit.
6.       The Technical Assistance program, which was generous in scope, was
somewhat less productive, due to the declining need for certain studies and
some unimpressive consultant performances. However, the consultancy for
management information system studies was very successful and the
recommendations form the basis of FELCRA's ongoing implementation of
comprehensive data base and computerised facilities.
Results
7.       Early yields of oil palm have closely paralleled the appraisal
yield profile and reflect well-grown and maintained plantings. No project
rubber is yet in production but the yields of preproject rubber are
encouraging. Palm oil processing mill performance is satisfactory. Farmer
incomes in 1987 over all producing FELCRA schemes were estimated to be some
44-lOOZ higher, depending on the type of scheme, than from those
smallholdings of a similar type which had not been rehabilitated. The
economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 132 compared to 17Z
at appraisal, the reduction being attributable to project delays.



- vi -
Findings and Lessons
8.       The development of smallholder agriculture through systems of
group farming is very acceptable to the farmers and can be very effective
when the implementing agency is strong and has the confidence of the
farmers, and when the productive strategy is sound.
9.       A strategy for the future devolution of scheme operational and
management responsibilities from FELCRA to the farmers and the
identification of an appropriate farmer group structure are of increasing
importance as FELCRA's development program rapidly expands. Without such
action, the continuing development program would become unsustainable.
Similarly a strategy for the future operation and management of FELCRA's
increasing number of palm oil mills will also be needed.
10.      Institutional strength and effectiveness is greatly enhanced
through comprehensive and integrated staff training which pays attention to
both work attitudes and the upgrading of skills. Strong staff morale adds
to the vitality and performance of the institution.
11.      Technical assistance should not be overdesigned as it can engender
Borrower 3ensitivities to both costs and their competence.
12.      FELCRA is in the process of greatly expanding its computerised
data base but has yet to use the facility for its full potential as a
management tool. For this reason the Second FELCRA project is of great
importance in providing an opportunity to monitor FELCRA's further progress
in this area and provide assistance if desirable.
13.      Continuity of Bank supervision personnel is important for the
development of good project relationships, mutual trust and confidc.ace and
for the deeper understanding of project concerns.



PROJECT COMPLETION RFroRT
MALAYSIA
FELCRA I PROJECT
(LOAN 2013-MA)
Overview
Introduction
1.       This Overview is based on the Project Completion Report (PCR)
prepared by the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority
(FELCRA), the project implementing agency, and on information and reports
in Bank files. The loan, signed for a five year project on July 20, 1981
for a sum of US$37.0 million, was _xpected to close December 31, 1986.  It
was extended for one year to end-1987; the loan account was fully disbursed
on April 13, 1988 with major development targets achieved. This was the
first Bank loan to FELCRA in support of its agricultural development
program for smallholders. However, FELCRA had been involved in an earlier
loan for the Trans-Perak project (Ln. 1960-MA), where initially it was only
one of the implementing agencies coordinated by the Ministry of
Agriculture, but in 1984 became coordinator of the project - which is now
nearing completion.
Project Objectives
2.       The overall objectives of the project supported Government
agricultural policies of alleviation of rural poverty, increasing
agricultural incomes and expanding rural employment opportunities and
enhancing export earnings for national economic growth. The strategies
were to rehabilitate low-yielding smallholder lands through planting of
rubber and oil palm and to increase the size of very small holdings through
consolidation with nearby State land.
3.       Specifically, the project aimed to develop some 34,000 ha of
uni-Aproved smallholdings, both titled and in State schemes, with rubber
(25,900 ha) an,d oil palm (8100 ha), in about 9O gro;;p farming sc'eies
There was also provision for basic farm infrastructure, the construction of
two palm oil mills and special emphasis on the strengthening of FELCRA's
institutional capacity through administrative reorlanization, staff
training, technical assistance and computerization. It was estimated that
the project would directly increase the incomes of about 12,000 rural
households.



-2-
Project Preparation
4.       The Bank initiated discussions with Government in mid-1976 on the
possibility of financing a FELCRA operation. In early 1977, after
preliminary Bank reviews, it was agreed that a FELCRA project could be
justified provided major attention were given to improving FELCRA's
management and administration. UNDP/Bank project planning assistance
focussing on FELCRA's group farming system, accounting system,        v
administrative structure and stafr requirements was provided. FELCRA
welcomed the assistance, which resulted in an approved reorganization plan
for senior administration and a new chain of command from senior management
to the State level in May 1979.
5.       The proposed pioject was formally identified in October 1979, took
about one year to pr pare and was appraised in September 1980. It was
agreed that the project would be designed around FELCRA's land development
program and the institutional building of the agency. FELCRA had also
initiated a limited village restructuring program involving relocation with
modern infrastructural facilities, and the provision of more land for
houselots; however, the Government was uncertain of that program's
viability and preferred at that time not to seek Bank funding for its
further execution.
6.       Issues appearing during project preparation included project
duration (from three years to allow primarily for the evaluation of scheme
development to five years or more to cover the immaturity period of
rubber), specific project versus time-slice financing of the total land
development works, the need for focussing land development in the poorer
northern States, the need for a nation&l strategy for tackling the idle
land problem, selection criteria for scheme settlers, the urgency of a
staff development program, and the need for an institutional monitoring
system. The project was finally formulated for 5 years, for the specific
development of about 90 schemes throughout the country, of which about 752
would be in the poorer northern states, and with covenants to address
questions of settler selection and staff training. It was concluded that
the question of straitegy for idle lands development was a concern for the
Ministry in consultation with the States and, thus, beyond the scope of
FELCRA.
The Loan and Lending Arrangements
7.       The loan was approved by the Board on June 16, 1981.  The loan
amount wa8 US$37.0 million, up from the originally proposed US$30.0
million, in order to finance the entire foreign exchange component. There
was provision for US$3.0 million of retroactive financing for land clearing
and design expenditures initiated in the iast quarter of 1980, in
preparation for the first project year. The Bank agreed that loan funds
would be onlent by Government to FELCRA without charge, as the funds were
for poverty alleviation, would be entirely under the control of FELCRA on
behalf of the scheme participants, and would be fully recoverable. A
Project Agreement between FELCRA and the Bank confirmed FELCRA's
implementation responsibilities. Loan effectiveness was seriously delayed



-3-
over the issue of whether or not there should be a relending agreement
between Government and FELCRA or any other ratification of the Project
Agreement by all concerned Government parties.  The Government insisted,
however, that the Project Agreement was the definitive binding document,
and the Bank finally agreed to declare Loan effectiveness on March 10,
1982, nearly eight months after loan signing.
Amendments to the Loan and Project Agreements
8.       There were three amendments to the Loan Agreement during the
project period. The first amendment of February 1, 1983, increased the
rates of disbursement for agricultural deveiopment and infrastructure (PCR
para 3.47); the second amendment of September 8, 1986 in which the loan
closing date was extended by one year to December 31, 1987 provided for the
financing of a third palm oil mill and some infrastructure design works
(PCR para 3.48), and the third amendment of August 21, 1987 adjusted the
schedule of loan disbursements by ca'egory to reflect the differe'- rates
of implementation of project activities compared to appraisal estimates,
and also to provide for the disbursement of the large (US$6.0 million)
unallocated portion of the loan.
9.       There were two amendments to the Project Agreement.  That of June
26, 1984, relieved FELCRA of the covenant on the criteria of settler
selection (PCR para 3.52), and that of January 29, 1986, introduced the use
of Statements of Expenditure for agricultural works.
Project Implementation
10.      General.  Overall project performance was very satisfactory.
After a slow start (para. 12), the main program of land development was
vigorously implemented and the project target was exceeded. The quality of
work was generally good and improved during the course of the project, in
line with the growing capabilities rf the agency. However, with the delay
in agricultural works, much of the associated scheme infrastructure program
could not be implemented and has been taken up in the follow-up Second
FELCRA project. The two oil palm processing mills were constructed as
scheduled. Additional milling and infrastructure works provided for under
the second amendment to the Loan Agreement (para. 8) were not initiated and
are being implemented under the Second FELCRA Project. A listing of
project key performance indicators is given in PCR Annex 1.
Institutionally FELCRA improved greatly, maturing into a very capable and
responsible organization. Much of this improvement was the result of
strong senior management capabilities and the impact of a comprehensive and
well conducted training and staff development program, as integral parts of
the project.
11.      Agricultural Development.  After serious early delays,
implementation developed strongly during the last three years of the
project. A total of 36,800 ha of rubber and oil palm were planted, some
2,700 ha or 82 above target, involving a total of 387 schemes compared to
the 90 envisaged at appraisal (para. 13). Numerous field visits during
supervision to most States on a fairly random basis found that the standard
of plantings was generally good and particularly after the first three



years when field technology was modified and management capabilities
strengthened. Crop ratio of about 75% oil palm and 25% rubber was almost
the reverse of the ratio predicted at appraisal.   This was the outcome of
strong smallholder perceptions regarding changing commodity prices and crop
labor requirements. The switch in ratio was supported by FELCRA and
demonstrated their administrative flexibility and sensitivity to the
farmers' viewpoint.
12.      Although the PCR cites budget constraints and the severe shortage
of oil palm planting material as the main causes for the shortfall in
planting targets during the early years of the project (paras. 3.03, 3.06),
equally important was FEICRA's decision to change rubber planting material
from bare rooted budded stumps to 2-whorl polybag buddings. This change,
which was adopted following several years of unacceptably high planting
losses with budded stumps due to rainfall conditions at field planting,
severely disrupted the planting program in the first two years (PCR Table
1) while nursery production routines were being adjusted. This was a very
significant technical change fully reflecting the industry's
recommendations, and it clearly demonstrated FELCRA's flexibility and
concern for program effectiveness. The new program was in full swing by
1983 and 1984; when 5-6,000 ha/yr were planted using the polybag
technology. Unfortunately, severe national budget problems subsequently
impacted FELCRA's planting performance in 1985.
13.      Whereas the project was originally designed to develop about 90
schemes, the number actually planted was 387 schemes. With the
implementation slowdown in 1985 and the realignment of FELCRA's
responsibilities for idle land rehabilitation, as a result of a shift in
emphasis of Government policy, from rather large State fringe schemes of
several hundred hectares each to idle land schemes of typically less than
200 hectares each, it became unrealistic to try to complete the project as
originally designed. Further, only 34 % of the loan was drawn down by end-
CY85 and there was increasing concern that a large part of the loan amount
might remain unutilized. On the other hand, with rapidly growing
capability to sustain a higher rate of agricultural implementation than
hitherto, the question of the number of schemes became secondary to that of
the total area of new land developed.
14.      Scheme Infrastructure.   The main items of scheme infrastructure
were access roads from the existing public network and offices and staff
quarters. These works are normally implemented several years after crop
planting but before harvesting to avoid damaging the new roads with heavy
land development equipment and constructing scheme buildings too early
before they are ".eeded at the start of crop production. As a consequence
of delayed agricultural implementation, a large part of the planned
infrastructure was not needed within the project period. Many items have
been rescheduled for implementation under the Second FELCRA project. The
introduction of the cluster systemn of scheme management (PCR para 3.23)
also markedly reduced requirements for offices and quarters. Installations



- 5 -
of water and electric utilities were likewise affected. Access roads of
more than about 2 km in length were constructed by the Public Works
Department (JKR), with 'ELCRA transferring appropriate budgetary
allocations. JKR also attended to land acquisition matters. The
performance of JKR was satisfactory. Some implementation delays occurred
in the earlier years due to conflicting work programs, but there was
noticeable improvement in the planning of works and cooperation in later
years. Rapport between key staff of the two agencies appeared to be good.
15.      Palm Oil Mills.  The two project palm oil mills were completed and
commissioned using industry consultantb, within the target implementation
year. Although both were appraised at 40 tons ffb/hr capacity, the
Nasaruddin mill was constructed for 30 tons to better match the production
of its command area. It has operated at high capacity for several years.
A similar reduct4an in the size of the Bukit Kepong mill, as suggested by
the Bank's consu-cant, would also have been appropriate as this mill has
consistently run well below capacity (at about 70%) due to insufficient
fruit bunch supplies. The cost of the two mills was about 25% higher than
the conservatively appraised estimate (PCR para. 3.20), jut in line with
the costs of similar mills financed by the Bank in Malaysia.    "illing
extraction rates of about 20% for crude oil and above 5% for palm kernels
are very satisfactory (PCR Annex 2). FELCRA's hiring of industry
consultants annually to review mill performance in order to maintain mill
operational efficiency is commendable. Although the Loan Agreement was
amended to permit financing of preliminary costs of FELCRA's third planned
palm oil mill at Tanjung Batu, the work was delayed due to site
reconsiderations and the mill will be financed instead under the Second
FELCRA project.
16.      Institutional Development.  FELCRA developed into a strong and
well-run organization during the project. It built up a larae cadre of
skilled and enthusiastic staff.  Changes in organizational siructure as
required under the Project Agreeme.,. came into effect at the beginning of
1982 (PCR Chart A). A Deputy Director-General (Administration) was
appointed, six Heads of Division were upgraded to Directors in key
operational areas commenr :rate with expanded functions, and five Regional
Controllers were appointed. By 1986, with the scope of FELCRA's work
expanding, further changes were made in organizational structure and
responsibilities at senior levels to streaml'   operations (PCR Chart B).
It is to be noced that FELCRA has returned t( ie single Deputy Dir-ctor-
General structure, now considered to provide stronger management.
17.      Consultancies   ubout 136 man-months of Technical Assistance were
used, much below the l' man-month.: approved at appraisal. The assistance
consisted principally of four consultancies in key operational areas of
Agricultural Planning, Accounting, Training and Management Information
Systems. Assistance was not used for sociology, research methodology and



- 6 -
land tenure. Three of the consultancies were filled by internationally
recruited specialists but in two cases good working relationships with
FELCRA staff did not develop, FELCRA questioned the benefits of the
expenditures and the contracts ceased earlier than planned, through non-
renewal. In contrast, the training advisor's assistance was considered
very critical to FELCRA's needs and supervision reports noted his good
performance and the strong development of the training program (para, 18).
Three years of the consultant assistance program for management information
systems and computerization were also very useful. The resulting
recommendations form the basis of FELCRA's ongoing implementation of
computerization and management faciiities. In hindsight, not only was the
total appraised program of technical assistance probably unduly generous,
but FELCRA was skeptical of the need for it all. However, FELCRA's
management is open to ideas and advice and welcomes the assistance of well
designed consultancy assistance.
18.      Training.  One of the most valuable and significant results of the
project was the strengthening of FELCRA's management and operational
capabilities, based on the implementation of a structured intensive and
extensive staff training program. A Training and Staff Development Unit
was set up in 1982; the Training Advisor followed in 1983 and enjoyed
strong support of senior management throughout his tenure of five years
(including two years of extension). A well focussed staff development
program was put in place involving analysis of the skill gaps in the agency
and provision of training opportunities for the staff at all levels. PCR
Table 7 shows the results of this program both in terms of the number of
courses (1,544 in total of which 1,244 were for staff) and participants
(22,000 in total of which 12,908 were staff). One shortfall of the
program, identified later by the training consultant engaged for the
preparation of the Second FELCRA project, was the inadequate attention
given to the training of trainers. This aspect has been given priority in
the new project.
Project Costs
19.         Total project costs at completion on December 31, 1987, were
M$262.8 (US$107.61) million against the appraisal estimate of M$299.0
(US$139.1) million. Details are given in PCR Annex 4, Table 3. The
reduction was about 12% in terms of ringgit and 23% in US dollars. The
performance difference between the currencies was due to the fall in the
ringgit exchange rate from 2.15 to 2.50 from 1981 to 1988. Contingency
provisions of M$79.9 million or about 36% of total project costs were high.
A comparison of actual costs with the appraisal estimates, including
contingencies by project components, is given in Table 1.

/b Using appraisal foreign exchange percentage estimates
20.      For the main project component, agricultural development,
expenditures were very close to estimates. This similarity masks, however,
the quite different planting profile by year and crop compared to original
planning (para. 11). For other components there were notable deviations in
total expenditures from the appraisal estimates in infrastructure (50%
shortfall due to an unavoidably delayed program, para. 14), and in
processing facilities (26% higher costs, para. 15). Consultant
expenditures were also markcily lower than appraised, due to program
curtailment (para 17). Costs of management services were down, perhaps
partly the effect of the unnecessarily high (38%) contingency level for
this component.
21.      Despite considerable deviations in the actual component costs from
appraisal figures, the estimated total foreign exchange content of -he
project 27.6% (Table 1) was almost the same as at appraisal (27%). The
fully disbursed loan of US$37.0 million represented 34% of the total US$
project costs, that is, within the Bank's 35% maximum guideline for
Malaysia,
Procurement
22.      As a new Bank client, FELCRA was not familiar with the Bank's
procurement guidelines and passed through a difficult adjustment period in



- 8 -
the early project years. However, their procurement performance was very
satisfactory in later years. The Bank modified procedures from time to
time for the benefit of the project. Important procurement issues of the
project were:
23.      Central Procurement.   An early purchase of 35 units of four wheel
drive vehicles through Government Central Procurement was declared
ineligible for loan financing as the Bank does not endorse their
procedures. However, the problem was not project specific, and after a
number of similar misprocurements in other projects, the Government allowed
agencies to call open tenders for Bank-financed purchases to avoid
difficulties.
24.      Limited Tendering.   Local Competitive Bidding was found to be
unsuitable for agricultural works in small schemes in isolated areas.
Larger contractors tended to give such awards low priority, thus affecting
implementation, while small local contractors, anxious to participate in
such works, were often squeezed out in the bidding process. After review,
the Bank agreed in August 1983 to finance limited (closed) bidding awards
for small agricultural works of up to M$100,000. The system worked well.
25.      Bid Evaluation.  In 1984, a bidder alleged misprocurement of four
wheel drive vehicles and tractors on the grounds of biased bid evaluation.
In reviewing the documents, the Bank found that the weight given to the
price factor in the scoring system was too low but amended scoring in line
with Bank guidelines produced the same result. The award was cleared for
financing. FELCRA has been somewhat skeptical of the high weight
recommended for price, arguing that the ability of contractors to supply
spares and service is equally important.
Disbursement
26.      The slow early disbursement of the loan was due both to
unfamiliarity with the system of loan withdrawal and its documentation
requirements, and to delayed implementation. Documentation requirements,
including translations, were not appropriate for a project of many small
schemes and contracts. Even at the end of 1984, some three and a half
years inco the project, only US$8.4 million or 22% of the Loan amount bnd
been disbursed.
27.      With the growing number of small land development contracts,
FELCRA sought a faster disbursement mechanism. In late 1985, the Bank
agreed to disburse small contracts awarded at Regional Offices by
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Then, in early 1986, the not
inconsiderable amount of force account expenditures in small schemes were
also admitted to financing. The accelerating implementation and improved
withdrawal facilities in the last years of the project rapidly improved
loan utilization, and in the final two years no less than US$23.2 million
or 63% of the loan amount was disbursed.
niect Benefits
Quantifiable benefits include crop production and farmer income.



-9-
PCR Table 9 and Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2, report the first four years of ffb
production of 3,780 ha of oil palm developed under the project. The yearly
profile follows closely that of the appraisal and at four years reaches 17
tons ffb/ha. This is a very commendable and would indicate that the stands
of palm are well grown and maintained. Up to 1987, none of the project
rubber areas are reported in tapping. However the average yield on over
20,000 ha of pre-project rubber at the end of 1987, averaged over all
tapping years, was 1.3 tons dry rubber/ha, again a good field performance.
29.      The PCR data on farmer incomes (PCR para. 4.01 and Table 10)
indicates that the project was successful in addressing its underlying
objectives of increasing small farmer income and alleviating rural povertv.
In 1987, over the several types of scheme and crop, participants emjoyed
irm incomes of 44% to 100% higher than those on similar holdings which had
not been rehabilitated. Within schemes, the 25% higher crop income of
rubber farmers over the growers of oil palm, is attributable to short term
price movements involving an upswing of rubber prices and declining palm
oil prices. Over the life of the crops, however, a higher rate of return
from oil palm as projected at appraisal can be expected. This expectation
is reflected in the rates of return (financial) projected for an oil palm
scheme and rubber scheme (PCR para. 6.03) even though the sample can hardly
be representative of the large number of schemes. By type of scheme, the
20% higher income in consolidation s.chemes compared to rehabilitation
schemes might be the effect of a longer average period in production, but
the result needs study. It is also of significance that with the change in
project focus to rehabilitation of idle land which is typically in small
parcels, the estimated number of project beneficiaries increased to more
than 25,000, about double that assumed at appraisal.
30.      The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 13%
compared to the 17% at appraisal (PCR para 4.06). This reduced return,
attributable to the two-vear delay in the completion of the project and the
bunching of agricultural development into the 1985-87 period instead of the
years 1981-83 as planned, is satisfactory.
31.      Project cost recovery is very favorable.  The export duty and cess
charges on rubber over the productive life of the trees exceed the level of
the replanting grant to which farmers are eligible. The oil palm growers
are expected to resume payment of export duties, currently suspended due to
low oil prices. The full field costs of agricultural development embodied
in the loans to participants are recoverable through deductions from the
sales of rubber and palm oil, all of which FELCRA markets. Loan
performance has been good and will be enhinced by the computerised loan
accounting system.
Project Issues
32.      Future Scheme Manazement.  FELCRA's group farming approach
involves FELCRA management over an exended period of up to 25 years until
the participants have repaid their development loans. However, the
expanding program will make it increasingly difficult for the agency to
maintain its current intensity of staff and budget inputs into the system.
Eventually there will have to be a transfer of responsibilities for the



- 1C -
operation of mature schemes to the participants, in the framework of an
appropriate group structure. Government is expected to pursue devolvement
by its parastatal land agencies as a policy issue in the coming years, in
the context of continuing strong socio-economic development and production
efficiency of the smallholder sector. In the meantime, FELCRA is working
on ideas for scheme cooperatives.
33.      Financing Delayed Development.  As a consequence of the delayed
implementation of the agricultural program, the loan was unable to finance
a major part of field maintenance during immaturity and implementation of
scheme infrastructure as appraised. However, the Second FELCRA project
(Loan 2917-MA) signed in April 1988 and involving time-slice financing of
the agency's total development program, ensures continuing Bank support and
assistance to FELCRA.
34.      Palm Oil Mills.  As for schemes, new long-term management
arrangements for FELCRA's expanding oil processing facilities have yet to
be formulated. Currently the mills are managed by FELCRA for the oil palm
growers with processing charged on a cost-plus basis with no intended
subsidy to participants; operatiors are financially profitable. However
there are high interest burdens from the 100* government loan    FELCRA is
considering the for ation of a mill corporation along the lines of the
FELDA model, but detdils and timetable have yet to be put in place.
35.      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).  With the computerization program
increasingly in place and growing staff experience, the M&E Division
greatly improved its performance and expanded its data base. However M&E
has not yet been developed to the potential of the system for the benefits
of management. Strengthening the Division's role and performance is an
objective of the second project.
FELCRA's Performance
36.      After a shaky start, FELCRA responded increasingly positively to
the challenges of the project. Its performance improved significantly and
a much more mature and efficient organization with strong management
emerged by the end of the project. Further, the implementation of a
comprehensive training program for staff skills and attitudes led to high
staff morale, a low rate of staff turnover and the emergence of a new
institutional confidence and vitality, which was very apparent to
supervision missions. Cooperation with the Bank reached a high level of
accord. Government also noted these changes and increasingly expressed its
confidence in the agency and its performance.
37.      Standards of field implementation were generally gocd, especially
after the modifications to planting practices from 1982.   Yields of
earlier planted areas (of oil palm) are close to target profiles. There
has been a continuing severe shortage of experienced field managers and
supervisors, but the priority given to technical training and action taken
to upgrade field management salaries have had very positive effects.
38.      The Borrower complied to the best of its ability with all legal
agreements and maintained a high standard of project progress reporting.
Audited accounts in the latter part of the project were timely.



Bank Performance
39.      The Bank developed a close rapport with FELCRA, which in turn
expressed confidence in the relationship to promote the development
program. This facilitated frank technical discussions, particularly in the
agricultural sphero. Initially, there was discontinuity of Bank
supervision staff, over which FELCRA expressed its unhappiness. However,
from about 1983, a team of fairly constant composition supervised the
project and rapport improved greatly.
40.      The delayed effectiveness of the loan agreement (para. 7) should
have been largely avoidable through more timely dialogue. The Bank could
also have prepared FELCRA more adequately on loan operating procedures,
particularly in the areas of procurement and disbursement, where there were
many early misunderstandings.
41.      The load of consultancy assistance designed into the project was
heavy. Borrowers are often sensitive to consultancies and it is not clear
that all the original proposals were fully justified by subject area and
duration of service, or fully understood by the agency.
42.      The Bank's concurrence with the Loan Agreement amendments and
acceptance of considerable modifications in implementation targets,
reflecting changing project conditions, demonstrated a commendable
flexibility. The need for so many changes, however, does raise questions
on some appraisal judgements.
Lessons Learned
43.      The development of smallholder agriculture on an estate-type
model, through a system of group farming, can be very effective when the
implementing agency is strong and has the confidence of the farmers, and
when the productive strategy is sound.
44.      A comprehensive staff training program integrated into the project
can promote large and very positive contributions to staff morale and
operational effectiveness.
45.      Technical assistance provisions should not be overdesigned as they
can engender Borrower sensitivities to both costs and their competence.
46.      It is important to have c ntinuity of supervision personnel for
good project relationships, deeper understanding of project concerns and
better development of implementing agency trust and confidence.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYS IA
FELCRA I PROJECT
(LOgN 2013-MA)
1. INTRODUCTION
This Project Completion Report is prepared in compliance
with Article II Section 2.05(d) of tihe Project Agreement. The
Felcra I Project loan was the second /1 loan between the World Bank
and   the   Government   of   Malaysia  in  which  the  Federal  Land
Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) was involved as
the  executing  agency.   The  US$37  million  loan  was to finance a
major portion of Felcra's land development programes and related
activities  "under   the   Fourth  Malaysia  Plan  (1981-85)  and  to
strengthen Felcra's capability to plan and implement smaliholder
improvement   projects.    The   project  started  in  1981  and  was
successfully completed by the end of 1987, two years after the
original project completion date. The loan was fully disbursed in
April 1988.
/1   The first loan is  the  Trans-Perak  Area  Development  Project,
where FELCRA was initially one of the implementing agencies in
a project coordinated through the Ministry of Agriculture,
but later (1984) became the project coordinator; the main
implementing agencies are FELCRA, the Drainage and Irrigation
Department (DID) and the Public Works Department (PWD). The
project is still in progress.

II.  PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Proijct_Identification-and-Loan Approval
2.01 The project was identified in July 1979 by Felcra with the
assistance   of   a   UNDP/World  Bank-funded  Agricultural  Planning
Advisor attached to Felcra and preparation was completed in Juiy
1980 aided by a World Bank-funded consultant. ,t was appraised by
the  Bank  in  September  1980.   Loan  negotiations  took  place  in
Washington, D.C and following loan approval by the Board, .he loan
was signed on July 20, 1981 for a sum -f U.S37.0 million and became
effective on March 10, 1982.
B. ProJect ObJectives and Com@oP_nts
2.02   The project was intended to strengthen and  expand  Felcra  to
enable it to undertake a principal role in tackling the problems of
limited holding size and underutilization of land in smallholder
agriculture, through rehabilitation of tree crop land (especially
in State-sponsored land schemes), consolidation and development of
Lringe land areas to supplement existing holdings.
2.03   The  project  was  to  increase  the  incomes  and impro-ve the
living conditions and well-being of about 12,000 rural households
in Peninsular Malaysia through land rehabilitation and development
schemes.
2.04   It was to comprise development activities  over  a  pe:iod  of
five years, 1981-85 and to consist of the following components:-



14
a)     Development of about 90 small schemes, extending  to  a  total
of   about   34,000   hectares   through   new   planting  and
rehabilitation of about 26,000 hectares of rubber (76%) and
8,000 hectares !24%V of oil palm.
b)    Construction  of  about  560  staff houses, 88 scheme offices,
water and electricity supply and 180 km of scheme access
roads.
.. ! Construction   of   oil  palm  processing  facilities  with  a
capacity of about 80 tons ffb/hour.
d)     Reorganization and expansion of FELCRA.
e)     Assistance to Felcra management through  additional  staffing,
vehicles, equipment and consultancy services.
C. Projec tCost and Loan Financing
2.05   At  appraisal,  total  project cost was estimated at US$139.08
million (M$299.05 million) of which the Bank was to finance the
full foreign exchange costs estimated at US$37.00 million (M$79.54
million or 27% of the  total  base  cost).   The  Government  was  to
contribute   to  the  local  costs  amounting  to  US$102.08  million
(M$219.51 million). Very high contingencies amounting to US$37.1
million  (M$79.78  million) or 36.4% of total base cost were included
in the project cost indicating the highly inflationary situation at
the time of appraisal.

III  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01   This  chapter  compares  actual  performance  with the targets
established at appraisal, including an analysis of implementation
performance of the different components of the project, assessment
of project cost, disbursements, procurement, reporting, auditing
and  compliance  with  loan  covenants.   Annex 1 presents a table of
key performance indicators.
A. Overall Performance
3.02   Overall performance  of  the  project  had  be3n  satisfactory
with agricultural development exceeding appraisal targets. Up to
the end of 1987, a total of 36,800 hectares were planted comprising
28,100 hectares (76%) oil palm and 8,700 hectares (24%) rubber,
reversing the crop ratio planned at appraisal.   This  situation  ran
parallel   with   the  nationwide  increase  in  oil  palm  hectarage
reflecting a trend caused by a boom in oil palm prices during the
period  1984-1986.   Infrastructure  progress  fell  behind  schedule
because   of   an   oversight   at   appraisal  which  scheduled  the
infrastructure  programes  to  be  implemented   concurrently   with
project   implementation  whereas  on  the  ground  it  need  not  be
implemented until two or three years later.
3.03   Project progress in the early years  was  affected  by  budget
constraints   caused   by  the  then  prevailing  economic   ecession
resulting from the plunge in crude  oil  prices.   Consequently  Bank
undertook  a  review  of  the  project  and  a  provision was made to
extend the loan period for a year to enable full loan utilisation.

3.05   The  project  commenced  development  in  September  1980  and
achieved 52.5% (17,917 hectares) progress against appraisal target
by  the  end  of  1985.   However,  with the extension of the project
period to 1987, its implementation surpassed the appraisal target
by  the  third  quarter  of  1987.   At  the  end  of 1987 total area
planted stood at 36,867 hectares (28,161 ha oil palm and 8,676 ha
rubber), exceeding the target by 8%. Total area cleared reached



- 18 -
48,162   hectares   (comprising  494  schemes),  exceeding  appraisal
target by 41%. A total of 387 schemes were actually opened, a
number which far exceeded the estimated 90 at apprai il.
3.06   Problems.    Physical   progress   in   the   early  years  of
agricultural  development,  particularly  oil  palm  plantings,   was
hindered by an acute shortage of oil palm seedlings due to an
upsurge in new oil palm areas opened up for planting during the oil.
palm  boom.   This  shortage  occurred  not only in Malaysia but also
extended throughout the South-East Asia and Pacific regions as
well.   Apart  from  this unexpected problem agricultural development
standards were satisfactory.
b)     Infrastructure
3.07   Infrastructure  development  consists  of  access   roads   to
schemes, scheme offices, staff housing and supply of water and
electricity.
i) Access-Road
3.08   Achieveent.   Achievement  in  the  construction  of   scheme
access roads is shown in Table 2. By the end of 1987, a total of
72 km (395) had been  constructed/upgraded.   rhe  uncompleted  works
were brought forward and scheduled for implementation during the
Second Felcra Land Development Project (1988-1990) which is also
World Bank-financed.

3.09   Problems.   Under  normal  circumstances  access  roads to the
schemes were only constructed after completion of the land clearing
and  planting  phase.   Access  to  the schemes in the meanwhile were
through upgraded existing timber tracks or village roads.   This  was
the main reason for the slow physical progress in the early years
of the project as shown by the table above.
ii) Buildings
3.10   Achievement.  Actual achievement until December  1987  was  23
scheme offices and 146 staff houses as shown in Table 3. This
represents a shortfall of about 74% against the appraisal estimate
for scheme buildings and staff housing.

iii) Elet  ci_y_and_Waer_Splx
3.11   Water  supply  and  electricity  were  installed  in 14 and 20
schemes respectively out of the targeted total of 88 schemes.
3.12   Problems.   At  project   appraisal,   buildings   requirement
followed the then prevailing norm of a management unit to every
scheme opened.  However, in idle land  rehabilitation  programme  the
scheme  size  became smaller but their number increased greatly.  The
cluster concept of management (see para  3.23)  whereby  a  group  of
small   schemes   is  managed  by  one  common  management  unit was
introduced by Felcra aimed at maximising available resources and to
take   advantage   of  economies  of  scale.   Therefore  the  actual
requirement of scheme offices, staff housing and the accompanying
requirements  of  electricity   and  water  supply was far below than
that targeted at appraisal.
c)     Vehicles and Equipment
3.13   The number of vehicles procured up to the end of  the  project
period compared against appraisal target is shown in Table 4.

3.14   A  total  of  286 units of the appraisal estimate of 355 units
was purchased under the project, made up of 139 four-wheel drive
vehicles, 104 tractors, 9'8 trailers, and 15 units of other types of
vehicles.
3.15   The number  of  four-wheel  drive  vehicles  procured  was  50
units (56X) more than agreed at appraisal because of the increase
in the number of schmes opened. However, only a small number of
several other vehicles and equipment such as rotovators, ploughs,
trucks and tractor-graders which were anticipated to be required at
appraisal were finally procured as these vehicles and equipment
were readily available on hire.

d)     Pain Oil Mills
3.16   Although the loan provided for the construction  of  two  palm
oil mills with a total milling capacity of 80 tons fresh fruit
bunches (ffb) per hour, the actual final capacity of the mills were
70 tons ffb per hour, 40 tons ffb per hour for the Bukit Kepong,
Johore mill and 30 tons ffb per hour for the Nasaruddin, Perak mill
as indicated in Table 5.

3.17   Two  palm  oil  mill  consultancy  firms  were engaged for the
design,  supervision  and  construction   of   the   mills.    Actual
construction  of  the  two  mills  coenced in Septmber/October 1981
and was completed on schedule in late  1982/early  1983.   The  Bukit
Kepong sill was comissioned in January 1983 and handed over to
Felcra by the consultant in August, 1983 while the Nasaruddin mill
was  conissioned  in  April, 1983 and handed over in November of the
same year.
3.18   A third mill was included in the Project  in  1986  to  enable
the preliminary costs to be financed by the loan but implemention
was deferred to the Second Felcra Land Development Project.



- 23 -
3.19   Mill  Performance.   Initially  both  the  mills  operated  at
below capacity as expected because of insufficient throughput and
faced   some  teething  problems.   However,  they  are  now  running
smoothly on two shifts. At peak season they run for 24 hours.
Annex  2  shows  the  quantity  of  annual  throughput, production of
crude palm oil (C.P.0) and kernel as well as extraction rates for
the two mills.
3.20   Problems.   Construction  cost  for  the  two  mills  exceeded
their estimates by more than 50% because of a number of factors:-
a)   Inflation  and  rising  costs  of construction.  The mill
costs were estimated in 1980 just before significant
inflationary pressures.
b)   Costs  which  were  not  accounted for when the estimates
were made such as provision for expansion of mill
capacity,  clearing  of  swamps,  construction  of   tube
wells and rock blasting at the site of the Bukit Kepong
mill.
c)   No provision was  made  for  price  contingencies  whilst
only M$2.21 million (10.6%) were provided for physical
contingencies.



- 24 -
e)     Institutional Development
3.21   Under  the  project  Felcra  was  to  have   reorganized   its
organizational   set-up   for   the   purpose  of  strengthening  and
expanding its management capability to cope with the increased
responsibilities   under   the   Fourth   Malaysia   Plan  (1981-85).
Accordingly in 1982/3 a reorganization took place along lines
agreed under the Project Agreement. The new organizational set-up
is depicted in Chart A.
3.22   The  reorganization  basically  divided  the organization into
two broad areas of operations and administration, and elevated the
status of divisional heads to directors so as to be commensurate
with the expanded role and functions that had to be undertaken.
3.23   From 1984 onwards as Felcra  became  more  and  more  involved
with  idle  land  rehabilitation, it became increasingly evident that
it was simply impossible and uneconomical to set up a scheme
administrative office at every scheme as the schemes became smaller
in size as well as scattered in location.  It was  at  this  juncture
that  the  scheme  cluster  concept was introduced whereby a group of
schemes located in close proximity to one another came under the
supervision of one common management and a scheme cluster office
was  centrally  located  for  the  purpose.   Smaller  land   schemes
located  near  to  existing scheme offices were supervised from these
offices and as a result the job of existing scheme management was
greatly expanded to take care of these smaller nearby schemes. It
led to overall lowering of overhead costs though in some cases it
really stretched the resources of the scheme management to the



- 25 -
limit.    Bach   cluster  is  headed  by  a  scheme  cluster  manager
supported by the field staff of the various schemes comprising the
cluster.   This  cluster  c~oncept  was  in line with the government's
call for maximisation of available resources at a time of economic
downturn.
3.24   Although   the  covenants  concerning  organizational  changes
were  fulfilled,  there  was   a   need   to   further   review   the
organizational structure towards the end of 1985. This was to meet
the challenges of Felcra's expanding role, particularly in respect
of  its  idle  land  rehabilitation  progre and to further improve
its management capacity. Consequently refinements were made to its
organizational structure in 1986. This is illustrated in Chart B.
f)     Staffing
3.25   Achievement.   During  the  period  the  total number of staff
intake increased from 1,683 just before 1981 to 2,771 in 1985 and
3,008  in  1987,  an increase of 65% and 79% respectively compared to
the 100% projected at appraisal. As at end of 1987, 2,444 or 81%
of the staff was at the state and scheme level. Details by grade
are shown in Table 6.

3.26 Problem. The government's drive for increasing productivity
in the public sector resulted in the less than anticipated increase
in staffing over the project period. By efficiently utilising its
human  resources  to  the utmost, this constraint in staffing however
did not in any way hinder Felcra from achieving its development
target.
g)     Trainipg
3.27   Prior   to   the   project,   training   functions   were  the
responsibility of the Personnel Division.   The  project  recommended
the establishment of a Training and Staff Development Unit at
Felcra  headquarters  to  be  supported  by  a  Training  and   Staff
Development Advisor for a period of 36 man-months. Accordingly, a
Training Unit independent of the Personnel Division was established
in   1982.   A  Training  Advisor  was  recruited  locally  from  the
National Institute of Public Administration on a secondment basis
for a period of three years commencing from April 1983. The
services of the Training Advisor expired on March 31, 1985 but was
extended for the remaining duration of the project period.
Table 7 shows the number of staff and scheme participants
trained by year.

3.28   During  the  project  period  the  scale and scope of training
activities for staff and settlers were greatly intensified and
expanded.   New  activities included  i) overseas training for middle
management level officers in administration, finance, planning,
agriculture and computer programming under the Asian Productivity
Organization   Prograwue   (APO),    ii)   attachment   training  for
technical  and  field  staff  to  private  estates   like   Harrisons
Plantation Malaysia Berhad (HMPB) and Sime Darby Plantations, and
iii) for settlers, training in the management of cooperatives and
economic  projects.   The  groundwork  for  the  Training of Trainers
progrme was initiated in the later part  of  the  period.   However
the training proper will only comence during the Second Felcra
Land Development Project.



- 28 -
h)     Technical Assistance
3.29   The technical assistance  component  of  the  project  was  to
overcome gaps in Felcra's capacity to manage its rapid growth. A
number of professional consultants were engpged at various stages
during   the   project  as  recommended  at  appraisal.   Consultancv
services procured were:-
i% Financial and Management Advisor

i    Financial and Management-Advisor
3.30 Consultancy services in finance, management and accounting
were  provided  by  an international Financial and Management Advisor
for a period  of  13.5  man-months.   The  assignment  was  completed
satisfactorily.    During  his  short  assignment  with  Felcra,  the
Advisor assisted in the review of Felcra's financial  and  accounting
procedures which led to the formulation and preparation of the
manuals which are  in  use  today.   He  was  also  involved  in  the
computerisation   of   various   aspects   of  Felcra's  systems  and
procedures including the computerisation of the planning models
developed by the Senior Planning Advisot and the palm oil mills
accounts.

ii) snior Planing_dvisor
3.31   An international Senior Planning Advisor was recraited  for  a
period of 27.5 man-months. During his assignment with Felcra, the
Senior Planning Advisor developed a scheme planning and financial
model for screening the large number of schemes to be considered by
Felcra. The advisor was also involved in the review of Felcra I
Project   and  reformulation  of  the  Trans-Perak  Area  Development
Project.
iii) Palm-Oil Mills Processing-Consultants
3.32   Two palm oil mill consultant  firms  were  engaged,  one  each
for the design and construction of the two palm oil mills. With
their  assistance,  the  mills  were  successfully  constructed   and
commissioned on schedule. For the operation of the mills, visiting
agents have been engaged to ensure the smooth running of the mills.
iv) Coqputer Consultants
3.33   A  computer  consultant  firm,  Arthur  Anderson  &  Co.   was
engaged for a total of about 17,000 man-hours stretching over a
period of five years from 1981-1985 to advise and assist in the
installation, syatess design, programming and operation of the
computer as well as training of Felcra staff. The Bank agreed to
finance this consultancy from 1983 onwards.



- 30
v) Other Consultancies
3.34   Other consultancy services and  specialists  engaged  included
soil survev firms for conducting semi-detailed soil surveys and
soil analysis, and licensed surveyors to undertake perimeter and
final surveys as well as road surveys.
i)    Studies
3.35   Baseline  surveys  were  undertaken  on four sample schemes in
1981 to record the socio-economic status of scheme participants at
the pre-project stage. The four schemes were:-
i) Felcra Paya Angut, Pahang
ii) Felcra Kota Gelanggi, Pahang
iii) Felcra Atta Duri, Perak
iv) Felcra Redang Punggor, Perak.
Impact evaluation surveys on the four schemes will be carried out
when the schemes reach full production to enable comparison to be
made between pre-project and post-project situations.
C. ?prtL.g
3.36   Felcra was  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the
Bank.   These  reports were prepared by the Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit of the Planning and Evaluation Department and duly delivered
to the Bank in formats agreed upon between the Bank and Felcra.



- 31 -
3.37   In   the  planning  of  schemes  to  be  developed  under  the
Project, a full feasibility study report was prepared for each
scheme using an expanded format developed by the Bank. This format
was later simplified, without loss of essential details, to cope
with the massive number of schemes that had to be handled under
idle land rehabilitation.  To  ensure  its  viability,  every  scheme
had to yield an economic rate of return of at least 10%, as
required by the Bank.
D. Accounts and Auditing
3.38   Felcra  was  to  prepare  a  five-year  financial   projection
detailing incomes, expenditures and financial provisions. This was
prepared and duly submitted to  the  Bank.   A  system  of  financial
reporting acceptable to the Bank was also required and hence the
financial aspects of the project were also incorporated in the
quarterly progress report refered to in para 3.36.
3.39   Under  the  provision of the appraisal, Felcra's accounts were
to be audited annually by an independent auditor and submitted to
the  Bank.   Felcra  complied  with this provision and duly submitted
to the Bank annually the accounts audited by the Auditor General.
3.40   A separate auditor's  opinion  with  regard  to  Statement  of
Expenditures fSOE) procedures was also included in the Audit Report
from 1986 onwards following Bank's approval on the use of SOE to
facilitate reimbursement.



- 32 -
E. Procurement
3.41   Although  Felcra  generally  was  able  to  adhere  to  Bank's
procurement  procedures  yet  problems were faced in certain aspects.
In the procurement of agricultural contracts, two major areas of
difficulties   were   encountered,   namely  in  contract  bid  price
negotiation and the use of limited tendering.
S.42   Normal Felcra procurement practice  allows  for  contract  bid
price negotiation in cases where it is deemed neccesary in order to
save time and costs. However, the Bank was not in favour of such
practices and to comply with the Bank reimbursement requirement,
Felcra did not apply such procedures in any of the Bank-financed
agricultural contracts.
3.43   Bank's   procurement  guidelines  insisting  on  International
Competitive  Bidding  (ICB)  in  the  procurement  of  vehicles   has
resulted in the withdrawal applications submitted for procurement
of 35 units of four-wheel drive vehicles through Central Government
Contracts (CGC) procedures not being reimbursed.
3.44   To  meet  difficulties  in  contracting out small and isolated
land development works, Bank agreed on August 4, 1983 to allow
Felcra to practice limited tendering procedures subject to the
foll wing conditions:-
i) The value of contracts not to  exceed  M$100,000  and  to
be for agriculture works only.



- 33 -
ii) A minimum of five participating bids.
ii)  Prequalification  of  bidders  to  be  done  on an annual
basis, that is, performance and financial standing of
contractors to be evaluated annually.
iv) In all Bank-financed contracts, no preference shall be
given to any party.
3.45   This  flexibility  proved  to  be  very  useful   later   with
Felcra's   involvement   in   idle   land   rehabilitation,  where  a
considerable   proportion   of    alienated    land    offered    for
rehabilitation were usually small, not contiguous and scattered in
pockets. In fact about 20% of the agricultural development works
are now being tendered using the limited tendering procedures at
the state offices.
F. Disbursement
3.46   Up to the end  of  1985,  disbursement  amounted  to  US$13.38
million (M$31,562,559.63) or 36% of the loan amount. At the end of
1986, the original loan closing  date,  a  sum  of  US$17.25  million
(46.6%)  had  been  disbursed and the remaining 53.4% of the loan was
fully disbursed  at  the  end  of  1987.   The breakdown  of actual
disbursement by category against the original loan allocation is
shown in the Table 9. The final disbursement was made on April 13,
1988.

G.  .bmendments to Loan/Project Agreement
and Disbursement Letter
3.47   Two  amendments  were made to the loan agreement to facilitate
loan  disbursement.   The  first  amendment  of  February   1,   1983
increased  the  disbursement  percentages.   For  Category  I  - land
clearing, planting and crop maintenance -  the  percentage  increased
from  50X  to  65%.   For  Category  2 - processing facilities, staff
housing, access roads and related infrat;ructure - the increase was
from  35%  to  40%.   These amendments were to cover the large amount
of force account expenditures in scheme agricultural development,
especially during the maintenance period after planting, which were
not originally reimbursable. rhe increase in t."isbursement



35 -
percentage for Category 1 in particular substantially helped to
accelerate disbursement as about half of the total loan amount was
under that category.
3.48   The s-cond amendment on September 8, 1986  extended  the  loan
period  by  one  year  to  December  31,  1987.   It  allowed for the
prospects of full loan disbursement in the light of the much
accelerated  rate  of  agricultural  development in the later project
years. At the same time, approval was given for:
a)     the financing of a third palm oil mill  to  increase  Felcra's
processing capacity from 80 to 100 tons FFB per hour and
b)     the  financing  of new training facilities and construction of
state offices through amendment of  Schedule  2  of  the  loan
agreement.
Neither of the last two facilities were used due to deferred
implementation. They are now included in the Second Felcra Land
Development Project.
3.49   Apart   from   the   abovementioned   amendments,   two  other
additional  changes  were  made  to   the   Project   Agreement   and
disbursecnt letter in order to capture a larger amount of iand
development expenditures in small contracts for  which  disbursements
through normal procedures would  icur a lot of documentation.



- 36 -
3.50   By  an  amendment  to  the Project Agreement dated January 29,
1986, the Bank stipulated that Felcra should maintain separate
accounts to reflect all expenditures for which withdrawals are
requested  from  the  Loan  Account  on  the  basis  of   SOE.    The
disbursement  letter  was  accordingly  revised  on April 16, 1986 to
reflect the amendment to the Project Agreement. The revision
allowed the use of SOE for Category 1 to facilitate disbursements
against land development contracts valued at not more than M$50,000
equivalent. On September 16, 1986 this limit on the value of
contracts  reimbursable  by  SOE  was  however  increased to not more
than M$100,000  equivalent.   These  amendments  greatly  facilitated
disbursement because they eliminated time-consuming, cumbersome and
voluminous documentation from the State Offices which slowed down
the reimbursement process.
H. Settler Selection
3.52   Felcra  was  to  carry  out  a  study of its settler selection
criteria by June 30, 1982 and furnish a report detailing proposals
for modifying such criteria to the Government and the Bank for
agreement. Since settler selection was the prerogative of the
State Governments, the draft report initially prepared was not
submitted.  Instead,  a  request  was  made  by  Felcra  through  thf
government that the Bank delete this covenant of the Project
Agreement, which the Bank subsequently did.

J. Production and Yields
3.53   As at the end of 1987 a total of 33  oil  palm  schemes  under
the  project  had come into production.  Annex 3 shows the schemes in
production, planted area, year of first harvest and annual output.
The total annual output and average crop yields based on an
analysis of the schemes in production are shown in Table 9.

Actual yield profile (mt/ha)       2.1    6.5    14.7      17.0
3.54   The  average  yields  of  2.3 tonnes per hectare for the first
year of production in 1984 and 9.4 tonnes per hectare for the
second year in 1985 compare favourably with the appraisal estimates
which were projected at 2.5 tonnes per hectare and 7.8 tonnes per
hectare  respectively.   The  average  yields for 1986 and 1987 which
was the third and fourth vear in production, fell considerably
because a number of new schemes came into production during the



- 40 -
respective years thus distorting the actual average. However, if
the analysis was made based on  the  actual  year  of  harvesting,  a
different yield profile is obtained as shown in the same Table.
The  actual  yields  appear  to be quite close to the projected yield
at appraisal. However, account has to be taken that the data for
area in production are only estimates as actual surveys of the
producing areas are still in progress.
3.55   As  of  1987  none  of  the  rubber  schemes   has   commenced
production.

IV. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES
A. Farm Income and Returns
4.01   The    pre-project   monthly   incomes   of   the   scheme
participants  ranged  from  $80  to  $250  per  household.    The
average monthly incomes of participants by the end of 1985 and
1987 by scheme type and crop are given in Table 10.   Apart  from
drawing    benefits    from   incremental   production,   project
participants who work on the schemes also obtain iumediate
benefits in the form of wages earned.
Table 10: Average Monthly Incomes of Scheme
Participants byScheme Tyea_d_qCrp

Rehabilitation              300    359   Oil Palm      395    402
Source: compiled by Social Services Division
It can be seen that the average incomes of scheme participants had
shown a marked improvement with the implementation of the project
and were generally above the poverty income level. The average
monthly   incomes   of   farmers   on   similar   smallholdings   not
participating in the project were in the order of M$200.



- 42 -
4.02   An estimated 12,000 riral households were to  have  benefitted
directly from the land rehabilitation and develcopment schemes.
With the emphasis on rehabilitation of alienated idle land which is
awned in smaller parcels it is  now  estimated  that  the  number  of
direct beneficiaries has increased to more than 25,000 participant
families.
4.03   Financial   rates   of   return   were   calculated   for    a
representative oil palm scheme (Felcra Batu 8, Jalan Chenor) and a
rubber scheme (Felcra Ulu  Jenut).   The  return  for  the  oil  palm
scheme is 21X while that for the rubber scheme is 13X. .4nnex 4
Tables 1 and 2 show the farm level cash flow projections and
calculation of rates of return for the two schemes.
B. ProJect_Gosts
4.04   Total   project  costs  were  estimated  at  US$139.1 million
(M$299.05  million)  at  appraisal.    At   the   time   of   project
completion, total costs were M$262.81 million as sumuarised in
Table 11.  These were ).2% below the  appraisal  target.   Details  of
project costs by year are given in .4nnex 4 Table 3.

C. Rate of Return
4.05   At  appraisal  economic  analysis  showed  that  the aggregate
rate of return was 17%.   The  financial  rates  of  return  for  the
Bukit  Kepong  and  Nasaruddin  palm  oil  mills were 26.1% and 21.'2%
respectively. All prices were expressed in constant first quarter
1981 dollar.
4.06   With  costs  and  benefits expressed in 1988 constant dollars,
the economic rate of return to the project is estimated at 13'o
(Annex 4 Table 6). Details of economic price derivation are given
in Annex 4 Tables 4 and 5.
4.07   For the palm oil  mills,  the  financial  rate  of  return  is
estimated at 17%. (Annex 4 Table 7).



- 44 -
4.08   The  following  assumptions were made in arriving at the above
rates of return:-
i) Costs  and  benefits  were  expressed  in  1988  constant
dollars.
ii) Value of rubber and ffb production were calculated on
ex-farm prices.
iii) Costs and returns up to 1987 (in some cases up to 1988)
were  actual  figures  while   that   of   1988/89   were
estimated.

V. LESSONS LEARNED
5.01   The  principal  aim  of  the  project  was  to  strengthen and
expand  Felcra's  capability  to  plan  and   implement   smallholder
improvement projects and through the progrimes financed under the
project to improve farm incomes of rural households.   On  the  whole
the project is successful in terms of its contributions towards the
strengthening of Felcra as an institution of development,  there  was
overall increase in incomes of scheme participants, improvement in
smallholder agriculture through the transfer of technology and it
helped to sharpen the focus of Felcra's programme in rural and Land
development.
5.02   The Project has resulted in  the  comercialisation  of  rural
smallholder   agriculture   by   turning   kampung  lands  into  more
productive and estatised units through the adoption of modern
agricultural techniques and practices. On the organizational side
most   of   Felcra's  operational  systems  and  procedures  are  now
well-established and its staff and management have acquired a high
level of professionalism and competence thanks to the exposure
given and emphasis on training under the Project.
5.03   Despite the successful completion of the  project,  there  are
also valuable lessons that can be learned from its implementation.



- 46 -
i)     Targets and Projections_at fppraisal
5.04   Realistic projections  and  targets  at  appraisal  will go a
long way to ensure less problematic implementation of a project.
Nevertheless,   what   is   more  important  for  successful  project
completion is the willingness of all parties to the agreement to
uodify and rectify as the need arises.
ii ! Government Comitment-and Sumort
5.05   The  project  was  hit  twice  by budget constraint during the
implementation period. To ensure the successful implementation of
the project, full budgetary support to the project by ensurirng the
availability  of  local counterpart  funds   at   every   stage   of
implementation  is  very  essential.   The  commitment of the various
parties at appraisal to make available all the necessary funds and
support services must be carried out accordingly during project
duration to ensure the smooth implementation of the project.
iii)   SOB Procedures
5.06   SOB procedures were only introduced in 1986, six  years  after
project   iwplementation.    It   should  kave  teen  established  at
appraisal that given the nature of  Felcra's  operations  innumerable
small contracts and force account works were a coinon feature of
land development. Thus SOE procedures, if included earlier, would
have accelerated disbursement right from the start.



- 47 -
iv)   Procurement Prcedures
5.07   The   Bank's   insistance   on   adhering   strictly   to  the
procurement procedures as laid out in the Bank's  guidelines  without
due  consideration  to  the  local environment, constraints and needs
led to difficulties in the early part of  the  project.   A  case  in
point   was   the   non-acceptance   by  the  Bank  of  existing  CGC
procedures.   In  many  instances  goods  procured  through  the  ICB
procedures of the Bank turned out to be  the  very  same  goods  that
were already made available at no significant difference in prices
through  the  CGC.   On  another  aspect,  Felcra  could  have  saved
millions of ringgit had price negotiations been allowed.
v)   Consultancy Services
5.08   The  Bank  had  reconmended  no  less  than  seven  types   of
consultancy services to be engaged for the project. Whilst it
cannot be denied that consultants do inject fresh ideas into the
organization   and   act  as  resource  persons  to  `op  management,
Felcra's experiences revealed that although their services and
report were satisfactory, consultants especially internationally
recruited ones, may have inadequate  knowledge  of  local  conditions
and somtimes fail to develop a harmonious and meaningful working
relationship with the management and staff.



- 48 _
vi)   Relationshiy With_Bank Staff
5.09   In the early years Felcra experienced difficulties  having  to
deal with different Bank staff with each supervision mission. The
same  questions,  reports  or  documents  were  repeatedly  asked  by
different supervision missions because of lack of continuity and
knowledge of the project. However, after Felcra had requested that
the same staff be assigned to the project, it became much easier to
deal  with  the  Bank.   As  a  result, over the years Bank staff and
Felcra have developed a very special kind of relationship based on
mutual understanding, cooperation and goodwill.
vii)   Training In Bank-Guidelines and Procedures
5.10   Because  this  was  the  first  time  that Felcra was involved
from project start-up as the primary development .gency in a World
Bank  loan,  its  officers had no previous experience with the Bank's
guidelines  and   procedures   with   regard   to   procurement   and
reimburse-sent.   As  a  result  teething  problem  arose in the early
years, causing delay in submission of withdrawal applications and
to   a   certain   extent   non-compliance  with  Bank's  procurement
guidelines. Full training or adequate exposure should have been
given in the first year 3f project implementation to the officers
responsible for various aspects of loan and project implementation
to   ensure   the   smooth   operation   of  the  project,  and  more
importantly, to ensure that all eligible expenditures incurre' and
made are forwarded for bank financing.

viii) Paverwork aud Docum"entation
5.11   In  the  submission of withdrawal applications, a large nuaber
of documents had to be compiled, translated and delivered to the
Bank.   Considering  the  amount of paperwork and documentation to be
done it was unavoidable that miscommunication and misunderstanding
sometimes did occur resulting in unnecessary delays either in
disbursement submissions or approval.

Human Resources Division,

U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Donaldson,
Re: Felcra I Project (Loan 2013-dA)
Draft Projectv CompletionpReport
Reference is made to your letter dated February 23, 1990 inviting
comments on the above captioned report.
We are quite happy and agreeable to the Preface, Evaluation Summary
and Overview put up by the Bank for the Felcra I Project Completion
Report.   However  we would like to draw your attention to a correction
of fact in the second sentence on para 13 page 4 of the Overview.
The   realignment   of   Felcra's    responsibilities   on   idle  land
rehabilitation was the result of a shift in emphasis of government
policy and not due to the 1985 Felcra Amendment Act which among other
things allowed Felcra to operate in Sabah and Sarawak, to establish a
reserve fund and to set up corporations.
Line  1  para  15,  page  5  of the Overview should be read as "The two
project  palm  oil  mills ........."  instead   of   ".           oil   palm
mills ...

For your information, the Federal Treasury has written to Felcra in a
letter dated March 24, 1990 stating that it has no comments on the
draft report.
With kind regards.
Sincerely,
(MOKHTAR BIN AHMAD)
for Director General,
Felcra.
