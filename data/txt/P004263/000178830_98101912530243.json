This would cover development of\n            about 50 proposed fringe schemes, and the rehabilitation of\n            about 40 existing unassisted land development schemes. The\n            project would also provide for the construction of two palm\n            oil mills. About 75 percent of the beneficiaries would be\n            rural households whose present incomes fall below the\n            poverty line. At full development, the project would enable\n            these beneficiaries to more than double their incomes."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
