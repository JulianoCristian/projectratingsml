SUBJEC: Project Completion Report on Uganda
Industrial Rehabilitation Project (Credit 18UG)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Uganda - Industrial Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1248-UG) prepaed by the Africa Regional Office. Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
Thiu project was designed to (i) rehabilitate industial projects to restore domestic capacity
for the production of essential goods and services; and (ii) strengthen two development institutions - the
Uganda Development Bank (UDB) and Uganda Commerci Bank (UCB) - to provide industri loans
for rehabilitation and development. The capital injection for the two financial institutions that was
required under the credit was not undertaken upfront as expected; instead, the equity was met as part of
sub-loan repayments through acceptance of debt for enuity. Institutional weaknesses were aggravated by
severe political, security and macroeconomic problems. The performance of UCB was relatively better
than that of UDB. However at credit closing, both institutions were in serious financial difficulties
because of serious arreirs and the poor quality of the overall portfolio.
The PCR provides a candid assessment of these problems. Overall, the operation is rated
unsatisfactory and its sustainability as uncertain. The project was partially successful in its institutional
development objectve of improving project analysis capacity in the two financial insttutions. No audit
is planned.

INDUSTRIJ,AL REABILTATON PROJECT
(CREDIT 1248-UG)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
I.           Following the cation of the 1979 war, the Govarment of Uganda iiiated n
economic recovery program Involving the rehabilitation of the productive sedors of the ecoomy
wbich wo  terally in rins as a result of the depedatons of the mfiitary regime (1971-79). In
pportof theseffbus, IDA inily proided two Recontu  credits and a Technical Assisace
creit  lhe credt under rewiew cciaplements thes6 credits.
Objective
Bi.          The objectves of the credt were to: (i) rehabilitate a nunber of iustri prjecs
to reoe some of the domesdtc cpcity for producing essntial goods and services; and (H)
sregthen UDB and UCB to mor effctively underak the Inmedio function for industr
reabiitation and devlopment
Imleento Exprence
i.     '     Ie Imple      g agencies were: (a) UDJI for financing rehabit  of medium-
a  lan W  scale industries; and (b) UCB for fiacing small scale indwsres (SSi;). The original
alloctin of US$30.0 million to UDB and US$5.0 to UCB were revised in the course of project
Irplementation to US$28.0 million and US$7.0 million respectvely, to enable UCB to fnamce mor
SSJ becms of its apid commiment of the orginal locaon The Government was to conribule
US$10.0 million and US$6.5 milion from the allocations of UDB and UCB respectivdy to their
paid-I capital and te balance to be on-lent to them  The Goverment decided to m&ae thes equity
cotition out of loan rpayment by  b-projects.
Iv.          Ibe record of project implentatlon was mixd. While UCB implem         the
proctd latively    ily, UDB w  hped itimy projectI                     by Istioal
and by political, security nd sevec problem  (Pa  5.01). Crit

Decmber 31, 1989 and June 30, 1992 re tvdy.

food and beverages, and engineeing sub-sectors. About 50% of the sub-projects were based on
imported aw matrials, receiving 36% of the amount. Most projects took firm 24 to 7S mouhs to
Implement and two are still under construction. Capacity utilization ragd between 7-90 percen,
the averg being 44%. Becuse of the contining economic difficulties, pardiulady the shotage
of foreigl exchange for import of raw mat s, and the long start-up perod needed for pr foj  to
go into commrcial production, it Is premaure to pass judgment at this stage on the success or filure
of the beneficiay enrpries (Para 6.01).
vi.          UCI SubWo-pjecs. UCB provided finacing of US$10 mfllion under the credi to
80 smail-scale enterprises, mosdy in agoprocessing, building, and clothing sub-sectou. Since most
of the sub-projects were based on local raw matrials, their performac was  t affced by the
shorte of foeign exchange an their capacity utlization was than that of UCB subpoects. Es the
case of UCB sub-projects, project reshould be considered to be satsfacty (Pam 6A.
vii.         St    hin  of UDB and UCI. 'TM  objecdve of strengthening the 
capabilities of UDB and UCB to undertake rore efectively the  _    fun fti  was not
achieved in the case of UDB. While the technical assistance provided under the credi did hdp
improve UDB staff capabilitlcs to some extent, the political and economic situation and suspensions
of credit lines by the donors due to Govenment defaults in itlment aments adveeldy affeced
UDB portfolio.  Lack of autonomy from Government in the matOer of project  1prval, in
determation of interest rates together with interfrence from Board in management fucutions
impaie  emangme  effectiveness.  UCB, on the other hand, was able to develop a better
organition, by sengeg its Development Finae   Group, which bandled fminaig of small-
scale industry. Because the capital injection into UDB and UCB, provided under the aedk, was
done out of sub-oan repayments, financial strengthening of these institutions was accomplshed only
paily and too late. Mainly because of are   and the poor quality of the overall portfolio, both
ntitutions are in serous financial difficulties (Paras 6.03, 9.02 and 9.03).
viii.        Since rehabiliaton took place during a period of econmic and political dfficulties,
and since most entises are not yet able to realize their fill potental due to shortage of foreign
exchange and other operational problems, it is prematu  to make a judgment on the modium- and
long-term sustainability of their econmic benft. Under improved operatig conditio, ecoomic
beMfits of most of the assisted    pris are likely tD be suaable. Regri  the finncial
intermediars, UCB, although presenty in a poor finial codion, has the potendal of improving
its position with the return of more stable economi conditons. UDB, however, has been vrtuly
an am of the Govaement, limitng its ability to operate as an autonomous intui   Its survival
wilhout enorm     Goven   subsidies (Para 9.02), and Its susanab     are qustonbe (Pr

to large portfolio arrears, are in precaious flanmcial poridoti. The main lesos learned from this
experienCe are as follows:
(a)    wito  political and economic stabilty, thaee is littls chance of success for an
eneprise rehabiitation project like this which does not target specific invesing
wies;
(b)   in a situion of svere and dronic foreign exchange shonage, while providing
resou    to indusial project for capitalmivestment snd six months requreme
of impored raw maWials, the Govenmnet shoudd have also ensured adequate
codtuity of complementary resources in foreign exchange for import of raw
mterias and spare part to enure opation at a reasonable capacity for longer
periods, wiot which invesm   in capital stck was not able to genate funds to
rey  loans, thus creatng liquidity problems for the financog institutions;
(c)    development finace istiions should be give autonoy in day to day management
and held accoutable for reslts.  Excessive Govenment control and Board
Inefaence demoralized UDB managemt and caused loss of focus on priorities;
(d)   a def. ed procedure and deadline(s) for capital injection out of IDA resourcesshould
have cmen spelled out in IDA's project documents; for lack of this, financial
strengthing of the two f'na     in  iares could not tke place in dme; and
(e)    without a longer term strategy for the financial sector, such fincional ivesmen
are unlikely to achieve much. (This is now being done under a proposed Finncial
Sector Adjusuen  Credit).

amount of US$35 million equivalent, the amounts under the two components were modfied in he
course of project ImplemeItaon (Pars 5.02). Among other th , the UDB cmonent also
pwvided for a techical assistance sub-component to impove UDB's project appraisal capabilites.

4.    Project Deign and Orgization
4.01         Following the cessation of war and the installation of a civilian Govenmnt, there
wa an immediate need fo ,roviding foreign exchage rources to rehabflitte the productive sector
of the economy. h project was designed and ftmuated to redress the constrait on the iustri
sector in Uganda and at the same time to establish quicldy an effective framewor for technical and
fnanci assistance to industry. While shortages of imported aw maewis and sparo pars were the
major constraints to indus  production i the shorterm, the enterprises also needed replacemen
of obsolee and damaged plan, machinery, tools and otier equipment, repairs to civil works and
assistance i installation, commissioning and opemion of the plants.  While the needs for
rehabition of the sector were extensive, the  Wain objective in designing the major componet of
the project (assistance dtugh UDB to medium- and large-scale enteprises) was to provide asitn
to a limited nber of priority industrial enteprises, pre-lccted by the Govanment, IDA and UDB,
on the basis of potentdal for (i) saving foreign excdhnge direcdy trough producing esal conumer
goods and conuctionmaterials and (i) contbutig to foreign exchange egs indirecdy throgh
producing emnal inputs for agricultural actiities. For re abilt   of small-scale industries,
based on a indicative sample in three priority sub-sectors (food prceing, farm implemens and
engineing workshops) it was estimated that the allocation of US$S milion would be adequate to
finance, on a fairly selectiva basis, 40-50 sub-projecs over a time frame of 3 years. For re-lending
fknds to i-Ausial enteprie, the two financial inrdes selected were appropriate. They
poessed the basic capabilkies although some shening was needed.
4.02         The project was well-prepared and its timing was approprate. The scope and scale
of the project were appropriate In light of its objectives and the imple n capability in the
country. The two financial intemediaries, which were responsible for project implemetion, were
associated right from the outset in project preparadon and formulation and were well aware of their
reponsibilies in project imlemention.
S.    Project Implementton
5.01         Ihe credit became effective on September 16, 1982, about four months after Board
approval and three months after credit signature. The record of project implemenation is checkerd.
While UCB implemented its portion of the investment component involving financing of small-scale
industies qudte efficieny, UDB was reatvely slow in implementig its portion, involving fianing
of medium and large industries. Apart from institutional w esses, the maintors adverely
affectingrwjet imp         were: the frequ breakdown of law and order and political umoil,
hih rami, of iion, massive depcia    of the curency, negative intert rates, shorage of
foreign exchange and local credit, reversal of the Govenment policy, for about 18 months, of the
Governnt assuming exchange risk on foreig   edits subloaned to idutri entpren, and
ssesion of lies of credi by donors maily due to defaus of repayments by the Govement

autorized in May 1986 to use IDA hnds for financing e  small-cale industia

(b) Credi comcitment and  losing dates wer extended thrice fom 6M30/84   and

(d) UlDB fiaced under the credit three sub-oject in exces of USS4.0 million

poject wold not be financed. However, It appears tha this matter was nOt finally

Govermet did not give suient Importace even to  hcasing th audhozed capital of the two

exchange for import of raw materials, and the long start-up period needed for projects to go into
commercial production, It is premature to pass judgment at this stage on the success or failure of the
beneficiary enterprises. However, given the continued low rate of capacity utilization (only 5 sub-
projects are operaing at 60% or higher capacity), it would still be fair to say that the project results
were less satisfactory than those visualized at a4praisal. Annexes l-VII provide data on the
peformance ef the sub-projects.
6.02         UCB sub-projects. UCB provided financing of US$10 million under the credit to
80 small-scale entprses, mosdy in the agr-processing, bulding, and clothing sub-sectors. About
79% of the sub-project received financing for amounts below Ush 50 million (US$50,000 at the
present exchange rate). Only scanty information on the performance of the sub-projects is available
(Ae  X and Xl). However, judging from their generally unsaisfctory repayment perfom
(Ann  XlI), it apa  that these sub-projects were nevertheless perfoming better than UDB sub-
projects. TbI was perhaps because most UCB were based on local raw mateuials and their
perfmace was not afected less adversely by the shortage of foreigm exchange. The sub-loans are
estimatd to have created 1,964 jobs at a cost of Ush 2.1 million (US$2,100) per job. In the case
of UCB sub-projects, project results should be considered to be sasfactory.
6.03         Sreghenng of UDB and UCB. The second objective of the project, to stregt
the institutional capabilities of UDB and UCB to underae more effectively the intermediation
funcD, was not achieved in the case of UDB. While the technical assistance provided to UDB did
help improe systems, procedures and staff capabilities to some extns, the political and economic
situation and suSpsions of credit lines from time to dme by the bilateral and iternaal donors
adverey afected staff morale. Further problems in the smooth functioning of UDB were created
by undue intree    in its operational matters by the Govenment (which required prior consultation
beore submission of the sub-projects to Board for approval and by UDB Board members, many of
whom were political appointees without appropriate professional background and were encroaching
upon the management functions of the General Manager, affecting his autnomy and effecivens).
UCB, on the other had, was able to develop a better organiaion, by strengthening its Developmen
Finance Group, which handled financing of smal-scale industry. Because of the modaity adopted
for capital injecdon, the project did not accomplish financial strengthening of these i
7.    SustainabiHty
7.01        Since rehabilitation took place during a period of economic and political difutis,
and since most enterprises were not able to realize their full potential due to shortage of foreign
exchange and .VJier operonal problems, it is premau  to make a judgment on the medium- and
long-tem susainabiity of their economic benefits. Under improved operating conditions, economic
benefs of most of the assise enterprises are likely to be sustainale. Regarding the finaci
intermediaris the UCB, although presently in a poor financia condition, has the potential of
imprving is position with the retur of more stable economic condiionsThe UDB, howevr, has
been vituay an arm of the Government and unable to opere as an autonomous  titiona It has
survived so -far only with enormous Government subsidies (Pa 9.02), without which its
su8talnaity is questionable. In developing its lending program for the future, the Bank Group is
the refm of the public enteris  and of the fiancial sector as a whole. A Finanal
Sector Adjusunn Credit being processed by lDA would have a tchnical assistan  componet to
improve the capbilte of the key instuions in the sector.

8.    IDAs Performance
8.01         The Bank Group prvided considerable assisuce to the Governme and the two
flnancW  intrmediries in idenifying, preparing and mlemenig the project. IDA, however, did
Qot take up with the Governm  the issue of UDB's autnomy at cri appraisal nor did t pursue
during supevision the issue of undue intference by UDB's Board in maagemen mae. It was
also deficient i not insiting strongly enough with Governmen to increase the authorized and paidin
capital of the two bank right at the beginnng of project imlemetaton a   in any case following
the currnc refoms of 1987, whereby the value of thei capital was reduced by a factor of 100.
IDA did not field supervision missions afr July 1989, ailthough  d _   of subs    a
(US$10.0 millon) were yet to be oompleted.        appws to be pardy due to the factbat, by July
1989, 100% of the UCB component and 85% of the UDB compot bad been committed and it was
expected that  d       would be completed by December 1990, and pardy because the techical
ssisuce compo  was completed.
9.    Borrower'sPer
9.01         Govrat performance.  he Govment was the borrower of the IDA credit,
but the major portion was inme     d through UDB and UCB to industrial entseris. The
Govnmen's perfomanc affected project Implemetatio to some exte   Goverment was pay
responsible for the delay in project implemention because its default in repaymet of cret
istmen often triggered  edit suspensos by donors, but this was due to c nces beyond
is control viz. extreme shortage of foreign  chage. Govement did not allow UDB sufficient
autoom  in project selecdon and setting of interest rates. It was also slow in incasiog the
authorized and paid-in capital of UDB and UCB; these delays have led to UDB vwiolating its 4:1 debt-
equty ratio covenan and to UCB having an unacceptably low capital to risk assets ratio until 1989.
Government also, for a period of 18 months, caused uncertainty in UDB and in the wub4brower,
by chanfng its position on bearing the foreign exchange risk on the loan.
Uanda Develpmet Bk (IUDB)
9.02         UDB was the intemediary for channdling 80% of the credit. Although most of the
sub-projects to be financed were pro-selected, it took UDB about 6 years to commit the amount and
9 yeas to disburse it. This was due to project appisal, supervision, and other or iona
weakness in UDB, which were addressed through technical assite provided by IDA and UNDP.
Other factrs responsible for delay in project imple ion were the macro economic and security
situatios change in the foreig exchange risk policy by the Goveoment for about 18 months (Para
5.01), and occasional suspension of wthrawals from the credit by donors, due to Govment
defults in repayments of credit. These events. and the shortage of local currc reorcs  with
lntrepreneus often disrupted project implemen    Over the years, UDB's financial posiion was
advesly affected by large ares and poor collction (Anmexes VI and VII). Under thlir extenl
audit' pressure, large provisios had to be made for             loans in 1989 and 1990
(Amuex VV . UDB nurred a loss of Ush 336 million in 1990, mainly due to a provision for loan
losses mounting to Ush 2.1 billion, or 93% of its total itert income. In recent years, UDB was
sved from insolvency by exchange gain on a loan it made to an export-orend enterprise

of window-dressing by UDB by rscheduling some of Is loans, withut adequate analysis of recovery
prosects, in order to presen an improved finacial posiion at the dme of UDB's appial by a

UDB's equity, althoug, acording to its own policy stateme, its investment in any one project
shud not exceed 20% of UDB's equity. Despite enorous, subsdies provided by the Govemne
in the form of low interestforegn credts, an unusually hih spread of 20% on its boowings,
fequ  replenshment of its paid-in capital, UDB i Presently facing a liquidity crisis and is in poor
shape. As of December 31, 1990, the latest period for which audited accou   are gavlable, UDB's
cuet atio was less than one, loan collections we  only 24% ot billiw, N  prvisions a_mnd
to 19% of the portfolio whereas over 78% of the portfolio was affcted by ears of over 6 months
(As of June 30, 1992, about 97% of the portflio was affected by aes of over 6 months).
Ugnda Commedal Bank (UCB)
9.03         UCB's role in this project was secondary. Its main fimction wascommerCial banking
but it had orgnied a special uni caled the DevelOpmen Fin       Groupw to handle its term
financing opeati  to small scale industries (SSIs). It was resosible for utizing only 20% of the
Credit. Its perform     in project mi I on was better tma dt of UDB. t had commined
93% of its original allocation of SDR 4.5 milion (US$5.0 million) by Febuay 1986 and 100% of
tho rvised allocation of SDR 6.5 million (US$7.0 million) by June 1988. While the repayment
pefoman  of its IDA sub-loans was better than tht of UDB's sub-loans, its SSI portfolio was
buildn up arrears due to          repayment performance of its SSI bormro s. This bas also
resulted in only small amounts of LDA sub-loans repaymen  beg  avalable for its caitalization.
I receot years, UCB's overall portfo and financial pition have also deterora    sharply
(Amxes    and XIV). It Incred huge lo  durng FY89-91, many because of lare prvisions
for loan losses. In FY89 it hadanegativ equity. It caried out a rauation of fixed  se (Ush
26.6 billion) in FY90 which accun  for positv equity in FY9o-91, but the eroi  of equy
connes. Unless immediat steps are taken by the Government to stengthen UCB financially and
to reucture It, UC  is very close to insolvency.

mainly to politcal tmoil, security problems and the ma-economic difficulties faced by the
country.  Both UDB and UCB maunined good relationships with a number of multilateral and
bilateral donors, who were inte d in assindg the rehabilitation of the economy and provided
grts and credits through them for the purpose.

UCB to submit audited accon  by certa  dates. UDB was fiurer reqired to protec Itsef from
exchange riskl and to maintain a debt-equity ratio of 4:1. The leg agreement should have required
dt  Goverment, as dth ody sh    der, to pay in the agreed mos of equity conution to
UDB and UCB out of the IDA credit by parcular dates and in a defined manmer. in a side leter,
th Govemen shoud  also have commtted itselfto allowing UDB to opera autonomouy, without

difficultes, paclarly the shortage of foreign exchae to import raw materis and spare parts.

PART H. PROJECT REVIEW FtOM THE BORROWERS PERSPECIVE
THE PROJECT OBJECTVES AND DESCRIPTON
OBJECIVES
1.           The objective of the Projeat was the achievement of a national revival of
agricultre and idutry though the provision of credit and odter loan facilies to prospecdve
epr       . UDB', objective were to provide a channel for financial and technical assistanCe
to promote industril rehabilitation and development The Project also focused on improving the
capacity of UDB to prepare and appraise development projec for financing by external donors
wWle    ning the Ban's own finance and management. IDA and UNDP put in place
insutio b _ug technical asnce to help UDB execute its growing development banking
responsibiity with a US$30 million IDA credit line in the pipeline. The Project objectives wex
overly opmc to assume that the revival of the economy could be achieved with  a few yeam,
with the provision of credi after ten years of ewnomic   n en     It also  umed dhs
aftaer the fall of Amin's Govermen in 1979, the era    cterized by civil ste and insecurity
had ended in Uganda.
DESCRIPTlION
2.           A line of credit of US$30.0 diHon was appwoved by the Bank againt guarantee
of Uganda Government to cover part of UDB's resource requireme  for financng 25 selected
projects for rehabilitation in the indal sector. Mhe loan was on IDA!s standard term for
fFIS. Prior Word Bank approval was necesay for each sub-project. Tle aggafree limit
per project was US$4.0 million. The sub4loans were to be made withn the frmework of UDB's
operang policies.
PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
3.           Mme key element of the Project was the provision of six highy qualified experts
in strategic line positons in UDB, i.e. (AGM Projects, AGM Finnc and Admion, CA,
Financial Analyst, ldustrial Economist and Industrial Engineer) ncetly for a two-year
pero  during which the selected sub-projects were to be ap sed and UDB's finances and
management strengthened.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.           The Project became effective on 1 September, 1982. However the environment
in which the ptoject functioned frouated its efectvene. Political Instability made rcuit
of the sx line consultants almost impossible. AU the six consultants were never in place
concurrenty at any time durig the project's life. Two of the expertu died shortly after satig
their         . At one stage the reWainng expe  wero evacuated for fi months due to
civil sti. I is only since 1986 ihat the project opeatd (five years aftr   start) in a sable
enioment.
S.           Dldays in UDB hnp       l of the project were maily duo to the foDlowg
(a)    The iniial list of idusti selected by IDA for the Project conisted of mainly
gOVe      owned           and Asian exproprid ndst    whose lea
own    i could not be estisheM   As per the terms of the project, t



Companies could not be appraised and financed Wot resolving the ownership
problems.
(b)   Out of the odginal list of 25 prese_cted projec, only ten qu6Iified for appraisal
ad finance. Accordinly, the Bank had to seek aroval from IDA to appraix
six other sub-projects which wert not on the original list. The approval of IDA
to appraise the six sub-projec  took a long time thus extending the
implementation period of the cet.
(c)   The Implementation of the Technical Asssta    component of the Project,
patdclay the recument of the six key line eprt was rot smooth as
indicated below:
Politcal itability made recruitment of the six line consulta   almot
mpossible; such that the six consultants wee never in ple concurently at any
point dudng the project's life, contray to what was envisaged in the ptoject.
The top two technical posts namely AGM (Finance & A sn) and AGM
(Operati) were tever concurrently filled. There was lack of expate team-
wotr Sbr these two posts.
(d)   Similay in the apptaisal departm   there were never a concurnt team
conwsing of expart  such as: an economist, indusrangineer, fiacl
analyst from which the local staff could benefit as a tam  They were enggd
at differ  times. ThI engineer and Chief Accntn died shordy after sting
their assiments. The replacem  engeer egapd In 1985, ran away in the
same year due to insecury. At one stage the remaiig expers were evacuaed
for five months due to civil strife. The enmi   aed also did not
contriute much.  Thus, overal UDB did not befit from dte aprais
expariat personnel.
(e)   The conultig firm which was engaed to appraise a number of preseected sub-
projects was iadequate in its work such dtat appraisals were not approved for
financing by IDA. This and the iffeci ss of the apprais  expatiat
peomel had a great bearing on the rate at which the sub-projects were
-ai  and hence finds committed.
In  sneam the apis was done by the local sta4 only takng advantage of the
aining         t of the techal sitance, both local and oveseas.
6.            iD     dzunde the la proceeded satisfactorily aft  1987. However, dm
wa need frter exte_ion of dosing dates of the Project to allow UDB to comit firther
fia whko m ainly due to cq of prvous preselected subroJects and sving
on f&lly disbursd sub-projects.
7.           Due to o       _    by the Governmet of aars o glbal loans to IDA,
ut_lbwton of exitng lines of credi was supended, threby i      the ds        of

and in tum the financial situation of UDB.
8.           mmbo nby the Govanen in May 1987 tat t wbuld nc longer ben
feign excha   risks on loan in foreig  curncy contributed to the derioration of the
porfolio  Mhm decision of Governm   on exchange risks affected the Bank's loan olection
effo  seriouy as the sub-loan contracts betwen th Bak and its sub-borowers were in dispu
theeby treening the Bas financi  viability.   m isue was finally resolved when the
Governmen agmed   resume beaing UDB sub-loans povided d  UDB imposd a lO% foeig
exchange risk fee payable to Govrmen by its sub-borwe. The deay in solving the freig
excage risk  e, thdfore, impded loan collections fom UDB sub-browers at a criical
period of the Projec
PERORMLANCE
9.           Given the difficult politcal eonom   ad secriy condiidons dat previ   in
th  1980s,  UDD's peomance i imple    the Project should be rated as mixed,
conidering the shoromings of the Tecical sistance component of the Project
10.          Out of the 16 sub-projects fimded, only, ten are operating sadsfcorily while five
ar exeiencn opeatioa problems and one is not yet opeaional. Neariy all sub-proJects

FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Findings
16.          UDB's performance under the loan has been mixed. During the implementation
of the Project, Ugaida passed through serious economic difficulties in addition to political
turmoil.
17.         The imx ct of these problems on UDB's portolio has bee severe. Porfolio
anes are bigh   Fu, iemore, UDB has been epeiencing delays in capitalzadon by
Govenment which is creating a liquidity crisi and could affect UDB's debt-seicing capaciy.
18.         Prendy UDB is makn considerable contribution by fiacin iWdustri and
agricultual development In common with other finacial iu  s, it has serus portlio
problems, which have affcted its viability. In addion, it has to rely on Inernional Fnanes
ttutns and the Govenment to provite credits for on-lending to sub-projects. Given this
senr, there is rethink going on its opetional strategy and role in the more stable ecnomic
sition in the country.
Lem= Larned
19.         A few lessons can be drawn from the experience of impl ion of this
project. Firsty, in view of the contry's foreig exchnge problems and heeon    ausiy
situtio, IDA dsud ave given highe pio    to fincing projet which had potential for
earing foreig exchange. Secondly, the Bank should have done a more thorough apprasal of
projects with a view to ensuring that the sponors had the necsary counepart funds to meut
any cost escalations and maagemen capabi  to implement the project. Thirdly, the project
should have taken Into account the mobilization of local cumency resuc  for the sub-projects.
Fourthly, there was lack of quick iniiati  to provide  cncal and finana assistauce to
restructure   jects e  ncing opeaiona prems long befre the  problems becam
serious. Lasty, it should have been avoided to continue financing sub-projects in an environment
of severe poliical and economic insbility.
