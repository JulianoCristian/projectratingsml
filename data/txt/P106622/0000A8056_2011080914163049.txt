                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are to assist in the implementation of the Government’s national HIV/AIDS program through support to: (i) deepening of
                         prevention interventions targeted at high risk groups and for the general population (ii) increasing of access to treatment, care and support services for
                         infected and affected individuals; (iii) strengthening of program management and analysis to identify priorities for strengthening the health sector capacity to
                         respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other priority health problems.

                         Second HIV/AIDS Project from May 30-June 3, 2011. The overall conclusion of the MTR is that significant achievements have been made under the implementation of the
                         2007-2012 National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (NSP), however, AIDS remains a major threat in Jamaica and a key challenge remaining is to sustain efforts in prevention and treatment

                         of AIDS, particularly among most at risk populations (MARPs). The Government is applying for the next round of the Global Fund to implement the new National AIDS Strategy
                         (2012-2017).

                         Achievements include:
                         (1) Reduction in AIDS Mortality. Increased access to HIV testing and expansion of ARV treatment have resulted in a reduction of AIDS mortality. Mother to child transmission has
                         been reduced from 10 percent in 2006 to less than 5 percent in 2010 and pediatric AIDS cases were reduced by 19% between 2008 and 2009.

                         (2) Improved prevention programs. Prevention programs have increasingly focused on MARPs and interventions were refined based on evidence and information from the M&E
                         system.

                         (3) Strengthened surveillance and M&E system for HIV. Jamaica has built solid surveillance and M&E systems to monitor the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Capacity for surveillance and
                         M&E has been strengthened and the M&E team stands out as one of the best in the Caribbean region.

                         (4) Mobilization of Resources for HIV/AIDS. In addition to the World Bank Loan from the Second AIDS Project in 2008, the National HIV Program (NHP) mobilized a large amount of
                         grant financing: US$45 million from the Global Fund and US$10 million from USAID/PEPFAR.

                         Challenges: AIDS Prevalence rates are still high, particularly among MARPs. The estimated adult prevalence rate among the general population is 1.7%, but rates are much higher
                         among MARPs: 32% among men having sex with men (MSM) and 5% among Commercial Sex Workers (CSWs). Jamaica reports an estimated 27,000 people living with HIV/AIDS
                         (PLHIV); however, the figure could be as high as 30,000-35,000 due to many being unaware of their status and posing a tremendous risk as they can potentially unknowingly spread
                         HIV.

                         Capacity for scaling up prevention and treatment for MARPs is limited. The high HIV prevalence in MARPs necessitates the scaling up of effective prevention interventions for this
                         group. The program has the capacity to cover about 30% of the 285,000 persons most at risk (MSM, CSW, prisoners, out of school youth, adolescents) but reaches approximately
                         10%.

                         Stigma and discrimination persists and poses a challenge to scaling up activities. Only 3 out of 25 NGOs are working with MSM. Testing rates among MARPs are also much lower
                         than in the general population.

                         Sustainability of the NHP. The 2007-2012 NSP has largely depended on donor financing. The Bank loan is scheduled to close on November 30, 2012, the GFATM grant will close
                         by June 30, 2013 and USAID/PEPFAR program will end by 2014. Future donor financing is likely to decline. How to sustain the AIDS program and finance the next NSP is a major
                         challenge.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following agreements were reached during the MTR:

                         Supporting the development of New National AIDS Strategy (2012-2017). The World Bank will assist the government in developing the new NSP by providing (i) peer review of the
                         draft strategy; and (ii) technical assistance on costing of the strategy including identifying and mentoring a consultant to do the costing.

                         Supporting a study on the financial sustainability of the Jamaica's AIDS response. The Bank in collaboration with the UNAIDS Secretariat (Regional Support Team in Trinidad and
                         Tobago and the Country office in Kingston) will support the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) to carry out the sustainability study. UNAIDS will
                         prepare a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be signed by PIOJ, UNAIDS and the Bank. The MoU will articulate (i) the roles and responsibilities of each partner in the
                         undertaking of the study, and (ii) how Government ownership will be ensured and the sovereignty of GOJ respected when it comes to the sharing and use of data and information
                         emanating from the study. The World Bank will finalize the TOR for the international consultant and UNAIDS will prepare a TOR for a local consultant for the study.

                         Supporting Impact evaluation of MARP interventions. The Bank is willing to support the government to identify the knowledge gap in understanding MARP interventions and provide

                         MARPs. The MOH team will submit the impact evaluation proposal to the Bank when they prepare for an impact evaluation.
