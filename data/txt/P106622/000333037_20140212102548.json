the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            behavior change takes time, particularly in countries like\n            Jamaica with complex socio-cultural environments.\n            Consequently, it is important that the anticipated outcomes\n            recognize and take into account: (a) the time lag between\n            activities and results; (b) the potential challenges in\n            setting and achieving Project targets; (c) the inputs and\n            strategies needed to effect change; and (d) importantly,\n            emerging options such as the use of treatment as prevention.\n            During project preparation, the overall environment for\n            procurement should be assessed, and the design of\n            procurement arrangements should balance transparency and\n            accountability with effective implementation. For instance,\n            higher thresholds for requiring competitive bidding should\n            be considered, along with some relaxation or flexibility of\n            the need to obtain three quotations under the shopping\n            method should be considered. This is particularly critical\n            in small island states like Jamaica with limited numbers of\n            local vendors, and small quantities, which make bidding\n            unattractive to external vendors. In addition, the weak\n            capacity, particularly in procurement could have been\n            addressed through more hand holding and training to prevent\n            some delays."}, "docdt": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
