                                  PROJECT PAPER

  A. SUMMARY

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director to introduce three
changes in the Legal Agreement for the Jamaica Second HIV/AIDS Project (the Project)
(Loan No. IBRD 7556). The proposed changes are to (a) reallocate funds among Project
Disbursement Categories; (b) extend the Project Closing Date for four months from
November 30, 2012 to March 31, 2013; and (c) provide a four months Grace Period for
the Project. The proposed changes will allow the Project to complete the activities that
started late due to delayed budget allocation because of the negative impact of the global
economic down-turn on the Government’s budget. The reallocation will take into account
the actual costs and future needs of Project implementation and the four month Grace
Period will allow the project to complete payments after the Project closing. The
proposed changes will not change the development objectives or the associated outcome
targets.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

2.     The US$10 million Loan Agreement for the Jamaica Second AIDS Project was
signed on June 10, 2008 and became effective on September 23, 2008. The Project is a
follow-on project to the Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, which was
successfully completed on May 31, 2008. The Government sought the Bank’s support to
finance the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan for the period 2007-
2012, which is also supported by the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
(GF) and other partners. The Project has successfully supported the implementation of
the 2007-2012 National HIV Program (NHP). Increased access to HIV testing and
expansion of ART treatment have resulted in a reduction of mother to child transmission
and AIDS related mortality. The NHP has made significant progress in reaching most at
risk population such as commercial sex workers (CSWs). The percent of CSWs reporting
condom use with their most recent client has reached 97 percent, and 75 percent of CSWs
who received HIV testing in the last 12 months know their results, surpassing the 50
percent target. The Project has built capacity at the national and regional levels for
implementing the NHP.

3.      The global financial crisis affected the availability of resources for implementing
the Project. To fulfill the requirements/conditions of the GF Grant, the Government used
the World Bank loan as the Government’s counterpart financing for the Global Fund
grants to finance some staffing cost of the NHP. Therefore, there was no funding
allocated for implementing biomedical waste management under Component 4 of the
Project. The funding situation improved after 2010. As a result, the implementation as
well as disbursement was behind schedule. As of October 15, 2012, US$7.09 million
(71%) of the Loan has been disbursed.


                                            5
Overall, the Project is performing well and the Project objectives are achievable.
However, the Project is scheduled to close on November 30, 2012 and it still has
USS2.91 million undisbursed.

  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

4.     In the letter dated on August 23, 2012, the Government requested to reallocate
funds among Expenditure Categories and extend the Project Closing Date by four
months.

5.      Need for Reallocation of Loan Proceeds. The Loan Proceeds need to be
reallocated to reflect the actual costs of activities supported by the Project. Because the
World Bank loan is used as the Government’s counterpart fund for the GF Grants to pay
for staffing cost, the Project has used more funds under Disbursement Category 3 under
Part 3 of the Project. The proposed reallocation is in Table 1 below and the revised Loan
proceeds allocation is presented in Annex 1.

 Disbursement Category     Original        Actual      Balance Proposed        Amount to be

                                           31, 2012
 Category 1                3,248           2,052       1,196     2,714         (535)
 Category 2                1,736           1,198       538       1,647         (89)
 Category 3                3,046           3,651       (605)     4,562         1,517
 Category 4                1,945           19          1,926     1,052         (893)
 Front-End Fee             25              25          0         25
 Total                     10,000          6,945       3,055     10,000        0

6.     The reallocation will not affect the implementation of the Project and
achievement of the Project objectives as Project activities are supported by other funding
sources.

7.      Extension of the Project Closing Date. The Government requested to extend the
Project closing date from November 30, 2012 to March 31, 2013, for the Project to
complete two major tasks: the expansion of the Southeast Medical Waste Management
Facility (MWMF) and the renovation of the Portland Health Center (PHC). The
installation of the major equipment for the MWMF has already completed and the
expansion will be completed by December 2012 and the renovation of the PHC is
progressing well and will be completed by January 2013. Additional time will also allow
the Government to prepare for the transition from the Bank financing to Government
financing of the NHP; and salaries of the Project staff will be paid by the Government
starting April 1, 2013, the beginning of the Government’s new fiscal year. The
Government is confident that with a four-month extension, the loan funds will be fully
utilized. This will be the first and only extension for this Project.




                                             6
8.     The Government has prepared a specific action plan to be implemented within the
extension period (Annex 2). The performance of the Ministry of Health and other
implementing agencies is satisfactory. There is no outstanding audit under the Project.

9.      Extension of the Project Grace Period. The Disbursement Deadline Date
included in the Project’s Disbursement Letter is January 31, 2013, two months after the
Project Closing Date. Considering the time needed to process small payments at the
different levels with many implementing agencies, the Grace Period will be extended
from two months to four months (April 1, 2013 to July 31, 2013).
