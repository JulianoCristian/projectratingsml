The changes are all\n            related to the results framework: (a) replacing four project\n            development objective (PDO) indicators with three indicators\n            that are more appropriate for measuring the project's\n            achievements; and (b) revising component output and results\n            indicators by adding four new indicators, removing six\n            indicators, and refining indicators and targets based on\n            data availability and the appropriateness of the indicators\n            in tracking project progress. The revised PDO indicators are\n            better linked to the priority areas of the project:\n            promoting condom use among the youth, prevention of\n            mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and reducing stigma\n            and discrimination. The changes will not affect the original\n            PDOs or the project design. The revised indicators will\n            allow for more accurate measurement of the project's\n            progress and impact."}, "docdt": "2009-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
