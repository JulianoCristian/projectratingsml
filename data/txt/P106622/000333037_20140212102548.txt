1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.      Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean, with a population of
2.7 million. During the past three decades, Jamaica has continued to face significant
challenges: low growth, high debt, crime and violence; and high vulnerability to
exogenous shocks and natural disasters. These factors have contributed to economic
stagnation and volatility.

2.     At appraisal in 2008, AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STI) were the
second leading cause of death among the 15-24 year age group. It was estimated that
25,000 (1.5 percent) adults aged 15-49 years were infected with HIV, with the
majority (65 percent) of reported AIDS cases falling within the 20-44 year age group.
Jamaica displayed features of both a generalized and concentrated HIV epidemic.
Heterosexual transmission was reported by 90 percent of persons with HIV. The
prevalence varied across population groups, with a high prevalence among men who
have sex with men (MSM, 20-30 percent), commercial sex workers (CSW, 9
percent), STI clinic attendees (4.6 percent) in 2005; and prisoners (3.3 percent) in
2006.

3.     A complicated and intertwined set of cultural, economic, social, and
behavioral factors was identified as driving the epidemic: risky behaviors such as
multiple partners, participation in commercial and transactional sex, and failure to use
condoms with non-regular partners; early initiation of sexual activity; gender inequity
and gender roles; poverty; and stigma and discrimination, which negatively affected
appropriate health-seeking behaviors.

4.      The national response was guided by a series of medium-term HIV/AIDS
strategic plans, the 2002-2006 HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan (NSP), and the
2007-2012 NSP. The NSP identified four priority areas: (a) improved access to
quality prevention services; (b) comprehensive treatment, care and support services;
(c) enabling environment and human rights; and (d) empowerment and governance.
The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) estimated that a substantial increase in funding
would be needed to scale up the National HIV/AIDS Program (NHP) to finance the
implementation of the NSP. As such, the GOJ sought to increase domestic resources
to address the epidemic, as well as complimentary resources from external partners
including the World Bank (WB).

5.     This Project was a follow-on project to the Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention and
Control Project (P074641, Loan No. IBRD-71120), which was successfully
completed on May 31, 2008. As such, it built upon the support provided under the
first WB financed operation. The Bank’s comparative advantage rested in its
accumulated technical expertise in the implementation of HIV/AIDS projects both in
the Caribbean, and across the world. The Project was aligned with the FY2006-2009
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report #31830-JM), which itself was aligned



                                           1
with the Government’s Medium-term Socio-economic Policy framework for 2004-
2009, which stressed the threat of HIV/AIDS to the country's development prospects.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.     The Project Development Objectives (PDO) were to assist in the
implementation of the Government’s national HIV/AIDS program through support to:
(a) deepening of prevention interventions targeted at most at risk populations and for
the general population; (b) increasing of access to treatment, care and support
services for infected and affected individuals; (c) strengthening of program
management and analysis to identify priorities for strengthening the health sector
capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other priority health problems.

7.      The Project’s original indicators included four outcome indicators (OIs), and
nineteen intermediate outcome indicators (IOIs). The OIs related to the PDO, as
defined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were: (a) % of CSWs who are HIV
infected; (b) % of MSM who are HIV infected; (c) number of men, women &
children with advanced HIV receiving antiretroviral combination therapy according
to national guidelines; and (d) number of institutions adopting policies to address HIV.

1.3    Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

8.      The Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Vice Presidency approved
second order restructuring of the Project on May 22, 2009. Restructuring involved
changes to the Results Framework (R/F) to make the indicators more realistic and
reflective of new knowledge and information (arising from a 2008 National
Knowledge, Attitudes, Behavior and Practices (KABP) survey and a 2007 MSM
survey), and better aligned with national priorities. One change involved replacing the
four original OIs with three new OIs which were deemed to be more appropriate for
measuring the Project’s achievements. The new OIs were: (a) % of young people
aged 15-24 reporting the use of a condom the last time they had sex with a non-
regular sexual partner; (b) % of infants born to HIV infected mothers who are HIV
infected; and (c) % of people expressing accepting attitudes towards PLWHA, of all
people surveyed aged 15-49. In addition, four new IOI were added, six IOIs were
removed, and a number of indicators and targets were refined based on data
availability, and the appropriateness of the indicators in reflecting the reality of the
epidemic and in tracking Project progress.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

9.     Project beneficiaries included: (a) most at-risk populations (MARP) - with an
emphasis on CSW, MSM, in and out of school youth, prison inmates, and drug users-
who would benefit from targeted interventions; (b) persons living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWHA) who would benefit from better access to treatment, care and support
interventions, and efforts to develop an enabling environment; and (c) the entire
population in Jamaica who would benefit from, inter alia, improved prevention
services.

                                           2
1.5    Original Components

10.    The Project had four components (detailed description of project components
in Annex 2).

1.6    Revised Components

11.    No changes were made to Project components or proposed activities.

1.7    Other significant changes

12.     In addition to the first restructuring in May 2009 (Section 1.3), a second
Project restructuring was approved by the Country Director on September 24, 2012,
to provide the Project with the additional time needed to complete activities that had
been delayed due to the negative impact of the global economic down-turn on the
Government’s counterpart funding. Approved changes involved: (a) reallocating
funds among project categories of expenditures to reflect the actual costs of activities
supported by the Project; (b) extending the Closing Date by four months to March 31,
2013; and (c) extending the grace period from two to four months.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.     The background analysis for this Project was sufficient. This follow-on
Project was prepared as part of the GOJ’s emergency response to HIV/AIDS, and in
support of the financing gap needed to implement the NSP. The Government was
committed to meeting the Millennium Development Goals, with HIV/AIDS one of
the high priorities in the country’s development agenda. The NSP was developed in a
participatory manner based on consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, and
included cost-effective interventions in priority areas: prevention; treatment, care and
support; enabling environment and human rights; and empowerment and governance.

14. Project Preparation and Design. The Project was prepared in approximately
eight months. There were no conditions of effectiveness. The Project design built
upon the lessons learned from the previous project, and took into account the
priorities identified in the NSP. The Project design recognized that there was no
proven "production function" to respond to HIV/AIDS in a complex epidemic such as
the one in Jamaica. As such, the importance of research and M&E were considered
critical in identifying the areas driving the epidemic, and the effectiveness (or not) of
interventions, to continuously adjust the program to the changing nature of the
epidemic.

15.     Lessons reflected in the Project design. The Project design benefitted from a
number of lessons learned from implementing the previous Bank-financed project, as
well as from other Bank and donor financed projects throughout the Caribbean. These
included: (a) the need to improve the strategic focus of prevention activities, by
ensuring that behavior change efforts are skillfully designed to respond to the

                                           3
complex socio-economic factors driving the epidemic; (b) the importance of TA in
supporting efforts to foster an enabling environment, legal and regulatory reforms,
and policy advocacy; and (c) the importance of a multi-sectoral response involving a
cross-cutting range of stakeholders.

16.    Lending Instrument. The lending instrument was a Specific Investment
Lending (SIL) of US$10M with co-financing of US$1.54M from the Government. By
Project closing, actual counterpart funding was US$2.24M, or approximately 145
percent of the appraised amount.

17.     Assessment of risks and their mitigation. At appraisal, important risks were
identified, with the overall risk rating assessed as Moderate. The risk mitigation
measures were generally adequate as reflected in the design. Two key risks, however,
and their corresponding mitigation measures were not identified: (a) insufficient
counterpart funds, despite the fact that Jamaica had persistent issues with budget
deficits and a major fiscal space constraint; and (b) the socio-cultural environment,
which posed a persistent challenge in reaching MARP, in particular MSM.

2.2    Implementation

18.    The Loan Agreement for the Project was signed on June 10, 2008, and
became effective on September 23, 2008. Project implementation benefitted from the
capacity built during the first HIV/AIDS Project, including a competent management
team. As such, Project implementation commenced in April 2008 - in advance of both
Project signing and effectiveness - due to retroactive financing. In addition, Project
funds were pooled with other donor funds managed by the NHP, configuring a Sector
Wide Approach (SWAp). This approach was never formalized in Bank documents,
but was crucial to a coordinated and programmatic response to the epidemic.
Notwithstanding achievements, a summary of implementation challenges is outlined
below.

 •    The global financial crisis substantially affected the availability of
      resources for implementing the NHP. In particular, the budget allocated to the
      NHP was reduced from approximately US$4.98M in 2009 to US$1.46M in
      2010. Consequently, the GOJ used the Bank loan as its counterpart funding to
      meet an agreed condition of the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria
      (GFATM) grant. The project funding was mainly used to support staffing cost
      to implement the activities under the NHP financed by the Global Fund. There
      was no funding allocated to implement the activities planned under Component
      4 until 2011, when the funding situation improved, and the GOJ actually
      allocated additional funds to allow the Project to catch up with the delayed
      activities. Even though the Bank disbursement was low in the first few years of
      project implementation, the ISR ratings were based on the overall progress
      made under the NHP, which the project supported.
 •    At the individual level, it can be inferred from global evidence that the
      global financial crisis also led to, and exacerbated risky behaviors. The
      available data indicated an increase in transactional sex; informal/ multiple


                                          4
        partnerships and reduced condom use by both men and women during the
        economic downturn from 2008 to 2012. This finding is consistent with the
        findings from a number of studies on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan
        Africa, which show that poverty and income shocks negatively influence sexual
        behaviors. 1 Seeking financial and social security under an economic hardship
        could drive up risky behaviors.
    •   Stigma and discrimination continued to be a challenge - as it was under the
        first operation - despite the scaling up of prevention interventions. Despite
        efforts such as the revision of the National Workplace Policy, as well as other
        initiatives in some Ministries, key populations at higher risk for HIV continue to
        face stigma and discrimination.
    •   Development of an enabling environment was challenged by a number of
        factors, including: (a) limited support from the high level Officers of the Court,
        barriers to the proposed legislative amendment, and inadequate interest by
        legislators; and (b) the sensitization period required to gain the support of newly
        appointed Permanent Secretaries.
    •   Limited capacity. While the implementation capacity of the NHP was
        strengthened under the first project, this changed during implementation of this
        project, with the turnover of almost all key Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
        staff members mainly due to the unforeseen future of the Project. The
        Government considered cancelling the Project several times as a means of
        reducing expenditure and the debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio. This
        turnover led to a gap in both knowledge and institutional memory, and had a
        negative impact on implementation. In addition, relatively weak capacity at the
        regional and community levels proved to be a major concern, although this
        situation was partially addressed through the recruitment of procurement and
        financial management specialists in the four RHAs.

19.    Due to initial delays in the Government budget allocation for Project
implementation, a mid-term review (MTR) of the Project was conducted in May 2011,
when the Project had disbursed US$4.5M, or 45 percent of the loan. The MTR was
conducted jointly with development partners, and included a review of the Jamaica
National HIV/STI Program. Prior to the MTR, several assessments on the
performance of the National HIV/STI Program and the Bank-supported Project were
conducted. The overall conclusion of the MTR was that while significant
achievements had been made, AIDS remained a major threat in Jamaica, with the
sustainability of efforts in prevention and treatment of AIDS, particularly among key
populations, persisting as a challenge. The project performance further improved after
the MTR.

20.     The Bank provided important technical assistance to Jamaica under this
Project. The Bank assisted Jamaica in developing new NSP 2012-2017. The Bank
conducted jointly with the GOJ and UNAIDS an important study on the sustainability
of the National HIV Response. The study results have helped the GOJ prepare a

                                                5
sustainability plan for its National Response. The study has also served as a model for
Caribbean countries for strengthening the sustainability of their national HIV
responses.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
        Utilization

21.     Design. By Project appraisal, the HIV/AIDS M&E system was well
developed. 2 Most of the indicators in the results framework were drawn from the
country's national M&E plan, which also served as the basis for the country's regular
reporting to the United Nation General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS
every two years. However, the targets for a number of indicators had already been
achieved; some targets were unrealistic; some indicators could not be tracked due to
the absence of an appropriate data collection instrument; and a number of baseline
and target indicators related to MSM were not defined. Consequently, discussions on
revising the results framework were initiated during the first supervision mission in
Sept 2008. The revised indicators were deemed to be: (a) more appropriate for
attributing the Project’s achievements; (b) consistent with global knowledge on
monitoring the epidemic at the Project-level; and (c) better linked to the priority areas
of the Project. That said, the prevention outcome indicators (OIs #1 and #3) remained
overly ambitious, as at the time it was not possible to anticipate the significant impact
of the financial crisis in both maintaining gains achieved under the previous project,
and in influencing further change. Also, as Project implementation later evolved into
a SWAp Approach, there was an associated emphasis in monitoring programmatic
NHP indicators.

22.     Implementation and Utilization. Guided by the M&E Plan, the M&E system
collected data and produced information to support and guide the national HIV/AIDS
response. The results from the 2008 KABP, and 2007 MSM and 2008 CSW surveys,
were used to develop targeted interventions to reach a higher percentage of key
populations at higher risk for HIV. 3 Specific achievements in the area of HIV/AIDS
M&E under the Project include: (a) development of the HIV M&E Plan 2012-2017
(which underpins the NSP) through an extensive participatory process; (b) support to
making the HIV/AIDS M&E database web-based to allow direct inputting of data and
reports electronically by key actors; (c) strengthening of the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) at the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL); (d) M&E capacity
building for staff from each RHA, CSOs, Government ministries and the NHP, as
well as pharmacies and treatment sites; and (e) increased operational research to
guide program management and implementation.



2
  (a) an HIV/AIDS tracking system had been established since 1989; (b) ANC/STI clinic attendees
sentinel surveillance and second generation surveillance on SW were being carried out routinely, along
with nationally representative surveys to obtain information on subgroups such as SW and MSM; and,
(c) national KABP surveys were conducted every 4 years to monitor progress.
3
  The term MARP has been recently replaced by “key populations at higher risk for HIV”. This term is
considered to be more politically correct by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.

                                                  6
23.    Notwithstanding achievements, there were also a number of challenges:

 •    Data collection and dissemination. Disaggregated data on some key indicators
      remained unavailable, limiting understanding of access to services by key
      populations at higher risk for HIV and the general population. In addition, gaps
      in collecting data from private health care professionals remained, along with ad
      hoc dissemination of data. Published data was often limited to surveillance data.
 •    Databases. Interrupted power supply, inadequate human resources, and both
      limited buy-in by stakeholders and non-linkage of many HIV related databases,
      limited the usefulness of databases, and reduced the accuracy of data captured.
      Also, having purchased the licensing rights to implement the LIS nationwide,
      funds to train and equip staff were not available.
 •    Limited capacity. Lack of capacity among key implementing agencies at sub-
      national levels to use available data for decision-making.
 •    Partnerships. A lack of clarity about the services and deliverables expected
      from the NHP at the national level, coupled with limited coordination of M&E
      training between the M&E Unit of the NHP, and other training entities.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

24.     Safeguards. The Project triggered OP/BP/GP 4.01 - Environmental
Assessment - due to additional biomedical waste that would be generated from
activities supported by the Project. The Government's Environmental Impact
Assessment for the Southeastern Regional Medical (infectious) Waste Treatment
Facility, which was publicly disclosed in Jamaica on September 13, 2007, was
reviewed and considered valid for purposes of Project appraisal, and along with this,
specific areas for strengthening biomedical waste were also identified. These
included: training of health care workers on the handling of medical waste; support
for drafting a new National Medical Waste Management Regulation; and upgrading
regional medical waste collection systems and treatment facilities. Compliance to
safeguards was consistently rated Satisfactory in Project Implementation Status
Reports (ISRs). Despite some delay in the expansion of the Biomedical Waste
Management Facility, all planned activities were successfully completed.

25.     Fiduciary Compliance. Financial Management (FM) was rated Moderately
Satisfactory at Project closing - and frequently during Project implementation - due to
delays in both documenting incurred Project expenditures and submitting withdrawal
applications, and in submitting Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) and audit reports.
Audit reports, however, were unqualified, and auditors found no material weaknesses
in the internal control arrangements of the Project, reflecting a favorable internal
control system in place for administration of Project funds. FM challenges faced by
the client, however, included: (a) a cumbersome payment process resulting from the
‘Structure of Government Contribution’ across components (for example, prevention
3 percent, treatment 5 percent) which required two checks for each purchase; and (b)
the ceiling of US$850,000 for ‘Outstanding Advance’ under the Designated Account
(DA), which proved somewhat restrictive during the economic recession, and
contributed to delays in Project implementation. Although the Project provided for

                                           7
the participation of the RHAs, for example, the funds from the DA could not be used
to provide advances to these implementing agencies. This caused delays in the
implementation of activities by the RHAs, and resulted in the GOJ providing cash
flows by way of warrants.

26.     Procurement. The handling of procurement was largely appropriate
throughout the implementation period, with proper application of all procurement
procedures. An independent review carried out in June 2013 found no major
deviations, or indications of fraud and corruption. Procurement plans, however, were
not updated on a regular basis, and unlike the careful handling of consultant and
larger International Competitive Bidding and National Competitive Bidding packages,
filing for small procurement was found to be non-existent in the procurement unit. In
addition, delays in planning made it impossible to finalize some critical procurement
and hence commit the full loan amount. On this basis, the independent review
conducted at the end of the project rated Project procurement processing as
Moderately Satisfactory.

27.     The client raised a number of procurement issues throughout implementation:
(a) the difficulties in obtaining three quotations under the shopping method; (b) the
low thresholds for prior review for direct contracting and sole sourcing; and (c)
concern that the Bank did not have the in-house technical expertise to clear the
technical specifications for planned procurement on biomedical waste management,
resulting in delays.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

28.     In an environment with limited fiscal space, the Government has focused on
improving the overall efficiency of the program, and the cost-effectiveness of
interventions. In this regard, one major change has been the integration (approved in
March 2013) of the NHP into the National Family Planning Board (NFPB) to form
one statutory body. The overall goal of this integration is to strengthen the link
between family planning, HIV/STI and sexual and reproductive health, and to
maximize coverage and health outcomes for the population, while optimizing the use
of scarce resources. In addition, the expectation is that this new structure should
improve the capacity of the NHP to attract grant funding and international
development assistance, as it provides a more optimal governance framework within
which Projects can be financed and monitored. There is no follow-on World Bank
health operation, although a Development Policy Lending Program is under
preparation, which includes a health sector policy trigger on improving health
financing, which could positively affect HIV/AIDS financing in the future. The
GFATM is continuing to finance the Jamaica’s HIV/STI program during the
transitional period from mainly donor financing to domestic financing.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

29.     The PDOs were and remain highly relevant and consistent with
Jamaica’s priority to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Project was and remains
consistent with the global commitment to fight the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic;
the Bank, country and sectoral assistance strategies; and the NSP. As previously
noted, the Project design was guided by strategic and cost-effective priorities
identified in the NSP. These priorities remain relevant today. On this basis, the
relevance of objectives is rated High.

30.     Project components, organization and the M&E design were reflected in
the PDO. The design of this Project built on support provided under the previous
Bank-funded Project, and contributed to the GOJ’s NHP by supporting: prevention
programs targeting key populations at higher risk for HIV and the general population;
and strengthening treatment, care and support and the country's multi-sectoral
capacity to respond to the epidemic. Notably, the Project design included
interventions not covered by GFATM funding, and complemented initiatives
supported by other bilateral donors and UN agencies. In this regard, Bank funding -
and the Project design - was harmonized with other ongoing efforts, and prioritized an
overall coordinated response to the epidemic.

31.     Project implementation was relevant, and in line with the PDO. As previously
noted, the Project moved towards a SWAp. The informal SWAp arrangement
assisted the GOJ in coping with budgetary constraints and allowed the Government to
meet the GFATM counterpart funding requirement to obtain a US$48 million grant to
implement the NHP. The implementation of the NHP has been successful and many
of its programmatic indicators were achieved. The GFATM has rated the Jamaica
NHP very highly. On this basis, Project design and implementation is rated as
Substantial. Consequently, given high relevance of objectives, overall relevance is
rated as Substantial.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

32.     The Jamaica HIV/AIDS response has resulted in a number of significant
achievements. It is clear that this Project contributed to these achievements,
particularly given the above mentioned SWAp approach. 4 An assessment of Project
efficacy will review achievements under each of the individual PDOs in turn. A list of
outputs by component is provided in Annex 2.




4
 In monetary terms, the GFATM supplied the greatest financial assistance for Jamaica’s HIV/AIDS
program over the period 2008 - 2013, contributing US$34.28m of the US$47.59m or approximately
72% of the expenditure. The World Bank was the second highest contributor, followed by USAID.

PDO #1: Deepening of prevention interventions targeted at high risk groups and
for the general population

33.      An estimated 27.5 percent of the loan amount was used to support prevention
interventions, which represented an estimated 14% of funds going towards prevention
activities in the NHP, with two of the Project’s three OIs linked to prevention
activities. Both OIs were not achieved, and some results were below the baselines: the
percentage of young people aged 15-24 reporting the use of a condom the last time
they had sex with a non-regular sexual partner (OI#1), and the percentage of people
expressing accepting attitudes towards PLWHA, of all people surveyed aged 15-49
(OI#3).

34.     As discussed earlier the reduction in using condoms and an increase in
transactional sex among young women are closely related to the difficult economic
environment in Jamaica, over which the project had no control. The indicator related
to attitudes towards PLWHA was a composite indictor with many dimensions.
Progress was made in the areas of willingness of caring for PLWHA and allowing
them to work, but not in the area of accepting PLWHA to handle food.

35.    There was progress made towards achieving PDO#1 under the NHP, which
the Project supported. The adult HIV prevalence rate has been maintained at less
than 2 percent since the mid-1990s. Reductions in prevalence have also been
accompanied by a reported decline in the number of new infections by 25 percent
(Figures 1 and 2). HIV prevalence among female sex workers was reduced from 9%
in 2005 to 4.1% in 2011. These were considered important accomplishments in the
context of a severe financial crisis.

36.     Improvements in HIV prevalence and incidence have been influenced by a
number of key activities supported under the NHP. Specifically, HIV testing has been
significantly scaled-up, and there has been significant outreach to key populations at
higher risk for HIV and the general population. Significant efforts were taken to
develop a multi-sectoral response through the formation of partnerships with select
line and non-line Ministries.

37.    Achievement of this PDO was also measured through 6 IOIs: 4 were achieved
and surpassed their targets and 2 were partially achieved. Based on this, and the
foregoing discussion, achievement of this PDO is rated Modest.

PDO #2: Increasing of access to treatment, care and support services for infected
and affected individuals

38.     An estimated 15.6 percent of the loan amount was used to support treatment,
care and support services, 5 with one of the Project’s three OIs - which was achieved/
surpassed - linked to this PDO: the percentage of infants born to HIV infected
mothers, who are HIV infected (OI#2). This indicator was reduced by 86 percent, and
represents a significant achievement under the NHP and Project. Vertical
transmission of HIV has been less than 5 percent for the past five years, down from a
high of over 10 percent a decade ago. Specifically, the Project contributed to the
success of the PMTCT Programme by training a wide cross-section of health care
workers in PMTCT, and making alternative nutrition available for HIV-exposed
infants for the first six months of life. Notably, Jamaica has also achieved the
elimination of vertical transmission of syphilis as defined by having three consecutive
years of less than 0.5 cases per 1000 live births (2008 – 2010). As such, Jamaica
appears to be well positioned to achieve the regional target of elimination of MTCT
of HIV and congenital syphilis by 2015. Considering these significant achievements,
as well as full attainment of targets for 3 of the 4 IOIs as discussed below,
achievement of this PDO is rated Substantial.

39.      Two treatment indicators: number of men, women & children with advanced
HIV receiving ACT according to national guidelines (IOI#8) surpassed the target by
1,469; and the % of HIV positive pregnant women receiving a complete course of
ARV prophylaxis to reduce the risk of MTCT (IOI#9) achieved its target. 6 The one
care and support indicator: the % of ANC clients that are counseled and tested for
HIV (IOI#10) was also achieved, and was estimated to be over 95 percent at Project
closing. This is another significant achievement under the NHP and this Project. The
indicator percentage of adults & children with HIV still alive 12 months after
initiation of ART (IOI#7) improved by only 0.6 percent.

PDO #3: Strengthening of program management and analysis to identify
priorities for strengthening the health sector capacity to respond to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic and other priority health problems




5
  This represented an estimated 8% of funds going towards treatment, care and support activities in the
NHP.
6
   Achievement of these indicators benefitted from close harmonization and coordination between
GFATM and WB funds For example, while access to ARVs was made possible through the financial
support of the GFATM, this project facilitated, inter alia, the purchase of drugs for the treatment of
Opportunistic Infections and STIs, as well as nutritional supplements to promote ARV medication
adherence, and assist PLWHA who were economically marginalized.

                                                  11
40.    This PDO spanned Components 3 and 4 of the Project - “Strengthening
Institutional Capacity for Legislative Reform, Policy Formulation, Program
Management, Monitoring and Evaluation” and “Health Sector Development
Support”. An estimated 53.1 percent of the loan amount was used to support
achievement of this PDO. Considering significant institutional strengthening under
this PDO, both for the NHP and the health system as a whole, achievement is rated as
Substantial. Specifically, institutional strengthening occurred in the following key
areas:

 (a) Policy Formulation. There were notable achievements towards developing an
     enabling environment through the formulation, reform and introduction of a
     number of policies, position papers, and technical reports. These included: (i)
     preparation of a draft cabinet submission for the amendment of the Public
     Health Order (Notifiable Diseases) supported by a technical report on the
     proposed amendments; (ii) Adoption of the National HIV Workplace Policy as a
     Green Paper by Parliament in February 2010; (iii) Revision of the National
     Workplace Policy on HIV and AIDS in May 2012; (iv) presentation of a
     position paper with recommendations, outlining the proposed amendment to the
     Nurses and Midwives Act, to the Nursing Council of Jamaica on behalf the
     NHP; and (v) revamping the national HIV-related discrimination reporting and
     redress system.

 (b) National Public Health Laboratory and TB Laboratory. Capacity building
     (for example, hiring of essential staff members such as laboratory technical
     assistants), infrastructure, supplies and equipment were all provided to the
     NPHL and the TB Laboratory.

 (c) Waste management. While the original plan was to build a second Biomedical
     Waste Management facility, a decision was made in 2011, in response to the
     financial crisis, to expand the existing plant - with upgraded treatment, storage
     and transportation capacity - rather than build a new one (IOI#14). This
     upgraded facility can handle approximately 83 percent of the infectious waste
     generated by public health care facilities across the island, and is currently
     implementing environmental management and monitoring plans, in line with
     national guidelines (IOI#15).

 (d) HIV Program Management. As discussed in Section 2.3, significant support
     has been provided for HIV/AIDS M&E. This has been critical in both
     developing a strong evidence-based approach that complies with local, regional
     and international guidelines to inform the local response; and in paving the way
     for an efficient and sustainable response to HIV.

41.    In addition to the two IOIs noted above, this PDO was also measured by an
additional four IOIs. Three of these were fully achieved. One (additional) significant
achievement under the Project has been an increase to 100 percent of the cases that
are reviewed and referred to the relevant redress bodies with detailed
recommendations for redress (IOI#11). This surpassed the target of 70 percent. In

                                         12
addition, the percentage of institutions/organizations reached adopting HIV/AIDS
policies (IOI#12) improved well-beyond its target of 93 percent, to 105 percent due to
an additional 11 institutions/organizations being identified and targeted. A third IOI
(#16) - Assessment of Health sector obstacles to [the] delivery of quality care - was
completed, although through non-Project. The Bank did take a lead in supporting
analytical work on the sustainability of Jamaica’s HIV/AIDS response. The one IOI
which was not achieved is the Completion of computerization for Regional Labs
(IOI#13). While the target was 3, no labs were computerized because of a delay in
permission from the GOJ to use funds for this activity - given concerns regarding the
tight macroeconomic environment - and at a much later stage, challenges with
procurement.

42.   Given “Modest” rating for PDO#1 and Substantial achievement on other two
PDOs, overall Project efficacy is rated as Substantial.

3.3    Efficiency

43.    By Project closing, approximately 96.5 percent of the loan had been disbursed.

44.     The Project (and in effect the NHP) adopted a comprehensive approach
involving funding for prevention interventions targeting both the key and the general
populations, in addition to scaling up of treatment, care and support services. This
approach maximized the number of infections averted and the number of Disability
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) saved. Specifically, Project interventions focused on
selected internationally recognized cost-effective interventions for implementing the
NSP, which were based on the drivers of the epidemic: STI management,
interventions for key populations at higher risk for HIV, VCT, PMTCT, and ARV
treatment. Although it is not possible to assess allocative efficiency of the NHP, and
the Project, due to a lack of information on the financing, costing and outputs of the
NHP, it is clear that Project interventions were technically sound, and made a
significant contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS. For example, there was a
significant emphasis on prevention activities (Figures 1 and 2), which result in
quantifiable benefits of averted productivity losses and savings on in-patient care and
on treatment of opportunistic illnesses.

45.     In addition to this, significant attention was placed on strengthening the multi-
sectoral approach through partnerships with a cross-cutting range of stakeholders, as
well as decreasing stigma and discrimination through interventions such as the
development of an enabling environment, and outreach to both key populations at
higher risk for HIV and the general population. Notably, the efficiency of this
outreach was improved by promoting, inter alia, community interventions, workplace
interventions, and VCT which target the general population while simultaneously
allowing for the multiplier effect of prevention among key populations at higher risk
for HIV. Approximately 18.9% of total expenditures on the prevention component
were spent on MSM in 2011-12, up from 2.31% in 2009-10 and 7.89% 2010-2011.
Meanwhile, expenditure on CSW and youth showed a decline of 61% (from 3.50% to
1.38%) and 8.4% (from 10.65% to 9.76%) respectively between 2011-12 and 2010-

                                           13
11. This decline can be regarded as an efficient use of resources since given
challenges in reaching MSM, but successes among CSW, a deliberate decision was
made to increase resources focused on MSM, at the expense of CSW. Expenditures
across categories for the Prevention Unit are shown in Table 3.2, Annex 3.

46.     The efficiency of the treatment component of the Project can be quantified in
terms of cost effectiveness, based on a death averted due to treatment and care. At a
programmatic level, treatment has expanded from approximately 3,000 adults and
children on treatment in 2007 to 10,469 by Dec 2012. At the end of 2012, 9,275
adults and children were started on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART).
Over a similar period (2008 – 2011), the number of deaths reported has been held
relatively constant (Figure 3.3, Annex 3). This is a significant achievement for the
program as these figures represent the lowest level of reported deaths since 1998, and
occur in the context of increased surveillance and greater case identification. Notably,
the expanded program covering ART was made possible through careful
harmonization and coordination between the Bank and GFATM. This donor
coordination optimized the planning cycle and reduced duplication in both planning
and implementation, and was a critical efficiency gain for the MOH, as it reduced the
transaction costs associated with managing different donor funded activities.

47.     Finally, one additional efficiency gain to the sector has been the integration of
the NHP into the NFPB to form one statutory body. This integration should help to
maximize coverage and health outcomes for the population, while optimizing the use
of scarce resources, and improving efficiency in the overall response to reproductive
health. In light of this discussion, overall Project efficiency is rated Substantial.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

48.    On the basis of the Substantial relevance, Substantial efficacy and
Substantial efficiency, the overall Project outcome is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

       (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

49.     There is consensus that HIV/AIDS contributes to the persistence of poverty as
it affects not only the stock, but also the accumulation of human capital. Also,
HIV/AIDS affects economic activity in a number of ways. Consequently, through
scaling up of prevention which averts infection, and treatment which averts death, the
Project has had a positive impact on poverty. In terms of gender issues, the
development of an enabling environment for women to make an informed choice, and
economic empowerment of women are critical issues in reducing the vulnerability of
women to HIV/AIDS. A significant reduction of HIV prevalence rate among female
sex workers from 9% in 2005 to 4.1% in 2011 indicated the impact of the NHP.



                                           14
       (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

50.      The Project supported activities which aimed to strengthen institutional
capacity in the areas of policy formulation, program management, and M&E. In
addition, the Project also: (a) expanded the capacity of line ministries, RHAs (for
example, in the areas of financial management and procurement), and non-state
actors; and (b) supported the development of broad ownership and strong institutional
coordination mechanisms for an expanded response, which included the involvement
of all relevant key stakeholders.

       (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

51.    This Project played a key role in helping the GOJ leverage additional donor
funds. This included US$44.2M from the GFATM, and US$26M from
USAID/PEPFAR. Based on the sustainability study conducted by the Bank in
collaboration with the GOJ and UNAIDS, GFATM has provided an additional grant
of approximately US$2M to Jamaica to assist with the transitional period from
external to domestic financing.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
       Workshops
       N/A

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
       Rating: Significant

52.     Particularly in the last year of Project implementation, there was a concerted
attempt to address sustainability issues, in an effort to reduce the risk to development
outcome. The following factors should contribute to the sustainability of
achievements: (a) continuing high level of Government commitment to the fight
against HIV/AIDS; (b) development of an enabling policy and legal environment,
with strong political support and leadership for dealing with HIV/AIDS; (c)
development of broad ownership and strong institutional coordination mechanisms
for an expanded response; and (d) conversion of a number of NHP positions into
permanent established posts to create an institutionalized and sustainable core group
of professionals to implement the NHP.

53.     In spite of these measures, however, the risk to development outcome remains
substantial. First, despite significant achievements, AIDS remains as a major threat to
overall economic development in Jamaica. Secondly, this environment has been
further challenged by the increasing cost of treatment, coupled with reductions in
external financing. However, despite a severely constrained fiscal space, Jamaica is
paying more of its HIV cost as donors withdraw support (Annex 3). Given limited
budget allocations, there is both an operational risk that the country will not be able to
sustain the momentum built by the Program; and a technical risk that the country will
not be able to further develop and maintain an institutionalized and sustainable core

group of professionals to implement the NHP. Finally, stigma and discrimination
remains high, and continues to affect both adherence to care, and risk taking behavior.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

       (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

54.     As a follow-on health operation, this Project was prepared in a short time
period; built upon the successes and lessons learned from the previous health project;
was strongly grounded in the NSP; and in line with the Bank’s accumulated technical
expertise in the implementation of HIV/AIDS projects both in the Caribbean, and
across the world. To ensure that there were no gaps in financing, the Project
retroactively financed eligible expenditures up to an aggregate amount of US$1.3M.
Important risks were identified and the risk mitigation measures were generally
adequate. However, two challenges which had a significant impact on the pace of
implementation, and which were not identified as risks in the PAD, were: insufficient
counterpart funding; and the socio-cultural environment which posed a persistent
challenge in reaching key populations at higher risk for HIV.

       (b) Quality of Supervision
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

55.     Supervision missions were regular, and sought to proactively identify
implementation challenges and issues requiring follow-up. In addition, the ISRs were
clear, action-oriented, and candid, and sought advice and support, when necessary, to
assist the client with Project implementation. The proactivity of the Bank team is
clearly evident in a decision- shortly following Project effectiveness - to restructure
the Project. Also, as previously discussed, the team should be commended for their
efforts to support and encourage donor coordination, in the interest of an overall
harmonized HIV/AIDS response. Finally, as discussed in Section 2.4, FM and
procurement oversight and support by the Bank was considered to be generally
adequate. However, there was consensus from the client on the need for more support
in overcoming procurement-related difficulties, with an independent procurement
review noting that the Bank could have increased flexibility and the quality of the
procurement supervision. In addition to this, the Bank could have considered further
revising the prevention outcome indicators (as discussed in Section 2.3) to make these
more realistic particularly given the severity of the financial crisis to Jamaica.

       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

56.    Based on the above discussion, which show moderate shortcomings in Bank
performance in ensuring quality at entry and during supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

                                          16
5.2    Borrower Performance

       (a) Government Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.      The GOJ remains highly committed and supportive of the NHP and was very
supportive of the Project. Specifically, the Government has made significant strides in
the development of an enabling environment, and in particular, in trying to redress the
high levels of stigma and discrimination through a number of policy reforms and
consultations with key cross-cutting stakeholders. Although counterpart funding was
a problem for a significant period of time due to a reduction in the Project's budget
allocation by more than 60 percent (as a result of the economic crisis), it is important
to consider that by the Project closing, counterpart funding was approximately 145
percent of the appraised amount, and the Government kept the project even when it
was under pressure to reduce debt and provided additional funding for project
activities when its budget situation improved. In addition, at least 20 consultants were
integrated into the Government to create an institutionalized and sustainable core
group of professionals to implement the NHP. In parallel, and given reductions in
donor funding, the GOJ has been working to rapidly improve the efficiency and cost-
effectiveness of the response.

       (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.      This Project was implemented by the MOH through its departments and the
four decentralized RHAs; four key non-health line ministries and CSOs; and the
Jamaica Business Council. The MOH - and in particular, the PCU under the NHP-
coordinated activities, and provided technical and fiduciary support to implementing
entities, which were responsible for execution of Project activities. The PCU included
an experienced team of professionals that coordinated the technical and fiduciary
activities of the first HIV/AIDS project. They had been trained in World Bank
procedures and performed well under this Project. Notwithstanding good performance,
and overall achievements of the NHP, the performance of the Implementing Agency
(IA) is rated Moderately Satisfactory due to late planning on procurement-related
issues (due in part to the absence of an integrated information system and heavy
workloads of fiduciary staff); delays in the submission of IFRs and audit reports; and
some delays in submitting work plans and in updating procurement plans.

       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.    Given Moderately Satisfactory rating of Government Performance in
Ensuring Quality at Entry, and Moderately Satisfactory performance by the
implementing agency, overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.




                                          17
6.       Lessons Learned

60.     The following key lessons have been derived from the implementation of this
project. These are organized by thematic areas.

61.      Prevention. Behavior change takes time, particularly in countries like
Jamaica with complex socio-cultural environments. Consequently, it is important that
the anticipated outcomes recognize and take into account: (a) the time lag between
activities and results; (b) the potential challenges in setting and achieving Project
targets; (c) the inputs and strategies needed to effect change; and (d) importantly,
emerging options such as the use of treatment as prevention.

62.      National HIV/AIDS Program. A strong HIV/AIDS response involves a
number of critical inputs. Firstly, strong leadership at the highest governmental level
generates the most effective national responses to HIV, but must be accompanied by a
national strategic plan, which is technically sound, underpinned by epidemiological
and behavioral data, and adequately funded. Secondly, there is a need to ensure that
the response is inclusive and involves meaningful partnerships with all relevant actors
at the national and local levels. Finally, strong leadership at the national level is
critical in ensuring that donor funds are complimentary to, and harmonized with other
ongoing efforts, and prioritize an overall coordinated response to the epidemic.

63.      Operational. During Project preparation, the overall environment for
procurement should be assessed, and the design of procurement arrangements should
balance transparency and accountability with effective implementation. For instance,
higher thresholds for requiring competitive bidding should be considered, along with
some relaxation or flexibility of the need to obtain three quotations under the
shopping method should be considered. This is particularly critical in small island
states like Jamaica with limited numbers of local vendors, and small quantities, which
make bidding unattractive to external vendors. In addition, the weak capacity,
particularly in procurement could have been addressed through more hand holding
and training to prevent some delays.

64.     Sustainability. Given fierce competition for limited resources, it is critical
that a sustainability plan is developed early on during Project implementation, with
adequate stakeholder involvement to ensure ownership and “buy-in”. This plan
should be underpinned by: (a) an understanding of the epidemic and past HIV
programs; (b) an assessment of both allocative and technical efficiency; and (c) a
consideration of the merits of a vertical HIV/AIDS program vis-à-visa more
integrated and broader health systems approach. 7

  The Bank with support from GOJ and UNAIDS carried out a study on the financial sustainability of
the national HIV/AIDS response, which helped the government to develop a sustainability strategy
plan for the National HIV/AIDS response.

          Annex 2. Project Components and Outputs by Component

Description of Project Components

1.      Component 1: Prevention (appraisal estimate: US$3.34M). This
component aimed to scale-up prevention activities in support of efforts to halt and
reverse the spread of the epidemic. Various implementing entities were expected to
intensify their prevention activities: the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Regional
Health Authorities (RHAs), four non-health line ministries, Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) and the Jamaica Business Council. This component was
comprised of three sub-components: (a) Prevention Activities by the MOH and RHAs
to provide technical guidance for the national response to HIV/AIDS, and to deliver
HIV/AIDS related prevention services; (b) Prevention Activities by the non-health
line ministries to improve the multi-sectorality of the response; and (c) Prevention

                   Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      A formal economic and financial analysis for the purpose of this ICR was not
carried out. The information below is taken largely from the PAD, a study led by the
World Bank on the Financial Sustainability of Jamaica’s HIV program, presentations
from the 2012 Annual Review meetings, a presentation by UNAIDS on “Investing to
End HIV/AIDS. What should Jamaica do?”, and a number of external data sources on
the cost effectiveness of HIV interventions. All sources of data are listed in Annex 9.

HIV/AIDS- Status and Trends

2.      It is estimated that HIV prevalence is 1.7 percent among the adult population
(15 to 49 years) but the prevalence rate is much higher among key populations at
higher risk for HIV-MSM (32 percent) and CSW (5 percent). UNAIDS estimates that
there were 32,000 PLWHA in 2009 (i.e. 1.1 percent of the total population of 2.8
million). This represented a small increase from previous years and was only slightly
lower than at its peak when there were 33,000 PLWHA in the mid-1990s. The
population has grown over this period, and thus the number of PLWHA has remained
nearly constant. Consequently, seen in proportion to the population as a whole, the
number of PLWHA implies a decline in HIV prevalence from 2.2 percent (1995) to
1.7 percent (2009) among those aged 15–49 years in 1995.

3.     Among young adults, HIV/AIDS accounts for one-quarter of deaths between
those aged 15 to 59 years, and is the leading cause of death among males between the
ages of 30 and 44 years. The impact of HIV/AIDS has resulted in a substantial
reversal of health gains achieved in other areas. For example, life expectancy in the
country grew at an average rate of 0.2 years annually between 1955/60 and 2005/10
but as a result of HIV/AIDS life expectancy at birth was reduced in by 1.6 years in
2005/10. Such aggregate estimates, however, mask the role of HIV/AIDS among
young adults. Figure 3.1 shows the HIV, Advance HIV, AIDS Cases and AIDS
Deaths over the period 1982 – 2011. AIDS cases and deaths are disaggregated by
gender in Figure 3.2.

4.      Factors driving the epidemic continue to be: multiple sexual partners;
insufficient condom use; High HIV rate among MSM; High HIV rate among CSW;
Transactional Sex; PLWHA who are unaware of their status; early initiation of sexual
activity; and High STI rate. The HIV prevalence rates among selected populations are
outlined in Table 3.1 below. There is consensus that HIV/AIDS contributes to the
persistence of poverty as it affects not only the stock, but also the accumulation of
human capital. HIV/AIDS affects economic activity in several ways. It leads to
decreases in productivity, increased absenteeism of the economic work force and
increased turn-over. Moreover, HIV/AIDS depletes the stock of human capital as
skilled workers die prematurely. At the same time that the epidemic causes an
increase in the demand for government services (particularly in health), it can also
lead to reductions in public revenues. As such, HIV/AIDS puts considerable strain on
public finances, with a potentially substantial negative long-run impact of HIV/AIDS
on economic development.

Technical Justification for Project Interventions

5.      Consequently, the most cost-effective interventions were selected to address
the four priority areas of the NSP: (a) decrease stigma and discrimination, resulting in
increased acceptability of services and increased uptake; (b) strengthen the multi-
sectoral approach through partnerships which include improved capacity of all
stakeholders, resulting in increased quantity, quality, availability and access to
services; (c) develop a strong evidence-based approach that complies with local,
regional and international guidelines to inform the local response; and (d) strengthen
the M&E system to pave way for an efficient and sustainable response to HIV. Other
guiding principles of the national response in the NSP included equity; participation
of PLWHA; promotion and protection of human rights; transparency and
accountability; and application of the International Labor Organization principles on
HIV/AIDS and the world of work. The National HIV/AIDS Policy and the Draft NSP
2007-2012 put significant emphasis on the provision of a supportive legal and
regulatory environment.

6.      Prevention. During appraisal, the World Bank applied the Allocation by
Cost-effectiveness (ABC) model. The model focuses on prevention programs only,
and does not impose trade-offs between funding prevention against treatment and
care. It analyzes alternative resource allocations differentiated by strategy and target
population group. Findings from the application of this model indicated that a
substantial impact can be obtained even with limited resources. The most cost-
effective interventions were: condom distribution targeted to high-risk groups;
information, education and communication for key populations at higher risk for HIV
(including CSW, MSM, and prisoners and VCT). Although it is difficult to
disaggregate funds spent purely on the key populations at higher risk for HIV from

                                                27
the total prevention interventions, since community interventions, workplace
interventions, and VCT can also reach key populations at higher risk for HIV —it is
estimated that roughly 18.9% of total expenditures on the prevention component were

7.      The analysis further estimated that with an optimal allocation for these
interventions of US$1.0 million would prevent between 5,100 and 12,000 infections,
corresponding to between 11% and 19% of primary and secondary infections.
Inclusion of secondary infections allows for the multiplier effects of prevention in
some subgroups. The cost per infection averted was in the range of US$84 and
US$196. Another finding was that at a budget of US$10 million, only about 25% of
all primary and secondary infections can be prevented because it becomes
increasingly difficult to reach certain population groups that are at highest risk. This
implied that after a certain threshold, there is a need to go beyond these interventions
to fund strategies that lead to expanded coverage, including reduction of stigma,
decriminalization of certain behaviors, increased service coverage etc.

8.      In spite of this, however, and as noted in the PAD, Governments do not
allocate resources solely on the basis of cost-effectiveness. For ethical and human
rights reasons other interventions at a given budget constraint level, would be less
cost-effective. These include safe blood and PMTCT which may be selected by a
Government for inclusion in the basic package of services. These recent findings are
in line with earlier findings on cost-effective interventions outlined in Table 3.3
below. This table, adapted from Jha et al. (2001) summarizes the range of values from
the literature relating to the cost-effectiveness of some of the most frequent
interventions in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.

9.      Individual country programs, therefore, will maximize the number of
infections averted and the number of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) saved,
in an effort to ensure that the most cost-effective interventions obtain sufficient
attention and financing, and are not crowded out. Consistent with this thinking,
Jamaica selected a comprehensive approach which has funding for preventive
interventions both for targeting key populations at higher risk for HIV as well as for
reaching the general population in addition to the proposed scaling up of treatment
and care.

10.     The efficiency of the treatment component of the Project can be quantified in
terms of cost effectiveness for a death averted due to treatment and care. Treatment
has expanded from approximately 3000 adults and children on treatment in 2007 to
9,680 by Dec 2012. At the end of 2012, 9275 adults and children were started on
HAART. This represents a steady increase from 2004 when 400 patients were placed
on treatment. Over a similar period (2008 – 2011), the number of deaths reported has
been held relatively constant (see Figure 3.3 below). This is a significant achievement
for the program as these figures represent the lowest level of reported deaths since
1998, and occur in the context of increased surveillance and greater case
identification.

11.     The cumulative deaths averted between 2008 and 2012 due to treatment are
currently being estimated, although given that interventions have already been
provided, the actual number of deaths averted is likely to be higher than that
estimated. 8

12.     The cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in the Caribbean was studied
using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC)
international model, an adaptation of the CEPAC US model, a state-transition
simulation model of HIV disease in resource-limited settings. Projections were made
for survival, cost, and cost-effectiveness of treating and HIV-infected cohort in the
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The data used was from the
Jamaica HIV/AIDS Tracking System, a national surveillance database and
projections. The results indicated that without treatment, mean survival was 2.3 years.
One ART regimen added an additional 5.86 years of survival benefit compared with
no treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ 690 per year of life
saved. A second regimen added 1.04 years of survival benefit. The incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio was US$10,960 per year of live saved. Results depended on the
cost of ART second-line drugs and the per person lifetime costs decreased from US
$17,020 to $ 9,290 if the costs of second-line drugs decreased to those available
internationally.

Financing for HIV and AIDS

13.     Jamaica faces macroeconomic challenges including a high debt stock.
Jamaica’s tight macroeconomic environment is diagrammatically shown in Figure 3.4
during Project implementation, the fiscal space restriction by the GOJ was a concern
particularly during the last two years of the global recession. This resulted in the
Project having to compete with the Figure 3.4: Jamaica's tight macroeconomic
Government’s numerous priorities, as the                        environment
                                                                                          150

 Through scaling up of prevention, which averts infection, and treatment- which averts death, it can be
argued that the project has- at least theoretically- had a positive impact on poverty. Notwithstanding
this theoretical linkage, the PIOJ estimates that poverty levels have increased from 12.3% in 2008, to
16.5% in 2009, and to 18.5% - 20.3% in 2010. Consequently, roughly 500,000 Jamaicans currently are
living below the poverty line.

                                                  30
14.     Even in the post-recession period, budget allocations remain limited. As such,
there is an operational risk that the country will not be able to sustain the momentum
built by the Program. The sustainability of the ARVs, for example, is a major concern.
Also, while most patients cannot afford to access HIV tests in the private sector, the
public sector is under severe stress. On an individual level, the continued contraction
of the Jamaican economy has negatively impacted the most vulnerable of the
population. While the demand for social welfare benefits has increased, the pool of
resources has not expanded to meet this need. As such, nutritional concerns including
food availability and access to services (due to financial challenges) have been
documented as major impediments to adherence.

15.     In an environment with limited resources, and with decreases in external
donor funding, Jamaica is increasingly covering most of the costs of the NHP (see
Figure 3.5 below). Notably, while the GOJ financed less than 5% of direct costs over
the period 2007 - 2011, they financed the majority of indirect costs. As such, there is
a need to ensure that resources are focused on the most cost-effective interventions.
Figure 3.6 shows how funding was spent across different priority areas between 2009
and 2011.

Performance of the national response

16.     The HIV/AIDS program has shown a number of significant achievements: (a)
while over 30,000 Jamaicans still live with HIV prevalence has declined (see Figure
1); (b) incidence has declined from a peak of 5,495 (1993/4) to 2,022 (2011) (see
Figure 2), and treatment is saving lives (see Figure 3.7). In 2010, 8,047 Jamaicans
were on treatment, but 44% of those who needed it were not. That said, there is
consensus that more effective strategies need to be found to reduce the high
prevalence of HIV among MSM, with a specific emphasis on measures to increase
their risk perception, reduce their social vulnerability, combat stigma and
discrimination and empower MSM to practice safe sex.

17.     According to the 2012 KAPB survey, however, HIV/AIDS knowledge is
declining among youth- both males and females, and reflected in risky behaviour
choices (see Figure 3.8). 9 This shows a worsening trend from the 2008 KABP which
showed high awareness and knowledge of HIV- although these did not translate into
behaviour change.

  Correct preventive practices measures the proportion of the population able to endorse correct
HIV/AIDS preventive practices. The younger age cohort (15-24 year olds) must endorse 3 preventive
practices: condom use always, one faithful partner, abstinence while the older age cohort (25-49 year
olds) must endorse 2 preventive practices: condom use always, one faithful partner.

Conclusion

18.     In summary, Jamaica’s NHP aims to maximize the number of infections
averted and the number of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) saved, in an
effort to ensure that the most cost-effective interventions obtain sufficient attention
and financing, and are not crowded out. Consistent with this thinking, the program
has adopted a comprehensive approach which includes funding for both prevention
interventions which are targeted to key populations at higher risk for HIV and the
general population, as well as scaling up of treatment, care and support services.
Project interventions are technically sound, and have made a significant contribution
to the fight against HIV/AIDS, as evidenced by, for example, reductions in
prevalence and incidence, and a significant scaling-up of treatment. Given a lack of
information on overall financing for the NHP (including on both program
expenditures and outputs), however, it is not possible to assess allocative efficiency of
the NHP.

19.    In spite of successes and in-roads in challenging areas such as influencing
behavior change among key populations at higher risk for HIV, a key challenge in
both sustaining and further scaling up the response will be financing. Jamaica
continues to face macroeconomic challenges including a high debt to GDP ratio,
coupled with reductions in external financing to the NHP. In this environment, further
emphasis will be placed on maximizing efficiencies and cost-effectiveness of
interventions.

1.      Jamaica’s response to HIV has been guided by a national plan since as early
as 1988. Oversight of the response was provided by a well-established National
HIV/STI Programme (NHP) and National AIDS Committee.                   Multi-sectoral
involvement was a feature of the response from the very early stages. The NHP
engaged other government ministries and agencies, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), community based organizations (CBOs), faith-based organizations (FBOs),
the private sector, people living with HIV (PLHIV) as well as vulnerable populations.

2.     Funding for the current Five Year Program (2008 – 2013) was provided from
three main sources. The Global Fund provided grant funds of US$39.90 Million
(67%) of the US$60.00 million of budgeted expenditure for the period. The IBRD
provided loan financing of US$10 million or 17% of the total. USAID and direct
funding from the Government of Jamaica accounted for the balance.

3.      The World Bank loan was structured as an investment based loan with
financing of detailed activities, with co-financing from the GOJ. This project
benefitted from an accelerated preparation phase and was built on the previous World
Bank loan which ended in March 2008 and achieved loan effectiveness in November
2008.

4.       The loan however carried a retroactive financing clause which allowed for
financing of activities from April 2008, the ending of the first loan, and November
2008 the formal commencement of the second loan. This allowed for a seamless
transition from one project to the next and maintenance of the capacities, people and
activities that were established through the first loan. The loan was structured with the
following main components:

Component 1: Prevention -The prevention component of the NHP was mandated to
prevent new HIV infections. This included identifying new HIV infections and
channeling these persons into existing treatment and care services. The IBRD loan
accounted for US$2.80 Million or approximately 15% of expenditures in this
component.

Component 2: Treatment, Care and Support -The primary objective of this
component was to increase the capacity to provide basic treatment, care and support
to PLHIV. The IBRD Loan contributed US$1.56 Million or 7% of expenditure in this
component.

Component 3: Institutional Capacity for Policy Formulation, Programme
Management and Monitoring & Evaluation -This component had the widest range
of programme area and supported changes to the legislative and policy framework,
coordination and management of the NHP and strengthening the M&E system. Of the
total expenditure of US$57.01 million, it accounted for US$4.49 million or
approximately 8%. The IBRD provided 72% of actual expenditure under this
component over the period.

                                           38
Component 4: Health Sector Development- This component was primarily
concerned with infectious waste management and the assessment of the obstacles that
limit the capacity of the health sector to deliver quality health care. All indicators for
this component were IBRD indicators and the IBRD provided 100% financing or
US$0.82 Million for this component.

5.      There were no significant restructuring of the loan over the period though
reallocations were made to the cost categories as per below table. One extension for
three months was requested and granted resulting in the closing of the loan at the end
of March 2013, rather than November 2012.

Main Achievements

7.      The project realized many achievements over the period including
maintenance of the adult HIV prevalence at less than 2% since the mid-1990s. HIV
prevalence among public antenatal and STI clinic attendees also declined. While the
HIV prevalence among antenatal women increased from 0.14% to 1.96% between
1989 and 1996, it declined over the last 15 years. The rates for 2010 and 2011 were
at 1% and below. This overall decline was attributed to successful behavior change
strategies among the general population. Also notable was that in 2010, UNAIDS
reported that the number of new HIV infections in Jamaica had declined by 25% over
the previous 10 years.

8.    In support of this success were the mass media campaigns developed by the
NHP to address priority issues. These included:
   • Adherence to medication and promotion/normalization of voluntary HIV
      testing.
   • Sigma reduction. The “Yes I Can” campaign featured a second pair of persons
      living with HIV (PLHIV) publicly disclosing their status and encouraging
      support for PLHIV. This campaign was extremely important in facilitating the
      creation of an enabling environment.
   • Parenting and discussions about sexuality. Parents were encouraged to speak
      openly and honestly with their children about sex and sexuality through the
      “Time to Talk” campaign.
   • Multiple partnerships. “Stick to One Partner” was designed in response to
      Jamaica’s ongoing problem.
   • Condom use. Three media campaigns were developed to further encourage
      condom use: “Pinch, Leave an Inch and Roll” targeted building condom use
      efficacy among adolescents and young people, “Big Man Use Condom”
      featured a popular dance hall artiste and targeted young males while “Smart
      Sexy Wise” targeted females.

9.      Prevention site-based interventions were implemented among SWs and MSM.
Condoms and lubricant were distributed and risk reduction conversations and condom
efficacy skills-building activities were conducted. The IBRD targets for number of
SW (30,000) and MSM (19,000) reached through prevention activities were
surpassed as interactions were had with over 40,000 SW and over 22,000 MSM.

10.     Vertical transmission of HIV has been less than 5% for the past five years
coming from a high of over 10% a decade ago. Additionally, Jamaica appeared to be
well positioned to achieve the regional target of elimination of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV and congenital syphilis by 2015. The national Prevention of
Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) programme which was implement in 2004
included routine opt-out testing of antenatal clinic attendees, provision of
antiretrovirals (ARVs) and access to alternate feeding for HIV-infected women. A
national survey revealed that 95% of pregnant women attending public clinics in 2010
and 2011 were tested for HIV and treatment or prophylaxis was provided for more
than 85% of HIV infected mothers and more than 98% of their infants received ARVs
for PMTCT. Based on programme monitoring data this trend continued through 2012.

11.     HIV testing was significantly scaled-up over the years. The number of HIV
tests done was less than 100,000 annually prior to 2004 but over three million tests
have been done and results returned, cumulatively between 2008 and 2012 and by the
end of September 2012, 9,680 adults and 453 children with advanced HIV were
started on antiretroviral (ARV) treatment.

12.    A state-of-the-art Waste Management Facility was upgraded at a cost of
US$0.9M, expanding the treatment capacity to 1,000 Tonnes per year, which
represents approximately 60% of the island’s annual medical waste generation of
1,600 tonnes, was also established to support public healthcare facilities.
Other key achievements included:
    • In 2009, for the first time the GOJ provided funding to support 20 posts.
       Another major achievement during the period was the integration of the NHP
       into the National Family Planning Board (NFPB) in 2013 to form one
       statutory body with responsibility for sexual and reproductive health.
    • During the 2008 to 2011 period Jamaica had Prime Ministers from each of the
       major political parties. They committed to be high-level leadership advocates
       and to join the multi-sectoral partnership on HIV/AIDS.
    • In 2011, the People’s National Party again reaffirmed their commitment and
       The Honourable Bruce Golding, when he was Prime Minister signed his
       commitment to eliminate stigma, discrimination and gender inequalities
       affecting Jamaica’s HIV/AIDS Response.
    • Revision of the National Workplace Policy on HIV and AIDS in May 2012.
       It was revised based on ILO Recommendation 200 and recommendations
       from the Attorney General. It was resubmitted to the Human Resources

          Committee of the Cabinet and approved as a White Paper in July 2012. The
          policy will be tabled in the parliament for approval.
      •   Increased operational research occurred, including implementation of a
          national HIV research agenda through the Monitoring and Evaluation
          Reference Group (MERG) to answer key questions for programme
          management.
      •   The HIV M&E Plan, 2012-2017: The M&E Plan was developed through an
          extensive participatory process of assessing the existing M&E system.
      •   Completion of a comprehensive Health Sector Assessment Study supported
          by the IADB. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the
          country’s burden of illness, the key programmes required to mitigate this to an
          acceptable level and proposes alternative financing mechanisms to fund the
          response.

Project Expenditure

14.    The project realized expenditures of US$ 9.7 Million or 97% of the loan
amount with vast majority of the under expenditure related to the non-procurement of
two specialized medical waste collection vehicles and equipment for the
decentralization of the Laboratory information system. Expenditures per Component
and cost category is outlined below.

Main Challenges

15.     While the achievements were many, there were some challenges. Despite a
documented reduction in new HIV infections and the HIV prevalence among sex
workers, prevalence rates remained high among MSM (32%). Behavioural
surveillance revealed that the main factors driving the epidemic, namely multiple
partnerships, early sexual debut, high levels of transactional sex and inadequate
condom use, have remained high over the last 30 years. On the background of the
country’s contracting economy, the global financial crisis and potential reduction in
external funding, another major concern is the potential loss of gains due to
challenges in the wider health system which limits the full integration and expansion
of HIV services necessary to achieve and maintain sustainability.

16.    Stigma associated with HIV also remained a concern throughout
implementation. The socially marginalized groups, especially MSM, were still
stigmatized and discriminatory acts were far too common. Stigma and discrimination
also slowed the progress of development of social policy and legislation. Policy
makers were reluctant to take bold steps to promote an enabling environment that

                                             46
would reduce the vulnerability of those most at risk and better facilitate the provision
of services and practice of safer sex.

17.     Fighting the epidemic within the MSM population remained a significant gap
in the programme. The HIV prevalence among MSM remained unacceptably high at
32% and there has been no improvement in the proportion of MSMs reporting the use
of a condom the last time they had anal sex, from 74% that it was in 2008.

18.     The practice of multiple partnerships which is a primary driver of HIV
infections in Jamaica persist within our culture. The 2012 KAPB Survey reported a
2% increase between 2008 and 2012, with a significant increase noted among the 15
– 24 year-old age group. The target for the IBRD PDO indicator regarding the
percentage of young people aged 15-24 reporting the use of a condom the last time
they had sex with a non-regular sexual partner was partially achieved.

19.     The percentage of young women and men aged 15 - 24 who both correctly
identify ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major
misconceptions about HIV transmission has declined for males between 2008 and
2012.

20.     Many implementing stakeholders lacked the capacity to conduct appropriate
surveillance or evaluations and to use available data for decision-making. Very few
stakeholders had a committed M&E position, and even fewer had developed M&E
plans for their programmes.

Other key challenges experienced during implementation included:

   •   The ‘Structure of Government Contribution’ across components (e,g.
       Prevention 3%, Treatment 5%) led to additional administrative monitoring
       which resulted in additional accounting and audit costs. This was attributed
       directly to the fact that two (2) cheques had to be prepared (one from the
       Designated Account and the other from the GOJ) to suppliers in respect of
       each transaction.

   •   Fiscal Space Restriction by the Government of Jamaica was a concern
       particularly during the last two years of the global recession. This resulted in
       the project having to compete with the Government’s numerous priorities, as
       the Government relied primarily on fiscal contraction to address the level of
       aggregate expenditure, inflation and devaluation.

   •   The ceiling of US$850,000 for ‘Outstanding Advance’ under the Designated
       Account proved somewhat restrictive during the period of the recession. The
       GOJ was occasionally required to provide cash flow to meet urgent project
       expenses, with the World Bank subsequently reimbursing the GOJ
       Consolidated Fund. This contributed to delays in project implementation.




                                          47
   •   In Procurement/Service Contracting the project was required to satisfy the
       procurement guidelines of the World Bank as stipulated in the Loan
       Agreement along with the contract procedures to be observed by government
       entities outlined in the local Contractor General’s ‘handbook’. From time to
       time this resulted in more than one tier of approval which led to programme
       delays.

   •   Worsening poverty in view of the link between risky sexual behaviour and
       social inequities has implications for the spread of HIV. The Planning
       Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) projected that poverty levels in Jamaica increased
       from 16.5% in 2009, and 12.3% in 2008to 18.5%- 20.3% in 2010.
       Consequently, roughly 500,000 Jamaicans currently are living below the
       poverty line.

Lessons Learned

   •   Strong leadership at the highest governmental level generates the most
       effective national responses to HIV. Along with this, a national strategic plan
       for HIV is essential to guide the response if human and financial resources are
       to be optimally utilized. Epidemiological and behavioural data must inform
       the development and monitoring of the national strategic plan.
   •   Meaningful partnerships are critical to strong national and local responses.
       The partners include governments, health professionals, people living with
       HIV, vulnerable groups, local CBOS and NGOs.
   •   Laws and policies that counter stigma and discrimination against people living
       with HIV and vulnerable populations reduce the negative impact of the
       disease and enhance prevention, health-promotion, treatment and care efforts.
       However, despite the non-existence of this enabling legal framework,
       significant work can still be done among those most vulnerable and
       marginalised groups.
   •   Investment in prevention, treatment care and support at the present time
       significantly reduces future human and financial costs. Similarly, rational and
       effective use of antiretroviral and other HIV-related treatments improves the
       outcome by reduction in HIV and AIDS-related mortality and morbidity.
   •   Wide-ranging public-information campaigns help counter denial, normalize
       HIV, reduce stigma and discrimination and lead to reduced levels of HIV
       infection. However, the main challenge to continued stigma is the reluctance
       of persons living with HIV to disclose to their family and friends.
   •   Integration of the HIV response into sexual reproductive health programmes
       within the ambit of the primary health care response can lead to broader reach
       and deeper sustained impact.
   •   Programme or Policy based loans with 100% financing may lead to greater
       efficiency in implementation.

Sustainability

21.     The World Bank Project facilitated significant investments in the general
health system as well supported the implementation of the national HIV response.
Early after the introduction of the National HIV/STI Programme, the treatment and
care component was integrated into the general health care system. Field health care
workers (clinicians, pharmacists, nurses, social workers, contact investigators, etc.)
received extensive and on-going training/updates over the period of the loan thereby
ensuring institutionalization/sustainability of the treatment and care response.
Capacity building sessions will continue post-loan and will be integrated into in-
service education sessions.

22.     The integration of the National HIV/STI Programme (NHP) into the National
Family Planning Board (NFPB) to form one executive agency with responsibility for
sexual and reproductive health will support the sustainability of the HIV Prevention
Component and the Enabling Environment and Human Rights component has set up a
steering committee consisting of legal officers from Ministries of Labour and Social
Security, Health, National Security and Justice as well as civil society representatives
to ensure continuity of its work.

23.    The Government has also committed (by way of budgetary allocations) to
continue to provide HIV testing and monitoring laboratory supplies, infant
supplementary feeds as well as antiretroviral drugs.

Conclusion

24.     The World Bank Project facilitated significant investments in the general
health system as well as supported the implementation of the national HIV response.
The infrastructure investments including the expansion of the Portland Health
department, Expansion of the capacity at the South East Medical Waste Management
Plant and the expansion of the sample collection area of the National Public Health
Laboratory will continue to serve the health sector for years to come. The investment
in staff training and development will also be sustained as the Government has
created posts for the key staff at the PCU and have taken over the payment of staff at
the field level. The project also leveraged other resources as it formed the counterpart
funding for the USAID and Global Fund projects and hence contributed to the overall
success of Jamaica’s National Response. The integration of the HIV response into the
National Family Planning Board to create a “One Authority” will also help to ensure
sustainability of the gains achieved by the project.

27.     The current socio economic climate within the country however will continue
to erode the gains and unless investments in HIV is continued at least at the same
level the gains could be reversed in the medium term.
