                                              PROJECTPAPER

 IntroductoryStatement

 1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President to introduce changes in the
 Project Documents for the Jamaica Second HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention Project (the Project) (Loan
No. IBRD 7556).

2.       The proposed changes are all related to the Results Framework: (a) replacing four Project
Development Objective (PDO) indicators with three indicators that are more appropriate for measuring the
Project's achievements; and (b) revising Component output and results indicators by adding four new
indicators, removing six indicators, and refining indicators and targets based on data availability and the
appropriateness o f the indicators in tracking project progress (See Annex 1 for details). The revised PDO
indicators are better linked to the priority areas o f the Project: promoting condom use among the youth,
prevention o f mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and reducing stigma and discrimination.

3.       The proposed changes will not affect the original PDOs or the project design. The revised
indicators will allow for more accurate measurement of the Project's progress and impact.

Backgroundand Reasonsfor Restructuring

4.       The US$lO million Loan Agreement for the Jamaica Second HIV/AIDS Project was signed on June
 10, 2008 and became effective on September 23, 2008. The Project is a follow-on project to the Jamaica
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, which was successfully completed on May 3 1, 2008. The
Government sought the Bank's support to finance the implementation o f the National HIV/AIDS Strategic
Plan for the period 2007-2012 and to increase resources to address the epidemic through its own budget as
well as through securing additional resources from external partners including the World Bank, the Global
Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other partners. The implementation of this Project has
benefittedfrom the capacity built during the first HIV/AIDS Project and has been making steady progress.
As o fApril 5,2009, US$875,000 (8.8%) ofthe Loanhas been disbursed.

5.      During the first supervision mission in October 2008, the Bank and project teams had an
opportunity to revisit the project indicators based on the data available from the 2008 National Knowledge,
Attitudes, Behavior and Practices (KABP) Survey and the 2007 Survey on men having sex with men
(MSM).This review identified a number of issues with the Results Framework: (a) usingHIV prevalence
rates among commercial sex workers (CSW) and men having sex with MSMis considered inappropriate for
measuring efforts to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; (b) some targets set for the Project have already
been achieved and some targets are unrealistic given the information on the current HIV epidemic; and (c)
some indicators cannot be tracked due to lack o f a data collection tool. The Bank and project teams made a
collective decision to revise the project indicators in order to better reflect the reality o f the epidemic and to
allow for better tracking o f project progress towards implementation o f the National HIV/AIDS Strategic
Plan.

6.      The PDOs are to contribute to the Government's National HIV/AIDS Program through support to:
(i)deepening prevention interventions targeted at high-risk groups and for the general population; (ii)
increasing access to treatment, care and support services for infected and affected individuals; and (iii)
strengtheningthe program management and analysis to identify priorities for strengtheningthe health sector
capacity to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other priority health problems. The PDO remains
appropriate and valid. There i s no need to change the project design and its implementation arrangements.




                                                                                                                  2

Proposed Changes

7.      The proposed changes to the Results Framework were discussed during the February 2009
SupervisionMissionand agreedwith the Government. The major changes include:

        (a)      To replace four PDO indicators with three indicators that allow better tracking o f the
        project outcome and impact on the National AIDS Program. The following PDO indicatorswould
        be removed: (i)percent of CSWs who are HIV infected; (ii)percent of MSM who are HIV
        infected; (iii)number of men, women & children with advanced HIV receiving antiretroviral
        combination therapy according to national guidelines; and (iv) number of institutions adopting
        policies to address HIV. The revisedPDO indicatorswould be: (i)       percent of young people aged
         15-24 reportingthe use of a condom the last time they had sex with a non-regular sexual partner;
        (ii)percent ofinfants bornto HIV-infectedmothers, who are HIV-infected;and (iii)percent of
        people expressing accepting attitudes towards PLWHA, of all people surveyed aged 15-49. The
        revisedPDO indicatorsare a better reflectionof the programareas on which the Project can havea
        direct impact; and

        (b)      To improve Component Output and Result Indicators by adding four new indicators,
        removing six indicators and refining indicators and targets based on data availability and the
        appropriateness of the indicators in reflecting the reality of the epidemic and in tracking project
        progress.


8.      The detailed changes in the original Results Framework are presented in Annex 1 and the revised
ResultsFrameworkinAnnex 2.

Analysis

9.      The proposed changes will not affect the economic, financial, environmental, technical and social
aspects of the Project as appraised. The changes do not amend the appraised components or require
reallocation of funds. The Project will continue to focus on the high risk groups, promote condom use,
particularly among high risk groups and reinforce the need to address the issues of stigma and
discrimination.The institutionalarrangementswill all remainunchangedwith the Ministry of Healthas the
main implementingagency. The proposedrestructuringwill not trigger any new safeguardpoliciesor affect
environmentsafeguardratingofthe Project.

Expected outcomes

10.     As mentioned, despite the revision of indicators, the PDOs remain the same, i.e. to support: (i)
deepening prevention interventions targeted at high-risk groups and for the general population; (ii)
increasing access to treatment, care and support services for infected and affected individuals; and (iii)
strengtheningthe programmanagement and analysisto identify priorities for strengtheningthe healthsector
capacity to respondto the HIV/AIDS epidemic and otherpriority healthproblems.

11.     It is expected that the proposed restructuringwill strengthen the Project's focus on more realistic
and deliverableobjectives and improvethe projectmonitoringand evaluationframework and its utilization.




                                                                                                         3

Benefits and Risks

12.      The proposed changes will improve the implementation of the Jamaica National HIV/AIDS
Program because the proposed changes to the indictors will make the Results Framework more realistic,
reflect the new knowledge and information that are available and are better aligned with the national
priorities. Since the restructuringis at the beginningof the implementation,the revisedResults Framework
will allow better trackingand monitoringof projecteffort and progress inorder to guide the implementation
and ultimately improveits effectiveness.
