                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are to assist in the implementation of the Government's national HIV/AIDS program through support to: (i) deepening of
                         prevention interventions targeted at high risk groups and for the general population (ii) increasing of access to treatment, care and support services for
                         infected and affected individuals; (iii) strengthening of program management and analysis to identify priorities for strengthening the health sector capacity to
                         respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other priority health problems.

                         development objectives. Compared with last year's program, more attention has been paid to targeting the most-at-risk population groups (MARPs) because they are the main
                         drivers of the epidemic and have much higher HIV prevalence rates: 32% among men having sex with men (MSM) and 5% among commercial sex workers (CSWs). The prevalence

                         rates for crack/cocaine users and prisoners were estimated at 5% and 3.5% respectively. The results from the National Knowledge, Attitudes, Behavior and Practices (KABP) 2008
                         and other surveys on MSM and sex workers (2008) have been used to reach a higher percentage of the MARPs.

                         Progress continued to be made in the areas of provision of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), expansion of Anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment and Prevention of Mother to Child
                         Transmission (PMTCT). The coverage of PMTCT to pregnant mothers increased from 74% in 2005 to 95% in 2009 in the public sector. Pediatric AIDS cases were reduced by 19%
                         from 2008 to 2009. The percentage of HIV exposed infants receiving ARV treatment increased from 87% in 2005 to 98% in 2009. Of the 14,000 PLHIV estimated to be in need of
                         ARV, 6895 (49%) were receiving therapy in 2009. The number of people tested has increased from 30,000 in 2002 to 247,492 in 2009. Testing for CD4 count, which is the most
                         important test for being able to manage HIV positive individuals, has increased by 30% compared to 2008.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government of Jamaica has reaffirmed its commitment to meeting the MDGs and HIV/AIDS remains as one of the high priorities on the government's agenda. The Government
                         team emphasized the need to review and re-visit the National Program priorities and strategic framework. This will be done as part of the mid-term review discussion in May/June
                         2011. The mid-term review would provide the opportunity to review the progress and identify gaps in order to ensure that the project continues to respond to national program
                         priorities. The National AIDS Program can prioritize the integration with broader health systems to allow the Program to contribute to the development of the country's health sector.
