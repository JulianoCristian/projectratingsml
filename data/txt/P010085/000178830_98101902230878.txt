The Sri Lanka Rupee, which had been linked to the U.S. Dollar
from November 6, 1971, was re-linked to the Pound Sterling from July 10,
1972 onward at a parity rate of 4 1.00 = Rs 15.60. Parity,rates with all
other currencies are determined from time to time by the Central Bank.
The Central Bank of Ceylon makes foreign exchange available for
certain categories of imports through purchase of Foreign Exchange Enti-
tlement Certificates (FEECs) for which a premium is charged. The same
premium is offered to exporters on foreign exchange earnings from the
sale of non-traditional goods. The net revenue from the sale of FEECs
is credited to the Government's Revenue Account. The premium is present-
ly fixed at 65 percent of the Rupee parity rate and results in an exchange
rate of Rs 10.68 = US$1. This rate currently applies to about 20 percent
of merchandise exports, about 60 percent of merchandise imports and to
most invisible transactions with the exception of aid receipts.

Oi' A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THIE REPUBLIC OP eRI LAMIKA
FOR A PROGRAM1 CREDIT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Sri Lanka for the equivalent of
US$15 million on standard IDA terms to help finance imports required for
expansion of industrial and agricultural production and for improvement of
selected services.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report, "Recent Economic Developments and
Prospects for Sri Lanka" (Report No. 407-CE of April 15, 1974), was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors on April 22, 1974. Country data are
provided in Annex I.
_ack3gound
3.        The economic difficulties that have beset Sri Lanka since the
late 1950's can be traced principally to two basic characteristics of the
country's economic and social system: first, the specialization of produc-
tion in three export crops - tea, rubber and coconut - which at the time of
independence (1948) directly contributed nearly 40% of GNP and which has
since declined to 13% in 1973; second, a political commitment to the wel-
fare state which was made possible by the economic benefits derived from
that export specialization. This commitment found its expression in two
policy tenets which for the past quarter century all governments have fol-
lowed in varying degrees: the supply of mass consumption goods, principally
food and textiles, at low prices, and the provision of public services -
mainly education, health and transport - free of charge or substantially
below cost.
4.        Sri Lanka's progress in social fields has been commendable.
Health services are free except for a token contribution for out-patients
visiting health centers and the health network is well developed. Educa-
tion is provided free; however, the system is not geared to the country's
needs. Sri Lanka has also tried to achieve a more equal distribution of
income by enforcing policies aimed at the promotion of high wages, subsidi-
zation of services, and the distribution of food below cost, or even free.
The welfare state, however, was based on the prosperity of the external
sector. Even if the terms of trade had remained in Sri Lanka's favor, it
would have been increasingly difficult for the export sector to generate
the foreign exchange resources and government revenues required to extend
the benefits of the Government's social policy to a population which nearly
doubled in 25 years. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka experienced a pronounced



weakening in the market of two of its major exports, tea and rubber, begin-
ning in the mid--fifties and, in addition, there was hardly any increase in
the volume of exports between 1955 and 1970. As a result, there has been
little growth in the economy over the last ten years. This stagnation has
led to insufficient employment opportunities being created, so much so that
in 1971, about 800,000 workers, or 18 percent: of the labor force, were un-
employed. Even more striking is that nearly two-thirds of these had been
educated beyond the ninth grade of schooling, a consequence of the extensive
education facilities. It was very largely this situation that provoked the
insurgency in April 1971 which posed a real threat to the stability of the
country.
5.        Economic policies to date have done little to offset the impact
of the declining fortunes of the major export crops. Indeed, policies have
been dedicated to maintaining welfare services despite the inadequacy of
resources. A plethora of regulations and price controls has created serious
disincentives as has been demonstrated by the failure over many years of do-
mestic agriculture to replace imported products. However, the recent success
in allowing market prices to stimulate production of a limited number of vege-
table products provides an interesting contrast to the lack of performance
under earlier policies.
6.        It is against this background that Sri Lanka has now to face the
twin shocks of sharply escalating costs for imported food, which are ex-
pected to absorb 60 percent of the country's export earnings in 1974, and
a doubling of the oil import bill. Thus, Sri Lanka emerges as one of the
LDCs most severely affected by the recent worldwide price inflation.
7.        In these circumstances, the Government responded last fall by
doubling the price of petroleum products, raising transport tariffs by
50 percent or more and making adjustments in the amount and price of food
supplied at subsidized rates so that the cost of subsidies to be borne on
the budget would be reduced. In the event, and as described later, the
food subsidy adjustments have not proved adequate to offset the sharp in-
crease in worldwide commodity prices. Nonetheless the members of the Aid
Group meeting in Paris in May 1974 noted that the policies behind these
measures constituted an important contribution towards improving the Gov-
ernment's budgetary position. The members also recognized that immediate
support was essential, and the Association urged that quick disbursing
assistance should be provided. The purpose of this credit is to complement
the Aid Group's efforts.
Developments in 1973 and 1974
8.        Agriculture.   Agriculture accounts for 33 percent of the GDP and
employs about 2 million people or 50 percent of the total labor force. Tea,
rubber and coconuts are the principal crops, contributing 80 percent of the
value of exports and 25 percent of total employment. Any substantial in-
crease in foreign exchange earnings will have to come from exports of these
products. There are no serious long-term demand constraints on the export



of rubber or coconut products, although prices have proved to be quite vola-
tile in reaction to short-term market conditions. For tea, prices have been
depressed for many years on accourt of slow growth in demand and further ex-
pansion is expected to continue at only about 2 percent annually. Sri Lanka's
tea production has been stagnant over the past decade, but with improved pro-
ductivity Sri Lanka could increase export earnings by securing a share of this
world expansion in demand. However, the production of these three crops has
been adversely affected by Government policies; in particular, profit margins
have been continually squeezed through tax and pricing policies with the re-
sult that investment, productivity and quality have declined. An Agriculture
Sector Mission visited Sri Lanka during July to review the sector's prospects
with the Government.
9.        During 1973, export prices of rubber and coconuts rose sharply as
part of the worldwide price escalation, although the price of the former is
beginning to move down from the peak reached in March 1974; tea prices showed
only a small gain. But, the costs of production also increased sharply, es-
pecially fertilizer. In addition, the FEEC system (the details of this sys-
tem are explained in the frontispiece) prices many input requirements at a
premium but does not offer the same benefit to export selling prices. Al-
though there are various Government subsidy schemes for replanting and fer-
tilizer, the net effect of the all round increase in prices has been only
some limited improvement in the profitability of rubber. In the case of
coconuts, production was depressed because of continued drought and disease,
which led to the banning of exports for a period. In the case of tea, the
combined effect of only a marginal increase in price and high costs of pro-
duction led to yet further declines in profitability.
10.       The Government has made attempts over the past few years to in-
crease domestic production of food crops, especially rice. Paddy produc-
tion reached a peak of 1.3 million tons in 1970, but has been sharply down
since then largely on account of drought from 1971 to 1973. A renewed drive
to raise production was initiated in 1973. Priority has been given to the
supply of inputs and the procurement price of paddy has been raised pro-
gressively from Rs 18 per bushel in April 1973 to Rs 33 per bushel by July
1974.
11.       Special efforts have been directed towards irrigation and coloni-
zation programmes. Hitherto, inefficient use of water and inadequate main-
tenance of facilities have hampered the expansion of production, especially
in the dry zone, where potential for raising crop yields and double-cropping
is considerable.
12.       The production of certain vegetable crops, such as onions, pota-
toes, and chillies, has been greatly stimulated through the ban,ning of im-
ports. Initially, prices rose very much, but a reasonable balance between
supply and demand has evolved, with the country now being self-sufficient.
13.       Industry.  The manufacturing sector contributes about 14 percent
of GDP and provides employment for about 420,000 people or about 11 percent
of total employment. During 1973 growth in the sector was negligible and,



what is most disturbing, there was very little new investment. An important
factor, apart from the shortage of foreign exchange for equipment and the
slow growth in the economy, has been the uncertainty surrounding the role
of private ownership and the curbs on income. The sector has also been
plagued by low capacity utilization of the order of only 30-50 percent for
many industries, because of the chronic shortage of raw materials and spare
parts. In these circumstances, it is difficult to assess the efficiency
of industry although the results of a series of plant visits set out in
paragraphs 39 to 49 provide some insight into the potential of this sector.
14.       Industrial activity is primarily directed towards meeting consumer
demand and to supplying a modest range of engineering goods. More recently
exports have assumed some importance. The consumer goods industry is impor-
tant not only as a means of providing incentives for wage labor but also of
providing employment. In the latter context, textiles are significant as
this industry provides about 25 percent of employment in the sector. As
export sales of textile manufactures, especially garments, are expanding,
this industry is of added importance to the economy.
15.       The Government's policy towards industry is based upon defining
the respective roles of public sector corporations and of the private
sector. The Government has decided that the public sector should under-
take those projects which are likely to dominate the local market. In
view of the small size of Sri Lanka's economy, this means that public
sector ownership is quite widespread with 33 percent of value added in
the sector coming from this source. In aggregate terms, the return achieved
by these corporations has been fair, but there is of course some variation
among enterprises. Petroleum, chemicals, paper, steel and ceramics have
generally been profitable while the multi-product engineering group, State
Hardware Corporation, has incurred substantial losses.
16.       The role of the private sector has been primarily to produce con-
sumer goods for domestic consumption. The Government has placed emphasis
upon the use of local raw materials, employment generation and location
in backward areas. More recently the private sector has been encouraged
to produce for export. However, a plethora of regulations to control the
private sector has, in many instances, acted as a serious disincentive for
private business to fulfill this role. Consumer goods production is domi-
nated by textiles which have faced grave difficulty in obtaining sufficient
raw materials to operate at much above 30 percent utilization. Exports of
textiles, largely in the form of made up garments, have expanded rapidly
over the past three years, and even though the import content is about 75
percent, the employment generated is an important factor in the Sri Lanka
context. At the same time the requirements for processing export and other
crops has led to the establishment of a competent engineering goods indus-
try. The manufacture of agricultural processing equipment, in particular
tea machinery, is quite competitive by international standards, but export
potential has been severely hampered by shortage of raw materials and by
uncertainty over allocations of foreign exchange.



- 5 -
17.       In addition to textiles, the private sector has been expanding
exports of small consumer items, leather and rubber products, and most
notably gems. Overall, the value of industrial goods exports went up by
30 percent in 1973, while during 1974 it is expected to be double the level
of 1972. In particular earnings from gems have gone up rapidly from US$2
million in 1972 to an expected US$19 million in 1974.
18.       Exporters receive considerable tax incentives.   They are also
allocated a small percentage of their earnings to use freely for imports
of consumer items or manufacturing requirements; in the case of gems, the
allocation is more liberal. In addition, they receive a premium of 65 per-
cent under the FEEC system on all foreign exchange earned which more than
offsets the cost of their imports for which the 65 percent premium also has
to be paid. This incentive package has undoubtedly provided a considerable
stimulus to exporters, but one serious problem remains. An exporter has no
way of knowing what raw material imports he may be allowed and hence he has
grave difficulty in bidding for an export order until he has secured his
imported raw material allocation.
Short Term Prospects
19.       Prospects over the next twelve months, July 1974 to June 1975, are
very mixed. In agriculture, rice production is likely to show some increase
following the good Maha harvest (spring harvest which usually accounts for
three quarters of total production). Of the export crops, tea production
is likely to be 6 percent lower than 1973 as production has been adversely
affected by weather conditions. Exports of rubber should improve, while
the resumption of coconut exports will make a substantial contribution to
foreign exchange earnings, although these exports will be well below the
volume achieved prior to the drought in 1972/73. Export prices for rubber
and coconuts rose sharply during 1973 and early 1974 but the extent to which
these prices will be maintained is problematical.
20.       In industry, prospects depend in large part upon the availability
of imported raw materials. Present indications are that availability may
not be appreciably more over the period 1974/75 than during 1973/74, on
account of the large amount of foreign exchange required for imports of
food and fertilizer.
21.       On the budget, the Government announced proposals in October 1973
for reducing the cost of food subsidies. In particular, apart from the free
rice ration, rice supplies were to be charged at cost, while the prices of
flour and sugar were also to be increased. However, the price of imported
commodities rose so sharply in late 1973 and early 1974 that instead of
these measures resulting in a reduction of the food subsidy, it is now ex-
pected to be approximately double the amount forecast in the 1974 budget.
In an effort to cope with the situation, the Government introduced further
fiscal measures on July 10 and July 31. Flour prices have been increased
to the point that flour is no longer subsidized, the subsidy on fertilizer
supplied to paddy growers has been removed and the guaranteed price of paddy



- 6 -
has been increased from Rs 30 per bushel to Rs 33 to offset the loss of the
fertilizer subsidy. The retail price of rice distributed by the Government,
however, has been slightly lowered. The Government also anticipates substan-
tially higher receipts from the ad valorem export tax on tea, arising from
increased tea prices, and seeks to stimulate rubber replanting by increasing
the replanting subsidy by about 33%. The combined effect of these changes
is estimated to produce a current account deficit of about Rs 9 million as
compared to the budget forecast of a surplus of Rs 229 million. Overall,
the budget deficit, originally forecast at Rs 900 million, is now estimated
to be about Rs 1,400 million.
22.       Regarding the balance of payments, the deficit on current account
is expected to increase from US$183 million estimated early in 1974 to US$235
million, as compared with $38 million in 1973. This deterioration is largely
on account of the unexpectedly high import cost of food and the further price
increases of oil and fertilizer. However, prospects for higher aid disburse-
ments and other receipts have been improving with the result that despite the
larger deficit on current account, the overall financing gap is expected to
be reduced from US$125 million forecast in April at the time of the Economic
Report to the more recent estimate (August) of US$79 million (Annex IV). The
improvement in receipts is attributable in considerable measure to an increase
in grants, notably for food, and in supplierst credits. It is also due to the
fact that, more recently, Sri Lanka has been allocated about US$38 million by
the IMF from the Special Oil Facility of which a drawing of US$13 million was
approved on August 9. A decision on withdrawal of the balance has yet to be
made.
Role of External Assistance
23.       In the past, external assistance to Sri Lanka has been substantial
with commitments averaging about US$7 per capita annually between 1966 and
1972. Total external public debt of over one year was US$713 million on
December 30, 1973 including an undisbursed balance of US$237 million. Terms
and conditions of aid have been improving over the past five years. Debt
service payments amounted to US$54 million in 1973, to give a debt service
ratio of about 12 percent.
24.       At the Aid Group meeting in Paris in May 1974, the members gave
indications which could result in commitments for 1974 amounting to US$163
million, which compares with commitments in 1972 of US$54 million and in
1973 of US$67 million. A substantial part of this increase, US$65 million,
relates to financing of a proposed fertilizer plant and thus will not be
fully disbursed until this project has been carried out. It is also ex-
pected that commitments totalling US$35 million will be proposed by the
Bank Group in FY75, including this proposed credit. An important feature
of Aid Group assistance in 1974 is the emphasis on quick disbursement,
which has been an important factor in the expected doubling of gross dis-
bursements from the Aid Group during 1974 (Annex V).



- 7 -
25.       Other sources of foreign exchange are the IMP, suppliers' credits
and short term credits. In addition to assistance from the Special Oil
Facility mentioned in paragraph 22, the IMF has approved standby arrange-
ments resulting in a net gain of US$7 million. Suppliers' credits are ex-
pected to increase sharply from US$15 million in 1973 to US$42 million in
1974, while short-term liabilities (less than one year) may decrease mar-
ginally. With Sri Lanka's current debt service ratio of about 12 percent,
the increase in suppliers' credit is not unreasonable given the extremely
difficult balance of payments situation which the country faces. However,
the addition of large amounts of debt on hard terms, which includes both
suppliers' credit and short-term credits, should be kept under careful
control. In this context, the stabilization of indebtedness in respect
of short term and suppliers' credits is an objective of the ceilings set
by the IMF on this type of borrowing.
The Case for Non-Project Assistance
26.       The case for non-project assistance stems from Sri Lanka's urgent
need for a rapid transfer of resources, a need vastly aggravated by the de-
terioration of Sri Lanka's terms of trade, making Sri Lanka one of the coun-
tries most adversely affected by the recent worldwide inflation. The justi-
fication for providing non-project assistance at this time is that, since
last Fall, the Government has begun to show a new realism in dealing with
its economic problems and political courage in introducing some unpopular
fiscal measures. Further adjustments will have to be made and progress will
be reviewed later this year. If progress is satisfactory, we may wish to
propose a second program credit of US$10-15 million for presentation to the
Executive Directors during the first half of Calendar 1975.
27.       The Government made a substantial effort in the 1974 budget to
improve performance and mobilize resources for development. Since then
the unexpectedly large increases in import prices and the failure of tea,
the main export earner, to benefit significantly from the general rise of
world commodity prices, has, unfortunately, offset much of this effort.
In particular, the measures proposed by the Government in October 1973 to
reduce the cost of food subsidies have been frustrated by the exceptional
increase in the price of imported food. Although there are indications
that these prices may decline during the latter part of 1974 and early
1975 the Government felt impelled to secure the country's food supplies
for 1974 and consequently concluded most contracts at the peak of the
markets.
28.       The Government introduced additional fiscal measures on July 10
and July 31 to reduce the prospective budget deficit (paragraph 21). How-
ever, the presently estimated budget outturn for 1974 is a serious problem.
The possibility of achieving a major improvement this year is limited. Of
particular concern is the absence of public savings, the overall deficit
and the increased use of expansionary borrowing from the domestic banking
system. If prices of imported foodstuffs do not rise, the local prices of
food distributed through Government channels and set in late 1973 and early



- 8 -
1974 should cover the cost of supplies, thus there is a reasonable prospect
that the budget requirements for meeting the cost of food subsidies in 1975
may be significantly reduced.
29.       The need for non-project assistance also emerges from the balance
of payments forecast which relies heavily on the assumption that aid dis-
bursements during 1974 will accelerate.   If this assumption does not prove
correct, then the increased food, fertilizer and petroleum costs cannot be
offset and as a result imports for industry will have to be compressed fur-
ther.  Over the past three years, there has been little or no increase in
the value of imports allocated to the industrial sector with the result
that, in real terms, the level of imports has been declining. Capacity
utilization is around 30-50 percent for many enterprises and without fur-
ther imported materials, the unemployment situation will be aggravated and
essential consumer demand will not be met. Furthermore, Sri Lanka's net
external reserves are negligible and thus there is no cushion to finance
any shortfall in receipts.
30.       This credit is predicated on the assumption that the Government
will persist in its efforts to implement economic reforms, in particular
to permit greater play of market forces through more realistic pricing of
agricultural products; to adjust welfare policies including food subsidies,
so that adequate resources are available for investment; and to stimulate
through incentives improvements in both agricultural and industrial produc-
tivity.
PART II - BM4K GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
31.       Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the
Bank Group has made seven loans totalling US$73.5 million and six credits
totalling US$34.6 million (net of cancellations) in support of twelve proj-
ects. About 80 percent of Bank Group assistance has been for power and
irrigation, and the remainder for DFC operations, land reclamation, high-
ways and, most recently, dairy development. Three early power projects and
the first DFC project were satisfactorily completed and the loans fully dis-
bursed by 1970. A credit for highways was cancelled in 1970, after disburse-
ment of US$0.6 million, at the request of the Borrower following Government's
decision to make major changes in the scope of the project. The remaining
eight loans and credits have all been made since 1968. Implementation of
ongoing projects has suffered delays, due in large part to the civil disturb-
ances of 1971, but is proceeding satisfactorily at this time. IFC's only
investment in Sri Lanka, US$3.25 million in Pearl Textile Mills, Ltd. (Cey-
lon), was made in January 1970 but cancelled the same year at the request of
the Company. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations
as of July 31, 1974 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
32.       The Bank Group's strategy is designed to help alleviate the for-
eign exchange constraint by supporting measures to increase agricultural



output, both for import substitution and export expansion, and to help
stimulate industrial production and investment. In the immediate future,
program lending as proposed under this credit is justified to finance im-
ports of essential industrial and agricultural production inputs.    A re-
view (paragraph 26) will take place later in 1974 on the economic situation
and on the implementation of policy measures, before a second program credit
is presented.   Proposals for agricultural sector lending will be considered
after the Agricultural Review Mission, which visited Sri Lanka in July, has
completed its report.
33.       Project lending will also continue.   A third project for the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon for the financing of industrial
and tourism sub-projects is scheduled for presentation to the Executive
Directors in the second half of FY75. A project for irrigation rehabili-
tation is being prepared with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Programme and is tentatively scheduled for presentation in early FY76.
34.       The Bank Group presently accounts for about 11 percent (and the
Bank alone for about 7 percent) of Sri Lanka's total external debt outstand-
ing and about 8 percent (with IDA negligible) of debt service. In three
years the Bank Group's share in total external debt is projected to rise to
about 12 percent (and the Bank's share alone to fall to less than 6 percent),
while the Bank and IDA shares in the debt service will remain at their cur-
rent levels.
PART III - THE PROJECT
35.       The Government of Sri Lanka has asked the Association for program
assistance in order to achieve more efficient utilization of existing facil-
ities in agriculture, industry and selected services through imports of raw
materials, components and spares. Ihe Association agreed to appraise a credit
of US$15 million for this purpose and a mission visited Sri Lanka from June 17
to 28. Negotiations were held in Washington on August 16, 1974. The Govern-
ment was represented by Ambassador Kanakaratne. A Credit and Project summary
is attached as Annex III.
36.       The credit has been designed to assist Sri Lanka to finance urgently
needed imports, which are based on the balance of payments forecast and for-
eign exchange availability. Eleven groups of manufacturing enterprises have
been selected on the basis of their priority to the economy in terms of the
need for particular products, export potential and employment generation
(page 11). Total foreign exchange requirement for these enterprises for the
period September 1974 to June 1975 is US$85 million (of which US$21 million
is expected to be required between September and December 1974). About US$13
million is expected to be disbursed from the credit for the requirements of
these enterprises. The credit will also finance spare parts for equipment
operated by four different groups of users who have been selected on account
of their importance to the economy and amongst whom users of transportation



- 10 -
equipment figure prominently. About US$2 million is expected to be disbursed
for this purpose.
37.       The list of eligible groups, the estimate of foreign exchange re-
quirements and IDA participation are summarized below. The proposed IDA
allocations are only indicative so that actual disbursement will depend upon
the flow of imports. The import requirements of the eligible sectors show
wide diversity but steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, wood pulp, raw cot-
ton and cotton yarn, engineering components and spares will be among the prin-
cipal items to be financed from the credit.

38.       The credit has been designed to permit rapid disbursement.   About
US$5 million should be withdrawn during the last quarter of 1974; the bal-
ance should be disbursed in the early part of 1975. A review of the prin-
cipal manufacturing and service groups was carried out during appraisal and
the results are summarized below. Annex IX shows some data obtained from a
sample survey of eligible manufacturing enterprises.
Eligible Manufacturing Sectors
39.       Agricultural engineering broadly comprises two groups, makers of
production line items such as agricultural implements, pumps and sprayers,
and jobbing metal workshops which serve the agricultural products process-
ing industry. Many of the larger plants also make non-agriculture-related
products. Among the agricultural implements, a type of hoe called a mam-
moty is the main farming tool in Sri Lanka. The Products Division of State
Hardward Corporation is the principal maker of mammoties, with an installed
capacity of 360,000 units per year on 3 shifts. Production in 1973 attained
340,000 units, but quality improvement, especially with regard to the forging
technology, is necessary. Production of all other farming tools such as axes
and forks totalled around 50,000 units per year. Production of farm imple-
ments in the private sector is limited to small-scale blacksmith shop opera-
tions. Water pumps are produced by five private sector firms; their combined
output in 1973 was under 5,000 pump sets, representing an average capacity
utilization of around 30% on 2 shifts. Production in 1972 was even lower.
Part of the problem is the high cost of imported engines and small imported
parts. Several large metalworking complexes in the private sector have the
capability to build complete lines of tea machinery for the modernization of
tea factories as well as for export. They also make rubber rollers and coco-
nut dryers. Engineering know-how is considerable. Capacity utilization is
difficult to estimate, but is probably low largely on account of the shortage
of raw materials and components; the shortage of foundry-grade pig iron and
coke is particularly acute.
40.       Agricultural products processing.   Fruit canning, powdered milk
processing, primary processing of tea, rubber, and coconuts as well as oils
and fats processing are included in this category. This group is vital to
the three major export crops and for processing local food requirements.
Performance is rather variable as is capacity utilization. The group needs
a variety of imported items including jute bags, cans, and chemicals. There
is also a need for further resource development, such as development of vege-
table-oil based products and industrial fibre development - possibly kenaf -
for packing and pulping applications.
41.       Pulp, paper and paper products.   The Eastern Paper Mills, a state
enterprise, is the sole producer of paper and paper board in the country,
with capacities of 10,500 tons per year of printing and writing paper and
12,000 tons per year of paper board. The mills are operating near 90% of
capacity on 3 shifts and output in 1973 totalled 19,000 tons valued at over
Rs 50 million. A second -ntegrated pulp and paper mill is scheduled for
completion in 1976 and will have an installed capacity of 15,000 tons per



- 12 -
year of printing and writing paper, raising the total annual capacity in this
category to 25,500 tons. Although reliable market data are not available,
there is a possibility of excess capacity in writing and printing paper, where-
as an estimated 30,000 tons per year or more of industrial paper (for cement
bags, etc.) and newsprint will still be imported. The advisability of incor-
porating machinery at the new plant which will permit changes in the product
mix should be considered. Paper products are made mostly by small firms in
the private sector that get their paper and paperboard supplies from the mills
and convert them into exercise books, bags and cartons. These and related
downstream activities employ about 15,000 workers and the 1973 output was
around Rs 40 million. At the paper mills, rice straw is the only indigenous
pulping material used; it is a low grade short-fibre pulp and requires blend-
ing with imported long-fibre wood pulp. The extent of blending varies with
the paper grade produced, but on the average, imported pulp accounts for over
50% by value of the total material cost. In 1973, almost Rs 20 million worth
of imported pulp was used. The early development of an alternative domestic
pulping material such as kenaf, banana stalk and bamboo to partially substi-
tute for imported wood pulp should be given priority.
42.       Packing and containers. The importance of this industry derives
from its direct link with the agricultural products processing industry,
particularly the export of tea. The principal products are tea chests made
of plywood and various containers made of plastic, tin or paper. The Ceylon
Plywood Corporation, a state enterprise, is the sole domestic supplier of
tea chest panels. Its two fact:ories have a combined capacity of over 100
million square feet of plywood, but production in 1972 and 1973 was far below
capacity at around 30 million square feet. An estimated 85% of plywood pro-
duction goes into tea chest panels; in 1973, 1.6 million tea chest panel sets
were produced which satisfied less than half the country's requirement. The
balance was met from imports. There is a shortage of log supply, and supple-
mentation with rubber wood has not proved satisfactory. Further, the conver-
sion rate of raw timber into plywood is only about 30 percent. It is these
factors which have largely affected production at the plywood factories.
Plastic and tin containers are all made in the private sector, using imported
raw materials. There are some eight producers of polyethylene films and bags
and ten producers of tin containers. In addition, there are five suppliers
of tea chest fittings made from imported tinplate waste. Most are small en-
terprises, the larger units employing about 100 workers. Capacity utiliza-
tion declined in 1973 to less than 40% from an average of about 50% in the
preceding two years due to raw material shortages. Their raw material situa-
tion reflects a worldwide trend of shortages and sharp price increases, but
they are less able to cope with the situation than in many other countries
since they cannot buy in quantity to secure price benefits and improve de-
livery schedules. The landed price of tinplate increased from an average of
Rs 1520/ton in 1972 to Rs 2840/ton in 1973, and of polyethylene powder from
Rs 1300/ton in 1972 to Rs 2630/ton in 1973.
43.       Base metals are dominated by two state corporations, Ceylon Steel
and the foundry division of State Hardware. These enterprises mainly produce
materials for construction and public works, and are weakly linked to the



- 13 -
manufacturers of engineering products. The Ceylon Steel Corporation has an
installed capacity of 72,000 tons in its rolling mill and 12,000 tons in its
wire mill, and produces angles, reinforcement bars and wire products from
imported billets. Production attained a high of 40,000 tons in 1972, but
declined to 29,000 tons in 197`. For the current year, as of June 1974,
12,000 tons of billets were received and 15,000 tons are on order for the
balance of the year, which is considerably below the requirement to maintain
production even at the 1973 level. However, aside from the import question,
the market should be studied to determine the extent of market constraint on
production at the steel plant. The State Hardware Foundry began operation
in 1969 with an installed capacity of 9,000 tons on three shifts. Production
in 1973 attained 4,000 tons, but 90% of output was cast iron spun pipes, pipe
fittings and manhole covers for urban drainage and water distribution systems.
Only about 400 tons were ingots sold to local industries or exported. In the
private sector, there are captive as well as small independent foundries pro-
ducing industrial castings including machinery parts. All are cupola opera-
tions, which require good-quality pig iron and coke. Because of shortages,
variable quality and high costs of these inputs, the operations are subject
to excessive casting defects and high conversion costs. The first steel
foundry in the country is operating on a pilot scale at Ceylon Steel, and
is expected to be fully operational by the end of 1974.
44.       Agricultural and industrial chemicals.   The chemical industry
in the private sector is comprised of producers of consumer end-products.
Soap is the largest production item at over Rs 50 million in annual output.
Paints and pharmaceuticals are next at around Rs 20 million. Other products
include cosmetics, matches, toothpaste, inks and candles with a total value
of Rs 10 million, or below. Linkages back along the processing chain are
limited to only caustic soda, liquid chlorine and hydrochloric acid produced
from salt by the state-owned Paranthan Chemicals Corporation. In agro-chemi-
cals, the country is totally reliant on imports; there are half a dozen pro-
ducers of pesticides and insecticides, but they are formulation plants that
import and simply blend the active ingredients.
45.       Cables and wires comprise three firms in the private sector with
combined employment and output in 1973 of 240 and Rs 12 million respectively.
Capacity utilization declined in 1973 to considerably below 50% due to short-
ages of copper and aluminum. Generally, the electrical products sector of
Sri Lanka is at an infant stage, with production limited to small household
items such as fans, bulbs and lighting accessories. The first plant to make
electrical motors began production of units up to 15 HP in April 1974 with
an initial target of 3,000 units per year; all electrical components will
be imported with the exception of wires.
46.       Auto ancillaries serve largely the domestic repair and replace-
ment markets. The more significant products of this industry are tires
and battery containers which use locally produced rubber. In truck and
auto tires, the state-owned Sri Lanka Tyre Corporation enjoys a monopoly
in the sizes which it makes. Production in 1973 totalled 100,000 tires,
corresponding to a capacity utilization of 75%, which was a drop from the



- 14 -
1972 high of over 110,000 tires. Part of the reason is that although local
rubber is used, imported materials including tire cord and chemicals account
for over 80% by value of the raw material costs, and procurement of imported
materials fell short of consumption by 20 to 30 percent in 1972 and 1973.
Product quality and cost should also be improved. Auto batteries are pro-
duced by six private sector enterprises for the domestic market as well as
for export. However, because the advantage from having local rubber avail-
able is of considerably less significance in the finished product, the sup-
ply of battery containers to overseas makers of batteries could be more
competitive for Sri Lanka than the direct export of batteries. Springs
and other parts are also produced in the private sector.
47.       Leather and leather products.   The Ceylon Leather Products Corpora-
tion, a state enterprise, operates the principal tannery in the country. It
supplies roughly 50% of finished leather for the domestic market, the balance
being supplied by eleven tanneries in the private sector. Leather production
in 1973 totalled around Rs 15 million. The state tannery has been operating
at, or near, full capacity on a one-shift basis, and it is planned to expand
production in the near future by operating two shifts, when new machinery
has been acquired. Import requirements are mainly chemicals and machinery
parts, with the value of chemicals comprising about 50% of the direct mate-
rial costs. This is a primary export item for Sri Lanka, but the quality of
raw hides needs to be improved. Cattle hides are mostly collected from small
suppliers and they tend to be marred so that, on the average, only about 20%
of available hides are usable and only 3 to 4% are of export quality. Foot-
wear and other leather goods are made by the state enterprise as well as some
70 private sector firms. Output in 1973 totalled Rs 60 million. To achieve
any significant export of finished goods the manufacturers would require
access to updated designs, since the products are fashion-sensitive.
48.       Mining industry covers the extraction of minerals such as graphite,
ilemnite, and rutile as well as gems. Local graphite is of a very high qual-
ity and it is all exported. The gem industry includes not only mining but
also finishing and polishing; gems have become a major export item with earn-
ings having gone up from US$2 million in 1972 to US$18 million in 1973. Im-
port requirements are for explosives, drills, bits and chemicals.
49.       Textile industry comprises National Textile, a state corporation,
with its two operating mills and a third under construction, and a large
private sector that includes modern integrated mills. It relies on imported
cotton and synthetic yarn, chemicals and spare parts. Nevertheless, it pro-
vides a substantial amount of employment, over 100,000 jobs or 25 percent of
employment in the industrial sector. In addition there is export potential
especially for made-up garments. Capacity utilization although still low
at 30 percent or so for some mills, has been improving but mills using syn-
thetics suffered a setback in 1973 from a shortage of imported fibres.

Eligible Service Sectors
50.       Transportation services have been most adversely affected by the
lack of spare parts. While the life of trucks and buses has been extended
with great skill and ingenuity, the majority of vehicles will need addi-
tional spares if they are to be kept going. The railways and ports face
similar difficulties and so without an injection of the most urgently needed
spares, transport services will deteriorate further at great cost to the eco-
nomy.
51.       Agricultural production is dependent upon keeping the existing
stock of tractors, pumps, and irrigation machinery in service, and the lack
of spares is affecting the effective utilization of investment not only in
agricultural machinery but also in civil works, especially irrigation sys-
tems, and in inputs such as fertilizer.
52.       Power generation is largely hydroelectric, but there is one major
thermal plant and a number of small plants, most of which are operating well
below capacity for lack of spares.
Administration of the Credit
53.       The Financial Regulations (1966) of the Government require, for
public sector corporations and agencies, international competitive bidding
procedures that are consistent with the Bank Group's guidelines for procure-
ment. However, the Regulations also provide for flexibility where interna-
tional competitive bidding is not appropriate. Under present international
trading conditions for commodities, this flexibility is highly desirable.
Consequently, under this credit, public sector corporations and agencies
would be required, in respect of orders for more than U.S.$50,000 for goods
other than spare parts, to invite offers from at least three suppliers and
award the contract to the lowest evaluated offer (Schedule 3 of the Devel-
opment Credit Agreement). Spare parts for existing equipment will be pur-
chased through normal commercial channels. Goods to be bought by private
enterprises will also be procured through normal commercial channels. The
Central Bank of Ceylon will retain all documentation relating to bidding
and award of contracts by public sector corporations and agencies for re-
view by the Association during supervision missions.
54.       The proceeds of the credit will be disbursed against the CIF cost
of imports. Withdrawal applications will be prepared by the Central Bank
of Ceylon and forwarded to the Association. In accordance with Bank Group
procedure, withdrawal applications will be accompanied by shipping documents,
supplier's invoice and evidence of payment. In the case of withdrawal appli-
cations for procurement by public sector corporations and agencies for goods
other than spare parts, the Central Bank of Ceylon will also submit a state-
ment that the purchasing corporation or agency has certified that procurement
has been in accordance with the Procurement Schedule of the Development Credit
Agreement (Schedule 3 of the Development Credit Agreement).



- 16 -
55.       Eligible enterprises and organizations have on order goods which
have been procured in accordance with the procedures proposed under this
credit. Those orders on which payment is made after the signing of the
credit will be eligible for reimbursement under this credit. Disbursement
of about one third the credit amount is expected by December 31, 1974; the
balance should be disbursed over the succeeding six months. However, to
make allowance for possible delays in delivery, the closing date has been
set 15 months after signing of the agreement.
Counterpart Fund
56.       The Government has agreed to the creation of a Counterpart Fund,
within the Central Bank, using rupee proceeds obtained from the sale of for-
eign exchange provided for the purchase of items financed from the credit
(Section 4.02 of the Development Credit Agreement). The Fwnd would be used
exclusively for development expenditures shown in the 1974 and forthcoming
1975 budgets. The Central Bank would maintain an account for the Fund and
a monthly statement of expenditures would be prepared and submitted, within
two weeks after the end of each month, to the Association for review.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Sri Lanka and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
58.       Features of the Development Credit. Agreement of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 53, 54 and 56 of this Report.
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. No. 121    -    Lift Irrigation Project; US$2 million of June 19,
1968; Original Closing Date: June 30, 1973,
Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Construction is about two years behind the appraisal schedule,
but most problems causing the delay - government change, reorganization,
insurrection in 1971, strikes in 1972 and inadequate repair facilities -
have been solved since 1973 and little further slippage is expected. In
particular, problems of maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment
are considerably reduced, since the repair shops recently completed are
now operational. Savings from the disbursement category for civil works
have recently been reallocated to allow purchase of additional vehicles
for irrigation and agricultural staff in order to improve supervision
and operation of the project. The project is now expected to be completed
by the end of 1974 and the credit fully disbursed and the area fully ir-
rigated by the revised Closing Date of December 31, 1975.
Ln. No. 634    -    Second Development Finance Corporation Project;
US$3 million of July 18, 1969; Original Closing
Date: December 31, 1973, Revised Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
Because of the slowdown in economic activities, there were delays
in committing funds and the original Closing Date of December 31, 1973 has
been postponed for a second time from December 31, 1974 to December 31, 1975,
to allow sufficient time for presentation of new sub-projects to the Bank
and the completion of disbursement. Helped by Government's policy to en-
courage tourism and non-traditional exports, commitments under the loan
picked up in 1973 and were completed by last December. Loan disbursements
are expected to be completed by the revised Closing Date.
Ln. No. 636    -    Maskeliya Ova Power Project, US$16.5 million
of July 28. 1969; Original Closing Date:
September 30, 1973, Revised Closing Date:
December 31, 1974
The first unit of 50 MW was commissioned in February 1974, about
1-1/2 years later than originally estimated. The second unit is expected
to be commissioned shortly. Delays were caused mainly by problems associated
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the un-
derstanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

with the appointment of acceptable consultants, landslides in the penstock
area and various strikes in manufacturers' factories. Site work has in
general been carried out satisfactorily. There may be some savings in
foreign exchange costs which the Ceylon Electricity Board, the beneficiary,
wishes to utilize for financing the first stage of a much needed system
control center. Details of the equipment required are being prepared by
CEB. The original Closing Date of September 30, 1973 has been extended to
December 31, 1974, but a further extension may be required to allow for
completion of disbursements, including retention payments for major equipment
and for the control center.
Cr. No. 168    -    Land Reclamation and Drainage Project; US$2.5
million of November 13, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974
Construction is about two years behind schedule (for the same
reasons as under Credit 121 above), but all necessary equipment is now on
order and no further delays are anticipated. The project is expected to
be completed by December 1976, which would necessitate extension of the
Closing Date. Allocation of the proceeds of the credit has recently been
modified to permit purchase of additional equipment and vehicles to improve
engineering and agricultural supervision in the widespread project area.
Ln. No. 653 and Cr. No. 174 - Mahaweli Ganga Development Project
(Irrigation/Power); US$14.5 million
each, botn of January 30, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The expected date of first water deliverv is now one and a half
years behind the appraisal schedule and overall completion of the project
is expected to be November 1975, nearly a year behind appraisal target.
Delays were due mainly to foundation problems at Polgolla power house and
a slow start at Bowatenna diversion dam. Construction is now progressing
satisfactorily. Good progress has been recorded to date on agricultural
extension and research in the project area. Total project costs have
increased by about 10% largely as a result of rising costs for electro-
mechanical equipment. Cost overruns are being met by reallocation from
the Unallocated category of disbursements. The Loan and Credit are ex-
pected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 372    -    Power Transmission and Distribution Project;
US$6.0 million of April 18, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
Preparation for construction is proceeding satisfactorily. Bids
for imported equipment and materials have been received and bid evaluation
has been cleared by the Association for the award of contracts to the value
of about ITS$5 million equivalent. Bids for remaining items are expected
to be received by the Association shortly.

SRI LANKA PROGRAM CREDIT
SURVEY OF THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
1.        As part of the appraisal of this credit, a sample survey of manu-
facturing enterprises in the eligible sub-sectors chosen for this credit was
carried out in Sri Lanka from June 12-28, 1974. Data for 1973 were obtained
on about 300 enterprises; these data are summarized in Table 1. A question-
naire was completed by 35 of the major enterprises employing approximately
30,000 workers or 7 percent of total employment in manufacturing. Eighteen
of these enterprises were visited. On the basis of this survey and discuss-
ions with the Government, three major topics are discussed here, namely, the
management and structure of the industrial sector, factors affecting produc-
tion and export performance.
A.   The Management and Structure of the Industrial Sector
2.        The Five-Year Plan (1972-1976) contains a program for industrial
development but hitherto there has been no comprehensive statement of in-
dustrial policy. Instead, policy has emerged from a series of pronounce-
ments over time which have provided the basis for licensing and regulating
industry. The government's main concern has been to define broad areas
for public and private investment. The principal policies governing estab-
lishment of public sector corporations have been where:
(a) The economies of scale and the limited size of the
domestic market mean that only one plant is likely
to be economic (i.e. steel, petroleum, cement,
paper and tires).
(b) The Government decides to take the lead in providing
inputs for other manufacturing activities. The
Government either operates a monopoly (i.e. oils
and fats processing and chemicals) or enters into
competition with the private sector (i.e. tanning,
foundry work and metal fabrication).
(c) The Government wishes to expand output with particular
concern for employment generation and in competition
with the private sector (i.e. textiles and hardware).
(d) A foreign investor wants a joint venture with the
Government for export-oriented production (i.e.
ceramics); a fairly recent development.
3.        The private sector has been encouraged to produce consumer goods
for export. In addition, a variety of engineering goods are manufactured,
primarily for the domestic market. Joint ventures with foreign firms for



ANNEX IX
Page 2
export-oriented production have been encouraged following a white paper
prepared in 1972 (Policy of the Government of Sri Lanka on Private Foreign
Investment).
4.        Industrial policy has been concerned with the generation of em-
ployment opportunities, small scale units, minimizing foreign exchange costs,
and regional dispersion. The large amount of unemployment has caused the
Government to give high priority to creating new jobs.
5.        Because Sri Lanka has very few industrial raw materials, industry
in general has a high percentage of import requirements in relation to total
raw material costs. For steel, textiles, engineering goods and tires, 80
percent of the raw materials used are imported. Although Sri Lanka produces
rubber, tires are included in this group because the value of imported cord
and chemicals is high. For leather and paper products about 50 percent of
value of raw materials is imported, while for plywood and mineral prod-
cts it is 20 percent or less. As Sri Lanka's terms of trade have deterio-
1ated progressively, industrial imports have been compressed, the principal
cau3e of under-utilization of capacity.
o.        Finally, industry is heavily concentrated around Colombo with
90 percent of output being manufactured in this area. Although the Govern-
ment is concerned about regional dispersion, no incentive schemes have been
launched to encourage private investment in other parts of the island. The
Government has established some plants in the more backward areas and it has
been preparing a plan to convert the old naval base at Trincomalee into an
export manufacturing zone.
7.        The management of the sector is faced with formidable difficulties;
the almost total lack of locally produced raw materials, a small market, a
pressing unemployment problem, a chronic shortage of foreign exchange and
an economy which, in real terms, has been declining. In these circumstances,
it is surprising to find that there is no comprehensive statement of policy
to promote industrial development. The weakness of the private sector stems
.i! large part from the heavy disincentive of taxation and previous policies
on investment which has led the public sector more and more to take the ini-
tiative. The private sector also operates in the knowledge that the Govern-
ment has enacted legislation which inhibits expansion. For example, although
the Business Acquisition Act of 1970 has only been invoked in isolated cases
under rather exceptional circumstances, the fact is that this particular
piece of legislation gives Government sweeping powers to nationalize private
industry. Similar powers have been assumed in other sectors for other pur-
poses (i.e. the Estates Transfer and Control Act of 1972 and the Land Reform
Act of 1972) but which nonetheless have added to the general atmosphere of
uncertainty about the place of private ownership and the role of entrepre-
neurship. More recently, the Government has felt compelled to place a
ceiling on incomes (The Ceiling on Incomes Act of 1973) which is likely to
inhibit the mobilization of personal savings for investment in the private
sector.



ANNEX IX
Page 3
8.        Against these rather negative aspects, the Government has estab-
lished an attractive incentive program for exports (paragraphs 13 to 16
below) and has taken considerable initiative in trying to encourage private
foreign investment either in joint ventures with the government or with
private Sri Lanka interests. Progress has been slow but the accelerating
pace of hotel construction by foreign interests in response to tourist
demand is a small but encouraging sign of increased foreign investment.
B.   Factors Affecting Production
9.        Raw Material Shortages.  Most of the manufacturing enterprises in
Sri Lanka are operating at well below capacity. 1/ Shortage of imported
materials is the main reason, although the actual impact of the shortages
is difficult to gauge. The performance of five state enterprises is shown
in Table 2. These enterprises all have moderate to high import dependence
and are either the sole or the dominant production unit in their respective
industries. The values of imported materials used in manufacture have been
estimated from the ratio of imported inputs to total materials used, the
material component of production costs, and the output in a given year.
In 1973, three enterprises operated at 75 percent of capacity, or higher.
Of these Ceylon Steel and National Textile are almost totally dependent
upon imported raw materials. Ceylon Tire is also heavily dependent upon
imports, but rubber is, of course, available locally. Eastern Paper and
Ceylon Leather Tannery are dependent upon imports for about half of their
input needs, but they both had sufficient stock to maintain a high level
of operation in 1973. The apparent drop in capacity utilization at the
paper mill in 1972 was due to the addition of its No. 2 machine which
began production in April 1973. As might be expected, manufacturers have
been adjusting production programs to their anticipated foreign exchange
allocations, while there is also evidence that they have been depleting
the stocks built up earlier. This is fairly typical of the sector as a
whole, although private enterprises have probably had greater difficulty
in building up stocks and in obtaining replenishment, largely because,
in a very tight foreign exchange situation, private sector operations
have a somewhat lower order of priority.
10.       In addition to shortages, prices of imported industrial raw
materials have risen sharply over the past two years, reflecting a
worldwide trend. Although other countries have also had to face this
problem, industry in Sri Lanka is less able than many to cope with the
situation because of deteriorating terms of trade and import capacity.
The price trends of some major imported raw materials are shown below.
1/   See Table 1 for estimated capacity under-utilization of selected
manufacturing industries.

Labor Costs.  Labor costs per unLt of output are not available
but they are undoubtedly higher than they need be. This is because general
-onccrr over employment has led to excessive labor forces in relation to
output and because of the high rate of absenteeism at plants operating at
relatively high levels of capacity. Thus, in general, labor discipline
appears to be poor and production costs have been raised because of the
compulsion to retain larger labor forces than are necessary.
C.   Export Performance
12.       Exports of industrial goods are expected to increase from US$15
million in 1972 to an estimated US$29 million in 1974. Although develop-
ment has taken place from a small initial base, this performance is a
reflection of the Government's efforts to stimulate exports.
13.       Incentives for Export.   Incentives are provided through various
tax exemptions or reliefs, payment of FEECs, custom duty rebates, and im-
port privileges. Tax holidays on profits from export sales are offered to
both new enterprises (8 years) and existing enterprises (5 years). Export
sales are exempt from the turnover tax and personal income receipts from
export profits are excluded from the compulsory saving scheme. Export
oriented investments are encouraged through large initial depreciation
allowances (50-80 percent for machinery) and a development rebate (20-40
percent).
14.       Exporters of industrial goods receive Foreign Exchange Entitle-
ment Certificates (FEEC) which provide a premium of 65 percent over the
parity exchange rate. To the extent that exporters have paid for their
imported raw materials at the FEEC rate, the FEEC rate for exports will
offset these costs. However, as the FEEC rate is based upon the total value



ANNEX IX
Page 5
of exports, the manufacturer receives the premium regardless of import
costs. Thus, the FEEC rate offers a considerable cash incentive if the
domestic input is high.
15.       Custom duty rebates are offered on an assessed percentage basis
which exporters receive directly from commercial banks upon producing
evidence of sale and shipment.
16.       Import privileges are of two kinds.   First, export industries
receive special allocations for imported raw materials provided that ex-
porters can produce irrevocable letters of credit. However, for an ex-
porter to obtain an irrevocable letter of credit, he must commit himself
to fill an order which he may not, and often cannot, meet without assurance
that his imported raw material requirements will be met. This poses a
serious problem for exporters, especially as constraints have made the
availability of foreign exchange very uncertain. A scheme for automatic
replenishment of the import content of exporters needs early consideration.
Secondly, exporters may utilize freely 3 percent of export earnings for any
purpose they wish, including foreign luxury goods. In practice, enterpre-
neurs have shown greater interest in using this concession for their busi-
nesses than importing cars and other luxury items.
17.       Export Performance.   Details of the export of industrial goods,
which include some processed agricultural and fishery products over the
past three years, and the estimated import content, are shown below:

18.       For the three years, 1971 to 1973, and leaving aside sales of
naptha, export production is largely concentrated in goods with low import
content. The exceptions are textiles and garments for which employment
considerations are very important. Although a certain amount of the im-
provement in foreign exchange earnings from industrial exports is attri-
butable to price increases, volume has increased as well. Overall per-
crmance has been reasonable and demonstrates that, in certain sub-sectors,
such as textiles and garments, engineering goods, and leather products, rapid
strides in expanding exports can be achieved. It is surprising to find such
a small margin of foreign exchange earnings from rubber products, but the
difficulty seems to be that most products have high value import require-
ments. The Government is examining prospects for rubber goods manufacture
and clearly, maximizing value-added to the economy from locally grown rubber,
has high priority. Mineral products are based upon extraction of graphite
ilminite and rutile, with Sri Lanka's graphite being of especially high
quality. So far only very limited processing of ores has taken place.
The prospects for industries based upon these minerals, in particular
graphite, have yet to be examined, but manufacture of a range of industrial
goods might well prove feasible and certainly deserves further examination.
19.       Future Prospects.   Industrial export earnings in 1974 will be
heavily influenced by world prices. Nonetheless, the first quarter shows



ANNEX IX
Page 7
some further real progress, especially in the export of garments and en-
gineering goods. Leather goods are also likely to increase substantially
by the end of the year. In order to lay the foundation for continuing
export growth, the Government should give priority to those goods offering
the highest return in terms of foreign exchange. At the same time, a more
consistent system of allocating foreign exchange to exporters is required
in order that they may know their imported raw material situation with cer-
tainty, before they bid for orders. Further, technical know-how for devel-
opment of the rubber and engineering goods industries is essential. In
addition, improvement of leather quality has high priority.
