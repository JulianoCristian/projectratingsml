Palestinian Reform and\n            Development Plan Project (DPG V) is a standalone operation\n            aimed at supporting the Palestinian Authority (PA) in\n            implementing some of the reform priorities under its\n            National Development Plan (NDP) as well as some recently\n            emerged reform priorities. DPG V will support the reforms\n            designed under the NDP in two broad areas: (a) strengthening\n            the PA's fiscal position; and (b) laying the\n            institutional foundations for improved governance and\n            transparency in the public sector. The operation supports\n            efforts seen as crucial by the PA to overcoming the urgent\n            fiscal issues, reducing the PA's reliance on foreign\n            assistance for recurrent expenditures while increasing the\n            efficiency of government expenditure programs. In addition,\n            the operation supports improving governance and transparency\n            in the areas that are important for better management of\n            public finances. DPG V, as envisaged in the 2012-2014\n            interim strategy note, remains a key instrument aimed at\n            supporting the PA's strategic priorities, advancing the\n            policy dialogue, and also providing essential financing for\n            the PA's budget."}, "docdt": "2013-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
