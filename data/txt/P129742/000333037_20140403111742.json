   follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            reform momentum can be safeguarded only through a\n            combination of strong client commitment and assured donor\n            financing for the budget. This operation was nestled within\n            the NDP, was selective in its approach, and leveraged a\n            five-fold additionally in donor financing. These factors\n            created powerful incentives for success, even in a highly\n            difficult political environment, both external and internal.\n            Firm attention to macroeconomic fundamentals is a necessary\n            condition for success. Two implications follow: first,\n            fiscal adjustments have to be adequate; second, the budget\n            has to be adequately financed and this means full and\n            predictable donor financing. Were the fiscal accounts to\n            come under strain, the vital reforms in expenditures will\n            unravel. An effective, relevant and timely data-based\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system can be utilized\n            to assist implementation, take corrective actions, and to\n            provide feedback to future reform design."}, "docdt": "2014-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
