Description:    The Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-2) will
                continue to support the implementation o f Cape Verde's Growth
                 and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRSP). This one-tranche
                operation would be the second o f a planned series o f three annual
                PRSCs. The financial support provided through the PRSC-2 will
                 hrther narrow the gap between the cost o f implementing key
                 elements    o f the  GPRSP     and     resources. available  from
                 Government's own domestic revenues and other donor support. A
                policy dialogue and results-based framework under PRSC-2 will
                 focus on the following pillars o f the GPRSP: (i)   promote good
                 governance; (ii) develop human capital in the areas o f education
                 andhealth; and (iii)improve the effectiveness and sustainability o f
                 the socialprotection system.

Benefits:        Interms of benefits, the value added of the PRSC lies inboth the
                nature o f the instrument and the results that are expected: (i)
                 improved functioning o f national budget systems; (ii)reduced
                 transaction costs and distortions due to international assistance,
                 (iii) linkagesbetweensectorsandcross-cutting issues; (iv)
                     better
                 improved service delivery for the poor; and (v) improved well-
                 beingo fthe population.

Risks:           The main risks associated with PRSC-2 are: (i)     macroeconomic
                 shocks    could   undermine   stability   and   growth;   and  (ii)
                 accumulation o f contingent liabilities and mandatory expenditure
                programs      could  bring about      fiscal  slippages   and stall
                 implementation o f the more sensitive policy reforms, and possibly
                 delays o f the Government implementation strategy.

           A PROPOSED SECOND POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                   I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-2) to Cape Verde for
SDR 7 million (US$10 million equivalent) on standard International Development Association
(IDA) terms supports the implementation o f the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy, as
presented in the document Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) and
summarized in the Letter o f Development Policy in Annex 1. PRSC-2 i s the second in a series
of three annual single-tranche operations.

2.      The proposed PRSC-2 follows up on the first to continue supporting national strategies
and systems for poverty reduction.         The move to supporting poverty reduction through
programmatic lending i s consistent with Cape Verde's level o f institutional, economic and
political development, and it acknowledges the country's strong and sustained performance in
recent years.

3.      The reform program associated with this operation is at the core of IDA'SFY05-08
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), adopted in February 2005. The PRSC series will account
for about 60 percent o f proposed new IDA lending over the next four years. The CAS will
maintain flexibility to employ other Bank instruments in support o f the GPRSP, such as sectoral
investment projects intransport, infrastructure, and HIV/AIDS,

4.      Following the PRSC-I approach, this second operation is prepared in close coordination
with two other budget support partners, the Dutch Cooperation and the European Union,
following a Memorandum o f Understanding signedwith the Government.

5.      The objective of the project is to support the Government to (a) meet the objectives of its
GPRSP; and (b) improve the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency o f the national budget
process as the central mechanism for channeling resources toward poverty reduction. The
proposed PRSC-2 would engage the Bank in policy and technical dialogue in three o f the five
pillars o f the GPRSP, based on the division o f labor with other IDA and donor projects and
comparative advantage o f this lending instrument:
    (a) Promote good governance -especially effectiveness and equity- through reforms inpublic
        expenditure management, civil service, the judiciary, and decentralization.
    (b) Develophumancapital, witha focus onhealthand education.
    (c) Strengthenthe effectiveness and sustainability o f the social protection system.

                                    11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                       A.     COUNTRYOVERVIEW

6.         Cape Verde, despite its small size (population 472,000) and remote archipelago formation,
continues to post strong gains in social and economic advancement.               Cape Verde's growth
performance since the late 80s has raised it to the ranks o f lower middle income countries, with a
GNI per capita o f US$1,800 in 2004. Recent economic growth o f around 2.5 percent per capita
has been sustained through public and private investment based on high levels o f donor support,
strong private capital flows and remittances. Thanks to this growth, poverty has declined by one-
fourth over the last decade, while the human development index has increased from 0.59 in 1990
to 0.67 in 2003.        Adult literacy rates are high (approximately 76 percent in 2002) and life
expectancy at birth (69) is the third highest in Africa. Political openness has accompanied this
economic and social progress. Since the adoption o f a multi-party system in 1991, there have been
three national elections and two orderly changes in the Government. A free press and media
further support the buildingo f an open society. The last presidential and legislative elections took
place inearly 2006.

7.         But challenges remain. As a small, open economy, Cape Verde's vulnerability to external
shocks i s high. The country relies heavily on remittances and foreign aid. This foreign assistance
poses a severe risk o f distortions in public administration if it i s not properly channeled through
government systems (or at least harmonized with them) and may overwhelm the capacity o f the
islands' small group o f technical cadres. Unemployment remains high even though most o f it i s
short-lived, and it i s a main determinant o f poverty. Income inequality has risen and i s generally
worse than in countries o f comparable income levels, creating a potential drag on growth and
threatening social cohesion. Geographical dispersion drives internal inequities and raises the cost
of services. As rural populations flee entrenched poverty, urbanization i s causing increasing social
i l l s and puts pressure on basic services. Overall, the capacity o f the environment to support large-
scale expansion intourism, industry and construction may be at risk ifnot adequately managed.

                    B.     MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                                               OUTLOOK

8.         Macroeconomic performance continues to be strong with significant improvements inmost
indicators, Cape Verde has successfully completed the sixth (and final) review o f its IMF PRGF
program. All end-year quantitative performance criteria under the PRGF-supported program were
met with a substantial marginandmost structural objectiveswere also met.GDP growth slowed to
around 4.5 percent in 2004, mainly as a result o f difficulties in the agricultural sector and in the
execution o f the public investment program. However, the forecast for 2005 looks substantially
stronger, with growth projected to reach about 6 percent. This favorable outlook i s supported by
strong public and private investment, directed largely toward infrastructure development and the
tourism sector, and backed by higher external support. Consumer prices declined by 1.9 percent
on average in 2004, mainly because o f reductions in prices o f food products throughout the year
and the lowering o f customs tariffs inJanuary 2004. In2005, due to the rapid rise inthe oil prices,
inflation increased to 1.4 percent. Estimations for 2006 indicate continuation o f strong economic
growth, with GDP growth expected to reach 7.7 percent, and a further increase in prices, with
inflation expected to stand at 2.6 percent.



                                                    2

9.      The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) in 2004 was 0.2 percent o f GDP, attributable to
the stronger-than-expected performance o f the new VAT introduced inJanuary 2004, which more
than compensated for the decline in revenues from custom duties and excises resulting from the
rationalization o f the trade regime. Recurrent expenditures increased to support priority spending
inhealthand education, andto tackle unexpected difficulties inthe agricultural sector. The deficit
for 2005 has increased to 2.6 percent o f GDP, but i s expected to be fully financed by foreign
inflows. The fiscal impact o f the increasing arrears to the oil companies has led to a rectification o f
the 2005 budget. Nevertheless, the fiscal deficit stands at previous levels, as the amount o f
subsidiespaidto the oil companies is off-set by a correspondent amount intax revenues and donor
inflows, Fiscal slippages have emerged in the past, as a result o f overspending during run-up
elections, but such slippages are not expected to have re-occurred as a consequence o f the 2006
elections, as budget execution i s now more transparent (published on-line) and the Central Bank i s
independent, thus reducing the risk o f monetizing the deficit. Estimations for 2006 indicate that
fiscal deficit will not increase standing at approximately 2.5 percent o f GDP.

10.     Foreign direct investment and donor contributions have helped increase reserves at the
Central Bank to 3.1 months o f imports (higher than the original target for the three-year PRGF
program), supporting the credibility o f the exchange rate to the euro. The current account deficit
as a percentage o f GDP has been decreasing steadily since 2001, falling from 11percent in2002
to 6 percent in 2004, reflecting among other factors improved revenues from tourism, sustained
inflows o f remittances, effective demand management, and diversified import source. The
increase in oil prices had a modest impact in 2004, as it was partially offset by the appreciation
of the euro against the USD.In2005, due to the stabilization o f the USD/euro exchange rate, the
impact o f the sharp increase in oil prices had a more pronounced effect on the imports bill. It i s
estimated that the increase in the oil price has widen the county's financing needs in 2005 by
US$8 million, or 0.7 percent o f GDP. Nonetheless, the larger import bill was partially offset by
the very strong exports performance and thus the current account balance is expected to stand at
4.7 percent o f GDP. Further improvement is expected in 2006. Current account balance is
expected to reach 3.2 percent o f the GDP (including transfers).

11.     Cape Verde's strong overall macroeconomic performance has supported poverty
reduction and paved the way for Cape Verde's eventual graduation to middle-income status.
Nonetheless, the country still faces a number o f challenges to ensure sustained growth. The
economy remains vulnerable to external shocks as a result o f its narrow exports base and heavy
dependence on external concessional financing and remittances. In addition, macroeconomic
management over the medium term will be challenged by the need to balance the public sector
investments required to promote growth and the fiscal deficit limits imposed by the exchange
rate peg.

12.     Pressingstructural issues include finalizing the privatization agenda, resolvingthe on-going
dispute with the privatized utilities, and managing the contingent liabilities and cross-debts
between state entities. While some delays have recently emerged in the government privatization
program, substantial progress i s expected over the coming year inrestructuring and privatizing the
remaining public enterprises on the agenda. A partial solution to the long-standing difficulties
between the government and Electra has been found with the help o f an independent mediator, and
an agreement was finally reached in relation to the tariff deficit. Nonetheless, resolving pending
issues surrounding this dispute i s urgent and essential, both to address the fiscal risks arising from


                                                  3

this source and to enable Electra to expand its capacity to meet demand growth for electricity and
water. A recent study gives a broad overview of debts and contingent liabilities o f the State,
municipalities and para-public institutions. The study identified US$131million incross debts, of
which US$77 million are net debt o f the Central Government. Some debts have already been
recognized, and some o f them have already been paid or are under securitization process, The
treasury has prepared a plan to be implemented in the medium term for the settlement o f the
remaining recognized liabilities.

13.      A study on the sustainability o f Cape Verde's public debt carried out in June 2005
concluded that, under reasonable assumptions regarding new borrowing and export growth, the
external debt burden would continue to smooth over time, including in the face o f moderate
shocks, This holds even when recent oil prices increases are taken into account. The results of the
revisedDSA that took place in September 2005 to reflect the latest rise in2005, show that the debt
ratios under the baseline scenario are still comfortably below the reference debt-burdenthresholds
for Cape Verde. However, when considering the most extreme stress tests, results show that
external debt sustainability remains sensitive to exogenous shocks such as exchange rate
fluctuations, declining exports and worsening o f lending terms. Pertaining to fiscal sustainability,
results illustrate that under a scenario with a primarybalance held at the 2004 level, all indicators
of public debt sustainability (external and domestic) show a decline o f the debt service and debt
burden in the projected period (2005-25). Overall, the analysis concludes that even though Cape
Verde's public debt appears to be sustainable, a prudent approach to borrowing, consolidation o f
fiscal reforms, and strengthened debt management are highlyrecommended.

 14.     The medium term outlook (2006-08) is optimistic. According to the most recent IMF
projections, the GDP growth i s expected to stand at 7 percent on average over the period 2006-08,
as envisaged in the PRSP. Growth i s projected to be led by private investment in tourism, public
investment in infrastructure, and private consumption. Consumer Prices are expected to grow on
average at the rate o f 2 percent a year, reflecting the increase inoil prices. Exports and imports are
expected to grow at the same pace. The worsening or improvement o f the current account balance
will depend on the expansion of the domestic demand and higher oil prices. This scenario is
envisaged under the principle o f continuation o f sound macroeconomic policies. However, ifoil
price increases become persistent, this promising scenario might become unlikely.

                 111,    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM:CAPE VERDE'S
                         POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY (2005-07)

 15.     The final version o f the GPRSP (2005-07), dated September 21,2004, received a positive
 assessment through a joint IMF/IDA Staff Advisory Note (April 22, 2005). It builds on a well-
 articulated set o f strategies and priorities that address Cape Verde's main development
 challenges and rests on an updated analysis o f poverty based on the 2002 national survey on
household income and expenditures. The GPRSP acknowledges that growth i s central to the
 alleviation o f poverty, and therefore complements its proposals for sector strategies with a direct
 impact on poverty (e.g., health, education, social protection) with strategies promoting private
 sector development (e.g., infrastructure .and financial sector).     The GPRSP underscores the
 importance o f a modernized and effective administration to implement its priority programs. The
 priorities of the Government are presented along five "pillars": (a) good governance and reform


                                                   4

of the State; (b) private sector development; (c) human development; (d) infrastructure
development for the integration o fthe archipelago; and (e) social security and solidarity.

16.      The first pillar aims to improve governance by modernizing Government procedures and
institutions and by increasing its interface with citizens. Accountability and equity will be
enhanced through more direct participation o f citizens, better management practices for public
finance   and human resources, improvements in tax policies, a firmer regulatory role in the
economy, legal and judicial reform, simplified administrative procedures, expanded use o f
information technology (IT), and increased decentralization o f responsibilities and resources.
The GPRSP refers explicitly to the recommendations o fthe CFAA, PER, and CPAR.

17.      The second pillar reflects the Government's acknowledgement that fighting poverty
requires economic growth, built on sound and sustainable development o f the private sector. The
proposed policy interventions aim at improving labor market conditions, addressing market
failures in micro-enterprise financing, disseminating drip irrigation technology, modernizing
infrastructure inthe fisheries sector, and enhancing tourism marketing and basic infrastructure,

18.      The third pillar seeks to improve the education and health status o f the population, In
line with its Education Reform Strategy, the GPRSP aims to improve the employability and
skills o f the labor force by reducing barriers to secondary education, increasing the internal
efficiency o f the education system, reinforcing linkages between the education system and the
labor market, expanding access to early childhood education, and developing tertiary education.
As for health, mindfblo f increasing costs, the Government's sectoral reform strategy will focus
on an expansion o f the network o f health facilities, limit treatment overseas by improving local
alternatives, improve human resource management through decentralization, strengthen the
health information system, and reinforce citizen participation in health promotion and disease
prevention. Health financing issues will be addressed in the planned reforms of the social
insurance system.

 19.     The fourth pillar, infrastructure and regional development, is central to Cape Verde's
development plans. Although private sector development has outpaced public sector growth in
the past 12 years, large infrastructure projects have remained prominent with either public or
private financing. Energy, water and sanitation are expected to expand their networks through
public/private partnerships. Air and maritime transportation are the focus o f a domestic and
regional hub strategy, while the road network will be strengthened with user-financed
maintenance. This pillar also proposes to develop environmental protection and conservation
measures, to be implemented through increased community involvement.

20.      The fifthpillar, social protection, reflects the challenges o f curbing the increasing income
inequality as well as the growing realization that a number o f existing schemes require reforms
to ensure sustainability and broaden coverage (active labor market interventions, social
assistance, pensions and social security, community development and food security).                The
Government's reform strategy seeks to: (i) from a focus on ex-post assistance to increased
                                               move
attention to risk mitigation and prevention measures; and (ii)decentralize and contract out
service delivery inline with the broader reforms underway.




                                                    5

21.      The macroeconomic framework of Cape Verde's GPRSP proposes an average real
economic growth of 6.5 percent per annmover the 2005-07 period, with inflation projected at 2
percent. Most of the additional growth in the short term i s expected to come from higher
investmentlevels, with public investmentincreasing from 1.6 percent o f GDP to 7.1 percent and
private investment, including foreign direct investment, increasing from 14.7 percent o f GDP in
2004 to 16.0 percent by 2007. Inthe longer term, investment-driven growth should make way
for export-driven growth. Fiscal discipline will underpin private sector confidence. The deficit
(after grants) i s expected to grow to no more than 4.8 percent o f GDP, with some o f the
programmed expenditure only occurring ifexternal financing materializes.

22.      Overall coordination i s overseen by a GPRSP Steering Committee comprised of
representatives from ministries, municipal governments, the central bank, the National Statistics
Institute, the private sector and NGOs. Consultative commissions at the decentralized level are
headed by mayors. The Technical Secretariat for Development Assistance (STAD) under the
General Direction o f Planning has day-to-day responsibilities to provide technical guidance,
monitor performance, and inform internal and external partners o f progress.

23.      The GPRSP has provided an opportunity for Cape Verde to develop a national integrated
approach to monitoring and evaluation, control, statistics and information that could become a
flagship for Africa. The main features o f the approach are (a) integration o f the budget and
financial management system with the technical aspects o f programs and service delivery; (b)
development of a unified technological platform through the Operational Nucleus for
Information Systems (NOSI); (c) open access to the main data warehouses on national statistics,
policies and projects; and (d) the restructuring and strengthening o f sectoral units within the
ministries. While ambitious, the proposed approach builds on existing systems and information
technology (IT) platforms that are well advanced and technical assistance i s at hand.

              IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                        A.      LINKSTO COUNTRYASSISTANCE          STRATEGY

24.        The FY05-08Country Assistance Strategy for Cape Verde was approvedby IDA'SBoard
of Directors on February 22, 2005. The thrust o f the Bank's future program i s twofold: (a) to
assist Cape Verde in implementing its poverty reduction strategy; and (b) to improve aid
effectiveness by shifting the form o f assistance for this small, island State towards programmatic
support and sharpening focus on results. The proposed PRSC series i s central to the World Bank's
CAS, accounting for about 60 percent o f proposed new IDA lending over the next four years (the
share o f the PRSC would remain constant inthe base case or high case scenario, as PRSC lending
would increase ina highcase scenario). This emphasis on programmatic lending i s consistent with
Cape Verde's performance in implementingthe previous CAS, its level o f institutional, economic
and political development, its strong and sustained performance in recent years, and the
recommendations of core diagnostic work (PER, CFAA, CPAR). The CAS deems the PRSC to be
the preferred lending instrument to (a) provide predictable resource flows, particularly important
given Cape Verde's reliance on donor financing; (b) strengthen public administration and public
expenditure management systems, with spill-over benefits to non-IDA resources; and (c)
harmonize donors and reduce the potential distortions and transaction costs o f external assistance,

                     B.        COORDINATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

  26.      Coordination between IDA, the Netherlands and the European Union has been especially
  strong, since all three donors are preparing budget support operations. This collaboration was
  initiated withjoint support for key analytical underpinnings, including the PERs, the CFAA, and
  the CPAR. By agreeing on the findings and recommendations o f these due diligence ESWs, the
  three donors have built an important technical basis to harmonize policies and support. PRSC-1
  was catalytic in starting improved donor harmonization in Cape Verde. During preparation o f
  the PRSC, the Netherlands and IDA carried out joint pre-appraisal and appraisal missions, in
  consultation with the EuropeanUnion. This harmonization process was carried forward through
  a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Government, IDA, the EU and the Dutch
  Cooperation entitled "Partnership Framework between Budget Support Partners and the
  Government o f Cape Verde for the provision o f Budget Support" signed in Praia on April 13,
  2005. The Partnership Framework commits the parties to joint reviews, harmonization of
  indicators and prior actions, and synchronization with Government budget cycles with a view to
  reducing the transaction costs o f assistance to the Government (see MOU in Annex 9). 2005
  represents the first year of implementation o f the MOU. Reporting requirements and joint
  missions are beingplanned within the processes proposed inthe MOU. Inorder to facilitate and
  strengthen the harmonization, the Government and the donors are developing a newjoint matrix
  ina streamlinedformat.

27.     The PRSC has been prepared in parallel with the IMF's PRGF reviewsY2following the
agreed institutional division of labor. The IMF i s taking the leadon macroeconomic issues while
IDA takes the lead on structural and social issues. Ina number o f areas where the mandates of
the two institutions overlap, such as public finance, the work is being closely coordinated to
ensure that consistent advice i s provided to the authorities. The existence o f an IMF program i s
an important input for the determination o f the adequacy o f the macroeconomic policy
framework, and in the absence o f an IMF arrangement, Bank staff communicates IMF views to
the Board. As the IMF i s currently not engaged in a program with Cape Verde, the IMF relation
note is included inthis document (see Annex 12).

                         c.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

28.     The proposed PRSC series allows IDA to consolidate its lending operations and engage
in policy and technical dialogue in three of the five GPRSP pillars, on governance
(decentralization, public finances, civil service reform, legal and judicial reform), human
development (education and health), and social protection. This choice o f pillars matches IDA'S
comparative advantage and division o f labor with investment projects in the portfolio, and
reflects selectivity with other donor support. Figure 1illustrates proposedcoverage by the PRSC
series, other IDA lending and budget support from other partners.

29.     Selection o f the first pillar, good governance, i s central to the PRSC instrument itself, as
it supports the use o f national budget and fiduciary systems as the main vehicle for channeling
resources to GPRSP priorities. It also addresses cross-cutting issues like civil service and legal
and judicial reform that are essential to improve service delivery. IDA has had investment
projects in the area o f public sector reform and economic management and has a strong track
record o f analytical work including recent fiduciary assessments.              Ongoing Institutional
Development Fund and Japanese Social Development Fund Grants support different legal and
judicial reform activities that strengthen the technical capacity o f the Ministry o f Justice and at
the same time are improving access to legal services to vulnerablepopulations inCape Verde.

30.     Inthe third pillar - education and health - IDA financed a successful Basic Education
Project that closed on June 30, 2004, and has been administering the Dutch Trust Fund for
budget support to the education sector. The health sector is included under the PRSC even
though there has been little previous experience in health sector investments. The only IDA
activities inthe health sector have been a multi-sectoral investment project on HIV/AIDS and the
construction o f rural health posts through the Social Sector Development Project. Thus, the
PRSC presents a real opportunity for IDA to engage in a policy dialogue on the health system.
This is particularly important given that the issues facing the health sector are not easily
addressed through investment lending (e.g., financial framework issues). Analytical work on
education and health has been included inthe PER, DPR, and Poverty Assessment.




  Cape Verde has successfully completed the final review of its IMFPRGFprogram.

31.      The fif'th pillar, the social protection system, has benefited both from an investment
project (Social Sector Development Project closed on March 31, 2005) and from an intensive
dialogue and technical assistance through the WBI Capacity Building for Social Protection
Strategies in Africa since 2002. While the Growth and Competitiveness Project supports reform
o f the pension system for civil servants and the formal private sector, the PRSC will focus on the
non-contributory schemes, social assistance, community development and food security. The P A
has done initial analysis on targeting and coverage to underpin the dialogue.

                                                 D.    LESSONSLEARNED

32.      The following lessons are drawn from the experience o f PRSC-1, and have been taken
into account inpreparing the second operation.

     (a) Align the preparation of the PRSC with the national budget cycle. The PRSC
         program captures a number o fpolicy reforms and outcomes that will depend on actions to
         be funded through the national budget. Aligning the PRSC operation with the budget
         cycle allows for the necessary linkages between them, which proved more difficult
         duringPRSC-1 since the Credit was approved during the first semester of the fixed year.
         Two strong advantages o f a PRSC will be better captured if the PRSC i s aligned to the
         budget cycle: (i)support the Government's own systems o f public expenditure




                                                             9

       management; and (ii)      provide a certain degree o f certainty on donor funding. This
        alignment i s the objective o fthe PRSC-2 preparation schedule.
   (b) Find ways to providetechnicalassistance at short noticefor capacitybuilding. The
        shift to budget support means that there i s limited access to short-term consultancies or
        technical assistance from the Bank side during credit preparation because administrative
        procedures for the traditional Bankpreparation trust fund (PHRD) are too slow inlight o f
        the short span o f a PRSC preparation cycle. Yet, achieving the results expected from the
        PRSC series requires strengthening counterpart capacity. The Bank, at the request o f the
        Government, will remain closely involved in capacity building through three main
        channels: (a) technical advice from members o f the core PRSC team; (b) financial
        support through relevant TA components o f existing projects; and (c) a new PRSP Trust
        Fund. Complementary analytical work or financial support from other donors is also
        coordinated with the Bank activities.
   (c) Raise awareness on differencesbetween investment operationsand budget support,
        in order to emphasize the necessary articulation of the reform program with the
        State budget. Shifting from project support to budget support changes the way teams
        operate around the project. It i s thus necessary to continue to raise awareness on key
        differences between project and budget support among the Government counterparts, in
        order to ensure a common understanding and smoother implementation. It is also crucial
        that sectors see that the shift to budget support brings financing o f priority programs, so
        as to secure the continuous involvement o f sectoral ministries, which i s another argument
        for a tighter linkage betweenthe PRSC and the country budget cycle.
   (d) Broaden and deepen donor coordination using budget support as a driver. As a
        small country with many donors, Cape Verde's public sector can be overwhelmed with
        coordination demands and its staffing patterns disrupted through the creation o f multiple
        project units. PRSC-1 has been instrumental in improving donor harmonization and
        coordination, reducing the burden o f multiple monitoring systems. The M O U signed
        between the three main donors providing budget support, and the scheduling o f joint
        missions, has resulted in reduced transaction costs and distortions o f international
        assistance. The Government's objective is to call for more donors to join the MOU.
    (e) Better link sectoral and cross-cutting issues. In shifting from a sectoral investment
        project focus to the PRSC, the ability to embed sector policy within cross-cutting issues -
        --including decentralization, improved expenditure management, and civil service reform-
           can increase the sustainability and impact o f service delivery. Inthat area, synergies
        potentially permitted by the multi-sector teams (on the Government and on the Bank
        side) may not have been fully exploited during preparation o f PRSC-1. During pre-
        appraisal o f PRSC-2, thematic discussions with the PRSP Steering Committee (on
        decentralization) started to bear fruit.

                             E.      KEYANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

33.     The analytical foundations o f the PRSC seek to assess whether government policies and
institutions target poverty reduction adequately, and whether the systems and procedures for
channeling resources to support these strategies are effective. IDA i s relying on core ESW,
includinga PER, CFAA, CPAR, DPR and Poverty Assessment as well as a study on the role o f
the State. Main conclusions o f this analytical work are described in the technical annexes



                                                  10

(Annexes 5 to 8). With support from UNDP, the Government has analyzed the likelihood of
achieving the MDGs. Table 2 presents the current status of these analytical underpinnings.

                                    A. OVERALLDESCRIPTION

  34.     The objectives o fthe proposedPRSC series are to:

    (a) Support the policies and reforms set forth in the Government's GPRSP in order to
        achieve sustained improvements inthe well-being o f the population.
    (b) Develop an improved form o f external assistance that reduces distortions and transaction
        costs associated with project-based aid (particularly acute given Cape Verde's small size)
        and increases Government capacity to plan, execute and monitor its efforts to address
       poverty.
    (c) Harmonize donor support around the GPRSP (see Annex 9).
    (d) Provide predictable support to the budget cycle to consolidate and smooth resource
        transfers.
    (e) Improve access to and quality o f key social services.

35,     Duringpreparationo fthe first PRSC, the possibility of gradually expanding the coverage
o f subsequent PRSCs was left open, depending on IDA'S (and the PRSC's) comparative
advantage and availability o f resources. During the preparation process o f the second PRSC,
reviewers and commentators, including OPCS and peer reviewers, cautioned against increasing
the scope and coverage o f the PRSC at this time.         Considering the decline in the budget
allocation for Cape Verde (almost 50 percent cut fkom $48 in IDA13 to $25 with IDA14), the
current status o f analytical work as well as other donor support, it was decided that the scope of
the programshould remainthe same as for PRSC-1, with no additiono fnew sectors or issues.



                                                 11

36.      The approach o f the PRSC adopts the results focus o f the GPRSP. For each o f the main
areas o f the PRSC, a results chain has been developed that identifies the key activities and
outputs needed to produce specific and monitorable outcomes, all supporting the long-term
strategic goals o f the GPRSP (see Annex 10). The PRSC series are underpinned by a draft
policy matrix (Attachment A) derived largely from the GPRSP matrix, and updated since
PRSC1.

37.      Like its predecessor, PRSC-2 supports a small and strategic subset o f the GPRSP policy
and reform agenda (three of the five GPRSP pillars) --good governance, human development and
social protection. Building upon the success o f PRSC-1, this operation has the same overall
objectives and it is designed to deepen, not broaden, support to the reform agenda. Based on
experience over the past year, it proposes a matrix updated along the following principles: (i)
simplification (fewer triggers, fewer activities); (ii)clarification (reformulation o f some triggers
inorder to clarify expected outputs and outcomes); and (iii)     modifications induced by changing
circumstances. The main policy changes sought in each programmatic area are summarized
below (details are presented inthe following sections and inthe technical annexes).

38.      Good governance: ensure budget support to priority sectors and progressively solve the
contingent liabilities issue, improve budget planning (use o f MTEF), deconcentrate expenditure
commitment and liquidation, rationalize public debt management, strengthen internal and
external controls, codify procurement, promote decentralization and strengthen municipalities,
modernize public sector management, facilitate access to justice for underprivileged citizens.

39.      Human development: (education and health): improve quality and efficiency o f basic
education including pre-school, expand and diversify supply o f secondary education both general
and technical, expand and diversify professional training services, strengthen capacity to deal
with non-communicable diseases, improve management o fhealth human resources, and increase
financial sustainability o f health services with special attention to contributory schemes.

40.      Social protection: decentralize and rationalize service delivery, improve management and
coverage of social pensions, promote and support community-driven initiatives, modernize the
legal and institutional fkamework for child protection, expand services to minors in difficult
circumstances, improve framework for prevention and management o f food crises.

            B.       POLICY AREA1:PROMOTE          GOODGOVERNANCE,         REINFORCING
                           EFFECTIVENESS GUARANTEEINGEQUITY
                                             AND

41.      With respect to governance, the country receives highmarks for political stability, rule of
law, and voice and accountability, while further efforts are needed in other areas, such as
Government effectiveness and quality o f the regulatory regime. Analysis by WB13shows that
the control o f corruption in Cape Verde is about twice as high as other Sub-Saharan countries,
and converging towards European norms.            Despite difficulties with the implementation of
financial management procedures, including delays in the annual review o f general accounts o f
the State by the Tribunal dus Contus (TdC, Court o f Accounts), public monies appear to have

Annex 6.


                                                   12

been managed transparently, and in the general interest. This perception of low corruption i s
corroborated by budget execution figures that are close to original allocations, little divergence
between the State's accounts, its log of treasury operations, and the record o f transactions on its
account at the Central Bank, and general information gathered from private and public sector
operators. The public finance reforms proposed will further reinforce transparency.

42.    Recent analysis (CFAA, PER and CPAR) confirms the general soundness o f public
expenditure management, although its underlying systems need improvement and modernization
inkey areas, such as: (a) greater integration ofinvestment and expenditure budgets,developing a
Medium-Term ExpenditureFramework (MTEF) to guide resource allocation and linking sector
budgets to programmatic outcomes; (b) reinforced financial controls, including more timely
audits; (c) more effective tax administration through improved information management; (d)
development o f adequate procurement legislation; and (e) control o f contingent liabilities,

43.    The central Government generally has a strong record o f delivering a good mix o f quality
and quantity o f public services. While the need for decentralization in a population o f 472,000
may not be immediately obvious, the island structure o f Cape Verde, including four islands with
under 15,000 people, calls for moving decision-making and monitoring o f service provision to
the local level. Current proposals for increasingdecentralization to the municipalities underscore
the intended goal to further improve policy responsiveness and implementation, as well as
increase citizen access to information inorder to increase local accountability.

44.     Budget has taken into account adequate funding o f GPRSP priorities. The 2006 budget
draft bill of law has not been approved yet, but it is expected that, when approved, will allow for
adequate funding o f the GPRSP priorities, given that the GPRSP had a very participatory process
and also because it appears that there i s enough general commitment and political will to its
objectives. The no submission o f the budget draft bill o f law to the Cape Verdean Parliament in
the period immediately before the legislative elections i s a common practice in the institutional
politics of Cape Verde, and it i s allowed under article 21 o f the Cape Verdean Framework
Budget Law (FBL). The rationale for this common practice is that they want to reserve for the
new Parliament, with democratic legitimacy, the opportunity to review and approve the budget
for the first year o f the term that takes place immediately after the elections. As per article 21,
numeral (5) o f the Cape Verdean FBL, the new assembly votes on a new budget within 60 days
of taking office. Article 21, numeral (3) o f the FBL establishes that duringthat period the budget
for the previous year remains in effect. Budget execution shall follow the normal rule of using
appropriations established in the expenditure charts by twelfths. Thus, as per article 21 of the
Cape Verdean FBL, the 2005 budget law will be inplace untilthe 2006 budget bill o f law i s duly
approved.

A.1    Public ExpenditureManagement Reforms

45.    The Government's reform agenda i s based on the assessments o f the CFAA, PER and
CPAR.     Together, these analytical pieces provide a comprehensive overview o f the critical
weaknesses inthe public expenditure management system.

Key Issues

          Key issues affectingpublic expenditure management that will be addressed include:

       Fiscal policy is at risk from an accumulation o f contingent liabilities and mandatory
       expenditureprograms. Inthe absence of rapid action, public expenditure could increase
       unsustainably and crowd out other priority expenditures. Furthermore, in order to avoid
       the mounting arrears to the oil companies and Electra it is urgent that the automatic oil,
       water and energy price adjustment mechanisms become operative.
       Budget formulation is hampered by insufficient guidance in the call circular on the main
       priorities, and it i s weakly linked to medium-term resource projections.
       Tax administration capacity i s mixed.          While customs administration is strong, the
       General Directorate for Income Tax (DGCI) at the Ministry o f Finance and Planning
       (MOFP) is still facing some challenges. DGCIhasjust completed the identification of tax
       payers and i s now validating it. The NIF files as well as the identity cards o f tax payers
       are expected to be ready early in2006. As recommended by the CFAA report, D G C Ihas
       increased the number o f tax verification missions and set up a capacity buildingprogram.
       However, there i s a need to strengthen the internal audit department o f DGCI by
       recruiting two additional staff andtraining them.
       The new IT-based Financial Management System (FMS) has been deployed to all
       Ministries. However, this i s on a read-only basis, and budget execution commitment i s
        still centrally done by the DGO. The law establishing the mandate and fbnction o f
        financial controllers exists but a regulation needs to be finalized and approved by the
       MFP4in order to deconcentrate expenditure commitment to line ministries. Training of
        all actors will also be needed. Moreover, the absence of a procedure manual to support
       day-to-day operations i s a fiduciary risk.
       Debt management is not yet linked through ITwith the Treasury, which limits the ability
        o f Treasury to program payments.
        External audits are still inadequate. However, a lot o f progress has been made to clear
        the backlog inclosing the State Accounts, thus allowing the TdC to perform this statutory
       task. Internal audits are also weak due to inadequate capacity at the General Inspectorate
        for Finances (IGF).
    (g) While procurement operations are basically sound, an overarching legal framework to
        support and harmonize procurement activities i s missing and there is limited capacity in
        the country to provide adequate advice.




 As of March 8, 2006, the name of this Ministry has changed to Ministry of Finance and Public Administration
(MFPA). However,the previous name o f the Ministry is kept throughout the document to avoid confusion. Future
actionswillbe carriedout by MFPA.

ExpectedResultsof PRSC Program

47.      Bythe end o fthe PRSC period (three years), the Government expects to have attained the
following outcomes:

    (a) Improved fiscal management and budget allocations contingent liabilities are controlled
                                                                 -
         and a plan for clearing arrears i s beingimplemented.
    (b) Improved budget planning and preparation as reflected in hrther integration o f the
         investment and recurrent budgets, the adoption o f budgets that respect MTEF ceilings
         and sector allocations inline with the priorities o f the GPRSP.
    (c) Improved management and control o f tax proceeds resultingin an increase inthe number
          of contributors and amounts collected, as well as number o f audits.
    (d) Improved budget execution via the introduction o f financial controllers and
          deconcentrationo f expenditure responsibilities to at least six ministries.
    (e) Improved monitoring o f public resources as evidenced ina decrease inthe supplementary
         budget period andbetter coverage o f autonomous institutes.
    ( f ) Reinforced internal and external audits, with more timely presentation o f executed
          budgets to Parliament andreview by the TdC; and increased activity o f the IGF.
    (8) Improved procurement systems through updating and consolidating laws, regulations and
          processes, which will result in greater transparency, reduced unit costs o f government
          purchases and better stimulus o f the private sector.

ResultsAchieved since PRSC-1

48.       Achievements inspecific areas o f the agenda since PRSC-1 include:

    (a) Budget Planning and Preparation:           The draft budget laws on budget planning and
          preparation are expected to be approved by the end o f the first quarter o f 2006. The new
          laws aims at taking into account all the new reform options (progress towards MTEF and
          program budgeting). International technical assistance and training i s being provided to the
          Ministryo f Finances and the relevant sector ministries inorder to develop a global MTEF
          and sectoral ones. The ministries o f Education and the Ministryo f Agriculture, Fisheries
          and Environment, have a preliminary draft o f a sectoral MTEF. However, there seems to
          be little articulation with the Ministry o f Finances, and the global MTEF consists o f the
          projections made for the DECRP document. The 2005 budget was already elaborated on
          the same track for capital and recurrent expenditures and was linked to a very preliminary
          version o f the MTEF.
    (b) Contingent liabilities: A plan for the settlement o f contingent liabilities and clearance of
          central government arrears was prepared.
    (c) Management and Control o f Tax Proceeds: The identification o f the income tax payers i s
          completed. The attribution o f a single identification number and o f an updated NIF i s
          ongoing.
    (d) Budget Execution and Control: The new IT-based Financial Management System (FMS)
          was implemented, connecting all Ministries, and allowing them to monitor their accounts in
          real-time.
    (e) Improve Internal and External Audits: The Government has taken appropriate measures to
          finalize the 2000-03 state general accounts, while preparing and submitting on time current


                                                    16

         accounts. The 2001 and 2002 accounts were presented to Parliament. Four laws on
         organization, financial autonomy and systems o f controls public expenditure are being
         prepared in order to support the internal audit institution, the IGF. The IGF organic law
         has been approved by the Council o f Ministers. The TdC, the supreme audit institution, is
         in the process of recruiting staff to enhance its capacity. The legal framework regulating
         the TdC is being reviewed, with the preparationo f laws on reorganization and competences
         of the TDC. The laws on reorganization and competences should be submitted to
         Parliament inthe first semester o f 2006 after the current discussion within Government for
         internal approval.

PRSC-2Prior Actions and ProposedPRSC-3Triggers

49.      PRSC-2 prior actions focus on key aspects of public finance.         The first one, "revised
2005 budget takes into account inter alia, adequate funding o f DECRP priorities, cross-cutting
reforms for public administration and public expenditure management" reflects the Government
engagement to implement the DECRP. The second one, `plan for the settlement o f contingent
liabilities and debts approved by MOFP' highlights the need to tackle the compensation for
existing contingent liabilities and prevent further liabilities to be created. The third prior action
now reads "Prepare MTEF: Prepare MTEF. Unified budget classification used for 2006 budget
and adoption o f law on budget planning and preparation by the Council o f Ministers."            The
adoption of a new budget preparation and planning law will allow for sustainable progress on
establishing a MTEF. The fourth prior action i s "2000-02 State General Accounts submitted to
Parliament", acknowledging the importance o f external control and accountability.

PRSC-3 potential triggerspertaining to fiscal policy are the following:

    0    Draft 2007 budget takes into account adequate funding o f GPRSP priorities.
    0    Implementationo f the plan for settlement o f the contingent liabilities.
    0    Prepare MTEF: Single 2007 budget call circular including investment and recurrent
         budget for all ministries, with ceilings and GPRSP priorities, and sectoral MTEF in at
         least four ministries.
    0    2003 and 2004 State General Accounts submitted to Parliament.
    0    National Procurement Code approved by Council o f Ministers and submitted to
         Parliament.

A.2      Civil Service, Decentralization and Legal and Judicial Reform

Key Issues

50.      Annex 5 describes the status and challenges o fpublic sector reform inmore details,
Main issues are:

    (a) Uneven progress in public sector reform due to the absence o f an integrated strategic
         framework and appropriate structures for coordinating the reforms, creating a disconnect
         betweenvarious initiatives.




                                                  17

     (b) Slow civil service reform as human resource management remains centralized and
         implementation of merit-based recruitment and evaluation is lagging. Careers are not
         attractive for high-level professionals, which leads to a significant turnover at managerial
         positions. Job descriptions are missing and there i s no formal policy for professional
         training. In lieu of a comprehensive reform, ad hoc solutions have been introduced by
         individual ministries or parts thereof, which has ledto large variations o f salaries between
         ministries or between central and local governments, and contributed to low morale.
     (c) The creation of autonomous institutes has been used as a solution to larger public
         administration problems, multiplying semi-independent bodies with more attractive
         benefits and working conditions. This creates distortions in public sector performance,
         potential hiddenliabilities, and a dilution o fthe Government's core responsibilities.
     (d) Decentralization o f responsibilities and resources to the municipalities is one o f the key
         vehicles chosen by the Government to improve service delivery. However, municipal
         prerogatives and financing are defined by an outdated set o f laws (currently under
         revision) and mechanisms to better coordinate municipal, central and deconcentrated
         government activities needto be developed.
     (e) Financial autonomy o f the municipalities i s weakened by financing uncertainties as
         transfers from the central Government come in various forms and not always at planned
         intervals. Formula-based transfers plus other central transfers amounted to 5 percent o f
         the State budget in2002.
     (f) The financial management capacity o f municipalities i s uneven. Turnover o f skilled staff
         i s an issue across all municipalities and affects financial management processes, which
         are also underminedby the absence o f standardprocedures.
     (g) In a country setting where insularity adds specific challenges to responsive service
         delivery, citizens continue to perceivepublic administration as inefficient.
     (h) Lack of legal knowledge anddifficulties inaccessingjudicial services continue to impair
         most vulnerable populations (including vulnerable female single-headed households) to
         benefit from legal security and protection.

PRSCFocus andExpectedResults

51,      The policy matrix was prepared with staff from the Ministry o f State Reform and Public
Administration (MREAP), the MOFP and the Ministry o f Justice.                Following the GPRSP
priorities, the PRSC focuses on key medium-term objectives, namely: (a) improve and integrate
public sector reform management; (b) clarify respective mandates o f central and deconcentrated
administration and municipalities and improve the financing o f municipalities; (c) improve
human resource management and capacity; and (d) enhance legal and judicial knowledge and
efficiency,  andpromote access to justice.

52.      By the end of the PRSC period (three years), the Government o f Cape Verde expects to
have attained the following outcomes:

     (a) Overall decentralization framework i s more conducive to progress in service delivery
         outcomes, with clear repartition o f functions and improved financial flows, including
         timeliness and volume o f transfers.
     (b) Adequate tools for human resource management are developed and operational, and
         various stakeholders are briefed on possible options for the reform o f the civil service, in


                                                   18

        order to forge consensus on a strategy to promote a qualified,    motivated and accountable
        civil service.
        Local capacity for training is improved and professional training institutionalized.
        Some o f the most demanded services are more easily accessedby citizens.
        Knowledge o f the law and access to justice are broadened especially for the most
        vulnerable groups.

ResultsAchievedsince PRSC-1

53.     The PRSC-1 prior action for human resource management related to the completion o f
the civil servants database, as a way to improve management o f human resources but also,
through an analysis of the current workforce, to propose scenarios for civil service reform. The
full validation o f the database is a major achievement. Sustainability o f the database is being
ensured through: (i)    the Decree 5/2004 o f September 27, 2004 stating rules for update and
management; and (ii)the deconcentration o f the database to line ministries, and training on
database use for staff incharge o f general administration invarious ministries.
54.     A study on options to improve and integrate public sector reform management, based on
the database analysis, and assist the MREAP in putting in place an operational mechanism for
public sector reforms coordination and implementation has been produced. Elaborating and
starting to implement more specific scenario for reforms will be the focus o fPRSC 3.
55.     To provide rapid access to key public services for users, and to improve citizens'
perception o f public administration, the Government decided to create a Citizen House (single
window for most usedservices), which should open by early 2006.
Decentralization

56.     A new Local Finances law, which will increase the amount o f formula-based transfers to
the municipalities, was approved and published. Technical assistance is being contracted in
order to prepare the "decentralization organic law", the law that would guide and harmonize
decentralization processes, and clarify mechanisms for concomitant transfer o f resources and
responsibilities for municipalities. To improve budget execution and reporting for municipalities,
a plan is designed to roll-over in more municipalities the computerized system that allow three      ,
municipalities (Silo Vicente, Sal and Praia) to significantly raise their own revenues.
Legal and Judicial Reform

57.      Cape Verde i s implementing an important reform o f its legal and judicial sectors, IDA
has assisted Cape Verde in this important effort.           First, with an ongoing Institutional
Development Fund grant, aimed at the strengthening o f the Ministry o f Justice, including, inter
alia: (a) design o f legal information and communication campaigns, (b) compilation o f Supreme
Court decisions; (c) trainingprograms for judges andjudicial clerks; and (d) the development of
data bases to monitor the access to justice o f poor populations. Second, and most recently, with
a Japanese Social Development Fund grant to improve the access to legal services o f vulnerable
populations (especially women), through, inter alia: (a) the establishment o f eleven legal centers;
(b) the provision o f basic legal counseling, mediation and conciliation services; (c) production
and dissemination o f legal education materials; (d) the provision, in cooperation with the Cape
Verdean Bar Association, o f an in-court legal assistance scheme, and out o f court counseling


                                                 19

services to benefit vulnerable populations; and (e) training o f paralegals. In addition, Cape
Verde has recently promulgated both a decree-law on mediation and a law on arbitration. These
new alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms will provide quicker solutions to legal
claims o f both private citizens and business entities in Cape Verde and it will lessen the burden
o f the country's court system.


PRSC-2Prior Actions and PRSC-3 Triggers

58.       Prior actions for PRSC-2 are: (i)          Decentralization: Promulgation o f the local finances
law, once approved by Parliament: this will have a positive impact on municipal finances; (ii)
Civil Service Reform: Civil servant's database operational and deconcentrated for regular
updating by sectors, used as a basis for a diagnostic on human resources and elaboration o f
reform options"; and (iii)          Judicial Reform: Decree setting forth an arrangement between the
Ministry of Justice and the Cape Verdean Bar Association to pay lawyers assisting
underprivileged clients on the basis o fpre-arranged fees. .

59.       In moving to PRSC-3, potential triggers would be: (i)                  "decentralization basic law"
adopted; and (ii)civil servants database used for salary payment and deconcentrated in line
ministries, interministerial working group in charge o f drafting new civil service reform status
operational, and preliminary PCCS draft/options discussed with key stakeholders.

B.1.   Education and Professional Training
Key Issues

60.    Cape Verde's education achievements rank among the top o f Sub-Saharan African
countries and other countries at the lower middle income level (for more details see Annex 6).
Several studies have been completed by the Government, the Bank and others identify the main
issues and future challenges inthe education sector:

    (a)     Expansion in coverage o f early childhood education i s becoming a pressing need, as
       less than 60 percent of the 3-5 year olds attend early childhood education. Regional and
       socio-economic disparities in access to pre-school are strong. Early childhood education
       i s the responsibility of municipalities, with program coordination carried out by the
       Ministryo fEducation(MOE).
    (b)     Greater voice should be given to parents and communities in deciding how schools
       should be governed, managed and financed in order to foster greater accountability and
       support education quality.      Some transfer o f power and resources from the central
       Government to the municipalities should result in greater responsiveness to clients and
       improve delivery o f education services.
    (c)     Quality i s an issue even though the unit cost per student i s one o f the highest in the
       sub-region.    The repetition rate in primary education remains stubbornly high at 12
       percent, mainly due to insufficiently prepared teachers.
    (d)     Despite recent investments in school infrastructure, secondary education i s ill-
       prepared for the growing demand from primary school graduates, with limited and
       unequal distribution o f facilities, a shortage o f teachers, and outdated curriculum and
       teaching practices. More average size secondary schools are needed to provide equitable
       access to all the population and especially those living inrural areas.
    (e)     The professional training system should be better structured to respond to social
       demands and to meet the needs o f the labor market. Sector rules and responsibilities are
       unclear and few providers are certified. Access to professional training and
       apprenticeship for primarygraduates remains too restricted.
    (0      Demand for higher education will further strain resources. Support for study abroad
       has been reduced inrecent years despite the risingnumber o f secondary school graduates.
       The number and relevance o f tertiary education institutions are insufficient to meet the
       needs o f Cape Verde's economic and social development.
    (8)     The teaching wage bill will need to be controlled, as salaries consistently absorb
       about 90 percent of recurrent expenditures.        While for primary school teachers the
       average salary relative to GDP i s close to the regional average, the level for secondary
       education i s muchhigher - andthis i s where system expansion will be concentrated.

PRSCFocus andExpectedResults

61.    The Education Ministry contribution to the PRSC policy matrix prioritizes four main
medium-term objectives: (a) improve the quality and efficiency o f education; (b) expand and
diversify general and technical secondary education supply; (c) expand and better orient
professional training service delivery; and (d) restructurehigher education.



                                                 21

62.     Bythe end of the PRSCperiod (three years), the Government expects to have attained the
following educational outcomes:

    (a) Improvements inthe quality of basic education, as evidenced by a significant increase in
         the percentage of teachers who have academic qualifications, a decrease inthe repetition
         rate, a system to test academic achievement designed and piloted, and a higher share of
         students completing primaryschool.
    (b) Greater efficiency of the education system, as evidenced by a decrease in the student-
         teacher ratio inprimary education and reduced drop-out and repetition rates.
    (c) Expanded opportunities for children to get an earlier start in education as shown by an
         increase inthe share o f 3-5 years old enrolled inearly childhood programs.
    (d) Expanded and diversified general and technical secondary education supply resulting in
         an increase in children completing eight years o f schooling, a greater share o f students
         enrolled in technical secondary education, and a higher proportion o f poor students
         benefiting from support.
     (e) Better preparation for labor market needs through increased numbers of students enrolled
         inprofessional training and apprenticeship programs, accompanied by an increase inthe
         number o f accredited professionaltraining providers.
     (f) A tertiary education sector that allows for higher enrollment and less reliance on study
         abroad within a limitedpublic finance envelope.

ResultsAchieved since PRSC-1

63.      As a PRSC-1 prior action, teacher training priorities were identified in basic education
and a three-year action plan developed.            Key issues identified were (a) improving the
professional qualification o f existing teachers (in-service training) rather than training and
recruiting new teachers (pre-service training); and (b) ensuring that deployment o f primary
teachers i s not biased against remote rural areas.

64.      A Professional Training Assessment was also completed as a prior action.            A key
findings was that professional training will need to be restructured, expanded and improved to
address the highunemployment rate. The recently approved law on professional training revised
the overall structure of professional training by establishing three types o f training (initial, in-
service and continued) and five levels o f qualification, each leading to a certificate o f
professional training.

65.      Other achievements since PRSC-1 include:
     (a) Beginning o f the revision o f the basic education curriculum.
     (b) Expansion o f early childhood education (ECD) with 70 new ECD teachers and 17 ECD
         coordinators trained.
     (c) Progress toward the expansion o f secondary schools, as the Ministry o f Education
         identified priority sites for constructions, and launched a construction plan to build 9
         secondary schools by 2007.
     (d) Improvement o f secondary technical education through several on-going programs
         supported by the Luxemburgandthe Portuguese Cooperation.

PRSC-2 Prior Actions and PRSC-3 Triggers

66.     The prior action o f PRSC-2 is the implementation o f the first year o f the teacher training
action plan for basic education, targeting 605 primary teachers enrolled in-service teacher
training offered by the three teacher colleges and expected to receive their degree inJuly 2005.

67.     In moving to PRSC-3, a potential trigger would be the continued implementation of
teacher training action plan for basic education, as this i s crucial for improving educational
quality and increasing the efficiency o f the basic education system. Results expected during the
PRSC-3 period include progress on curriculum revision and the implementation o f achievement
tests to underpin and monitor improvements in education quality, an expansion o f early child
education to 62 percent o f 3-5 year olds, development o f a targeting system for the scholarship
program for secondary students from poor households, as well as securing financing and
finalizing implementation details for the professionaltraining strategic plan.

B.2     Health Sector

Key Issues

68,      Compared to other countries inAfrica, Cape Verde's coverage o f health services i s good
and the country i s on track to achieve the MDGs. However, these good indicators mask
significant regional disparities and are based on an unsustainable financial framework (for more
details see Annex 7). Several studies have been completed by the Bank and others that identify
the following main issues:

    (a) Inequities in health outcomes and access to health services persist. Access i s limited
         primarily by geographic factors, while costly medical evacuations remainnumerous.
    (b) Problems with human resources limit the effectiveness o f the health system. These
         include: (i) insufficient number o f doctors; (ii) distribution o f staff; (iii) o f
                      an                                      poor                            lack
         incentives to maximize efficiency or focus on the poor; and (iv) a growing number o f
         public sector doctors working inan unregulatedprivate sector.
    (c) Management o f the system, including monitoring and evaluation, is hampered by the lack
         of a functioning health information system.
    (d) There is no organized approach to non-communicable diseases, which are rapidly
         becoming a major concern because o f Cape Verde's epidemiologic transition.
    (e) Health financing i s facing important challenges, even though total government health
         spendingis generous and financing by donors is the second highest per capita inAfrica at
         about US$10 per capita. The main causes are: a growing deficit at the INPS, a very high
         and rapidly increasing rate o f expenditures on pharmaceuticals, and increases in demand
         as incomes improve and the population ages. At the same time, financial protection is
         needed for the indigent (e.g., 90 percent o f total health spending by the poor i s to
         purchase medicines).
    (f) Issues outside the control of the MOH, like inadequate and unsafe water, poor nutrition,
         and lack o f transport, contribute to poor health outcomes. For example, only 11 percent
         o f the poor have access to public water supplies compared with 51 percent o f the non-
         poor.



                                                  23

PRSC Focus and ExpectedResults

69.      The PRSC policy matrix, which has been prepared by the Ministry o f Health in
collaboration with its main partners, reflects the priority issues described above. The main
objectives are to reduce the inequities inhealth outcomes and ensure financial protection for the
poor. Specific results include:

70.      Better access to quality health services by the poor by: (i)expanding health infrastructure,
particularly inremote rural areas, (ii)  training and deploying health personnel to these areas, and
(iii) prioritizing the financing and provision o f services for those diseases that have the most
impact on the poor. A pushto ensure attended deliveries will attempt to reduce the discrepancies
between rich and poor, with the poor much more likelyto deliver at home.

71,      Improved financial       access and sustainability o f health services by controlling
expenditures. Controlling the growth in non-communicable diseases i s a priority given their
increasing prevalence and associated treating costs.        Introduction o f health prevention and
promotion programs is likely to have the largest impact on health expenditures in the future,
particularly for the poor who are least able to afford treatment. Reforms to the social security
system should also result inreduced expenditures on health.

72.      Improvements inhealth protection for the poor: Several policies are proposed to protect
the poor from the high cost o f illness. Introduction o f user fees will allow more money to be
allocated to the poor assuming a system o f exemptions i s put inplace. Expansion o f the existing
social insurance program, INPS, i s also proposed with several options for covering the poor
under discussion.

ResultsAchievedsince PRSC-1

73.      Cape Verde has made considerable progress in most o f the priority areas identified in the
PRSC. Perhaps most importantly, the financing provided for priority programs inthe 2005 budget
i s the same as that estimated in the GPRSP action plan. Other achievements to date include
development o f two new key nationalpolicies on the HealthInformation System (HIS) and Human
Resources for Health (HRH). Implementation o f the national infrastructure plan i s on track with
significant support fkom donors. Finally, important reforms to reduce the current subsidy from
pensions to health inthe INPS have been introduced.

74.      Progress inspecific areas o f the reform program include:

     (a) Priority health programs. A GPRSP priority is to ensure that expenditures for the priority
         programs5 appear in the annual budget and are fully disbursed. The 2005 budget provides
         sufficient financing to implement the programs. The MOH anticipates the main constraint
         to implementing the priorityprograms in2005 will be insufficient availability o f personnel.
     (b) Health Information System (HIS).        The MOH has completed a situation analysis and
         finalized a national policy for HIS in April 2005. The analysis o f the HIS situation


  Priority programs include HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, the Expanded Program for Immunization, and Integrated
Management o f Childhood Infections.


                                                   24

         concluded that the basis for a functional HIS exists, but i s fragmented. In addition, the
         capacity to use data generated by an HIS is low, particularly inthe periphery.

    (c) Human Resources for Health (HRH). The analysis of the situation in HRH has been
         completed as a PRSC-1 prior action, and it reveals shortages in all types o f health care staff
         and an inequitable geographical distribution.      The main recommendations o f the draft
         Strategic Plan include increasing the numbers of trained health staff, strengthening clinical
         capacity, adapting clinical services to chronic disease care, and strengthening public health
         management. Implementationhas already begunwith the start of a new training course for
         nurses.
    (d) Improving; access to health facilities. The facilities map, completed in 1999, points to two
         approaches for improving access: improve quality by refirbishing and re-equipping
         existing facilities, thereby stimulating demand, and increase supply where geographical
         access is limited. Three criteria are applied prior to including a new (not rehabilitated)
         facility inthe plan: (i)the demographic situation; (ii) epidemiologic profile; and (iii)
                                                                the                                 the
         referral system. Strategic plans that are currently under elaboration include Santiago North,
         urban Praia, and the islando f SZo Vicente.
    (e) Financial protection and the INPS.      The INPS is developing a medium-term strategy to
         address the deficit in its health insurance component,             focusing   on controlling
         pharmaceutical costs, changes in reimbursement for certain medical specialties, better
         verification o f beneficiaries, and a revision o f payments to the public sector. Regarding
         financial  protection, a study o f the viability o f community-based health insurance was
         recently completed by the ILO. This study concluded that the necessary preconditions for
         establishing such a system were present and recommendedestablishing a pilot project,

PRSC-2 Prior Actions and PRSC-3Triggers

75.        The PRSC-2 prior action in the health area is the publication o f a report o f 2004 health
statistics, to be followed by regular yearly reports. This would provide accurate data upon which
to build the specific technical reforms needed in the sector as well as facilitate monitoring o f
GPRSPRRSC implementation. Inparticular, this information i s a crucial step toward a concerted
effort to prevent and treat non-communicable diseases, expected as result under PRSC-3.

76.        PRSC-3 would prioritize reforms that will ensure the financial sustainability o f INPS.
To this end, the trigger selected i s expansion o f coverage to the self-employed and the informal
sector. Other progress expected under PRSC-3 includes continued availability o f up-to-date
health statistics, continued progress inpriority health programs leading to a vaccination rate o f
85 percent for under one year olds, as well as greater accessibility o f trained health personnel,
and initiation o f activities oriented to non-communicable disease prevention and treatment.

         D.      POLICY AREA3: IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS SUSTAINABILITY
                                                                    AND
                               OF THE SOCIAL PROTECTION SYSTEM

Key Issues

77.     The Government's social protection strategy seeks to help vulnerable households to
better manage risks and become less susceptible to potentially damaging welfare losses through a
variety o f mechanisms, including labor market interventions, formal social security systems,
social assistance programs and food security measures (for more details see Annex 8).        Cape
Verde has a relatively well developed social protection system for Africa, so the basic issues
have more to do with reforms o f existing programs in order to increase efficiency, equity and
coverage as well as fillinspecific gaps. The main issues to be addressed are highlighted below.
    (a) Temporary employment through labor-intensive public works (known as FAIMO)
       schemes was a key feature o f rural survival in Cape Verde in the 1970-80s. Originally,
       this temporary employment provided a minimumsafety net for the ruralpoor. Over time
       the FAIMO program came to be equated with people showing up just to check their
       names o f f the lists, with limited impact o f investments, low labor productivity and little
        skills accumulation.
    (b) The long-run financial solvency o f contributory social security schemes is at risk. The
        two main systems (the AP for civil servants and the INPS for private firms) provide
        pensions, health insurance and other benefits, covering about one quarter o f the labor
        force. The sustainability o f both systems i s in question due to generous benefits and
        cross-subsidies from pensions to health insurance.
    (c) The Government's intention to expand the non-contributory pension schemes, including
        the Social Solidarity Pension (PSS) for ex-FAIMO workers and the Minimum Social
        Pension (PSM) for needy elderly and disabled, will need to be embedded in better
        targeting, modernization o f program administration including new identity cards, and
        coherence inthe overall fiscal envelope.
    (d) Municipal governments routinely contract with local associations for the day-to-day
        management and operation o f nursery schools, training programs and other social
        assistance services. The central level has experimentedwith contracting NGOs as service
        providers, as well as with direct financing o f community groups and fanners'
        cooperatives for development efforts. The challenge is to build on this experience,
        creating better systems for monitoring performance and impacts.
    (e) The legal and institutional framework for child protection needs updating and
        strengthening. Service provisionto minors at risk is currently hamperedby outdated laws
        and insufficient resources. An effort to decentralize services and give municipalities a
        greater role i s underway.
    (f) With little arable land, recurrent drought and declining soil fertility, food security has
        been a key motive o f migration to urban areas and outside the country. Overall, 14
        percent o f children from 0-5 are stunted. While growth has improved wellbeing, some
        10,000 mostly rural households are still considered at nutritional risk. Efforts to protect
        food insecure households are hamperedby lack o f coordination among the various bodies
        called to play a role.

PRSC FocusandExpectedResults


78.     Under the coordination o f the Ministry o f Labor and Solidarity (MTS), the Government
has prepared a policy matrix in consultation with other ministries, autonomous agencies and
NGOs. The matrix prioritizes: (a) protection, integration and social insertion, to redefine the
regulatory framework for decentralized service delivery, improve planning and management
instruments, improve management and coverage o f non-contributory pensions, increase access of
at-risk groups to education and professionaltraining, health services, and nutritional support, and
promotion and support for local community development initiatives; (b) protection o f children's
rights, to strengthen institutional mechanisms and reinforce technical capacity o fNGOs involved
inyouth and child protection issues; and (c) `food security', to prevent and manage food crises
and strengthen the institutional framework o f food security issues.

79.     By the end o f the PRSC period, the Government expects to have attained the following
social protection outcomes. These targets are ambitious but are anchored inexisting programs:
    (a) Improved ability to plan and monitor social assistance services as evidenced by complete
         andup-to-date information on coverage andutilization.
    (b) A greater share and better geographical distribution o f social services targeted to low-
        income and vulnerable groups through contracts with local governments and NGOs, with
        modest increases inutilization rates (already at 85 percent) o f existing infrastructure.
    (c) Expanded coverage and better targeting o f the non-contributory pensions schemes, as
         seen inincreased participation rates by the poor, with expenditures within the MTEF.
    (d) Increased coverage and quality o fNGOprograms for children at risk.




                                                        27

    (e) Increased access by the poor to education and health services, resulting in higher
        attendance rates insecondary education and better nutrition rates.
    (f) Less utilization o f emergency coping strategies for food security through better
        prevention and management o f food crises.

ResultsAchievedsince PRSC-1

80.     The technical dialogue involving improvements to the social protection system focuses
on three broad areas mirroring the agreed policy matrix: (a) protection, integration and social
insertion; (b) protection of children's rights; and (c) food security. Under PRSC-1, significant
progress was made on the first component, including completion o f the Social Services Map
(Carla Social) by INE for the MTS, which was the only prior action in social protection. The
Social Services Map identified 609 social service centers, including day-care centers, multi-use
community centers, shelters, and centers for youth, disabled, elderly and malnourished children.
Overall the utilization rate o f this social infrastructure i s about 85 percent but this conceals wide
differences, for example, with utilization at about 375 percent inchild nutrition centers versus 54
percent in some centers for the disabled. This i s a critical first step in identifying gaps and
rationalizing the use o f infrastructure, as well as developing service norms.

81.     In addition to the mapping, overall policy direction has been better defined through the
drafting o f the country's Social Protection Strategy which was presented for national discussion
        2005. Furtherprogress under PRSC-1 includes:
        Redefinition o f the regulatory framework for decentralized service delivery i s underway to
        update the framework agreement (protocols) between the M T S and municipalities that
        regulates the decentralization o f social promotion services.
        The non-contributory pension study has been completed, providing the basis to move
        toward better management, targeting and coverage. A revised M I S database combining
        PSS and PSM recipients is now available and the MTS i s in the process o f issuingnew ID
        cards, including photo and updated recipient information. The new system will permit the
        identification o f any duplicate payments or receipt o f other pensions. The 2005 budget
        increased the number o f PSM and PSS recipients by 1,000 and 2,000, respectively, and
        raised the PSM from 1,300 CVE to 3,000 C V E per month (this alignment will facilitate the
        fusion o f the two systems planned for 2006). The revised poverty map was used to allocate
        additional pensions bymunicipality.
        To increase access o f at-risk groups to education and professional training, the MTS
        expanded support to secondary and technical education students, reaching 184 in 2005
        (against the 250 planned).
        To increase access o f at-risk groups to health services, options for a program to provide
        indigentwith access to subsidies for medicines was studied under PRSC-1. Inlight o fthe
        recent ILO study mentioned earlier, however, it appears that supporting community-
        based health insurance may be a more sustainable and wider-reaching way of making
        medicines more affordable for the poor.
        The promotion of local community development initiatives through contracts with NGOs
        for service provision is advancing with the on-going pilot experience financed by the
        Government o f Portugal. Six NGOshave already signed service contracts.


                                                    28

         A National Commission for Legal and Institutional Reform in the area o f Children and
         Adolescents was established through a resolution o f the Council o f Ministers on February
         28, 2005, thus setting the stage for a major overhaul in the legislative and institutional
         framework. With support from UNICEF, the Cape Verdean Institute for Minors (ICM) i s
         drafting an overarching Statute for Children and Adolescents. I C M supervision o fNGOs
         and local associations providing services to children and youth at-risk (including minors
         introuble with the law, as well as abused, mistreated and abandoned children) included
         updating data on service providers and carrying out meetings with them to discuss
         implementation issues. Utilization o f ICM's Child Emergency Centers has expanded in
         the last year as well.
         Progress in the food security agenda has consisted mainly o f activities needed to set the
         stage for more effective action, To develop a decentralized food security information
         system, the basic methodology and instruments have been developed and tested, and
         preliminaryinformation from existing datahas made itpossible to estimate the number o f
         families and the zones at nutritional risk. A National Council for Food Security was
         created in August 2005, representing an important step toward a more coordinated
         approach.

PRSC-2Prior Actions andPotentialPRSC-3Triggers

82.        Inmovingto PRSC-2, the prior actioninthe socialprotectionareais the creationofthe
database, validation o f the current beneficiary list o f PSMPSS, and distribution o f new identity
cards to recipients o f the social pensions. This prior action represents a major step for improving
program management in one o f the cornerstone social protection programs, especially in view o f
the envisaged expansion o f beneficiaries.            Further progress expected under PRSC-2 is the
approval of the National Social Protection Strategy, which will provide high-level political
support and validation o f the technical reforms proposed. The Social Services Map will be
published and mechanisms for its updating and use defined. The MTS in collaboration with
ICASE and INE will evaluate and redefine targeting mechanisms to promote access by the poor
to secondary and higher education and trainings6 Inthe area o f children rights, institutional and
legal reforms are being defined and municipal committees will be created in 2006. As for food
security, new information and improved institutional integration should make it possible to
revise the National Food Security Plan inview o f its implementation in2007.

83.        Potential triggers for the PRSC-3 would prioritize consolidation o f the revised
framework      for delivery o f decentralized social promotion services through municipal
governments. This process i s underway, and although finalization was initially envisioned for
the PRSC-2 period, the revised protocols between the MTS and municipal governments cannot
be finalized before approval o f the basic law on decentralization, which i s now expected in late
2006 (see section on decentralization).               Additional potential PRSC-3 triggers include
implementationo f the approved recommendations to deepen the reforms o f the non-contributory
pension system, and the approval o f an updated National Food Security Plan including the
identification o f new priority intervention areas. In addition to these priority areas, PRSC-3
anticipates the approval o f the new statute for the I C M and an evaluation o f the performance and

 The World Bank has recently initiated technical support to INEinthe development o f a national proxy means test
targeting systemto be applied to social programs and other areas (utilitytariffs, etc.).

sustainability o f its emergency child centers. Data from the Social Services Map would be
updated, and an expansion in the number o f social pension and NGO contracts in community
development i s planned.

                                    E.       FINANCIALFRAMEWORK

84.      The proposed PRSC-2 will provide US$lO million to the Government's 2006 budget o f
about US$300 million (GPRSP). PRSC-2 financing i s equivalent to 18 percent o f the proposed
GPRSP expenditures in the three pillars o f PRSC focus in 2006, or about 11 percent o f the
unidentified financing requirements. The PRSC-3 contribution to budget support would be about
US$lO million as well.          There is no earmarking o f activities to be financed, giving the
Government flexibility in orienting resources in line with GPRSP priorities. With the support o f
the PRSC, the Government will be able to provide financing for various activities that can be
tracked through line items in the budget including teachers and materials for basic education,
broader coverage o f the non-contributory pension schemes, and more even coverage o f health
services across the islands.

                                  A.       POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

85.     With a strong record o f economic growth and social investment, Cape Verde i s on target
to reach most MDGsby 2015 (Table 6). IfGDP continues to grow at the same rate, poverty may
be reduced by half in 2016. However, the remaining poverty is likely to be more entrenched and
growth alone may be insufficient. MDG education targets have already largely been met, and
health indicators are on track, with the exception o f immunization rates where more efforts are
needed. Meeting the provision o f water and sanitation will entail significant investment, but
urbanization will ease meeting this goal.           In all cases, however, overall national progress
conceals important geographic variations, with the rural areas generally lagging behind global
averages.


                                                     30

86.     The share o f the population with consumption under the poverty line has fallen by one-
fourth inthe 1990s from 49 to 37 percent, with the population in extreme poverty now estimated
at 21 percent. The share o f total household consumption devoted to food was reduced from 50 to
35 percent, reflecting a reduction in the number o f poor people vulnerable to basic food
insecurity. However, while poverty was reduced, inequality has increased. The Gini index for
per capita expenditure rose from to 0.50 in 1988 to 0.53 in 2002, exacerbating the already high
concentration o f consumption among the richest

87.     About half o f the rural population i s poor and about one-quarter o f urban dwellers are
below the poverty line.      The most rural islands, like Santo AntTio, Fog0 and Brava, have
significantly higher poverty rates. They are also the most isolated islands, with especially high
transport costs and, for Brava, no regular air or sea links. Limited access to quality education
and health care, isolation due to bad roads, and low agricultural productivity contribute to the
entrenched nature o f rural poverty. At the household level, the main determinants o f poverty are
size of household, education levels, employment, gender and lack o f access to migrant
remittances.

88.     The series o f three PRSCs operations is expected to have the following benefits on
poverty:

    0   Improved service delivery for the poor. The PRSC would provide incremental resources
        to finance GPRSP priorities, which should translate into improved services to the poor.
        Specifically, the PRSC will help support better schools (through teacher training,
        educational materials, and classroom improvements), health promotion services (by
        equipping and rehabilitating health centers in poor areas, better distribution of health
        personnel), better targeted social pensions, and an increase in the quality and supply o f
        social services like daycare centers and programs for the elderly at the municipal level.

    0   Improved well-being o f the population.      Better service delivery should translate into
        improved outcome indicators over time, such as higher secondary enrollment rates, better
        health status, and increased public satisfaction with services. Given the characteristics o f
        poverty, the wellbeing o f the rural population should beparticularly improved.

89.     Women are more likely to be poor than men in Cape Verde. Although a formal gender
assessment has not yet been carried out for Cape Verde, a revised poverty and gender profile has
been generated based on analysis o f the 2002 household survey. Despite impressive gains for
women in basic education and falling fertility rates, almost half o f adult women in rural areas
cannot read, and domestic violence i s an issue. Women are more likely to be unemployed, and
when employed to earn less thanmen, even at similar levels o f education and experience.

90.        Gender issues are mainstreamed throughout the PRSC. Gender disaggregated
performance indicators will be tracked in all relevant sectors. Specific priority interventions are
included as monitorable targets in the PRSC policy matrix. By the end o f the PRSC period
(December 2007), the Govemment expects to have attained the following monitorable outcomes:
        Within justice, women will have benefited from a community-based program on legal
        literacy, and from judicial aid and alternative disputes resolutions.
        Within education, gender parity will be achieved in primary education and would be
        greatly improved at the secondary level.
        Within health, access o f poor women to health services will have improved, specifically
        thanks to the increased presence o f trained staff --including midwives- inpoor districts.




                                                             32

    (d) Within social protection, the number o f women benefiting from decentralized social
        services will have increased, as well as the number o f poor women receiving social
        pensions and support for essential medicines.

91.     Given the overall thrust o f the PRSC series, no negative impacts on vulnerable groups are
envisaged. To the contrary, all the measures considered will result either in improved overall
well-being because o f better governance and more efficient and equitable government services,
or in specific gains for the poorest and most vulnerable members o f society because o f efforts to
reach those with difficult access to basic services, including social protection and safety nets, In
this sense, rural dwellers, and inparticular those living inthe most remote areas, stand to benefit
disproportionately from the PRSC series, as they have been traditionally those with the most
difficult access to public services.

92.     The Government has gone to considerable lengths to ensure that its actions are the true
expression o f the collective will, and has consistently and actively involved specific stakeholders
and citizens at large throughout the process leading to and accompanying the PRSC series. For
example: the GPRSP, which provides the framework for this operation, was the result o f an
intensive consultation process and has been widely disseminated; the household survey that
provides much of the baseline information to monitor results benefited from an information
campaign considered as best practice; two beneficiary assessments were carried out to help
assess the impact o f initialpoverty reduction interventions (in2003 and 2005); sectoral strategies
are the product o f consultations and open debate with national and international stakeholders;
civil society i s often included inspecialized bodies (e.g., the GPRSP Coordinating Commission).

                      B.     IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORINGEVALUATION AND

93.     The PRSC is overseen by the country GPRSP Steering Committee. Underthe umbrella of
the Ministry o f Finances, all ministries involved in the three GPRSP pillars supported by the

integrated national M&E system (Annex lo), the structure o f which i s shown in Figure 3. The
94.     The monitoring and evaluation program for the PRSC builds on the proposals for an

PRSC will reinforce a results-based M&E system with the objective o f ensuring timely access to
relevant data in order to monitor progress, evaluate the impact o f the poverty reduction strategy,
and help define new orientations or make changes based on analysis o f current data. Although
implementingthe system andmaking it fully operational are a longer term process thanthe time-
horizon o f the current PRSC allows, this initiative will help set up the basis for such a system
and support a culture of change for the way in which the government and its partners work for
the global development o f the country.

95.     The specific monitoring and evaluation activities under the proposedPRSC will be based
on, and reinforce, the system proposed for the monitoring and evaluation o f the GPRSP. They
will include: (a) annual GPRSP progress reports; (b) periodic reporting on achievement o f
MDGs (supported by UNDP); (c) overall annual budget monitoring through public expenditure
reviews; (d) annual sectoral budget execution and service delivery targets prepared by line
ministries; (e) periodic follow-up household surveys to track poverty and access to services

carried out by the National Statistics Institute (NE), (f) stakeholder surveys and qualitative
monitoring o f government performance and poverty impacts contracted through the STAD; and
(g) sectoral studies. Overall PRSC monitoring will be the responsibility o f the STAD o f the
Directorate for Planning. A detailed M& E action plan covering the PRSC series i s included in
Annex 10.~      A core set o f PRSC monitoring indicators are presentedinAnnex 11and are drawn
(primarily) from NDP, MDG and GPRSP indicators.

96.     During PRSC-1, the main institutional framework for the M&E system o f the GPRPS
was put in place, including publication o f the Decree creating the STAD and defining its
composition and the mode o f operation, including the creation o f the National and Regional
Poverty Reduction Commissions. Technical progress made on this component during PRSC-1
was concentrated on efforts to establish two national databases regrouping all information on
development projects at STAD (BDMP) and all statistics at INE (BDEO). The first sub-
component i s implemented with support from the Netherlands Cooperation which provided
technical assistance for training at STAD and support to NOSI to build the database, while INE
received assistance from INE Portugal to complete the interface between sectors and central
databases. IDA approved a trust fund to INE for statistical capacity building to finalize the
national strategy for the development o f the statistical system.

PRSC-2 Priorities and Potential PRSC-3 Triggers

97.     There will be two main focuses for PRSC-2. The first one will be to improve the overall
monitoring and evaluation system underpinningthe GPRSP. Actions expected to be completed

'Aresults  chain for the PRSC M&E system is included inAnnex 5.


                                                                          34

include the creation o f sectoral databases at the Ministry o f Agriculture and the Ministry o f
Education, as well as results-based training for government departments. PRSC-2 will also see
the development o f basic poverty monitoring tools. A disaggregated poverty map will soon be
completed with technical support from the World Bank. A pilot CWIQ (Core Welfare Indicators
Questionnaire) household survey o f core welfare indicators will be carried out to track poverty.
And, once validated and ratified by the Government, the hnding of the Agenda Estatisticawill
be discussed in a "Donors Table Ronde." By the end o f PRSC-2, the two databanks - BDEO
and BDMP -should also be completed and effective.

98.       To place emphasis on the timely development o f these monitoring and evaluation
instruments,PRSC-3 proposes two actions inM&E as potentialPRSC-3 triggers: (a) the creation
of sector databases in the Ministry o f Health and Ministry o f Labor and Solidarity; and (b)
implementation o f the main CWIQ survey.

                                           C.        FIDUCIARYASPECTS

99.       Fiduciary aspects, and strengthening o f the Government's own systems, are at the core o f
this operation. The 2003 CFAA and PERhave addressed the main challenges o f Cape Verde's
public expenditure management and financial accountability systems. An action planfocusing on
comprehensiveness and transparency o f budget and financial accountability i s being
implemented with the support o f the Netherlands, EU and the Bank. A follow-up o f the
implementation o f the CFAA's action plan has been part o f the PRSC supervision and
preparation. Public financial management has been improving steadily in line with government
commitment to reform, and dialogue between the Government and donors has been constructive.
The public financial management systemis reasonably adequate to support the PRSC.

 100.     IMF's most recent assessment o f the Central Bank was carried out inDecember 2002. It
indicated that the control environment o f the Central Bank was not satisfactory and the
 Government o f Cape Verde agreed on remedial actions. Such actions have been closely
monitored by IMF, which commended progress made by the Central Bank in building capacity
 for management and supervision as well as commitment to adopt international Financial
Reporting Standards. The IMF has also provided technical assistance to the Central Bank for this
reform. Therefore, the Bank i s not taking hrther action inthis area.8 Further details on fiduciary
 issues are inAnnex 5.

                                      D.      DISBURSEMENT AUDITINGAND

 101.     A single tranche credit o f SDR 7 million (US$lO million equivalent) would be made
 available to the Republic o f Cape Verde upon credit effectiveness, anticipated for July 2006. It
 is envisaged that the follow-on PRSC-3 will support the implementation o f the GPRSP in
 calendar year 2007.
 102.     The credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
 lending. The untied balance o f paymentshudget support will be disbursed against satisfactory


   IMF StaffReport for the 2005 Article IV Consultation,Sixth Reviewunder the PovertyReductionand GrowthFacility, and
 Request for Waiver of PerformanceCriterion (May 2005).




                                                             35

implementation o f the development policy program andnot tied to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will be needed. Once the Credit becomes effective, the borrower will
submit a withdrawal application requesting IDA to deposit the proceeds o f the Credit in the
Central Bank (BCV) into an account that forms part o f the country's official foreign exchange
reserves. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the credit into said account, an
equivalent amount i s credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank and to finance management expenditures. The Borrower will report to
the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to the budget
management system. Ifthe proceeds o f the credit are used for the ineligible purposes as defined
inthe Development Credit Agreement, IDAwill requiretheBorrower to refund an amount equal
to the amount o f said payment to IDApromptly upon notice from IDA. Amounts refunded to the
Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

103.    Through the Ministry o f Finance, the borrower will: (a) report the exact sum received
into the deposit account; (b) ensure that all withdrawals from the deposit account are for
budgeted public expenditures, except for purposes such as military expenditures or for other
items on IDA'Snegative list; and (c) provide to IDA evidence that the E C V equivalent o f the
Credit proceeds were credited to the Consolidated Fund account and disbursements from that
account were for budgeted public expenditures. It is expected that the TdC will provide IDA
with its annual report on the public accounts to Parliamentby the end o f the year following the
execution o f the budget.

                                 E.     ENVIRONMENTAL        ASPECTS

 104.   Vulnerability o f its climate and rainfall cycles, limited fresh water supplies, and reliance
on tourism as an engine of development puts sustainable use o f resources and protection o f the
environment as central to poverty reduction. The Government, with support from the
Netherlands cooperation and UNDP, has developed a National Environmental Plan (PANA,
2004-14) that identifies policies, investments and results indicators to promote the rational use o f
natural resources and the sustainable management o f economic activities. Its basic premise i s
that the sustainable use o f resources and environmental protection are central to poverty
reduction through the safeguard o f environmental assets, improved food security, and
employment opportunities. The Plan identifies three main environmental issues that match the
MDGs in the areas o f water supply, sanitation, and marine and terrestrial biodiversity,
Implementation o f the Plan will be overseen by the Department o f the Environment, within the
MinistryofEnvironment, Agriculture andFisheries.

 105.    Within the fourth GPRSP pillar, "Develop basic infrastructure, promote rational land
use and safeguard the environment", the Government reiterates its commitment to PANA
implementation. The Government o f the Netherlands is currently providing a budget support to
the environmental sector, aimed at financing national level structures and policies as well as
municipal environmental action plans. Critical prior actions and a set o f monitorable results
indicators have been identified. Based on reporting activities outlined in the budget support
partner MOU, IDA i s informed o f on-going progress inthe environmental sector.

 106.    In accordance with the new DPL guidelines, the PRSC team needs to assess the
expected impact o f PRSC-supported policies on the environment and, in case o f an expected


                                                  36

negative impact, assess the mitigation measures proposed by the Government. During
preparation o f PRSC-1,the possibility o f including the construction and rehabilitation o f health
centers in the policy matrix was discussed. After careful consideration, it was decided to take
this measure out o f the matrix, since this is an ongoing activity that does not need leverage from
the budget support and funding for this activity i s readily available in-country. Although this is
not part o f the PRSC matrix anymore, the PRSC team had already done the due diligence
exercise on this activity. As confirmed by the environment consultant who i s a member o f the
Dutch Budget Support team, the only potential impact o f this activity on the environment would
relate to waste management issues, a matter that figures prominently in the Dutch budget
Support matrix; andthat consequently will be addressed by them accordingly.

                                   F.      CAPACITYBUILDING

107.    As discussed in the Lessons Learned section, achieving the results expected from the
PRSC series require strengthening the capacity o f several o f the Government agencies and
ministries involved inits implementation. The Government itselffinanced a number o f technical
assistance and capacity building efforts in preparation for PRSC-1, including strategy and
development o f instruments in the social protection system, implementation o f critical CFAA
recommendations and studies, and institutionalization and analysis o f the civil service database,
all o f which will strengthen the capacity o f government agencies to carry out the PRSC. Besides
this very welcome development, the World Bank, at the request o f the Government, will remain
closely involved in capacity building through three main channels: (a) technical advice from
members o f the core PRSC team, through the policy dialogue in the context o f the PRSC or
through background analytical work; (b) financial support through relevant TA components o f
existing projects, and a new PRSP Trust Fund o f up to US$500,000 projected for 2006; and (c)
complementary analytical work or financial support from other donors. Inthe context o f one o f
the most effective collaborations, the Netherlands have committed Euro 2 million for the
implementation o f the CFAA and CPAR action plans. The EUhas also earmarked over Euro 1
million for TA inthe context o f the upcoming FEDprogram.

                               G.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
108.     The following risks and risk mitigation strategies have been identified:
    (a) Capacitv. Implicit inthe shift to budget support and reliance on national systems and civil
         servants for implementation is the issue o f capacity. The limited number o f technical staff
         in several core ministries poses a problem. Medium-term civil service reform strategies
         should help to builda better trained and stable cadre o f staff. However, inthe short term, a
         combination o f capacity building and technical support along with readjusting reform
         expectations in light o f capacity constraints will be needed.      The donors are working
         together to identify support for core areas o f GPRSP implementation that require technical
         assistance, for example C F M C P A R implementation, andmonitoring and evaluation.
    (b) External shocks. Fiscal policy is at risk ifoil prices increases are persistent (and not passed
         on the consumers), and if aid flows stop or decline substantially. Given the exchange rate
         regime inplace, pegged to the Euro, growing fiscal deficits can lead to the unsustainability
         of the peg. Furthermore, accumulation of contingent liabilities and mandatory expenditure
         programs could bring about fiscal slippages and stall implementation o f the more sensitive
        policy reforms, andpossibly delays ingeneral Government's strategy implementation.

SUBJECT: Letter of DeveloDmentPolicy for Poverty Reduction Suaaort Credit
lPRSC2l

Purpose

1. On behalf of the Governinent of Cape Verde Iam requesting a credit in the amount
   of US$ 10 million fmm the International Development Association, to continue
   supporting the Gavernmentof Cape Verde's structural reform program.

2. This Letter of Development Policy (u3P)     provides a summary of our Growth and
   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP). At the same time, it reinforces the
   commitment of the Government af Cape Verde with the program of objectives,
   policiesand measuresspelled out in its structural reform program,

3. The aforementioned credit will help to meet financing requirements that Cape Verde
   faces to implement its GPRS,

4, The new initiative GPRS is expected to run from 2005-2007 and will be a continuation
   of the earlier programs documented in IPRSP. These are The Grand Options Plan
   (GOP) 2002-2005, which emphasized on growth, poverty and income inequity
   reduction among the households. To strengthen GOP, the GOCV in the same period
   initiated the National DevelopmentPlan (NDP) 2002-2005 that aimed at maintenance
   of the macroeconomic balances; strengthening and consolidation uf the structural
   reforms; developing competitive advantages for the economy; and promotion of the
   economic growth and employment.

Recent developments

5. Cape Verde's economic performance has improved substantially over the past few
  years. Real GDP per capita (in current US$) is estimated at US$ 1,800 (2004), which
   shows a significant improvement since independence (1975), at which time it was
   US$ 190, or even as compared to 1990, when it was US$ 902. Real GDP average
   growth rates in the years 2000 to 2003 was 6.3%. Estimates call for a significant
   decrease to 4.4% in the year 2004 and an upturn to 6.5% in 2005. This strong and
   sustained economic growth has been anchored on the private sector development
   and integration of Cape Verde in the world economy. Private investment - especially
   external private investment - played a key role in the process by replacing public
   investment, which dominated untilthen.

6. The tertiary sector became dominant in the productive structure, supported by strong
   growth in tourism, as well as transports, banking and trade. The primary sector
   moved stowfy. With the growing rural population, and considering that agricultural
   incomes play a key role in the survival of one quarter of the labor force, the weak
   performance of the primary sector had a crucial negative impact on the income and
   poverty risks facing rural workers.
7. This gain in the growth of the real GDP per capita is manifested by improvements of
   the Human Development Index (HDI), HDI rose from 0.587 to 0.721 in the years
   1990 and 2003 respectively. At present, life expectancy is 68 years and 76 years for
   women and men accordingly (2004). In addition, Human Poverty Rate (HPR), which
   reflects deficiencies in terms of life expectancy, income, education, literacy and other
   areas improved from 28.8% in 1990 to 18.7% in 2005.

8 Cape Verde's economic growth of the last decade resulted in an increase in the
   inequality of income distribution as shown by the Gini coefficient, which rose to 0.57
   (2002), compared to 0.51 in the late 1980s. The excessive concentration of wealth is
   illustrated by the fact that 10% of the very poor population has only 1%of total
   income. The first seven decks (70% of the households) represent only 28Y0 of per
   capita expenditure, whlk the last decile (the wealthiest 10Y0) account for 47% of
   total expenditures.
9. The island of Siio Vicente has the highest concentration of wealth, with a 0.60 Gini
   coefficient, whereas the national average is 0.57. Next on the list are the islands of
   Santo Antfio, SrSo Nicolau, and Santiago, with 0.56.
10.The economic acceleration was accompanied by deep structural change in the
   economy, with services corning out on top. This situation had an important impact in
   terms of resource allocation among the sectors and on factor output, and, thus, on
   income and wealth distribution, on a national level, as well as within each island. On
   the other hand, the strong expansion in income in sectors such as tourism and other
   services worsened the imbalances in income distribution. Increasing demographic
   pressure, combined with erosion of agricultural soils, led to a negative impact on
   rural per capita incomes, thus also contributing to increase inequalities in income
   distribution.




                                          53

1l.Causes of poverty relate essentially to living conditions in rural areas and to the low
   employability of the poor. The combination of the nature of Cape Verdean
   agriculture, the high population growth rate, and the random nature of the climate,
   exptain the rural stagnation and low incomes. In fact, this process may aggravate soil
   erosion, which reducestheir productivity and availability.
12.To overcome the lack of resources in Cape Verde, the poor turn to migration and to
   the informal sector. At first, migration led Cape Verdeans abroad, but later, facing
   increasing difficutties in the host countries, they also started moving to the urban
   areas within the country. A clear evidence of this is the increase in population
   recorded in the city of Praia, with resulting pressure on sanitation, housing,
   education, and health facilities.
13.The FAIMO have become the main safety net in rural areas. Subsistence animal
   husbandry also plays a key role in rural areas, as it represents a security factor
   against the crises that follow drought periods. In urban areas, informal activities are
   the main way out for many families, as indicated by the surge in the informal
   economy. Women play a key role in this area, leading to a reduction in female
   poverty during the 1990s.
14,The budget deficit decreased from 19.5% (grants included) of GDP in 2000 to only
   1.5% in 2004, and estimates indicate that budget deficit stands at approximately
   3.0a/6 in 2005   . As a result of appropriate fiscal policies, current account deficit
   excluding grants dropped from 26.0% of GDP to 9.7% between 2000 and 2005.
   Meanwhile, the stock of external debt has decreased over the last decade. Despite
   this reduction, debt service remains a serious threat to any macroeconomic
   achievements and may impede and further delay the resilience of the economy.
   External debt service (in percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services) has
   remained stable, around 10.6 of GDP and around 15% of domestic revenues from
   2003-2005. Moreover, external financing support to GOCN has steadily decreased
   from 16.5% of the GDP in 2001 to 10.3% in 2003.
15.Inflation dropped steadily from 3.8% in 2001 to -1.9% in 2004 (deflation). This is
   comfortably beyand the reference threshold of 2.5%         -  3 O h that is necessary to
   maintain price stability and competitiveness of the economy vis-a-vis the country`s
   main partners in the euro zone.
Program overview

16.Cape Verde is a small country geographically as well as economically. Findings from
   Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)/ Household Living Conditions
   Survey (HLCS) conducted in 2001-2002 reveals that 37% of the population is
   considered poor, with 62% living in rural areas. Further, about 54% of the total poor
   population is considered to be extremely poor, while in terms of gender, about 51%
   of the poor are women.
17.The Government's Growth and Poverrty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), is outlined in the
   Poverty Reduction Strategy Document (PRSP) 2004-2007, which was prepared with
   support from the World Bank, Its main objective is a substantial reduction in the
   levels of absolute poverty in Cape Verde through the adoption of an all-around




                                     54

   poverty reduction policy, covering macro-economic policies, public management
   policies, as well as sectoral and microeconomic policies targeting the poor.

18.The GPRS is part of a broader strategic planning exercise that has been under way in
   Cape Verde and has as main components the Grand Options of the Plan 2002-2005
   (COP) and the National Development Plan (NDP2002-2005). The link between the
   NDP and the GPRS ensures global coherence of the planning instruments, thus
   facilitating management and monitoring of the various programs, and avoiding
   duplication of efforts and procedures. On the other hand, both the NDP and the GPRS
   include the same sectoral programs, thus guaranteeingcoherence between the global
   growth and poverty reduction goals on one hand, and the sectoral policies, on the
   other.

19.The overall aim of the GPRS is to further reduce poverty by implementing a series of
   basic policiesthat include consolidating macroeconomicstability, decentralizing public
   decision-making and service provision, and promoting employment by developing
   agriculture and other productive sectors with a multiplier effect on employment.
   Additional basic policies include income distribution and social protection, and
   environmental protection,

2O.From the above policies, the Government derived five strategic pillars setting forth
   the various forms of public intervention at the central and local level, using a
   Combination of programs and policy measures. The five pillars are: (I) Promote good
   governance, reinforcing effectiveness and guaranteeing equity; (ii) promote
   competitiveness to foster economic growth and employment creation; (iii) develop
   and upgrade human capital; (iv) improve and develop basic infrastructure, promote
   land use management, and protect the environment; and (v) improve the
   effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection system. The 2005 budget law
   reflects adequate funding for these five pillars.

   Promotegood governance, reinforcing effectiveness and guaranteeing equity

2I.The GOCV       realizes that the success of GPRS initiative will depend on good
   governance that focuses on the effectiveness of the economic policies especially the
   pro-poor policies. Under this program the GOCV            aims to reform the public
   administration at first place by introducing capacity building programs for the civil
   servants and enhancing manpower management skills. Particular emphasize will be
   in the area of information systems, communications technologies and human
   development planning. The government initiated the construction of a civil servant
   data base in 2004 and hasjust completed it.


22,Secondly, the objective is to reform and to strengthen the judicial system by
   impl~ment~ngseveral measures, among others, the strict enforcement of the rule of
   law; the enhancement of knowledge of basic citizens rights; the provision of funds for
   legal assistance to vulnerable populations;      and the creation of centers for the
   promotion of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms The GOCV has entrusted
   the Ministry of Justice to coordinate a l the neccesary actions among the pertinent




                                     55

   Cape Verdean public institutions, such as the National Human Rights Committee; the
   Constitutional Tribunal; the Justice Promoter; the Office of the Attorney-General ;and
   the Cape Verdean Bar Association, to achieve the above mentionedgoals,
23.Thirdty, the GOCv       ptans to continue with the reform of the State's financial
   management systems under transparent and participatory approach, The Country's
   Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA),      Public Expenditure Review (PER) and
   the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) undergo implementation. Said
   reform is directed into Budget Programming and Preparation, Management and
   Control of State Revenues, Managementof the State's Treasury and the Public Debt,
   Conditionsof Budget Execution, Management of Municipal Finances, Capacitiesof the
   Cenerai Inspectorate for Finances, Management of State Assets, Food Aid
   Management and Financial Reporting and finally to introduce the Public Procurement
   Code. The CPAR action plan has already been adopted and the GOCV is taking ail
   necessary measuresfor its implementation. MCA and other development partners are
   providing their support and technical assistance. In addition, the government has
   preparated the state general atxounts for the years 1998 through 2002 and has
   already submitted them to Parliament and is finalizing the state general accounts for
   2003. Finally, the GOCV has prepared a study that compiles all debts and contingent
   liabitities of municipalities, autonomous institutes and parastatals. Moreover, a plan
   for the settlement of the liabifities was prepared, which envisages the clerance of
   arreas in the next five years and the building-up of further arrears.
24.Fourthly, and concerning the fiscal reform we register the introduction of the
   expenditure-based Value Added Tax (VAT) in January 2004 as well as the
   streamlining of custom tariffs. The objective of these reforms is to increase resources
   availability for poverty reduction programs. VAT qomes to streamline the fiscal
   system and it is promoting collection of additional revenues.
2S.Fifth, the GOGV plans to enhance decentralization program that seeks to shift the
   decision making power to the locaf structures, specifically the poor. This will ensure a
   more equitabte distribution of resource by establishing the Financial Equilibrium
   Fund. Proceeds generated by the Fund has increased. The plan also seeks to
   coordinate smoothly the operation of Civil Society Organizations (EO) and that of
   Non-Gov~m~en~aiOrganizations (NCO) in improving the municipalitie~'capabilities
   in the provision of health, education, ~ n ~ ~ ~ n r nland ,
                                                            e n tuse planning and service
   delivery.


  Promote competitivenessto foster economic growth and employment creation


26,The GOCV continues with its efforts of advancing market economy by encouraging
   the establishment of domestic large, medium and micro enterprises, as well as
   promotion of partnerships with foreign investors, Public / private partnerships have
   been introduced. In view of this, the government has launched a competition policy
   that advocates the creation and enhancement of institutional conditions for the
   entrance of new businessesand firms in all the sectors of the economy.




                                       56

27.In order to ensure efficiency in the provision of goods and services the GOCV will
  continue implementing the privatization program, This is expected to reduce the
   government deficits by eliminating subsidies, increases the government resources in
  the form of tax revenues and sale proceeds of the privatized structures. Moreover,
   the process will fulfill the government's ambition of providing the poor with more
  varieties of goods and services at affordable prices.


  Develop and upgrade human capital


28.Despite the fact that Cape Verde is considered a middle income country, still
   unemployment poses threat especially to the poor. In the year 2001/02
   unemployment rate stood at 22% for the whole nation. About 33% of the tabor force
   is poor based on the XLCS of 2001/02. Indeed, 20% of the total poor population has
   been unemployed for more than 12 months while only 10% of the non-poor
   population has been unemployed over the period under investigation. This implies
   that, unemployment greatly affects the paor population. In sum, the unemployment
   rate of the poor population is 33% while that of non-poor is about 16%.
29.To took into the situation the GOCV has successfully initiated an employment policy
   that is expected to create morejobs and generate incomesto the poor. Attention has
   been directed towards programs such as Frentesde Aka htensidade de Mao-de-Obra
   (FAIMO) that offers temporary employments at a lower pay in infrastructure
   projects: such as road construction, soil and water conservation structures and
   reforestation programs.
30,At the same time the GOClf under the Ministries of Labor (MOL) and Education (MOE)
   is coordinating various skills development programs to assist the poor in securing
   more jobs and increase their pays. This has led to the initiation of the employment
   and the professionaltraining policies under the two ministries respectively. Particular
   attention is directed at strenghtening the organizational structure of civil society
   organizationsin order to supplant FAIMO.
31.Aside, the GOCV is supporting the reform of the land tenure and ownership system to
   encourage agricultural sector employment that provides a livelihood for the largest
   part of the population. Furthermore, the Government is committed to provide
   technical assistance through the Ministry of agriculture to such scheme. Moreover,
   strategic expansion of the tourist industry is expected to increase employment and
   incomes of the poor especially in the islandsof Sal, Boa Vista and Maio.
32.The development of human capital depends on two important ingredients namely:
   education and health. The track record is impressive but much remains to be done,
   particularly with regards to gender disparities between rural and urban areas. For
   instance, Cape Verde has attilined the goal of universal primary education. However,
   it is necessary to improve the quality of the education system. Teacher training
   priorities is indentified and actian plan developed. In addltion, students are to be
   encouraged to complete secondary or professional education in order to improve
   their chances of successfully entering the labor market. In this regard, a white paper
   diagnosing professional training is prepared. Literacy rates improved significantly




                                        57

   during the past ten years and more will be done over the coming years in this
   regard.
33.Another aspect of good health is the reduction of child mortality as well as infant
   mortality. However, the country's high health risk vulnerability calls for constant
   preventive and curative measures including routine vaccination and improvement of
   birth conditions in maternities. The goal of reducing child mortality by two thirds by
   the year 2015 may be achieved ifpast policies that led to the current results are
   strengthened. In this regard, the GOCV has already completed the analysis of health
   human resources and drafted and approved a strategy to increase the ratio of health
   professionals per inhabitant (this is already happening at the rural areas following
   infrastructure development). The challenges still ahead are: The especialization of
   health professionals as the country undergoes epidemiological transition.
   Furthermore, the Government is committed to strengthen the reforms in order to
   convey sustainability to the services rendered.
34.The fight against HIV/AIDS increases health costs to the households and individuals.
   The GOCV realizes that there is a need to advocate behaviour changes based on the
   current prevalence rate. There is a considerable dedine in the reported cases of
   tuberculosis and the associated deaths between 1989 and 2002. Further, good
   results have also been achieved in treating this disease and malaria is under control,
   except during rainy season.


  Improve and develop basic infrastructure, promote land use management, and
  protect the environment


35.The GOCV      recognizes the importance of basic infrustructure development that
   includes sanitation, water provision, and road construction and ~aiRtenance,In
   terms of sanitation, the government plan is to enhance the collection and treatment
   of residual water in the cities of Praia and Mindeloand extend this to the other cities
   pending fund availability. There is a serious problem on drainage system that threats
   the hygienic conditions of the poor and forms a major source of pollution especially of
   the domestic water.
36.Given the current outdated land use policies the government is underway to
   implement a comprehensive modern Municipal Urban Plans that will replace the
   obsolete Land Use Plans. Thus the GOCV            plans to reform the current basic
   cartography and cadastral systems to allow for property rights enforcement and
   municipal boundaries useful for other infrastructure development and property tax
   collections.
37.The most common environmental calamities such as soil erosion, coastline
   degradation, water and air pollutions, landslides, 10-95 of biodiversity, waste
   accumulation and dispersion are ubiquitous to the GOCV. To correct for the situation
   the GOCV has commissioned the second National Environmental Action Plan that
   outlines the policy implications and management framework to mitigate the situation.
38.Other infrastructure development policies include road services,              maritime
   transportation facilities and airport infrastructures. Inter-urban road transportation




                                      58

   has been totally liberalized; the open policy for the maritime transportation policy led
   to the liquidation of the state-owned maritime company "Arca Verde"; and the air
   code stipulates the regulations pertaining to the principles, rules and procedures to
   participate in international civil aviation industry and has led to the signing of some
   international air freight cooperation agreements.
39.This shows that the GOCV is highly committed to introduce reforms and restructure
   the transportation industry that is key to cost reduction and ensures effective
   delivery of goods and services to the poor.

  Improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection system

40.The current system of social protection under GOCV continues to suffer from weak
   targeting of the poor sections of the population. This has callfed for a systematic
   strategy that involves protection and support mechanisms to the household members
   in a situation of need, risk vulnerability and social exclusion.

41.TO counter this, efforts are already underway to implement a financially sustainable
   pension scheme and reform the social securw system. Nevertheless, there is a need
   to ensure that social protection transfers need to be well targeted to the poorest
   strata of the population if they are to have their desired impact on reducing poverty.
   Definitive data tables has been submitted to Bank Data.

42.More specifKally, the G'OCV is commited to advance with the unification of the
   existing systems that provides employment such as the redefinition of the FAIMO
   workers` benefits system and the reinforcement of the opacity of the National Social
   Security Institute (INPS).

43.AIternativelyr the government provides credit to support the poor and allow them to
   contribute into the production process. However, the Government acknowledge that
   there is a need to broad and better focus the targeted population. The aim is to
   promote self-employment via access to micro-credit that forms important sources of
   financial capital, which empowers the poor as an income generating activities. This
   has been extended to the establ~shmentof the financial intermediation so as to
   guarantee greater coverageof the poorest zones and the neediestfamilies.

44,With the same spirit the GOCV encourages sustainable agricultural development
   where the core of the initiative rests on the integrated enhancement of the agrarian
   resourcesand in the generalizationof the micro-irrigation schemes.

45.117 the area of food security, the EQCV provides guarantee of food availability and
   stability in the supply of the central and periphery markets, assuring the normal
   operation of the food markets and a management that involves the private
   commercial management in supplying the market.


Policy guidelines and expected outcome




                                       59

46.The GPRS will be implemented in a context of macroeconomic stability. The reference
   scenario used to design macroeconomic policies for the coming three years assumes
   a 6.5% average growth rate per year. Projected growth will be driven essentially by
   private and public investment, and exports. Supply side sectors expected to be more
   dynamic are hotels, industry, energy, fisheries and construction.
47,Fiscal performance will be guided by prudence, in line with the overall policy of
   macroeconomic stability, sustainable growth and poverty reduction, As a result, the
   primary current balance will record a surplus for every year of the period, and
   average 3.8% of GDP for the period as a whole.
48.Monetary targets are in tine with the goals of price stability and credibility of the
   exchange rate regime reflected in the upward trend in reserves relatively to imports
   of goods and services. It is also consistent with the principle of making internal
   resources available to finance the development effort. In this regard, credit to the
   economy as percentageof total credit is projected to expand.
49.The current account balance, including offtcial transfers, is expected to evolve
   favorably in relative terms, leading to a signiftcant reduction in the deficit, as a result
   of a relative stabilization of imports and an increase in exports during the period. The
   current account balance is expected to consolidate below double digits, reaching an
   average of -7.1Oh of CDP during the period. Gross international resetves are
   projected to reach 2.5 months of imports of gods and services.

Program implementation

5O.The GPRS will be implemented within the public planning and budget systems, which
   are currently undergoing reforms, Implemen~tio~will be guided by strong
   participation of community-based organizations, decentralized entities, and private
   sector representatives.
51,To support the process, the Government has decided to establish, starting with the
   2005 national budget, a MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and a number
   of Medium Term Sectoral Expenditure Frameworks (MTSEF) within key line Ministries
   (Education, Health, AgricuIture/Environment and Social Protection). It is expected
   that such a set-up will improve: i) prioritizing programs and projects that directly
   contribute towards the GPRS objectives and the sectoral objectives; ii) budgeting of
   programs and projects according to resources that can be mobilized; iii) medium
   term (three years) budget allocation according to priorities in order to reach the
   establisheddevelopmenttargets.
5Z.TO implement these guidelines, the Government has begun a number of reforms to
   make the public management system more efficient, more reliable and more
   transparent. In this regard, a number of measures are being designed to implement
   the recommendations from the PER, CFAA and CPAR exercises.
53.The institutional framework for i ~ p ~ e m e ~ tthegGPRS will consist of the existing
                                                     i n
   administrative apparatus, after the necessary functional changes in structure are
   introduced, The National Poverty Reduction Board is an advisory body that includes
   the main stakeholders, drawn from public administration, the private sector, and civil
   society. At the central level, the General Directorate of Planning, supported by a




                                     60

  Technical Secretariat, wili be responsible for coordination and technical support. At
  the sectoral level, the Studies and Planning offices within each line Ministry will
   prepare, monitor and evaluate priority programs and projects included in the
  strategy. At the local level, there will be Regional Poverty ReductionBoards, advisory
   bodies that will secure the input from localstakeholders.
Program monitoring and evaluation

54.The GOCW has set up a monitoring and evaluation system for the GPRS to guide the
   actions of the various actors involved in promoting growth and poverty reduction, In
   addition to governmental departments, the system include organizations from civil
   society, as well as the development partners.
55.The Government intends to ensure the following functions in the context of the
   monitoring and evaluation system: (i) monitoring and analysis of trends in growth,
   poverty, vulnerability and inequality; (ii} monitoring the execution of programs and
   projects that contribute to improved growth and poverty reduction; (iii)evaluation of
   the impact of policies and programs relatedto growth and poverty reduction.
56.This system will be based on a network that is currently constructed by NOS1
   (Information Technology Operational Unit). The system will include three core
   components and two support components. The core components wili be (i) a
   monitoring and trend analysis component, (ii)an execution component, and (iii) an
   impact evaluation component. The support components involve (i) creation of a
   physical, technical institutional and human environment that Is conducive to better
   circulation of data, information and outputs between producers and users, and (ii)
   improving information dissemination, aiming at a participated policy dialogue among
   the various stakeholders and, eventually, better design and execution of public
   policy.
57.To guarantee smooth and efficient functioning of this monitoring and evaluation
   system, the Government has decided to set up the following three-tiered institutional
   framework for monitoring and evaluation of the GPRS:

          (a) National Povertv Reduction Board (NPRB):            a broad-based entity
              responsiblefor monitoring and supporting political decisions in the areas of
              growth and poverty reduction. NPRB will be chaired by the cabinet member
              in charge of Planning and will include 17 member institutions from line
              ministries, civil society institutions, NGOs, private sector representatives,
              and labor unions.

          (b) Observatorv and Analvtical Svstem (OAS): made up of two sub-systems

Conclusion

The Government remains committed to its overall objective of poverty reduction through
sustainable economic growth, as set forth in its GPRSP. To this end, the Government
intends to energize the reform process, in a manner that is technically and
administratively feasible and consistent with the proposed overall objective.    In this
matter, a switch from project aid to budget aid is desirable, at both the global and
sectoral levels. It is therefore the Government's hope that IDA will grant the requested
credit to assist in implementation of envisaged reform program to reduce poverty
through implementation of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy.

                                          OVERVIEW

PublicSector Reformprogress and challenges
1.       Cape Verde, during the past 15 years, has moved on various fronts to reform its
public administration : (i)   progressive disengagement o f the State fiom the production system;
(ii)introduction o f a new career and salary system (PCCS) to strengthen professionalism o f the
workforce; (iii)  launch o f a series o f reforms o f public expenditure management, strongly
supported by donors, in order to strengthen control and improve planning and execution o f
expenditures; and (iv) political devolution o f some service delivery functions to elected
municipalities. The overall objective to improve effectiveness and efficiency o f the public sector.
The GOCV reform efforts have strong implications on capacity buildingneeds and administrative
structures and organization.
2.       The current administrative system is characterized by a lack of regulatory
authority. There i s no overarching coordinating body for leading and implementing the reform,
nor i s there any o f the key positions that have a role in regulating structures (positions such as
secretary general exist in very few ministries, and without the traditional authority to manage
resources, and financial controllers havejust been created but without implementation yet).
3.       Human resources management remains centralized, implementationof merit-based
recruitment and evaluation is lagging, and careers are not attractive for high-level
professionals. This leads to a significant turnover at managerial positions, which i s particularly
damaging because job descriptions are lacking and there i s no formal policy for professional
training.   In lieu o f comprehensive reforms, an ad hoc solution has been the introduction o f
specific arrangements for specific ministries or parts thereof, which led to large variations o f
salaries for similar positions between ministries or between central and local governments,
contributing to low morale. The planned reform o f the career and salary system will have to
address these issues.
4.       Public expenditure management reform have yielded some results, but budget
processesare still characterizedby an annual, one-year fiscal framework and a dual budget
preparation process (investment and recurrent budgets are, prepared separately by two distinct
governmental departments). Moreover, the system falls short o f providing needed information for
financial transfers to local governments, since expenditures are not always disaggregated by
geographical zones and planning o f recurrent costs for investment spending i s insufficient.
Ongoing reforms focus on establishing a comprehensive budget, and introducing a medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF).
5.       Check-and-balance institutions, albeit relatively new in the Cape Verdean setting,
are increasinglyplayingtheir role of watchdogs.The National Assembly is being transformed
into a more professional body, better able to fulfill its mandate o f legislative power and oversight.
The Judiciary i s going through a far-reaching reform process, with a dual goal o f increasing the
independence o f its magistrates and broadening access to its service. Capacity o f the Court o f
Accounts and the General Inspectorate o f Finances could be improved.               An IDF grant i s
supporting capacity building for the Court o f Account.       Clearing the backlog in closing the
national accounts has been a key focus o f the PRSCs and yielded results. In the meantime,
reporting for 2004 and 2005 i s being done on a quarterly basis and on time.

6.          The      political  decentralization        process      started       concomitantly            with  the
democratization process, and all actors concur that decentralization, though improvable, is
positive for the country. Implementation difficulties are linked to the weak resource base o f
most local governments, as well as to their poor capacity. Another caveat i s that the impact o f
decentralization on central and deconcentrated structures o f the State has not been looked at in a
systematic way, while transfers o f responsibilities sometimes occurred ina hasted manner.
7.          Cape Verde's government is struggling to reduce the size of its public sector, while
rationalizing it and making it more efficient. Despite more than a decade o f public sector
reform, citizens continue to perceive their public sector as inefficient and unresponsive. At the
same time, according to the 2004 Afiobarometer survey,1o73 percent o f Cape Verdeans think that
"all civil servants should keep their jobs, even if paying their salaries i s costly to the country",
which reflects a context o f highunemployment and decreasing opportunities for emigration, and
constrains reform options.
8.          Unlike many countries in the sub-region, the residents of Cape Verde generally
don't perceive corruption as a major issue, as shown in the Afrobarometer survey and as
reflected inthe Worldwide Governance Indicators. Infact, Cape Verde ranks well above average
for all Governance Indicators, as shown inthe following table.

9.           An urgent issue is to prevent reforms from evolving haphazardly, with some sectors
advancing faster than others.              The reform agenda remains uneven across sectors, with
considerable clarity for public finances, but much less for civil service reform.                                Little
coordination between reforms provides opportunities for isolated actions and overambitious
projects at the expense o f small, low-key but high-impact changes (E-Government initiatives are
a case inpoint). Meanwhile, ad hoc initiatives are taken to overcome bureaucratic rigidities, such
as the creation o f specific schemes o f services and o f autonomous agencies. The two key players
o f the reforms, the Ministry for State Reform and Public administration (MREAP) and the
Ministryo fFinance, suffer from a serious lack o fhumanresources, bothinnumbers andquality.

 10.         The proposed instrument to coordinate reforms could be strengthened. Recent
actions for reforming the public administration include the creation o f a Reform Commission,
which entails various representatives from key ministries, under the chairmanship o f the Ministry
for State Reform and Public Administration. This Commission has not become an instrument for
change nor coordination. It could be strengthened by being clearly supported at the level o f the
council o f ministers, and operationalized at two technical levels: (i) the level o f each ministry,
                                                                                    at

level, to organize, sequence and monitor the reform agenda in a coherent and sustainable
framework.

PromotingGoodGovernance,the FirstPillar of the GPRSP

11.      The first pillar o f the GPRSP, "Promoting Good Governance, Strengthening Efficiency
And Equity", emphasizes the following:

     0   Create an institutional framework for State reform and prepare a national reform
         plan.
    0    Improve accountability and monitoringand evaluation of public resources.
     0   Reform human resources management, including adoption of long-term training
         policy and focus on local capacity for training (reform of the national training
         institute for public servants, the INAG).
     0   Continue decentralization policies as a way to encourage participation of citizens.
     0   Simplify administrative procedures for most used services and use IT as a means
         to this end.
     0   Strengthen the rule of l a w and promote a transparent legal and regulatory
         framework as a means to encourage entrepreneurship andprivate sector growth.

                                         PUBLIC FINANCES

 12.     The fiscal slippages of 1999-2000 demonstrated the need for a sustained
dialogue on budget systems, not only to help controlthe use of State resources, but
also to improve pro-poor targeting. The Bank, the Netherlands, the EU and UNDP
have since launched in close partnership three comprehensive studies o f the State's
budget systems: (a) the CFAA identified strengths and weaknesses in the country PFM
systems, (b) the PER followed with a complementary analysis that confronted past
expenditure     trends with the weaknesses             of the current financial management
arrangements, and (c) the CPAR completed the analytical work with a review of
procurement systems.           The resulting recommendations, which are reflected in the
GPRSP, have been the basis on which partners propose to provide budgetary support.
The main findings o f these three analyses are detailed below, and are followed by the
 specific policy recommendations that are at the heart o f the agreed PEMreform program.

 13.     Cape Verde has consistently allocated an important share of its budget to the
social sectors. The social sectors (health, education and labor) accounted for 32% of the budget
in2003, with education standing at 22% of the budget. Education has also had the highest share
interms o f GDP o fthe three sectors inallyears, 7 % o f GDP on average compared to 2% and 1%
respectively for health and labor respectively. This share remains fairly stable from year to year,
 due to the importance o f teachers' salaries in its composition. Health and labor took up about 7%
and 4% o f the budget on average. Together, these three sectors account duringany given year for
not less than 30% o f expenditure, or 11% o f GDP. This establishes the Government's strong
 developmental credentials, since few countries in the sub-region allocate as much as it does to
 social sectors.

BudgetPreparationandAdoption

14.       Budget preparation is carried out accordingto a reliable schedule, which is usually
strictly respected. But analytical and informational shortfalls reduce the usefulness of the
exercise, and make it difficult for the state to estimate the financingneeds of public services:

      0   The presentation o f a true general policy framework i s not provided at the
          beginning o f the annual elaboration budget cycle, with consequences on the
          consistency o f sectoral budgetprogramming and on the final quality o f the overall
          budget.

15.       The memo sent by the M O F to the various line ministries does not communicate
all the relevant information. For example, the absence o f information on the past year
execution leads to new allocations based on cost estimates o f previous years. This
practice o f incremental adjustments risks creating a gap between the budget
appropriations and the real needs o f the services, and jeopardizing the administrative
reforms.

16.       The budgetpreparation is still carried out by two different departments, although
on the basis o f a unified budget classification. The double intervention o f the General
Directorate for the Budget (DGP) and the Directorate for General Planning (DGO)
remains a weakness, especially for the evaluation o fthe recurrent costs o f the investments
and their integration into the budget. The framework budget law is being revised inorder
to formalize the current changes (integration o f the two budgets, move towards a MTEF)
and their functional implications. This framework law i s a prerequisite for the
Government to be able to move on the MTEF andprogram budget agenda, since existing
laws and regulations do not allow for a programmatic approach.

15.       Some progress has been made in the preparation of sectoral MTEF in two of the
four pilot ministriesfor the 2006 budget. However,the wholeprocesswill require more efforts
in capacity building both in the DGP and DGO and in the targeted sectoral ministries.
Completion of the sectoral MTEF depends on the global MTEF including fiscal projections to
determineoverallbudget envelopes (thiswas done for 2006 butremains a bit weak).

BudgetExecution

16.       The procedure described inthe texts is prescriptive, with specific'features that are
inspiredby the Napoleonic system, but practice is largely different from the texts. The
system currently in force is highly centralized at the level o f the MOF, with a separation


                                                 77

between commitment phase and liquidation phase for internal control purposes. Because
o f the recurring treasury problems experienced by the State, however, commitment and
liquidation are done simultaneously for manytransactions.

17.      Control of the actual expenditures is entrusted to the services of the line
ministriesandit is weak. The cash shortage experienced duringthe last few years ledto
a loss o f suppliers' trust inthe State, as the expenditure was so long that it raised doubts
that the payment would ever occur. To manage this risk, suppliers raise their prices or
ask for payment before the service i s provided. Since the ministries are not informed o f
when the payments are made, commitments are programmed without real-time
information on the status o f liabilities toward suppliers.

18.     Reliable reporting i s made more difficult by a supplemental period that allows for
the inclusion o f an unlimited numbero f transactions during at least three months after the
end o f the fiscal year. A two-month period would be largely sufficient inthe near term,
with a view to limit it to one month to improve the ability o f the Government to make
timely and informed policy decisions. Moreover, some data retention keeps execution
data incomplete, which i s part o f the reason for the delay inclosing the state accounts.

19.      Additional shortcomingsinclude the absence of operating manuals and the
lack of a single accountingsystem". The negative impact o fthe former is made worse
by the little knowledge about ongoing reforms, which is resented as being imposed
randomly and arbitrarily. Lack o f a single account system preventsthe aggregation o f the
financial data from all public institutions, making it difficult to carry out a consolidation
of accounts, and inparticular to determine their debt and arrears --all the more disturbing
since the State may have to ensure payment o f these liabilities.

20.      The MFP carried out a review of debt and contingent liability at the end of
2004 (see Box 6.1). The Government has prepared a settlement plan including measures
to avoid reconstitution o f such liabilities and an action plan (calendar, responsibilities and
source o f financing) for settlement o f contingent liabilities and debt.




  The term "single accounting system" covers the concepts of integrated data-management arrangements,
and an integrated accounting framework (from equivalent charts o f accounts, or a single one).

                                  Box 1: Report on Contingent Liabilities

zontingent liabilities represent a risk to fiscal balances and public expenditure management as they
:ompromise pro-poor spending, and the integrity of budget systems. Contingent liabilities have appeared
;ince the large fiscal deficits in 1999 and 2000, principally as a result o f extraordinary restructuring costs
.elated to the privatization program, which were difficult to predict (e.g., some restructuring costs were
nherently linked to the outcome o f negotiations with investors). Other main contingent liabilities were the
.esult o f the implicit state guarantees that materialized when newly privatized state-owned enterprises
ransferred their non-performing assets to the state, as well as the implicit commitment to subsidize oil
mports.

aecent efforts to assess the real dimension of the contingent liabilities include a December 2004 study
:valuating the state's liabilitiesicredits on 17 municipalities, 37 autonomous institutes and 18 enterprises
:including 5 enterprises that are to be privatized, 2 in liquidation, and 6 enterprises where the state had
ninor participations). The following table presents the liabilities/credits across the several entities.

The global stock o f the debt as of December 2004 is US$131 million. While State's liabilities are
approximately USD 79 million, the credits correspond to US$14 millions. Electra (the main utilities
company) and the Central Bank represent an important proportion o f the State's liabilities with US$25
million and US$26 million, respectively. The parastatal Electra i s the largest creditor with US$25 million
followed by ENACOL and CV TELECOM with US$6 million and US$3.5, respectively.

The study recommends discharging the common debt o f the State and the municipalities by "resetting tht
meter at zero" (compensation of the debts) as well as the common debt o f the State and INPS b)
securitizing the debts. The document also recommends the discharge o f debts for institutes such as INGRL
(US$1.2 million) and INERF (USrS0.4 million), which play a key role in water supply to rural zones. For
public and para-public enterprises such as Electra, it i s important to consider credits with the public sector,
the subventions issues with the purchase o f gasoline, the question o f price determination, the development
o f the private sector and the development o f the privatization process. Meanwhile, the state has paid some
o f its liabilities, and has included some others inthe 2006 Budget.


21.        Finally, budget execution does not reflect the management of the public debt,
since it i s not managed through the current accounting system. The estimation o f the debt
and related payments is made with extra accounting tools. Moreover, the DGT is unable


                                                     79

to provide the amount o f the stock o f arrears concerning the current fiscal year and
previousfiscal years.

22.     The procedures for investment expenditures vary according to their source o f
financing. The modalities are described below.

     0  Procedures for investment expenditures financed from domestic revenues are the
        same as for recurrent expenditures.

23.     The procedures for expenditures financed by external financing are disparate and
difficult to monitor. The management o f most investment projects i s done within the
framework o f project coordination units, with the DGP taking part only in the
monitoring. This partly explains the important delays inclosing accounts.

     0  The regulation applicable to the autonomous accounts of projects is often not
        respected. For example, many accounts are open at institutions other than the
        Central Bank, so large amounts inproject accounts are not captured in the state's
        accounts o f executed expenditures (accrual or cash basis). This makes it difficult
        to assess the execution rate o f investments. Taking into account the fact that some
        projects require their accounts to be open in commercial banks, a solution could
        be for the Treasury to record in its books all the public funds (including the
        projects), while enhancing the control environment inthe Central Bank to prepare
        it for a progressive take-over o f all accounts.

24.     A commonfeature of the varioustypes of mechanismsfor the financingof
investmentsis the inabilityto carry forward unspentbudgetfrom one year to the
next, Regardlesso fthe type o ffinancing o fthe investment, andinthe absence o ftimely
information on execution, there i s no mechanism with an automatic "carry forward" o f
the appropriations not used during a given fiscal year.

Procurement

25.     CapeVerde does not have a consolidatedlegal and regulatoryframework for
all public sector procurement.For acquisition o f goods, equipments and services, there
are only few indications in several dispersed laws and the annual budget law, but no real
guidelines and principles on the procurement process. The preparation o f a new National
Procurement Code i s ongoing. The Code will clearly define the concept o f "Public
Procurement" and the general principles which govern it. This Code will also introduce
entirely new concepts, like the concession o f public utility (such as Build Operate
Transfer - BOT, Build Transfer - BT or Build Operate Own - BOO). In addition, the
legal framework will also be complemented by a law on the Delegated Management
Contract, to consolidate the good performance o f AGECABO on managing contracts for
small works at the municipal level. The same legal documents will also apply to the
Municipalities, with the necessary adaptations and simplifications.

26.     There are several institutions intervening in the procurement process with
little or no coordination: the Ministry o f Infrastructure and Transports (MIT) and
AGECABO (at the local level) for the civil works, the Directorate General o f Public


                                              80

Assets (DGPE) for some centralized contracts (water and energy, telecommunications,
insurance, fbel) and all public institutions (ministries, institutes, municipalities) for small
acquisitions o f goods, equipmentsandservices.

27.     Procurement processes are being slowed by a dilution of responsibility, as
most ministries and institutions are not responsible for their own procurement (although
the procurement o f civil works i s always supported by the MIT). AGECABO, despite its
proven efficiency, i s not always invited to provide services for municipalities for small
public works contracts. An authority for contract homologation also needs to be
introduced in the system. Prior reviews for contracts above a certain amount would have
to be approved by the Prime Minister, based on recommendations from an ad hoc
committee put inplace for such contracts.

28.     The absence o f effective recourse mechanisms (with the power to suspend the
execution o f the contested contract) i s being remedied, in the form o f Arbitration and
Mediation Centers, to be created in the chambers o f commerce (initially, for private
sector commercial disputes). These centers are to have decisional power (instead o f the
administrative courts) for litigations on attribution and execution o f contracts.

29.     Procurementproceduresandpracticevary widely, except for the civil works.
There are no standard bidding documents, request for proposals, or evaluation reports.
The lack o f consolidated regulatory framework leads to different practices from the
participants on the public procurement system, with negative impact on the private sector
intervention.

30.     Human resources are currently unevenly distributed and broadly
inadequate. The MIT has qualified personnel to handle procurement, but limited in
number to respond to all requests. For the other sectors, there are no qualified people
working specifically on procurement. Neither i s there, within Cape Verde, adequate
training on offer to improve the situation.

3 1,    The ex-anteaudit is currentlydone by the Court of Account,which is also the
authority for ex-post review. To avoid this situation of conflict o f interests, there are
plans to make give these attributions to the Prime Minister cabinet, through ad hoc
evaluation committees (for big contracts). Small contracts will be managed by the
ministries/institutions responsible for their own procurement process. The ex-post review
will remain a responsibility o f the Court o f Account. The ex-post review is currently
undermined by the delay injudging the state general accounts to provide a context to the
contract review. Nor does the TdC have authority to extract effective compensation to
enforce itsjudgments.

32.     An analysis o f the private sector had shown that there is enough capacity to
participate in most o f the public procurement processes. However, there i s limited
information on procurement opportunities. The availability o f the internet i s not being
leveraged to make available electronic versions o f all the documents to guide public
purchasers. The use o fthe internet will also be critical inpromoting transparency.




                                            81

CashManagement

33.     Cash management is on a daily basis and is hindered by a multiplicity of
accounts. It i s the responsibility of the Resources Programming and Management
Directorate (DGPR) and the Payment Service Directorate (DSP) o f the General
Directorate o f the Treasury (DGT). The DGPR has been given the task o f developing
monthly and annual treasury budgets. Information on the estimated level o f the receipts
comes from the General Directorate for Taxes (DGCI) and the General Directorate for
Customs (DGA). The DGO provides information regarding the expenditure side. Annual
programming exists only in theory.          Because o f past fiscal slippages, the State cash
management reflects a very short-term vision (sometimes almost a day-by-day
management), intended to face the needs qualified as urgent.

34.     There are many unrecorded accounts. This is the case for externally-financed
investment projects, some ministries, and the autonomous agencies. The existence o f
these accounts does not allow for effective treasury management and generates important
financial costs. For example, the State i s forced to borrow to face its financing need,
whereas some o f these accounts have a large credit position. A decision was taken in
1999 to close all these accounts but it was only partially implemented.

Tax Administration

35.     The General Directorate o f Contribution and Taxes (DGCI) and the General
Directorate o f Customs (DGA) are the main units responsible for tax assessments and
collection. The DGCI is incharge o f the income tax, but despiteprogress made, it i s still        '
not able to carry out some basic functions, such as internal controls and taxpayer audits,
especially on remote islands. By contrast, the DGA i s a well structured organization with
branches inthe different regions.'*

36.      The level of compliance of taxpayers with the incometax is not clear. DGCI
has an agreement with the largest commercial bank (Banco Comercial do Atlantico) to
collect income taxes and transfer them to the Treasury account. The reconciliation
between the amounts collected by B C A and taxes i s not done regularly, and therefore
does not allow for a close monitoring o f the effectiveness o f the arrangement, Efforts
have been made by DGCI and DGT to reconcile tax collection figures on a regular basis.
A draft protocol has been prepared to regulate the relation between DGCI and financial
intermediaries for tax collection. This protocol should put an end to the actual situation
whereby BCA collects tax and retain 1 percent o f tax collected without any formal
agreement. The new protocol will allow other financial institution to collect tax as well
and lower tax collection fees.

37.      The tax base is probably significantly underestimated. DGCI is updating the
NIF file (fiscal identification number) and has just completed the identification of tax
payers, The NIF file as well as the identity cards o f tax payers will be ready early in
2006.

'' TheDGA is collecting as muchas twice the receipts collectedbyDGCI, including 19taxes other than
custom duties.


                                               82

ExternalandInternalControls

38.     The legal framework regulating the mandates and activities o f the General
Inspection for Finance (IGF) has been overhauled in 2004-05, but its operations are
seriously weakened by insufficient means at its disposal. IGF field o f investigation i s
broad, including: (i) services o f the MOF and the line ministries; (ii) whole o f
                       general                                                 the
the public establishments and institutes; (iii)   municipalities and embassies; (iv) public
companies and autonomous funds; (v) companies, as regards the control o f their tax
obligations. However its performance i s hindered by insufficient qualified personnel
(which makes it possible to organize the services as stipulated by the decree-law),
financial resources limiting the number o f audits) and autonomy. After the
implementation o f the legal framework, the challenge will be to build sustainable
capacity within IGF and to enhance collaboration between IGF and other control entities
(Inspection General within sectoral ministries and TdC).

39.     The Office of the Auditor General, created in 1993, has administrative
autonomy and is independent from the politicalpowers. Although it does not have
financial autonomy, it controls its financial management and has its own bank accounts.
The budget o f the Auditor General is negotiated annually with the Minister o f Finance,
on the basis o f the Court's proposals. Law # 84/IV/93 confers on the Auditor General
great investigative powers covering all entities which manage public funds and all
financial or contractual transactions which commit the State or affect public finance
management. It has therefore been in charge o f the ex-ante monitoring o f large public
contracts that commit the State. Limited financial means coupled with the high cost o f
transport between islands greatly limit the effectiveness o f the Auditor General. Also, the
Office i s not sufficiently involved inthe reformprocess. For example, it does not have an
"intranet"  server connection to the server o f the DGO, which would facilitate and
guarantee the transmission o f quantitative data.

40.     The National Assembly's role should be strengthened in parallel with the
timely reporting on quarterly accounts. Progress in clearing the State accounts
backlog and in the use o f the IFMIS has facilitated the work o f the Finance Committee.
However, unlike other audit entities, the Commission i s not connected to the Intranet
network.

Progress on the Reformsof PublicExpenditureManagement

41.     An assessment o f public finance management cannot be done without taking into
account the various reforms inprogress. These include the following:

0  The regulation on Public Accounting. Set by the Decree-Law # 29/2001 o f November
    19, 2001, this reform took effect on January 1, 2004, and specified that certain data-
   processing aspects were set up on January l,2003. The new Decree-Law is largely
   inspired from the system in force in the French-speaking countries. Its most notable
   new elements are: (i) formalization o f the role o f authorizing officers and of the
                            the
   phases o f expenditure; (ii) the decentralization of the spending decision by giving the
    sectoral ministers the responsibility o f authorizing officers, (iii)
                                                                       the creation of an ex-
    ante financial control o f expenditure and (iv) the definition o f a modem accounting


                                             83

   system.    This new text, which applies to the central administration as well as to
   institutions with financial autonomy and all publicly-owned institutions, i s a great
   improvement in the budget execution process. It defines the rules applicable to public
   finance management, and sets in practice the principles o f checks-and-balances and
   transparency.
   The budget nomenclature which, although not yet completely finalized, was already
   implemented on January 1,2003.
   The State chart o f accounts, which is operational since January 1, 2004. The new
   chart o f accounts should allow for better information about the level o f arrears. Under
   the condition that information enters the system; the accounting system will be able to
   present the figures concerning the stock o f the foreign debt, as well as the domestic
   debt.
   Deployment o f the IFMIS system in line ministries: The MFP is implementing a two-
   steps approach for expenditure deconcentration. First, line ministries will have direct
   access to the integrated financial management information system in order to be able
   to monitor their expenditures levels.      In a second phase, they will be getting the
   necessary authorization to actually commit expenditures, possibly after the installation
   of financial controllers.
   Regarding the national debt, interface software. It will allow, in connection with the
   software for the simulation o f the debt, to carry out the interface between the software
   for the debt management and the accounting system.

                            PUBLICADMINISTRATION REFORM

CivilService Reform

74.      Past reforms have tried, with limited success, to improve personnelsystems
and services, such as recruitment,organizationalplanningand career management,
and to streamline the civil service.      A new career and salary system (PCCS) was
adopted in 1992, with progression not solely based on seniority and promotion done
through competitive exams. Implementation o f the systemhas proven difficult (resistance
from the agents, weaknesses o f the system o f competitive exams).. Top positions remain
strongly politicized, as demonstrated by multiple changes following elections (national or
local).

75.      Despite the fact that the State is the first employer in the country, civil
service positionsfail to retainqualifiedprofessionals. Today, there are few high level
and experienced staff, staff at managerial positions are visibly overstretched, and some
key positions are filled by international experts on secondment (see Appendix on results
from the Civil Service Database). The absence of a clear professional training strategy
deepens the problem, as well as poor manpower policies in the areas o f recruitment and
compensation systems. Professional training remains a mainly donor-financed activity,
organized on an ad hoc basis, outside the purview o f an underdeveloped school of
administration.   The high turnover o f managerial staff and the fact that individual
positions are not governed by clear job descriptions and work targets make public action


                                           84

a stop and go activity. The absence o f performance appraisals, laxity in supervision, and
the absence o f an accountability framework further deteriorated public administration
system. Civil servants, particularly in the lower and middle echelons, spend only part of
the official time inthe office.

76.     The ad-hoc proliferation of specific schemes is detrimentalto sound human
resources management. In order to try to remedy the unattractive package offered by
the "general" civil service pay and employment scheme, an ad-hoc solution has beento
allow sub-sets o f civil servants to be ruledunder specific separate schemes with a more
attractive package. The civil service database counts 49 specific schemes o f services,
with two main caveats to this situation. Inthe absence o f clear criteria for establishing
such schemes, their adoption i s more the result o f bargaining positions within the
government than the result o f an informed analysis on needed qualifications and skills
within the state apparatus.      It has not been accompanied by implementation o f an
evaluation system that would justify salary increases by higher monitoring o f
performance.

77.      The results of the comprehensivecivil service census conductedin 2002 are
being analyzed. The PRSC-2 prior action for this sector relatedto the completion o fthe
civil servant's database, as a way to improve management o f human resources but also,
through an analysis o f the current workforce, to propose scenarios for the reform o f the
civil service. The database has now been fully validated (including for staff working for
municipalities and autonomous institutes). Sustainability o f the database i s being ensured
through: (i)   the Decree 5/2004 o f September 27, 2004, stating rules for update and
management; (ii)   the deconcentration o f the database to line ministries ,and a training on
the use o f the database given to the staff in charge o f general administration various
ministries. Duringa transition period, the MREAP is still updating all processes, but this
will become the responsibility o f line ministries in the near future. Some fine-tuning is
being made to the database to allow for easy production o f consolidated, bi-annual
reports, In addition, a report on options to improve and integrate public sector reform
management, and assist the MREAP in putting in place an operational mechanism for
public sector reforms coordination and implementation has been produced and discussed
with a broad audience. The MREAP objective is to create an interministerial working
group to prepare and update existing laws on civil service. Many issues will need to be
reflected upon, among which the degree o f decentralization o f human resources
management, the future o f the various specific schemes o f services, the use o f contract
positions, the number o f political appointees, salaries and benefits, the geographical
distribution o f skilled professionaland incentives to work inremote areas.

78.      Current changes in public management need to be accompanied by
restructuringefforts. Lack o f coordination between different ministries and different
levels o f government, and inadequate linkages between sector policies and budget
allocations are epitomizing the challenges ahead. The Cape-Verdean administration i s
moving towards new principles o f public management, based on a clear articulation
between strategies, allocated resources and expected results.         To rationalize public
administration structures and to accompany the shift to program based management, two
2004 Decrees (on Administrative Structures and on Public Managers in priority



                                            85

ministries) regulated the merging o f the administrative units in charge o f general
administration and finances, and created a new career o f `public administrator".       The
"public administrators" will be top civil servants recruited on their technical merits. They
will benefit from solid public management training and be offered an attractive
compensation, with the objective o fproviding the various administrations with specialists
inpublic management and retain them inthe administration. The first graduates for this
new career will be trained in2006 and are expected to take office in2007.

Decentralization

79.      Decentralization is one of the key vehicles chosen by the Government to
improve service delivery. Political decentralization in the country started in 1989, with
four local elections between 1991 and 2004. The legal framework for decentralization
gives the 17 municipalities broad attributions (including health and education).
Transitory rules for implementation specify that attributions will be delegated
progressively. To date, four areas have been transferred: public works, roads, social
promotion andmunicipal taxes.

80.      Implementation difficulties are due to a poor adaptation of central
government and de-concentrated agencies to a decentralized setting, poor
coordination between the various actors, lack of clarity and planning of transfers
and weaknesses in the legal framework. Bothmunicipal prerogatives and financing are
currently defined under an outdated set o f laws which i s being updated (see below).
Further thought also needs to be given to the channels through which municipalities and
the central government coordinate their interventions. Today, municipalities take actions
that have a bearing on the central state budget without prior dialogue with relevant
authorities, there is overlapping o f mandates, and some sectors fall between the cracks.
Since there i s no institutionalized coordination mechanism that would bring together all
local actors at regular intervals, collaboration depends too much on interpersonal
relationships.

81.      Financial resources. Municipal resources are composed o f central transfers (the
formula-based Financial EquilibriumFund (FEF) and contract programs), local taxes and
proceeds o f decentralized cooperation. The FEF i s the main source o f resources for most
municipalities. The new local finances law established a revised formula, increasing the
percentage o f government resources transferred from 7 to 10 percent, and linking the
resources transferred to revenues collected by the Government the previous year.
Devolution o f local taxes to the municipalities proved difficult to implement, due to the
weak administrative capacity to collect, uncertainties (e.g., outdated cadastre) and low
resource base o f most municipalities. However, in some o f the largest municipalities, the
installation o f a computerized system helped in increasing revenues. Another problem is
that there i s no comprehensive knowledge o f the municipalities' resources, since
municipal budgets do not follow a standardized format, and proceeds o f decentralized
cooperationor one-off revenue such as the sale o f landmay represent an important source
o f financing.




                                           86

82.     Human resources. Attracting qualified personnel outside the capital, particularly
insmaller islands, is difficult, and this especially since municipalities do not benefit from
a specific, more attractive scheme o f service.        In order to accompany transfer of
competencies, various solutions were found (secondment, partial transfer, etc), which
have not always been satisfactory. There i s a need to revisit, from the viewpoint o f the
municipalities, the need for staffing, in the context o f the broad HRM reform, and
elaborate various options, which would give municipality flexibility in hiring and
retrenching while encouraging use o f existing staff inthe public service.

83.     Main reforms planned on the broad legal framework are ongoing. Technical
assistance is being contracted inorder to prepare the "decentralization basic law", the law
that would guide and harmonize decentralization processes, and clarify mechanisms for
concomitant transfer o f resources and responsibilities for municipalities. The work will
be followed by an interministerial committee.

84,     The creation of five new municipalities (in Santiago, Sao Nicolau and Fogo)
has been approved, and they will be progressively installed. The cost o f installing
these new municipalities i s likely to be high, especially inview of the small population o f
the country.

E-Government

85.      `E-Government' has advanced in its conception and implementation in
recent years.      The Government sees modern information technologies as a core
opportunity to improve the effectiveness, outreach and transparency o f public services, a
goal directly related to successfwl poverty reduction strategies. Use o f IT i s particularly
attractive in a discontinuous geographical setting and in a country with a very important
expatriate community.

86.      There is local capacity to design IT systems. Created in 1997 to oversee and
manage the financial reform process, the mandate o f the State Financial Administration
Reform (RAFE) i s to strengthen the institutional capacity to manage public resources and
to create the necessary instruments to do so, including the implementation o f information
technologies.   RAFE has grown into a more ambitious unit, dealing with various IT
modernization projects inthe country (single-windows inthe municipalities, development
o f websites, central government networking).         In 2003, RAFE was renamed NOSI
(Operational Nucleus for Information Systems) and attached to the Prime Minister's
office, to underline its crosscutting mandate. NOSI i s responsible for the IFMIS, which
shows very impressive characteristics.

87.      While IT activities have shown results, the IT capacity has not always been
matched by organizational, financial or institutional capacity. There i s an urgency to
match NOSI's activities with sufficient buy-in from the services, appropriate changes in
structures, necessary training, and reengineering of processes. NOSI has developed a
strategic plan, which should help take into account prioritization, cost estimates and
absorptive capacity - emphasis on change management and restructuring parallel to IT

introduction- would help. At the very least, any activity undertaken by NOS1 should
follow a strict protocol that includes earmarking o f expected recurrent costs.

88.      A current focus of public administration reform is the creation of "citizen
houses", a one-stop shop that would provide a unique entry point for most used services
to citizens andbusinesses. The model, which will rely on IT, has been developed, and the
first Citizen House has recently opened in Praia. This could, if rightly implemented,
translate public sector reforms into visible benefits for the users. The Citizen house will
regroup services most requested by citizens and businesses.

Legal andJudicialReform

89.      With participation of the Ministry of Justice, a full-fledged Legal and
Judicial Assessment of Cape Verde was undertaken in 2002. As a result o f said
assessment, a study entitled: "Assessing the Judicial System in Cape Verde" was
published, identifyingthe most urgentneeds o f these sectors inCape Verde.

90.      Upon identificationof said urgent needs of the legal and judicial sectors, the
Ministryof Justice adopteda StrategicPlan for 2003-05 definingpriorities for these
sectors, including: (a) the promotion o f sensitization and communication campaigns to
enhance knowledge and adequacy to the rule o f law; (b) free and easy access to justice
for the poor; and (c) the creation and promotion o f alternative dispute resolution
mechanisms for the poor. The protection and promotion o f human and citizen's rights o f
the most vulnerable groups i s explicit inthe draft GPRSP.

91.      Broadeningknowledgeand access to justice is a priorityto create conditions
for the creation of an environment conducive to the effective exercise of individual
and collective rights, and increase legal security as a fundamental aspect of
economic development. This first priority will be dealt with through community-based
programs, inorder to enhance ownership and impact o f the actions. Following a growing
consensus among legal professionals that legal andjudicial assistance (in and outside the
court rooms) need to be totally re-organized and re-designed, the reform o fjudicial aid i s
 another keypriority.

 92.     Judicial aid and alternative dispute resolution are key instruments to
broaden access to justice. The allocation o f funds for judicial aid by the Ministry o f
Justice for the compensation o f attorneys involved in the judicial protection o f poor
persons in courts has long been a problem, despite the existence o f a Judicial Aid Fund
 since 1988. To solve this problem, a decree on judicial assistance became effective on
 October 1, 2004, setting forth an arrangement whereby members o f the Cape Verdean
Bar Association would provide legal services to underprivileged citizens in exchange for
pre-arranged professional fees. Another priority was the adoption o f Alternative Dispute
 Resolution (ADR) mechanisms, and thus a decree-law on mediation and a Law on
 Arbitration have been approved and published. Training o f trainers for both types o f
ADR is ongoing. The regional communication program on legal literacy and access has
been elaborated and five protocols are to be signed between local associations and the

Ministryo f Justice for implementingactivities on legal access andpromotion ofthe rule-
of-law .
93.     An ongoing Institutional Development Fund grant supports Cape Verde with the
strengthening o f its Ministry o f Justice, including, inter alia: (a) design o f legal
information and communication campaigns; (b) compilation of Supreme Court decisions;
(c) training programs for judges and judicial clerks; and (d) the development o f data
bases to monitor the access to justice o f poor populations. In addition, a Japanese Social
Development Fund grant i s under implementationto improve the access to legal services
o f vulnerable populations (especially women), through, inter alia: (a) the establishment
o f eleven legal centers; (b) the provision o f basic legal counseling, mediation and
conciliation services; (c) production and dissemination o f legal education materials; (d)
the provision, incooperation with the Cape Verdean Bar Association, o f an in-court legal
assistance scheme, and out o f court counseling services; and (e) training o fparalegals.

     APPENDIX: Highlightsfrom the validatedhumanresourcesdatabase,2005.

94.     The following results are based on the data for the central and deconcentrated
administration (14,393 agents), but does not yet encompass data for the personnel o f the
municipalities and the autonomous institutes.

93.     Size of the civil service. According to a draft report, since 1975, the year o f
independence, the number o f civil servants has been fast growing. The size o f the civil
service i s a heavy burden which consumes more than half o f the recurrent budget, which
leaves not much margin to the government to invest in reform activity. This underlines
the importance o f launching a national debate on this sensitive issue.

94.     Distribution per institution. Not surprisingly, the Government's main
employers are the Ministry of Education (50%), Health (12%) and Environment and
Agriculture.

95.      Ratio of permanent civil servants vs. temporary ones. As regards the ratio o f
permanent civil servants to the temporary ones, the numbers are very disproportionate.
Out o f 14393 civil servants, there are only 7422 permanent civil servants, constituting 52
percent o f the total civil service. Some staff have been working continuously under short-
term contracts for the past 20 years. This also demonstrates that the partial freeze on
recruitment had no effect, since in any case people entered into the public service as
temporary employees.

96.      Percentage of Staff affiliated to the general statutes ("quadro comum'~).In
order to try to remedythe unattractive package offered by the "general" civil service pay
and employment scheme (the quadro cornurn), an ad-hoc solution has been to allow sub-
sets o f civil servants to be ruled under specific separate schemes with a more attractive
package. The civil service database counts 41 specific schemes o f services. The civil
servants still affiliated to this general scheme have lower compensations packages and
suffer from low morale. There i s a clear imbalance between institutions as regards the
percentage o f staff belonging to this scheme.

professional and the managerial areas, and perhaps overstaffed in the semi-skilled and
unskilledareas. Of the total 14393 civil servants, 5000 to 7000 roughly are employees
with low professional qualifications.             The graduate and degree holders and above

constitute only 25 % o f the civil servants, whilst those who have secondary education are
7044 be 49% and those who have primary education and no education are 26%. Out o f
the total, there are 7252 persons from the Education Ministry.Most o f the primary school
teachers have low qualifications. The large number o f teachers has reduced the levels o f
education in civil service.

98.      Gender. On average, women in the civil service are more educated than men.
The profiles are similar at the extremes (no education or tertiary education) but there are
more women who completed secondary education than men. However, inthe majority o f
institutions, the percentage of female workers affiliated to the quadro comum i s superior
to their representation in this institution (except for the National Assembly, the ministry
o f Health and the ministry o f environment and agriculture: the ministry o f education
shows almost an even %).

working in Praia, i.e. 52% (this however does not include the staff working directly for
the municipalities).   To this list must be added many civil servants in the Island o f
Santiago who live in Praia and commute daily to municipalities where they work in
Councils or in deconcentrated services. Albeit the percentage i s commensurate with the
population distribution in the country, it appears that islands outside Santiago are poorly
deserved by civil servants. It i s extremely difficult for the government to convince civil
servants to be transferred and to serve inthe Islands, especially the smallest ones.

                         Annex 6: EducationSector TechnicalNote


I. Background
1.      Cape Verde has made a commitment to work towards achieving the
Millennium Development Goals in education (MDG #3 is to ensure that, by 2015,
children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of
primary schooling). Cape Verde's education achievements now rank among the top o f
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries and other countries o f lower middle income level.
Over the past 5 years, the Government has achieved quasi-universal primary enr~llment.'~
In2003-04, it was estimated that over 90 percent ofthe students graduated from primary
school andthe transition rate to secondary for those graduating from primarywas estimated
at 72.4 percent. Illiteracy for the population over 15 years o f age has been halved since
1981, and was estimated at 25 percent in 2000. Illiteracy i s concentrated among adults
(particularly rural women), with literacy rates among 15-24 year olds at 95 percent due to
gains in schooling over the last 20 years. Gender equity i s achieved at the primary level,
and girls outnumber boys slightlyat the secondary andtertiary levels.


2.      Among the strengths o f the Cape Verde's education sector, it is important to point
out:
    A highand stable level of public financing for education which has beenmaintained
    roughly around 8 percent o f GDP over the years (including capital expenditure).


    primary education and growing access to secondary.
    An adequate control o f student flow with a close14to near universal coverage of

    A schooling environment in constant improvement with the availability o f essential
     school inputs and better trained teachers.
    A strong community and parents' participation in education and involvement of
    Municipalities in the delivery and financing o f early childhood education (ECE)
    services.
    A lean administration o f the Education Ministry, with 2 percent o f staff in central
     administration, 10 percent of staff in delegations, and 88 percent o f teachers in
    teaching assignments and mainly inprimary education where 65 percent o f students
     are enrolled.
    A high level o f capital expenditure allocated principally to secondary education in
     order to prepare the surgingdemand for this education sub-sector.
11.      Mainissues in the educationsector
3.       Several studies have been completed by the Government, the Bank and others
which identify the main issues inthe education sector.15 These issues include:


l3Gross Enrollment Rate inprimary education was 114.4%and first grade intake rate 97.1%, respectively
in2003-04.
l4Cape Verde has begun its demographic transition and the number o f school-age children (6 to 11years of
age) has been slowly declining since 1999.


                                               94

  The coverage of early childhoodeducationstillneeds to be improved. Around 59
  percent of the 3-5 year old attended ECE during the school-year 2002-03. Regional
  and socio-economic disparities in access to ECE remain strong. The Ministry of
  Education providedin and pre-service training for ECE teachers in 2004-05. Many
  municipalities have set up ECE centers inrecent years inorder to improve coverage.
  The quality of primary education should be further improved. There are no
   systems to measure learning outcomes in Cape Verde. Proxies to measure quality o f
   education exist, such as the passing rate at the end o f the primary cycle exam and
   other indicators of the education system internal efficiency (e.g., repetition and
   dropout rate).       These indicators are relatively good and show a reasonable
  performance o f the primary education system. At the same time, several initiatives
   could be envisioned to boost education quality such as lengthening the school day
   (right now students attend school four hours per day); providing additional learning
   and teaching materials; developing teacher resource centers in order to facilitate
   exchanges between teaching staff; developing school and student report cards and
   finally allowing for greater community and parents participation.
   The surging demand for secondary education needs to be satisfied. As a large
   share o f students graduates from primary school, secondary education has to cope
   with mounting pressure to improve the range and quality o f its offerings. Despite
   some recent investments in infrastructure, the secondary education sub-sector is still
   ill-prepared for the surge in enrollment. There are a few large secondary schools
   (with a capacity between 2,000 and 5,000 students) but not enough medium size
   secondary schools. School facilities are unequally distributed between islands and
   within islands. There is a shortage o fteachers insome subject areas. The curriculum
   will likely need to be revised. The internal efficiency o f secondary education is low
   resultinginwastage o f resources (average repetition and dropout rates are 20percent
   and 16 percent, respectively in 2003-04).        Secondary technical education remains
   marginalized.       Students enrolled in technical education do not benefit from
   complementary professional training that would facilitate their entry into the job
   market.
   The professional training system needs restructuring. The professional training
   system is not structured to respond to the social demand or to meet the needs o f the
   economy inqualified labor force. Rules and responsibilities governing the sector are
   unclear, very few providers are certified, and there i s no pedagogic supervision.
   Curriculum content i s sometimes random and degrees are not always accepted by the
   private sector. Financing for this sector i s too low and often depends on support from
   donors. The assessment o f the professional training sector was completed in 2004.
   A first draft o f a professional training sector strategic plan was elaborated in May
   2005, but it was deemed unsatisfactory and additional work was required. Greater
   political support and participation from the private and non-profit sectors are needed
   to develop a relevant and economically and socially viable professional training
   system.

    Tertiary educationsupply is expanding. Grants and opportunities to study abroad
    have been reduced in recent years whereas the number o f students completing upper
    secondary i s growing rapidly. New offerings have recently emerged such as the
    Piaget University that started to operate in2004 in Cape Verde. The Government set
    up a commissionto planthe creation of apublic university o f Cape Verde.

    Salary expenditurecontinues to crowd out other types of recurrent expenditure,
    Salaries absorb about 86 percent o f recurrent expenditures, and could be construed as
    a measure o f inefficiency. While the average teacher salary relative to GDP for
    primary education i s close to the regional average (but higher than the ratio o f 2.0 for
    countries with similar levels o f income), their level for secondary education i s much
    higher, and contributes to the high percentage of personnel charges in recurrent
    expenditure.    As a result, parents have assumed a growing responsibility in the
    financing   o f education, notably in secondary education.        And most investment
    programs are supported by donors.
111.    EducationReformStrategy
4.      The priorities for the Government's education policy are spelled out in the
Major Options of the Plan and the NationalDevelopmentPlan (2002-05) and in the
EducationStrategic Plan. Thesepriorities are as follows:
        Promoting equity and improving the functioning o f preschool education in order
        to create the conditions o f its progressive generalization.
        Improvingthe quality o fprimary education.
        Aligning the resources o f secondary education on the requirements for
        development;
        Supporting the development o f tertiary education.
        Reducing illiteracy and supporting adult educatiodlife-long learning.
        Developing professional training as a means for upgrading human resources and
        equipping them to meet the requirements o f the exercise o f citizenship and o f
        economic growth and o f increased competitiveness.
        Consolidating school welfare programs.
        Promoting a national policy for youth and sport to ensure a better integration o f
        the young generation into social life.
5.      Overall budget constraints put a premium on increases in efficiency to
permit further system expansion. The Education Ministry is considering a number of
measures to improve efficiency in primary and secondary education: (a) increase the
pupil/teacher ratio (PTR) and improving deployment o f teachers to reduce the number o f
teachers, or at least to maintain it stable inview o f the additional teachers to be recruited
because o f the expansion of access to secondary school (in primary education, it i s
expected that the PTR will increase from 27 to 35 by 2009-10); (b) increase the number
of teaching hours for secondary school teachers from 18 to 22 hours per week; (c)
improve internal efficiency by increasing the percentage o fprimaryschool graduates by 2
percentage points per year as o f 2004-05 while lowering repetition anddropout rates.
6.      Some efficiency gains will only be possible if the quality of education
improves. Important efforts are currently under way to improve the skills and
proficiency o f primary teachers. It will also be necessary that all children enrolled have


                                             96

access to proper learning materials and that teachers know how to use them. A student
achievement test will be introduced to measure student learning in key subjects, such as
Portuguese and mathematic. More regular testing will provide useful information for
progress monitoring ineducation quality, but also to identify specific student groups who
are falling behind. Insecondary education, recent data show that the internal efficiency i s
poor, with an increasing percentage o f repeaters in each grade. Better trained teachers,
some curriculum revision, more intense pedagogic support, and availability o f teaching
and learning materials in the classroom will contribute to improving education quality
and thus graduation rates. Efforts inthat direction have already started and will intensify
via the PRSC.
7.       The Government presented,its Education Strategic Plan in March 2003. It
focuses on six main areas: (i) consolidation and gradual expansion o f all sub-sectors
                               the
o f the education system; (ii)
                             the overall improvement o f the quality and efficiency o f the
education system; (iii)the strengthening o f cultural and civic values; (iv) the
modernization o f the education system; (v) the transfonnation o f the education system to
support social progress and alleviate poverty; and (vi) the development o f partnerships to
improve the management and sustainability o f the education institutions.
IV.      EducationPrioritiesinthe CapeVerde's GPRSP
8.       The Government has underlined the importance of education in its
development strategy. The general objective is to improve the employability and skills
o f the labor force as a means to support economic growth and alleviate poverty. The
accumulation and upgrading o f human capital entail to improve the education system and
to reinforce professionaltraining. Inparticular, the Government has emphasized the need
to: (i)overcome barriers that prevent the poorest from accessing secondary education; (ii)
improve teacher training in order to increase the education system's internal efficiency,
thus reduce school wastage at all levels; and, (iii)   reinforce the linkage between the
education system andthe labor market by ensuring that the skills and knowledge acquired
are those neededbythe economy.
9.       Inlinewith itsEducationReformStrategy, the Governmentvows to improve
quality of education in all sub-sectors, taking into consideration the reduction of
regional, gender and socio-economic inequities. Promoting access to secondary
education, diversifying supply o f vocational and professional training streams, and
providing better schooling orientation and specialization will raise the overall level of
education o f the population and facilitate the entry o f young graduates in the labor
market. It is expected that the Government will reinforce its normative and quality
control role by creating a proper framework for the development o f professional training
while the private sector and students themselves will support most o f the cost o f
professional training. Skill demand from the labor market should regulate the supply o f
professionaltraining.
V.       Financingof the GPRSP
10.      The overall cost of the consolidation, modernizition and expansion of the
educationsystem (89 percent of all education programs in the PRSP) is expectedto
cost an estimated US$37 million between 2005 and 2007. Fifty-seven percent is
equivalent to capital expenditure and 43 percent i s equivalent to recurrent expenditure



                                          97

(based on the costing documents included in the GPRSP). Expenditures to increase
access to education include: construction o f early childhood development centers,
expansion and renovation of school facilities inrural and/or poor areas,, construction and
equipment of secondary schools in rural areas, expansion o f the tertiary education
infrastructure. Expenditures to improve education quality include: (i)revision o f the
basic education curriculum and textbook collection; (ii)    training o f preschool and basic
education teachers; (iii)reformulation o f the objectives o f the secondary education
curriculum; (iv) equipping o f libraries, laboratories, computer labs; (v) training o f trainers
inadult education; (vi) distribution ofa free hot mealto all children enrolled inpreschool
and basic education in disadvantaged areas; and (vi) strengthening o f school health
interventions. Additional spending, such as for teacher recruitment and school facilities
operation, has not been included and must be accounted for.
11,     The quantitative targets for increased access to early childhood education
and secondary education are quite modest. As a result, the fiscal impact o f the
expansion o f the education systemshould remain manageable, inparticular regarding the
increase in recurrent expenditure.        Furthermore, it i s expected that local elected
governments, community-based organizations and parents will contribute to the financing
of early childhood centers. Of course, resources from local governments will have to be
raisedthrough local taxes and/or through transfer from the central government.
12.     Most of the new recurrent expenditures will stem from the expansion of
secondary education and particularly the objective of achieving universal basic
education of eight years.        The Government has already adopted a cost-sharing
mechanism resulting in parents taking a larger share o f the cost o f their children's
education based on their taxable income. In addition, it i s likely that private secondary
schools will emerge in greater numbers catering to those who can afford them and thus
freeing resources to be allocatedto subsidize the most disadvantaged.
VI,     Educationprioritiesfor the PRSC
13.     The EducationMinistry has prepared a draft matrix for the education and
training sectors. The matrix prioritizes three main medium-term objectives for PRSC-2,
PRSC-3 and PRSC-4: (i)      improving the quality and efficiency o f basic education; (ii)
expanding and diversifying general and technical secondary education supply; and (iii)
expanding and diversifyingdelivery o fprofessional training.
14.     Improving the quality and efficiency of education. The main activities
supported consist o f editinglelaborating a new curriculum for primary education
supporting a pedagogic approach based on learning objectives or competency.
Simultaneously, the initial and in-service teacher training system will be reformed to
strengthen its capacity to train primary and secondary education teachers.            Teachers
currently in classrooms with no formal academic training and/or less than ten years o f
education will be given priority access to teacher training opportunities. A national
testing system will be set up in order to evaluate student academic outcomes inprimary
education.   This will allow to measure progress achieved in increasing students'
proficiency andoverall education quality. .
15.     Expanding and diversifying general and technical secondary education
supply. Through a school mapping exercise, it has been possible to select sites for the



                                            98

construction of medium-size secondary schools to correct for geographical imbalances.
At the same time, the MOE will initiate a revision of the curriculum content to select
priority leamindacademic areas for the development and modernization o f general and
technical secondary education streams. Finally, expansion o f school welfare activities
will continue inview to facilitate accessofthe poorest to secondary education.
16.     Expanding and diversifying professional training service delivery. The
priority consists of developing a national policy and a legal framework to organize and
consolidate the delivery of professional training services. Inparticular, the Government
will support the establishment of mechanisms for quality insurance and accountability
through the accreditation of professional training institutions and certification o f degrees.
This is expected to create a pool of well-trained graduates from professional training
institutes on which the private sector can rely for a qualified workforce.
VII.    PRSCindicators
17.     Nine indicators were chosen for the education sector inthis PRSC matrix, This i s
a limitedselection o f education indicators included inthe GPRSP. For the most part, the
indicators used inthe PRSC are outcome indicators.
VIII. InstitutionalArrangements
18.     The Education Ministry will have primary responsibility for implementing
these reformmeasures. However, partnershipwith the Ministry of Labor and Solidarity
will be sought in two main areas: (i)supporting access to education o f the poorest
through social welfare programs; and (ii)    developing professional training activities to
upgrade the skills o fthe workforce.

I. Background

1.         Health outcomes in Cape Verde have been steadily improvingover the past
two decades and are among the best in Africa. Infantmortality per 1000births i s 32.2
(SSA average i s lOS), child mortality per 1,000 i s 28.2 (PRSP), and life expectancy at
birth is 69 (SSA average is 46). There are no significant differences inmortality rates by
island (Table 1). However, the difference in infant mortality rates across islands is
significant."          While it i s likely that Cape Verde will achieve all o f the MDGs, the
difference ininfant mortality across islands and the overall increase inthe rates over time
i s o f concern.

                          Table 1:SelectedHealthOutcomesby Island(2003)

Potential Years of Life




2.         Several studies on the state of the health sector have emphasized the
importance of the epidemiologictransition. To assess indirectly the dimension of the
epidemiological transition and o f the prevalence o f non-communicable diseases, the
morbidity data o f Cape Verde hospitals were compared with the morbidity data o f
Portuguese public hospitals."              To estimate the financial impact o f a complete
epidemiological transition, one indicator o f intensity resource consumption was used
applying the Portuguese cost structure by disease (IGIF, Portugal). The analysis suggests
that the epidemiological transition in Cape Verde i s at an early stage. According to actual
levels o f admissions, hospital costs will increase by 23 percent after the epidemiological
transition because o f the higher prevalence o fnon-communicable diseases is higher.

3.         Although mortality data are not available by income quintile, the data on
reported health status suggests there is little variation by income group or age.
However, utilization o f health services does vary by island, suggestingthat there may be
some problem with access to health services. According to the Ministry of Health, the
issue i s not supply as much as quality. Among those who are ill(self-reporting), there i s
a statistical difference in the utilization between those in the lowest quintile (48%)

compared to those in the highest (60%). The proposed health facilities infrastructure
program i s intended primarily to upgrade and repair the existingfacilities.

4.      Total expenditures in the health sector are increasing. There are three main
sources o f revenue in the health sector: (a) the general budget and donor funding (added
together and considered "MOH" financing inthe discussion below; (b) the social security
system, INPS, which covers both health and pensions for non civil service employees,
and (c) private, out-of-pocket spending. In 2004, the M O H contributed 54 percent to
total health spending, the INPS 23 percent and private, out of pocket (23%). Between
2001 and 2004, total health expenditures grew by 37 percent, increasing from 4.5 percent
of GDP in2001 to 5.1 percent in2004 (see Table 2).

                                  Table 2: HealthExpenditures(2001-04)




      Sources:Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finances,INPS and ME: 2001/2002 Household Survey and Population Estimate:S.
      Assumptions: The annualincrementfor privateexpenditureswas considered 5%.

5.      The MOH receives revenue not only from budget transfers but also from
civil servants contributions (equal to 2 percent of salary) and a lump sum transfer
from INPS.          Free access to basic medical care i s provided to all indigents, self-
employed (including most o f the rural population) and civil servants.                              The average
expenditure per beneficiary of government financing is around 5000 CVE. There i s no
significant difference inM O Hper capita spending across islands.

6.      The INPS covers those employedoutside of the civil service. An 8 percent tax
on payroll is split between employer and employee, and managed along with the pension
funds by INF'S. There are currently almost 150,000 beneficiaries inthe system, including
some 5,000 pensioners.              INPS' beneficiaries use public facilities, for which INPS
contributes 100 CV million CVE. The amount o f this transfer from INPS to the MOH
has not changed inmore than ten years and it is clear that the M o H now highly subsidizes
health care services for INF'S beneficiaries. In 2004 pharmaceuticalsaccountedfor 51
percent of total INPS expenditures, followed by medical and hospital care (29
percent) and medicalevacuations(13 percent). Inthis period total health expenditures
increased by 15 percent, medical and hospital care by 21 percent, medical evacuations by
28 percent, and prosthetics and other devices by 39 percent. Pharmaceuticals showed the
lower increase inthe period (7 percent).




                                                        102

7.        Several significant discussions are underway on potential changes to the
current system of public health financing. These include: i)having INPS pay the
MOH for the real cost o f services it uses; ii)including the pensioners o f the non-
contributory regimen into INPS; and iii)including civil servants and their families into
the INPS. Various combinations o f these reforms were modeled. Almost every scenario
implies additional expenditures, both for the total public and INPS health expenditures.
For example, if the INPS were to pay the MOH the full costs o f service it uses, there
would be a 63 percent increase in total health expenditures, with average per capita
expenditures rising from 6,536 ECV to 10,629 ECV. Ifnon contributory pensioners join
the INPS, there would be a 10 percent increase in total health expenditures, assuming
everything else remains the same. The introduction o f civil servants would increase
expenditures by 23 percent, assuming everythingelse remains the same.

8.        Out-of-pocket expenditures are relatively low compared to other African
countries.         Based on a 2001-02 household survey, out-of-pocket spending i s
approximately 1787 CVE per capita and in 2004 private expenditures accounted for 23
percent o f total health expenditures. According to the household survey, spending on
health comprised only 1.8 percent o f total household spending, which i s relatively low
(Table 3). Pharmaceuticals accounted for almost all the health expenditures o f those in
thepoorest quintile(93 percent) andwere substantial inall o fthe other income groups.

11. Main issuesinthe healthsector

9.        Several studies have been completedby the Bank and others which diagnose
the main issues in the health sector (PER, DPR, PRSP, and PND). Briefly, these
include:

0    Inequities in health outcomes and access to health services:             Inequities in
     outcomes by island and income level exist.         Access to health services does not
     account for all o f the disparities in health outcome, though. Differences in access to
    water, sanitation, and child nutrition could be also important factors, as well as
     demand-side issues such as affordability.

0    Reliance on medical evacuations, both within and outside o f the country, are
     necessary because o f a lack o f specialist and diagnostic equipment in remote areas.
     Since there i s a ceiling inthe number o f medical evacuations that the Portuguese will
     cover (300 patients per year) and an increase in medical evacuations i s expected due
     to increasing non-communicable diseases, the need for international evacuations
     shouldbereduced through new policies on the supply side (see below).



                                             103

   Increase in non-communicablediseases. Decreases in infant and child mortality
   rates over the last decade have led to an aging population. Life expectancy i s 67.7 for
   men and 75.7 for women. Today non-communicable diseases significantly hinder
   economic growth. On average, men lose 13.6 years o f productive life and women
    11.3 years, due to illness.
   Challenges in human resources. The main challenges include: (i) insufficient
                                                                             an
   number of doctors, particularly o f specialists,; (ii) distribution o f staff, with
                                                            poor
   about 75 percent of doctors are practicing in the two central hospitals; (iii) o f
                                                                                    lack
   incentives to maximize efficiency, focus on the poor, prioritize certain services, or
   avoid over-referral; and (iv) a growing number o f public sector doctors working inan
   unregulated private sector, which could raise additional problems for access to health
   care particularly for the poor, and contribute to the increase o f health care
   expenditures.
   Lack of health information. Data on utilization and cost are essential for basic
   monitoring and evaluation as well as management, but there i s a surprising lack o f
   information on health services and outcomes.         This suggests that investments in
   health information systems at all levels may be required. The communication
   channels between health services and MOH should be better defined and modernized
   (e.g., use o f electronic communications). Improving the accounting system in order
   to calculate costs per disease and to create MinimumUniform Discharge Data would
    allow the introduction o f patient classification systems that measure case complexity
    and severity o f illness. This information can be used for reimbursement policies,
    internal management and quality improvement.
    Fiscal instability. The public sector health system is in a financial crisis, even
   though total govenunent health spending in Cape Verde i s generous.           The main
    causes o f the financial crisis are: (i)
                                           a growing deficit at the INPS; (ii)very highand
                                                                             a
   rapidly increasing rate o f expenditures on pharmaceuticals, which can potentially
    increase with the introduction o f new pharmaceuticals and with the emergent non-
    communicable diseases; (iii)    increases indemand as incomes improve, the population
    ages and non-communicable diseases augment; and (iv) poor financial management
    on the part o fboth the INPS andMOH.

111.    ReformStrategy

10.     The Government's reform strategy (Programa - Reformar o Sistema par
Promover a Saude 2002-2005) maps the country's health priorities into four
programs: (i)  Structural Issues such as health financing, information systems, legislation,
capital planning and infrastructure, and pharmaceutical policy; (ii)      Reproductive and
Child Health activities that address in great part the issue o f deteriorating health sector
through a combination o f strengthening existing programs, providing training, and
improving the referral system; (iii)  Prevention of Communicable and Non-communicable
Diseases that aims to strengthen the capacity o f the health service to detect potential
epidemics, improve surveillance at all levels o f the health system, and increase
participation o f the population in health promotion and disease prevention; and (iv)
Human Resources to improve the management o f human resources, the quality o f care,
distribution of human resources, and conditions o f employment for health professionals.


                                            104

Objectives, targets, strategies, and monitoring indicators have been identified for each o f
the four programs. Note that issues related to health financing, and particularly the INPS,
are not included as part of the strategy for the MOHbut are covered by other government
ministries.

11.     Currentstatus ofthe reformstrategyincludes:

    a   Structural Issues: Progress has been achieved in several o f the components o f
        this program. For example, aninfrastructure development plan, targeted towards
        improving access and quality of health services in rural areas, has been developed
        and implementation has begun. The national pharmaceutical policy has been
        revised with the objective of           improving the availability o f essential
        pharmaceuticals of good quality.        A study o f health expenditures has been
        completed and development o f a new health financing policy i s underway.
    a   Reproductive and Child Health: Several specific programs oriented towards
        pregnant women and children are underway, including Making Pregnancies Safer,
        Primary Health and Nutrition Care, and Improved Service Standards and Mother-
        and- Child HealthCare.
    a   Prevention of Communicable and Non-communicable Diseases: Examples o f
        progress include: (i)introduction o f a system o f epidemiological surveillance o f
        priority diseases (TB, malaria, polio, etc) including a new network o f laboratories;
        (ii)approvalofnationalstrategiesforHIV/AIDSandTB;(iii)              improvements in
        the diagnostic capabilities for HIV/AIDS; and (iv) increases in vaccination
        coverage rates following a national campaign.
    a   Human Resources: The priority has been to continue to improve access and
        quality by supporting training, particularly o f nurses and specialists. Training,
        both within the country and abroad, has begun in areas such as surgery,
        neurology, neonatology, public health, andhealth administration.

IV.     Prioritiesin the GPRSP

12.     Consistentwith the nationalhealth strategy and NDP, the GPRSP identifies
the followingactivitieswhich are assumedto have a significantimpacton poverty:
    Expandthe network of health facilities and equipmentto respondto the lack of
    capacity to diagnose health problems with priority to be given to the poorest
    districts. This will improve health outcomes by providing access to care, but health
    outcomes depend also on demand-side factors. For example, future efforts in
    prevention o f non-communicable diseases are likely to impact the demand for
    curative health services.

    Limit treatment overseas by improving availability of these services nationally.
    Redistribution o f staff and training o f additional health specialist will reduce reliance
    on medical evacuations and also improve efficiency. These improvements in access
    should lead to improvements inhealth status. Reduced cost should allow reallocation
    o fresources to other priority programs.




                                            105

   Develop methods to improve planning and management of human resources.
   The number and distribution o f health personnel i s expected to improve, leading to
   greater accessibility and better quality o f care. Redistribution o f staff and training o f
   additional health specialists will also improve efficiency and reduce reliance on
   medical evacuations.

   Strengthen the health information systemto better treat communicable and non-
   communicable diseases. A comprehensive, integrated health information system
   will help to improve the efficiency o f health service delivery.        Improvements in
   efficiency ensure the best use o f scarce resources and allow the Government to
   reallocate resources to other priority programs.        Accurate data are important to
   monitor the incidence and prevalence o f diseases which allows the Government to
   better target its resources and improve health status.

   Reinforce the priority health programs such as IMCI, EPI, HIV/AIDS, TB, and
   Reproductive Health, including the surveillance system, by financing personnel,
    equipment, and consumables. This activity focuses on those diseases which have
    the greatest impact on the poor. Early detection and rapid responses should lead to
    improve health outcomes, particularly for the poor.

    Define a strategy to combat non-communicable diseases. While not as prevalent
    among the poor today, successful control o f non-communicable diseases requires a
    longterm approach that will improve health outcomes o f the poor inthe future.

    Reinforce citizen participation in health promotion and disease prevention by
    strengthening cooperation across sectors and with civil society organizations.
    This should lead to improved health outcomes fiscal savings are fewer resources will
    be needed to be spent on curative services ifthese programs are effective.

V.     Financing of the GPRSP

13.    The total cost of health programs to be implemented under the GPRSP is
expected to be US$40.5 million between 2005 and 2007, o f which US$21 million is
earmarked for building o f new health facilities, refurbishing existing facilities, and
equipment (54%) and US$10 million for HIV/AIDS. For 2005, GPRSP expenditures are
expected to total US$18.5 in comparison to a M o H 2005 budget o f US$32 million.
Increases in capital investment are accompanied by increased allocations for recurrent
costs for the first year only, after which it is assumed they will be included in the regular
budget. The Government assumes the GPRSP will not entail any increases in staff costs
because many of these positions are already included in the budget, even if currently
vacant.

14.    The Government assumes that some cost savings can be achieved through an
improved level of care in services in health centers and primary referral health
structure, thus limiting the need to refer to more expensive hospitals. Other cost
savings reforms include: (a) strengthened preventive care, particularly for chronic
diseases; (b) improved management o f health structures, supported by a reinforced health


                                            106

information system and introduction o f lowest-cost, standardized care protocols for key
diseases; and (c) control of drug costs by opening the drug market to competition.
Funding for the remaining activities is unclear although the GOCV may be able to
approach donors for increased aid, particular for capital investments. Over the next year
the Government intendsto articulate a new healthcare financingpolicy.

VI,     Healthsectorwithin the PRSC

15.     The healthsector portionof the PRSC is drawn fromthe above Government
strategies detailedinits own healthstrategy paper and the priority activitieslaidout
in the GPRSP. The M O H has prepared a draft policy matrix for the health sector in
collaboration with its main partners.       Consequently, the medium term for PRSC-1,
PRSC-2, and PRSC-3 are the same as those that appear in the GPRSP. These include
improving health outcomes by: (i)      improving access and quality o f health services by
improving the availability and quality o f health infrastructure and reducing the need for
medical evacuations; (ii)improving the capacity to identify, prevent, and treat
communicable and non communicable diseases, especially those related to maternal and
child health, by improving the health information system, establishing key health
promotion programs to address the growing number of non-communicable diseases, and
implementing a set o f priority programs to focus particularly on the needs o f women and
children; (iii)
              strengthening the ability o f human resources to participate inthe provision
services, especially by improving the planning and management o f health sector
personnel and following the overall civil service reforms to be implemented by the
Government, and (iv) ensuring the financial sustainability o f the system and protection
for the poor by developing and implementinga new health finance policy.

VII.    Indicators

16.     The PRSC uses indicatorsfrom the GPRSP and PND in most instances. The
indicators are a combination of health outcomes and system outputs, including coverage
of services and availability o f key staff, used inthe PRSP. System reform indicators, like
the level o fdebt o f INPS, will help measure financial sustainability.

VIII. InstitutionalArrangements

17.     While the Ministry of Health will have primary responsibility for
implementing these reform measures, a significant level of inter-sectoral
cooperation is expected, especially for measures related to financial protection, where
close collaboration i s expected with the Ministry o f Labor and Solidarity.         Other
implementingagencies include the Ministry o f Education andINE.

                        Annex 8: Social ProtectionTechnicalNote


Background

1.      DespiteCape Verde's strong performancein economic growth and delivery of
basic social services, there are segments of society that remain vulnerable. Of Cape
Verde's population o f 471,000, 172,727 live below the poverty line o f about US$450 per
year as o f 2001-02. O f these, 93,000 are considered in extreme poverty living on less than
$300 per year. Over half of the extreme poor live on the main island o f Santiago, and two-
thirds live in rural areas. Half of the population inpoverty i s comprised o f children under
15 years old.

.
2.      Criticalsituationsof vulnerabilityinclude:

  Elderlv. invalids and disabled: There are 41,050 people over 60 years o f age, o f whom
  about 13,000 are poor (5,000 in extreme poverty) and 3,000 live alone. As Cape Verde
  experiences the demographic transition, the share of elderly i s expected to rise. In
  addition, the 2000 Census estimates 14,000 disabled. Most o f the disabled are supported
  by their relatives (53 percent), 22 percent depend mainly on their own employment and 9
. percent live on government benefits. Of disabled children, 37 percent are currently not in
  school.
  The unemployed: Unemployment is a main determinant o f poverty and loss o f ajob is a
  critical shock to household well-being. A recent survey by the National Statistics
  Institute found that while 10 percent o f the non-poor population over 15 was
  unemployed, this rose to 20 percent for the poor. Of the approximately 91,000 Cape
  Verdians o f active working age (15-64), 17 percent are unemployed, rising to 39 percent
  o f the population aged 15-34 years.          While remittances help cushion periods of
  unemployment, households without access to these transfers are at risk. Moreover, the
   search for employment has prompted urban migration, putting pressures on urban
   services and transferring poverty to urban zones.
   Food insecurity and malnutrition: Periodic drought, low availability and productivity of
   agricultural land, and long-term soil erosion have brought crippling famines to rural
   Cape Verde in the past. The structural vulnerability inthis area, with only 10 percent of
  basic cereal needs covered by national production, has been a key motive o f migration to
   urban areas and outside the country.        While the absolute risk o f famine is greatly
   decreased, pockets o f food insecurity remain in certain islands. Preliminary analyses of
.  available data identify 9,508 families as at highrisk for food insecurity. Forty high risk
  rural zones were identified to help orient public and NGO investments.
   School drop-outs and illiterate: O f the 32,000 heads o f households that are illiterate, 23
  percent are inextreme poverty and 42 percent under the poverty line, well above national
.  averages. Currently, about 13 percent o f poor children o f primary age are not attending
   school, due to difficult family situations, child labor, or other problems.
  Unstable family structures: Migration, as well as having children out o f wedlock among
  the urban poor, exacerbates the phenomenon of single-parent households (41 percent of




                                            108

  households are headed by women).           There are an estimated 62,000 children living in
  families headed by someone other than their parents.
  Violence, social ills and marginalization: New social problems are arising as
  urbanization, globalization and other societal changes take place. Street children, juvenile
  delinquency, alcohol and drug abuse, and sexual abuse have grave repercussion on the
  individual, families and communities. Violent crime has risen in Praia, and there is a
. growing problem o f Cape Verdians migrants deported from Europe and the U S returning
  home with problems o f integration and criminality.
  Access to basic services by the poorest households: Despite enormous progress in the
  last twenty years, there is still a significant portion o f the population in vulnerable
  situations due to lack o f effective access to basic services, living in precarious,
  unhygienic situations with no access to running water and sanitation, and unable to
  afford medical treatment.

3. Key elements of the existing social protection system are:

0   Active labor market interventions. Cape Verde has a long tradition o f active labor
    market interventions.       Foremost among these has been the creation o f temporary
    employment during off-agricultural cycles through labor-intensive public works
    schemes (Frente a Alta Intensidad de Mano de Obra - FAIMO) financed largely
    through monetized food aid. Duringthe m i d - 9 0 ~FAIMO-type temporary employment,
                                                              ~
    mainly on roads and soil conservation projects, covered an estimated 10-15 percent o f
    the active labor force. Wages were low, equivalent to half the threshold o f extreme
    poverty, and no real skills were accumulated.              While originally this employment
    provided a minimum safety net for the rural poor to survive periodic droughts and
    precarious agricultural cycles, over time the FAIMO program was equated with people
    showing up to check their names o f f the lists, with little to show inthe way o f effective
    investments and low labor productivity.

0   Social security svstems. There are two main social security systems for formal sector
    workers.'' The AdministraqiTo Publica (AP)scheme covers approximately 13,000 civil
    servants, while the Instituto Nacional de Previdencia Social (INPS) estimated around
    31,000 contributors from private sector firms in 2001. They provide varying degrees o f
    old age pensions, disability, and health insurance. Together the schemes cover one
    quarter o f the labor force and currently pay pensions to about 6,000 people. The long-
    run solvency of both systems is in question due to generous benefits and outstanding
    government arrears in meeting its financial obligations to both systems. In addition,
    two non-contributory schemes provide income support to the poor. The Minimum
    Social Pension (PSM) covers 6,500 elderly, handicapped, or others who are identified
    by local governments as in need o f critical support.                 Evidence from the recent
    household survey shows that the targeting o f the PSM needs improvement as it is only
    mildly pro-poor. A Social Solidarity Pension (PSS) is also available to some 10,000
    elderly workers who participated inthe FAIMO program for more than ten years. The
    annual cost o fthe non-contributory programs i s about US$4.8 million.


  Overall, about 21percent of Cape Verdean households report receiving a pension- 15 percent through
national programs (INPS, AP andnon-contributory pensions) and 6 percent from abroad.


                                              109

0 Social Assistance. Targeted social assistance programs include a variety o f services
  for specific vulnerable groups, such as nutrition for at-risk children and elderly, training
  for disabled, and subsidized water and sewerage connections for poor urban
  households. A 2005 Social Services Map identified 609 social service centers,
  including day care centers and pre-schools, multi-use community centers, shelters,
  youth centers, centers for disabled, elderly, drug addicts, malnourished children, and
  residences for students. The survey found that overall the utilization rate o f this social
  infrastructure i s about 85 percent. But, this conceals wide differences, for example
  over-crowding in child nutrition centers (with utilization at about 375 percent) versus
  under-utilization o f some centers for disabled (at 54 percent). The main actors are:
  -   The Direction o f Solidarity of the MTS provides overall coordination and quality
      control, as well as a range o f assistance programs (e.g., support to at-risk elderly,
      children and youth, evacuation o f indigent sick), in part through service contracts
      with NGOs.
  -   The autonomous Instituto Caboverdiano d 'Accion Social Escolar (ICASE)
      facilitates schooling for low-income students through a variety o f programs. As
      school fees have been introduced through the education reform program, subsidies

  -   for the neediest children are channeled through ICASE.
      The Instituto Caboverdiano de Solidaridad (ICs) and the Instituto Caboverdiano de
      Menores (ICM) target children at risk through social services, shelters, medical and
      psychological support, training, emergency centers for abused and mistreated

  -   children and adolescents with drug problems.
      The Programa Nacional de Luta Contra a Pobreza (PNLP), a community-driven
      development (CDD) program under the MTS, constructs and equips a variety o f
      social infrastructure through municipal governments and local associations,
      including an innovative model o f multi-use community centers that house a
      combination o f nursery school, training programs, community library, an outreach
      agent o f the municipal administration, and other locally identified needs which

  -   builds synergies between social services andreduces unitcosts at the local level.
      Municipal governments carry out activities with MTS as well as own-financing,
      with growing activities in day care, feeding and other social services, consistent
      with the current decentralization framework. The Decentralization Law formally
      transferred responsibility for what i s termed 'social promotion'              to local
      governments.     This included placing M T S social workers within the municipal
      administration. However, more explicit agreements on norms and standards as well
      as municipal interface with national programs like the PSM are needed to improve

  -   quality and monitoring o f social services.
      NGOs and local associations, carry out a broad range o f activities, including
      significant programs through the Red Cross and Caritas.

  Cape Verde i s an example o f good collaboration between central, municipal and non-
  governmental organizations for the co-production o f social assistance services,
  including the development o f formal contracting relationships. For example, municipal
  governments routinely contract with local associations for the day to day management
  and operation o f nursery schools, training programs and other services. The central
  level has experimentedwith both contracting o f NGO service providers, as well as use


                                         110

   o f direct financing of community groups and farmer's cooperatives for development
   efforts.    The MTS has piloted a successful collaboration between an NGO, a
   neighborhood association, the municipal Government o f Praia and the private water
   company, Electra, to carry out social connections of water and sewerage in poor
   neighborhoods.

Main Issues in Social Protection

4. Several studies and evaluations have identified the key issues in the social
protection agenda in Cape Verde over the next several years:

    0  Build on the gains made in the reconversion of the FAIMO system in favor o f
       strategies to exit out o f rural poverty. The need for massive temporary low-skilled
       labor jobs in response to rural drought has decreased as Cape Verde has urbanized,
       diversified into tourism, invested in drip irrigation and other agricultural
       diversification and drought mitigation measures and overall increased income
       levels. This has caused a fbndamental reconsideration o f the FAIMO strategy in
       favor o f infrastructure with higher impact on poverty over the longer term through
       (i) introductionofcontractswithmunicipalgovernment fordeliveryofspecific
           the
       infrastructure investments rather than open-ended transfers to finance FAIMO-type
       expenditures, (ii)the creation of AGECABO, a delegated contract management
       agency working with municipalities to introduce efficient contracting and execution
       of civil works; and (iii)      support to farmer's cooperatives and rural associations for
       the execution o f small-scale infrastructure, including micro-irrigation, and income
       generating projects that boost rural productivity.
    0  In the area of social security, rework the basic parameters and reform the two
        formal social security schemes to promote long-run financial solvency and
        increase coverage and improve targeting and efficiency o f the programs.               A
        framework law passed in January 2001 set out the broad parameters o f the
        contributory pension system in Cape Verde, including setting the foundation for
        shifting all civil servants under the AP system into the W S scheme.20 Onthe non-
        contributory side, the Government i s in the process o f revising the social pension
        system. The benefits under the two programs were brought into conformity, a study
       was conducted to provide the basis for recommendations, a thorough beneficiary
        survey has enabled the MTS to clean up and combine existing databases, and new
       identity cards linked to an administrative tracking system will make it possible to
       target and monitor outlays. The study confirmed the need to improve targeting
        (16.5 percent of non-poor households reported receiving social pensions). Almost
       half o f the elderly poor reported receiving either the PSM or PSS, though the
       pensions accounted for only 18 percent of their total income.
    0   Strengthening of the capacity of local actors (community organizations and
        municipal governments) to address the needs of vulnerable populations,
        Government strategy i s that the State should not provide services directly, but rather
        contract out to NGOs and local associations to develop activities in support o f

and improvethe financial sustainabilityof INF'S throughthe Growth and CompetitivenessProject.


                                                 111

       social policy. The Government will mobilize resources (external and internal) and
       monitors performance.        Protocols for service delivery, including norms and
       standards, are being designed and piloted under MTS's Direction o f Solidarity.
   0   Develop effective responses for a growing number of social ills, as Cape Verde
       transitions to a predominantly urban, middle-income country. This will require the
       development of approaches and institutional mechanisms that can respond to new
       problems, like drugs and violence, where Cape Verde can draw lessons learned
       from other middle income countries.
   0   Move the food security agenda,from reactive to preventionand mitigationof food
       crises, based on the development o f a decentralized food security information
       system and a better coordinated effort o f the various agencies involved. The recent
       creation o f a National food Security Council has been hailed as a major step inthis
       direction.
   0   Expansion of access to health and educationservices by the poor. Despite the
       broad success in providing health and education services, access remains a
       challenge for the poorest households. Moreover, as Cape Verde moves from a
       tradition o f universal free access to payment for services, cost recovery policies will
       need to be complemented with targeted subsidies, fee waivers o f other forms o f
       support to ensure the poor can access these basic services. For example, World
       Food Program, which has been providing school lunches for all Cape Verdian
       school children recently announced it will be withdrawing from Cape Verde in the
       coming years. ICASE has initiated targeted subsidies for school fees for needy
       secondary education students whereby students are selected by committees at the
       school level and ICASE transfers the fee amount.           In health, expenditures on
       medicines represent up to 90 percent o f health expenditures for the poor. Recent
       work on community-based health insurance schemes suggests that this i s a most
       promising approach worth pursuing.

Priorityin GPRSPandFinancing

6.     The fifth pillar of the GPRSP entails "Strengthening the Equity and
Sustainabilityof the Social ProtectionSystem". This draws from the broad orientations
provided in the Grand Options document and the specific investment program identified in
the National Development Plan. The GPRSP presents five medium-term objectives inline
with the reform strategies underway in the country, namely: (a) developing institutional
capacity in social protection, (b) strengthening and extending programs that reach
disadvantaged groups (including social pensions, social assistance and health insurance
programs); (c) promoting local initiatives and community development; (d) promoting the
rights of children, and (e) improving mechanisms to prevent and manage food crises and
strengthen food security.




                                            112

7.      The GPRSP objectives are achievable, though better targeting of resources on
the neediest will be necessary to expand coverage within fiscal constraints. While there
i s no consolidated data on all social protection expenditures undertaken, the 2004 budget
shows 7 percent o f the operating budget and 2 percent o f the investment budget devoted to
social security and social assistance, though this does not include education subsidies and
programs implemented by municipalities. The expansion proposed for Social Pension
beneficiaries i s modest, adding about $550,000 to annual costs by the end o f the GPRSP
period. Financing priority GPRSP activities will be included within the on-going and
proposed program to improve budget allocations through the development o f the MTEF
and program-based budgetsincore ministries, including MTS.

8.      The GPRSP builds on an on-going process of reforms and improvements in
Cape Verde's social protection system.           During the preparation and initial GPRSP
implementation, several milestones were achieved. The Government has built an adequate
analytical and strategy base, including:

        In terms o f social assistance, pilot programs have been initiated in NGO service
        contracts for support to vulnerable women (micro-credit, social housing, and
        training) and subsidies to the poorest households to connect to public water and
        sanitation systems through anNGO-managed revolving fund system.

Social Protection Strategy and Reform Program

9.      To underpin its GPRSP, the Government has prepared a National Social
Protection Strategy. The strategy seeks to move from the more reactive, coping strategies
drawing from the welfare state legacy to increased attention to risk mitigation and
prevention measures, and to decentralize and contract out delivery o f services in line with
the broader reforms o f the state underway in Cape Verde. The Strategy has five specific
objectives: (i) to increase the level o f education and skills o f the poor; (ii) improve the
                                                                               to
employability o f the poor; (iii) to increase access if the poor and vulnerable to basic social
 services; (iv) to assure a minimum support to persons living in extreme situations of




                                            113

poverty and vulnerability; and (v) to improve the institutional capacity to intervene in the
area o f social protection.

10.      To achieve these objectives, the Strategy sets forth five principal axes:

(a) Expand coverage of the formal system of social protection to the poor and
    vulnerable, including implementation o f pension and health insurance reforms
    through the INPS and AP schemes for private sector salaries workers and civil
    servants.
(b) Develop and reinforce a social protection system for the informal sector, most
    notably through the development o f mutual health insurance schemes,
(c) Strengthening and extension of basic social protection to the poor and extreme
    poor, including reform o f the non-contributory pension systems (PSS and PSM) to
    improve coverage, increase administrative and targeting efficiency as well as extend
    critical social services to specific vulnerable groups like children at risk.
(d) Institutional integration - pubWprivate, vertical and horizontal - of social
    protection programs and strengthening of the institutional and legal
    framework, including continued decentralization and contracting out o f services;
    and implementation o f improved mechanisms o f coordination, cooperation, and
    monitoring and evaluation across the many institutions involved inthe field.
(e) Consolidation and strengthening of social policies to ensure access by poorest
    groups to basic social services, including identification of uncovered zones using
    the Social Services Map, expansion o f existing programs involving targeted
    interventions to improve the education, skills and health o f at risk populations, and
     expanded contracting with NGOs and local governments to increase access o f poor
    households to water and sewerage connections and social housing.

Social ProtectionActivities within the PRSC

11.      Coverage of social protection issues within the PRSC is fully consistent with
the areas of emphasis within the GPRSP. Under the coordination o f the MTS, the
Government has prepared a policy matrix inconsultationwith other ministries, autonomous
agencies and NGOs. The PRSC would engage the Bank in technical and policy dialogue
along the broad strategic lines o f       (a) Protection, Integration and Social Insertion to
redefine the regulatory framework for decentralized service delivery, improve planningand
management instruments, improve management and coverage o f non-contributory
pensions, increase access o f at-risk groups to education and professional training, increase
access o f at-risk groups to health services, increase access o f at-risk groups to nutritional
support, and promotion and support for local community development initiatives; (b)
Protection o f Children's Rights to strengthen institutional mechanisms and reinforce
technical capacity o f NGOs involved in youth issue; and (c) Food Security, to improve
prevention and management o f food crises and strengthen the institutional framework o f
food security issues.

12.      A series of monitoring indicators drawn in part from the NDP have been
developed in the GPRSP. These indicators track coverage, targeting and impact o f social
protection measures. A core set o f these indicators are taken up in the PRSC. Critical


                                             114

process indicators have been identified with the Government including a set o fprior actions
and triggers that serve as benchmarks for the PRSC progress. These targets are ambitious
but are anchored inexistingprograms and Government institutions with good track records
for implementation.      It is expected that the Annual progress report on GPRSP
implementationwill be used as an opportunity to further refine indicators.

InstitutionalArrangements

13.     The National Social Protection Commission under the MTS will coordinate,
monitor and evaluate the implementationof Cape Verde's social protectionstrategy.
Core members o f the commission are represented in the GPRSP Steering Committee to
ensure consistency with broader poverty reduction strategies and monitoring systems.
Technical staff and managers of the core agencies involved in social protection have had
intense involvement in the preparation o f the PRSC and its policy matrix. Workshops and
discussions are held on a non-going basis with representatives form the Ministry o f Labor
and Solidarity, the ICM, the Department o f Food Security o f the Ministry o f Agriculture,
INEandthe mainNGOs involvedinsocial protection issues.

      Annex 9: DonorHarmonization,Approachfor BudgetSupport Operations


I. CapeVerdecontext

Cape Verde has a successful track record as a good performing country with
relatively strong institutions. The country is still heavily dependent on donor support
(US$ 92 million in 2002; second highest aid per capita ratio worldwide), yet the form o f
donor support as well as aid management and donor coordination mechanisms have been
quite traditional so far.

Cape Verde currently is supported by in total 137 external partners providing
financial and/or technical support, almost exclusively at the project level. The
General Directorate for International Development Cooperation (Ministry for Foreign
Affairs) has mapped out and prioritized these external partners, classifying 19 o f them as
first priority partners. Among these first priority partners are IDA (who has become over
the last decade the largest donor partner), AfDB, the European Commission, Portugal
(the traditional and still largest bilateral partner), Luxembourg (second largest bilateral
partner), and the United States.

The GPRSP marks a notable shift towards budget support. The World Bank, the
European Commission, The Netherlands, and the African Development Bank are moving
towards coordinated budget support, and the combined amount o f this budget support
represents a significant share of overall the overall assistance. And the US, via its new
MillenniumChallengeAccount (MCA), is becoming a major donor.

The GPRSP provides an opportunity for better donor alignment. The GPRSP as a
strong, coherent and integrative medium-term country strategy implementation
framework could become the single anchor for aligned donor support. The GPRSP i s
derived from the existing development strategies and is designed as an overarching
medium-term strategy implementation framework, aimed to become the anchor for all
donor support as i s the case in many other countries. Donors are seeking to strengthen
coordination among each other and align their support with the GPRSP in terms o f (i)
priorities; (ii) indicators; and (iii)
                M&E                       Government budget and planningcycles.

Cape Verde's main mechanismfor overall donor coordinationis the Round Table
mechanism.The last Round Table took place inApril 2003, based on the PND 2002-05.
The planning and organization o f the Round Table was supported by UNDP and The
World Bank. The joint support o f UNDP and the Bank was an innovation compared to
previous Round Tables. The Round Table provided a startingpoint for discussions about
new modalities o f donor coordination and alignment, including the possibility o f
designating a donor "chef de file" for thematic or sectoral areas. It was agreed that, as a
follow up, specific thematic Round Tables would be established. This decision has not
beenimplemented yet.

In addition to the overall donor coordination mechanism, each donor has
establishedits own bilateralcoordinationmechanismwith the Government, mostly


                                            116

comprised of annual consultations. The possibility o f Government-led donor
coordination i s made more difficult by the fact that several donors do not have a
representative in the country -some donors have representation in Dakar (World Bank,
African Development Bank, Netherlands) while others work from their respective
headquarters (Switzerland, Sweden, USA via MCA).

Cape Verde's governance structure for donor coordination is split between the
Ministry of Finance (coordination of mainly multilateral institutions, including
IDA) and the Ministry for ForeignAffairs (coordinationof bilateralpartners).This
division in terms o f responsibilities has become a significant problem, and the Cape
Verdean authorities are aware o f this.

11.    PRSC andDonorAlignment

The preparation process of the PRSC has moved the harmonization agenda
forward. Basedon consultations throughout the preparationprocess, includingjoint pre-
appraisal and appraisal missions with the Dutch Cooperation, a Memorandum o f
Understanding Cooperation entitled "Partnership Framework between Budget Support
Partners and the Government o f Cape Verde for the provision o f Budget Support" was
signed between the Government, IDA, the EU and the Netherlands Embassy April 13,
2005. The Partnership Framework commits the parties to joint reviews, harmonization of
indicators and prior actions, and synchronization with Government budget cycles with a
view to reducing the transaction costs o f assistance to the Government (see below).

111.    PartnershipFrameworkbetweenBudgetSupport Partnersandthe
Governmentof CapeVerde for the provisionof BudgetSupport

a.      Main Principles

The Government of Cape Verde (GoCV) is strongly committed to take its Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) as one o f the guiding documents for the future socio-
economic development o f Cape Verde. The GoCV considers the use o f budget support as
the preferred financing mechanism to implement the PRSP and its overall cooperation
programme. Hence, the overall goal o f budget support i s to contribute to efficient and
effective poverty reduction and a successful PRSP implementation in Cape Verde and
reinforce the guidingprinciples o f alignment, accountability, ownership and coordination,

This Partnership Framework presents a set o f operational principles for the provision o f
budget support to Cape Verde. The objective o f these principles is to harmonise Budget
Support Partner behaviour, strengthen government systems and procedures, reduce
transaction costs for both GoCV and its development partners, harmonise aid modalities,
performance benchmarks and dialogue between the parties, increase the predictability o f
provision o f budget support and to link funding commitments by the partners to
achievement o f targets set. This will benefit overall economic developments and the
implementation and efficiency o fprogrammes inpriority sectors.




                                           117

b.      Participants

The participants to this Partnership Framework (PF) are the Government o f Cape Verde,
represented by the Ministry o f Finance and PlanningPlanning General Directorate and
National Authorising Office, the Ministry o f Foreign AffairdInternational Cooperation
General Directorate, and the members o f the Budget Support Group (BSG):

a   The World Bank.
a   The European Commission, represented by the European Commission's Delegation
    to Cape Verde (EC).
a   The Netherlands, represented by the Royal Netherlands Embassy inDakar, Senegal.

The BSG i s open to other development agencies and financial institutions (`partners')
who provide or plan to provide some form o f budget support (i.e. general, sectoral o f
specific) to Cape Verde. BSG members will urge other potential budget support partners
to join this framework, and will seek to provide direct general budget support as a
growing share o f their overall support to Cape Verde, although BSG members may
continue a portion o f their support to Cape Verde via investment projects, direct technical
assistance or other forms.

BSGMembers may use different methodologies and apply different criteria to decide on
their level andtype (general, sectoral or specific) o fbudget support; details o f each BSG
member's use o f methodologies/criteria are described in the attached technical note.
However, the goal o f this M o U i s to institutionalize ongoing efforts to harmonize budget
support for PRSP implementation. To that effect, members o f the BSG group will
endeavor to:

    -   Harmonize     their   methodology       for   assessment  o f progress    in PRSP

    --  implementation.
        Harmonize their key criteria for disbursement.
        Harmonize their timingfor disbursement, as well as their mission schedules.

Incase of discrepancy between this Partnership Framework and the individual bilateral
agreements between a Partner and the Government, the bilateral agreements will prevail.
However, it i s the intention o f the Parties to establish funding agreements that are
compatible with the provisions o f this Partnership Framework.

a.      Review Process

Regular dialogue between GoCV and BSG members, o f satisfactory quality and
transparency, to review the progress in the implementation o f the PRSP and to discuss
conditions for disbursement o f Budget Support, i s critical for the sustained provision o f
budget support. This dialogue will take place within the formal coordination mechanisms
established by GoCV.

Inview o f the large donor's interest in PRSP implementation, the GoCV invites other
partnersto participate into the annual evaluation o fPRSP implementation.


                                            118

The dialogue will be organised as follows:

To beprepared by the GoCV:
0  Annual financial and progress reports on the PRSP (May-June) including on
   individual government sectors that receive sectoral Budget Support from BSG
   Members.
0  Annual State General Accounts reviewedby the Tribunalde Contas.
0  Annual financial statements documenting the flow o f budget support funds into the
   Treasury and to the individual Sectors (where applicable).
0  Transmission to BSGpartnerso f copies o f quarterly reports on budget execution.

On the basis of these reports thefollowing Independent Review Instruments may be
applicable:
0  Annual Evaluation o f the PRSP progress (May-June), to be conducted jointly by BSG
   members. Meant to replace bilateral reviews.
0  Public Expenditure Review (PER).
0  Independent Sector Reviews for sectors that receive sectoral Budget Support from
   BSGmembers (May-June).
0  Annual conformity test to check the internal GoCV procedures.

On the basis of this information thefollowing Joint Review Mechanism will be
applicable:
0  Based on the information resulting from all the above, the BSG members will record
   their assessment o f the situation intheir respective Aide Memoires.
0  For policy areas o f common interest, such as macro-fiscal policy and financial
   management, BSG members will put together in a single document their joint
   assessment o f progress made on reforms in the context o f joint missions to evaluate
   their budget support programs. They will discuss it jointly in draft form with the
   authorities before leaving. BSG members will communicate to the Government a
   formal assessment within a month o f the last mission leaving the country.
0  The BSG members will then prepare and send out to the GoCV a joint letter
   highlightingmain issues and points o f understanding, at least four weeks before the
   Annual Review Meeting.
0  Annual Review Meeting (September). Duringthis meeting, BSG memberswill aim to
   provide the Government with confident predictions o f funding for the coming
   financial year, making clear what factors would affect the volume o f funding. The
   principles o f tranche calculations and the timing o f releases for each BSG member
   will be defined in a Technical Note. BSG members will try to coordinate their
   schedules.

b.     Audit

GoCV will provide to BSGmembers their annual audited State Accounts for both central
and local governments within the applicable statutory time limit The annual audits will
be made by the Tribunal de Contas in accordance with Cape Verdean legislation. BSG
members will not normally seek additional accountability outside o f these requirements,



                                          119

but may reserve the right to undertake independent general or sectoral auditing where
required.

Additional Partnership Framework coordination mechanisms may include the
following:
0   Progress meetings for e.g. the state o f affairs o f public finance/procurement review
    (CFMCPAR), PRSP andPRSC implementation.
0   Achievement o ftargets definedthrough key sector review processes.
0   Preparation of JSANreports.

Participants in this Partnership Framework will be active partners in the above
coordination mechanisms.

The participants to this Partnership Framework recognise that it is the delivery o f results
and the achievement o f a limited number o f outcome indicators that are ultimately most
important, and reports will be drafted and discussed to reflect this.

c.      Internalproceduresamongstthe BSGmembers

Before each Annual Review Meeting, BSG members will agree on one o f them serving
as a back-up secretariat to the Government secretariat that will prepare the review (e.g. be
incharge ofco-ordinating meetings, etc.) before andduringthe review, and coordinateon
preparation o f various donor reports and instruments.

When one o f the BSG members is in the process o f establishing a new budget support
agreement with Cape Verde, that member will share draft agreements with the other BSG
members. BSG members will aim to develop new agreements collectively, and will seek
to align their timetables as far as possible.

d.      Responsibilitiesof the Governmentof CapeVerde

Responsibilities for implementation o f this Partnership Framework on behalf o f the
Government o f Cape Verde are shared between the Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry
o f Foreign Affairs, and specifically their respective focal points in the Directorate
General o f Planningand the Directorate General o f International Cooperation.

The donor support towards the Partnership Framework is based upon the understanding
that the Government o f Cape Verde will:
0   Implement the key actions and benchmarks identified within the budget support
    matrixes o f the individual BSG members.
0   Implement the overall economic program aimed at stabilization and increased
    economic growth as has been described in the context o f the IMF program
    macroeconomic framework.
0   Ensure that total expenditures and sector allocations effectively reflect the poverty
    reduction commitment and that extra budgetary expenditure is brought into the
    budget so that budget comprehensiveness is ensured.



                                            120

0  Monitor and report on the effective implementation o f the budget and on progress in
   achieving PRSP targets.
0   Seek to ensure that its budget is comprehensive and that prioritization reflects the
   PRSP.
0  Coordinate and harmonize procedures for external assistance (both financial support
   andTA).
0  Prepare and share with BSG partners action plans and budgets for capacity building
   in core areas (CFAA, CPAR, expenditure management, PRSP monitoring and
    evaluation) inorder to harmonize resource mobilization for these activities.
0  Prepare the ARM and all other events to mobilize external aid and monitor its use.

1, Responsibilitiesof the BSGmembers

The BSG members are committed to work in Partnership with the Government o f Cape
Verde and wish to facilitate implementation o f the PRSP through financing governed by
this PF and/or complementary support provided through their wider development
cooperation programs. Within existing administrative and statutory provisions including
individual bilateral funding agreements with Cape Verde, which ultimately govern
decisions on disbursements and commitments, the BSGmembers commit themselves to:
0   Provide information on future disbursementsinadvance o f the budget year, andbased
    on a financial framework reflecting identical reform commitments o f the Government
    vis-&vis all partners.
0   Disburse all o f the commitments made within the Cape Verdean budget year and
    attempt to front load their disbursements within the first quarter.
0   Change funding only for the next budget year by reference to the implementation o f
    measures inPRSP and IMF assessments o fmacroeconomic performance.
0   In-year cuts will be avoided except inthe most serious o f circumstances.
0   Co-ordinate their disbursements in line with the Government's budgetary
    requirements as presented by the GoCV.
0   Harmonize their prior actions for areas ofjoint concern.

The partners will endeavor to follow the principles enshrined in the PF and assess
performance on the basis o f the PRSP progress report. Reference to these key processes
should be included in individual bilateral funding agreements to the maximum extent.
These agreements will mainly provide further details on the obligations o f both parties
and the procedures for disbursing funds together with any standard conditions for
development cooperation that the individual donor may have. The parties agree to keep
such general conditions to a minimum.

BSG members will seek to reach a common assessment o f compliance with conditions,
and will consult each other and GoCV in the event o f a dispute. Judgements on
disbursementwill be the responsibility o f each individual BSGmember.It is recognized
that not all BSG members will choose to emphasize all aspects o f the Partnership
Framework intheir bilateral agreements with GoCV.

                       Annex 10: GPRSP and PRSC M&E System


Monitoring and Evaluation of the GPRSP

1.      Monitoring and Evaluation of the GPRSP will be results-oriented. To this end,
the M&E system has three main objectives: (a) monitoring and analysis o f economic
growth and poverty reduction trends; (c) monitoring of the execution o f priority programs
and projects that contribute to growth and poverty reduction; and (c) impact evaluation o f
the keypolicies and programs on growth and improved living conditions.

2.      Monitoring and evaluation of the GPRSP builds off of the national systems for
investment planning, budget control, as well as development of national and sectoral
statistics (see Figure below). The main actors and responsibilities are:

    National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional da Estadistica - IN@. INE is
    legally mandated as the responsible agency for the National Statistical System. INE
    has prepared a plan to develop this system called the Statistical Agenda (Agenda
    Estadistica). Within GPRSP monitoring, INE is responsible for (a) collection and
    treatment o f general economic and social data, including household and enterprise
    surveys, the Social Services Map, and other data collection instruments; (b) the
    production o f current statistics, including poverty profile data, national accounts,
    social indicators; and (c) the validation o f official data published by the public sector
    and its storage and disseminationthrough the Database of Official Statistics (Base de
    Dados Estadisticas OJiciais-BDEO).
    General Directorate of Planning (DGP) and its Technical Secretariat to Support
    Development (Secretariado Tkcnico de Avoio ao Desenvolvimento STAD1. The  -                -
    DGP/STAD i s responsible for : (a) the development and maintenance o f the national
    Database on Policies and Projects (Base de Dados de Medidas e Projectos - BDMP);
    (b) the selection and specification of macroeconomic and sectoral indicators and
    targets for these indicators; (c) carry out and facilitate analysis o fmacroeconomic and
    sectoral results and impact indicators o f the GPRSP from data provided by INE; (c)
    utilization o f a macroeconomic model to link macro provisions with available
    government resources; (d) oversee preparation o f the Annual PRSP Progress Report.
    General Directorates of Planning, Budpet and Management within the sectoral
    ministries. These sectoral units are responsible for: (a) participate inthe selection of
    indicators and targets for the GPRSP; (b) production o f sectoral statistics and
    calculation of secotral indices; (c) analysis of GPRSP impacts in their respective
    sectors; (d) provide inputs into the Annual PRSP Progress Report and other
    monitoring instruments.
    The General Directorate of Budpet and its Management Information System for
    Budget and Finance.        The Budget Office provides updated information on all
    Government revenue and expenditures. The M I S will include all financial and public
    expenditure management indicators to be tracked inthe GPRSP. This office oversees
    the development o f the medium-term expenditure framework and the program
    budgetingto be carrie3d out inthe sectoral ministries.


                                            123

a   NOSI, or the Nhcleo Operacional da Sociedade da InformacZo (Operational
    Nucleus for Information Systems), is responsible for the information technology
    backbone o f the monitoring and evaluation system. This network allows for the
    processing, storage and communication o f all public sector information, based on the
    application o f Oracle technology.    This network currently includes the MIS for
    Budget and Finance (above), including a basic data sheet on every project financed by
    the Treasury. The system is currentlybeingexpanded at the municipal level.

3.      Monitoring and evaluation of GPRSP implementation will be carried out
through an integrated institutionalframework. Overall coordination is overseen by a
GPRSP Coordinating Commission comprised o f representatives from the core and sectoral
ministries, the association o f municipal governments, the central bank, the National
Statistics Institute, the chamber o f commerce, private sector, specialized institutes, unions
and NGOs. Consultative commissions at the decentralized level will be headed by the
respective mayors. The DGP/STAD has day-to-day responsibilities to provide technical
guidance, monitor program performance including reporting on the core set o f monitoring
indicators, and inform internal and external partnerso fprogress.

MonitoringandEvaluationof the PRSC

4.       The PRSC will be accompaniedby a resultsbased M&E system in line with
the GPRSP M&E system. The specific monitoring and evaluation activities under the
proposed PRSC will be based on, and reinforce, the system proposed for the monitoring
and evaluation o f the GPRSP in general. They will include: (a) annual GPRSP progress
reports; (b) periodic reporting on achievement o f MDGs (supported by UNDP); (c) overall
annual budget monitoring through public expenditure reviews; (e) annual sectoral budget
execution and service delivery targets prepared by line ministries; (f) periodic follow-up
household surveys to track poverty and access to services carried out by the National
Statistics Institute (INE), (g) stakeholder surveys and qualitative monitoring o f
government performance and poverty impacts contracted through the STAD; (h) analysis
of fiduciary performance; and (i)  sectoral studies. See Results Chain for M&E inAnnex 5;
and M&E action planon following pages.

 Public Information Notices (PINs) form part o f the IMF's efforts to promote transparency o f the IMF's
 views and analysis o f economic developments and policies. With the consent o f the country (or
 countries) concerned, PINSare issued after Executive Board discussions o f Article IV consultations
 with member countries, o f its surveillance o f developments at the regional level, o f post-program
 monitoring, and o f ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
 PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions o f general policy matters, unless otherwise
 decided by the Executive Board ina particular case.

On M a y 25, 2005, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cape Verde together with the sixth review of
Cape Verde's arrangement with the IMF under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) (see Press Release No. 05/124).'

Background

Macroeconomic policies in Cape Verde have strengthened significantly over recent
years, enabling the country to correct the severe macroeconomic imbalances that
emerged in 2000 inthe run-up to parliamentary and presidential elections. Inparticular,
the fiscal position i s now markedly stronger than in 2000; external and domestic public
debt have declined as a share o f GDP; and international reserves have been built up,
supporting the credibility o f the exchange rate peg to the euro. Important progress has
also been made on a range of structural refoms to increase efficiency, improve the
business climate, and support investment. Underpinned by this sound policy
environment, GDP growth has been robust-averaging                   nearly 6 percent since 2000-
and inflation has remained low.

Following a Fund staff-monitored program in the second half o f 2001, the authorities'
economic program has been supported by an arrangement with the IMFunder the PRGF.
This arrangement was approved inApril 2002 and ended inJuly 2005. The government's
medium-term development strategy is set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), which focuses on combating poverty and promoting private-sector-led growth
by strengthening education,           training,     and health care,         developing economic
infrastructure, and improving governance. The PRSP was discussed by the Boards o f the
IMFand WorldBank inJanuary 2005.

Considering recent developments, GDP growth i s estimated to have been 4.5 percent in
2004, held down in part by short-term difficulties in the agricultural sector, and is
projected to reach around 6 percent in 2005. The construction sector continues to
provide key support to economic activity, notably through private investment intourism
facilities and public investment in infrastructure. These trends have been backed by



                                             126

increasing foreign direct investment and concessional assistance from Cape Verde's
bilateral and multilateral partners.

The fiscal deficit (including grants) fell to 1.5 percent o f GDP in 2004, a stronger
performance than expected. Revenues from the new value-added tax-introduced             in
January 2004-exceeded expectations and, within effective restraints on overall public
spending, more resources were directed toward education, health, and other priority
areas. The fiscal deficit in 2005 i s projected to be 2.8 percent of GDP, fully financed
through higher external assistance.

International reserves increased at a faster pace than anticipated in 2004, reaching 2.6
months o f imports o f goods and services at the end o f the year-up  from 1.9 months at
end-2003. Further accumulation o f reserves is expected in 2005. In view o f continuing
low inflation, the strong balance o f payments position, and stable money and credit
growth, the Bank o f Cape Verde was able to lower the required reserve ratio in
December 2004 and the standing lending facility rate in February 2005. These moves
have beenfollowed by a reduction incommercial banks' lending rates.

The remaining enterprises on the government's privatization agenda are being prepared
for sale, tender under concession contracts, or liquidation. While progress in some areas
i s behind schedule, the program is expected to be largely completed over 2005-06. With
the help o f an independent mediator, negotiations are underway between the government
and the majority shareholders o f Electra, the electricity and water company, to reach
agreement on the amount o f the "tariff deficit'' owed to this company. This deficit stems
from the non-adjustment o f electricity and water tariffs during 2000-02. Following some
delays, the authorities are finalizing an automatic mechanism to adjust electricity and
water tariffs inresponse to changes inimport prices o f oil products.

Executive Board Assessment

They commended the Cape Verde authorities' strong record in implementing their
economic program, particularly the progress that has been made with fiscal
consolidation, strengthening the credibility o f the exchange rate peg, and structural
reform. This has contributed to strong economic performance in recent years. The
macroeconomic imbalances that emerged during the pre-election period in 2000 have
disappeared. Real GDP growth has been robust, supported by private and public
investment in tourism and infrastructure; inflation has been consistently low;
international reserves have increased; and the external debt is relatively small. These
achievements have supported poverty reduction and paved the way for Cape Verde's
graduation to middle-income status inthe near future.

While the public debt profile o f Cape Verde at end-2004 appears sustainable under long
term scenarios, Directors observed that the economy remains vulnerable to external
shocks, due to the heavy dependence on external concessional financing and the narrow
export base. Directors therefore        urged the     authorities to   maintain prudent
macroeconomic policies and a cautious approach to borrowing, and to sustain the reform
momentum. Domestic resource mobilization, to reduce the reliance on external


                                        127

financing, and export diversification should remain highpriorities.

Directors welcomed the decline in the fiscal deficit in 2004, which reflected the strong
performance o f the new value added tax and restraint on overall public spending, but
also delayed wage and capital expenditures. They stressed the importance o f continuing
a prudent fiscal policy, especially in the run-up to elections in early 2006. They saw
scope for further improvement in revenue performance, including through measures to
strengthen tax administration and rationalize tax exemptions. They welcomed the
authorities' commitment to keep expenditures within budgeted levels, and underscored
the importance o f prioritizing spending according to the objectives set out inthe Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper.

Directors noted the key role monetary policy has played in supporting overall
macroeconomic stability and growth, particularly by ensuring sustained low inflation
and the credibility o f the exchange rate peg. They supported the recent easing o f the
monetary policy stance, which has led to a much-needed reduction incommercial banks'
lending rates. Directors considered that the current exchange rate regime remains
appropriate for Cape Verde. They welcomed the further sizeable accumulation of
international reserves in2004, andnoted the important role that remittances have played
instrengthening thebalance ofpayments.

Directors considered that the banking system i s generally sound, but highly
concentrated. Theyurged the authorities to push ahead with reforms to improve
competition and efficiency in financial services, including through the introduction of
new indirect monetary policy instruments to promote financial deepening. It was also
noted that continued improvements in financial sector supervision will contribute to
macroeconomic stability and private sector development. Directors welcomed the
intention to adopt international financial reporting standards with technical assistance
from the Fund.

Directors encouraged the authorities to continue with structural reforms focused on
improving the conditions for private-sector-led growth. They welcomed the commitment
to complete the restructuring and privatization o f the remaining companies on the reform
agenda during 2005 and 2006, but stressed the importance o f parallel measures to
strengthen the underlying regulatory framework. They considered that implementation
o f the automatic mechanism to adjust electricity and water tariffs inresponse to changes
in input costs is important to reduce fiscal risks, restore the electricity and water
company to financial health, and ensure a more efficient supply o f utility services.
Directors welcomed Cape Verde's move toward a more liberal trade regime, and called
for faster progress in WTO membership negotiations. They encouraged efforts to
enhance labour market flexibility and improve the business environment.

Directors welcomed the efforts being made to tackle poverty and achieve the
MillenniumDevelopment Goals. They supported the creation o f the National Council
for Poverty Reduction, and commended the authorities for approving a PRSP after
consultationwith key stakeholders.



                                        128

   Directors observed that, while Cape Verde's statistical systems are generally adequate
   for program monitoring, there i s substantial scope for improvement in this area. They
   urged the authorities to make full use o f available technical assistance to strengthen
   national accounts data, implement the improved methodology for measuring consumer
   prices, and undertake labour market surveys.

 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles o f Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussionby the Executive Board. At the conclusion o f the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman o f the Board, summarizes the views o f Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.
