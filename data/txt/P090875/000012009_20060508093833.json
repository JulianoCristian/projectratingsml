Cape Verde's Growth and Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy (GPRSP). This one-tranche operation would\n            be the second of a planned series of three annual PRSCs. The\n            financial support provided through the PRSC-2 will further\n            narrow the gap between the cost of implementing key elements\n            of the GPRSP and resources, available from Government's\n            own domestic revenues and other donor support. A policy\n            dialogue and results-based framework under PRSC-2 will focus\n            on the following pillars of the GPRSP: 1) promotion of good\n            governance; 2) development of human capital in the areas of\n            education and health; and, 3) improvement in the\n            effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection\n            system. In terms of benefits, the value added of the PRSC\n            lies in both the nature of the instrument, and the results\n            that are expected from improved functioning of national\n            budget systems, from reduced transaction costs, and\n            distortions due to international assistance, from better\n            linkages between sectors and cross-cutting issues, from\n            improved service delivery for the poor, and, from an\n            improved wellbeing of the population. Notwithstanding, main\n            risks associated include macroeconomic shocks that could\n            undermine stability and growth, and, an accumulation of\n            contingent liabilities and mandatory expenditure programs\n            that could bring about fiscal slippages, and stall\n            implementation of the more sensitive policy reforms, and\n            possibly, delays in the Government implementation strategy."}, "docdt": "2006-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
