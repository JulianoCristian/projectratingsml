Education Reform Project for Albania\n            aims to assist the education ministry in planning and\n            managing the delivery of educational services and\n            strengthening its accountability to stakeholders for that\n            delivery. The project has five components. The first\n            component strengthens the generic functions of the Ministry\n            to improve the sector: policy analysis and strategic\n            planning; financial planning and management; human resource\n            management; and the design, implementation, and monitoring\n            of specific educational reform programs. The second\n            component is an institution-strengthening component that\n            supports a management information system that will link all\n            branches of the Ministry, including district offices and\n            universities. The third component is also an institution\n            building component as well as a policy reform component. It\n            funds the following activities: improving the current\n            examinations administered at grades 8 and 12; continuing the\n            development and administration of high quality and fair\n            university entrance examinations; determining the learning\n            performance standards to be assessed; and carrying out a\n            sample-based assessment for grade 4. The fourth component\n            develops building and design guidelines and specifications,\n            and rehabilitates schools. The fifth component both procures\n            and publishes textbooks."}, "docdt": "2000-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
