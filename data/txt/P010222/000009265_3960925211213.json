The project loan, which was\n            approved in 1985, was terminated in 1987 for failure to\n            become effective after five extensions to the effectiveness\n            date. At the first supervision mission, the Bank and\n            co-financiers agreed not to go on with the project until\n            policy, technical, and economic issues were solved. By the\n            fourth extension, the Borrower was asked to make changes in\n            pricing structure, raise consumer prices, obtain foreign\n            technical support on management of dairy infrastructure, and\n            propose a business plan for restructuring the dairy\n            industry. The Bank terminated the loan agreement when the\n            Borrower's response was found insufficient."}, "docdt": "1994-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
