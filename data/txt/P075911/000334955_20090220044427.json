as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) improved accountability system for\n            community development is critical in order to enhance\n            positive perceptions among beneficiaries, and other\n            stakeholders including donors. This provides an incentive\n            for their support and involvement. For this to be achieved\n            there is need to strengthen the information, education and\n            communication (IEC) so as to enhance civic engagement and\n            community accountability. 2) The first adaptable program\n            loan (APL 1) has managed to put in place proper\n            accountability systems; through the APL 1, several\n            innovations were made with regard to results monitoring and\n            measurement. Such systems need to be maintained at each\n            level of project implementation. For example, at the\n            community level, there is need to promote the use of\n            community monitoring and feedback through the community\n            statistics days as an integral part of the monitoring and\n            evaluation framework. At the local authority (LA) and\n            program level, there is need to promote participatory\n            development of delivery benchmarks related to the community\n            sub-project cycle so that beneficiaries and stakeholders are\n            aware of what they have to be accountable; and 3) the\n            sustainable mechanisms to secure continuity and\n            functionality of community assets and institutions\n            established through the APL 1 and other similar\n            interventions are important achievements for this project,\n            and need to be institutionalized."}, "docdt": "2008-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
