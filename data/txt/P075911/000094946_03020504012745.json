Specifically, the MASAF aims to 1) ensure that\n            environmental assessments are undertaken at every project\n            management sub-system level; and 2) support and empower\n            communities to implement and monitor mitigation measures on\n            MASAF-funded activities. This process will be routinely\n            integrated within the sub-project cycle processes. Where\n            needed, action plans to limit the negative effects arising\n            from project activities will be instituted. Sectoral\n            checklists will detail activities to be undertaken,\n            potential negative impacts, and mitigation measures.\n            Extension workers will elicit input from communities,\n            including ongoing environmental monitoring once the project\n            is approved. The Environmental District Officer will play a\n            critical role in coordinating activities geared at\n            supporting communities in environmental assessment. At the\n            national level, the Environmental Affairs Department will\n            insure that environmental assessment is carried out before\n            funding is released for a particular activity. This\n            department will also provide targeted messages designed to\n            increase environmental awareness and promoting the use of\n            alternative technologies, such as cement blocks, where\n            appropriate. A workshop held in Salima in August 2002\n            modified procedures and forms to be used specifically for\n            use in the environmental assessment for the Third Social\n            Action Fund; these are detailed in this report."}, "docdt": "2002-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
