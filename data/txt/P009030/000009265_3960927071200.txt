HEALTH PROJECT -- STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Project and Loan Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Turkey           Amount:  US$75.0 million
Beneficiary:       Ministry of Health (MOH)
Terms:             Seventeen years, including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Project
Description:       The project has three major objectives:  (i) to improve the health
status through access to basic health services of underprivileged
populations in eight of the country's 67 provinces; (ii) to enhance
efficiency in service delivery and improve financing prospects for
the sector;   and (iii)  to strengthen the Ministry of Health's
management capacity.   The project has two components:   (i) the
reorganization and expansion of provincial health services in
underserved areas of eight provinces, with a population of about 9
million;   and (ii) institutional development of the Ministry of
Health, focusing on training and curriculum development, management
information systems, and applied studies. Specifically, the project
would finance: (i) construction or expansion of provincial health
facilities and training centers; (ii) furniture, equipment, and
vehicles for the above facilities;   (iii) technical assistance,
overseas and local training, and applied research; and (iv) project
monitoring and evaluation.
Benefits
and Risks:         The project would  reduce  existing  inequalities  in health  and
fertility status by providing improved access to basic health care
for about 9 million persons. Through its institutional development
component, this project would also pave the way for achieving broader
sectoral objectives under subsequent proiects. The long-term goal
would be to establish a higher quality and partly self-supporting
health care delivery system. The main risk faced by the project is
the limited management capacity of MOH, and its lack of experience
in  implementing  large  projects;    this  risk  is offset by  the
relatively simple design of the project, the decentralization of
responsibilities for implementation, and the provision of technical
assistance in key areas. The construction program includes a large
number of small and scattered rural facilities; to ensure good
quality standards, and reduce the risk of cost overrung and delays,
the project will provide for additional supervision engineers.
Finally, the implementation of the Management Information System may
be held up owing to the shortage of specialized personnel; this risk
will be minimized through the close collaboration with Universities,
and the substantial training program included in the component.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Objectives
1.          The Integrated Health Service Scheme  [IHSS], designed to expand
health coverage in rural areas through the integration of basic services, was
created by a 1961 Law referred to as "socializationIe. It was expected to cover
the whole countLy in fifteen years, but this ambitious objective was never
achieved.   Until  the mid-1980s,  public health policy consisted mainly of
building hospitals; this left inadequate funds for equipment, vehicles or major
repairs, and only marginal resources for outreach services. Salaries absorbed
most of the operating budgets, leading to critical shortages of drugs, supplies
and fuel, and a general decay of public health services.   To illustrate this
point, it may be noted that, by 1980, less than 30% of Turkish children were
fully immunized.   Nevertheless, the institutional or legal setting neeacd to
revamp the public health sector generally exists in Turkey. First, the IHSS is
a viable health care delivery system which can be readily implemented. Second,
some cost recovery is already applied in the public health sector.   Third,
Turkey is one of the few countries where medical graduates must, and actually
d;, serve in the public sector, including in rural health centers. Fourth, the
personnel assignment policy brings midwives to remote rural areas. Evidently,
the system does not always operate efficiently, but there are no obstacles that
cannot be overcome with political will, popular support, and adequate financial
resources.
2.          The project therefore aims to .et-up a partly self-sufficient public
health system capable of providing quality services to an increasing number of
patients. While collecting user charges, it would be expected to deliver free
preventive services for all, and waive charges for indigents.   It was agreed
with the Government that this project will cover the whole public health system
in 8 out of 67 provinces.   Four criteria were used for their selection:  [i]
basic health indicators about or below national average; [ii] presence of a
strong and motivated technical team; [iii] year-round accessibility; and [iv]
community and political support. The location of these provinces is shown in
the attached map and their major characteristics are presented in Annex I. The
experience gained through the technical teams of these provinces would be
crucial for subsequent phases of rehabilitation of the public health system.
3.          The project has three major objectives:  [i]  improve the health
status of about 10% of the country's population; [ii] initiate measures to
enhance cost effectiveness and improve financing prospects for the sector; and
[iii] institution building, to strengthen MOH's management capability and set
the stage for further interventions designed to address crucial issues affecting
the sector.
4.          No adverse impact on the environment is expected from the project.

B. Project Description
5.          The proposed project consists of two major components:
a.    Reorganization and Strengthening of Provincial  Healt:. Services
[US$131.77 million], in order to:
i.    extend coverage and improve services in underserved areas of
eight provinces' with a total population of about 9 million,
through  the  implementation  of  15  health  programs,  the
strengthening of management, the reorganization of referral
procedures,   the  upgrading  or  construction  of  health
facilities, and the provision of equipment and vehicles;
ii.   achieve a better distribution of health personnel, provide in-
service and induction training for about 7,000 medical and
paramedical staff in the eight provinces, and health education
training for primary school teachers;
b.    Institutional Development  [US$14.89 million]  through three sub-
components:
i.    health manpower development, focussed on teachers training,
technical assistance for curriculum revision, local and
overseas training, study tours and attendance at international
meetings;
ii.   development of a Management Information System, to be first
implemented in the eight project provinces; and
iii.  support to the central level, through the strengthening of
MOH's management, planning, monitoring and supervision
capability,   applied   studies   and   research,   and   the
strengthening of the Project Coordination Unit.
C. Detailed Project Features
Provincial Health Services (US$131.77 million]
6.          It is the responsibility of the public sector to ensure adequate
curative, preventive and emergency services for the whole population, and to
keep communicable diseases under control. This component is therefore designed
to ensure full access to basic health services to 9 million persons living in
eight of the country's 67 provinces, and improve their general health status.
About 60X of this population depend entirely on MOH for curative care, and
' The eight provinces are: Ankara, Diyarbakir, Istanbul, Mardin, Mugla,
Sivas, Tokat, and Yozgat.



4
emphasis will be put on these 5.4 million persons, including 120,000 infants,
900,000 children and 1.3 million women of reproductive age, who suffer from
persistent infectious diseases, high infant, child and maternal mortality rates
and high fertility levels. Moreover, most of the beneficiaries of che social
security system also turn to MOH facilities for curative care provided for under
their medical benefits and rely entirely on public services for preventive care.
7.          Under this component, new patterns of health care delivery will be
developed,  to be gradually replicated in the rest of the country.   The key
reform is a move away from a delivery system where the public sector responds
to population's demand for curative services, to a system geared at anticipating
population's preventive and curative care needs.   This shift from a passive
attituda in care delivery, to active prevention, detection and treatment is
expected to generate profound changes in the organization of services, personnel
attitude and motivation, and result in a more cost-effective and equitable
public health system.   By the end of the project, quality basic health care
would be delivered through an improved and expanded network of properly equipped
facilities, operated by well trained personnel.
8.          At the same time, the project will support the development of more
decentralized procedures designed to improve cost effectiveness of public health
services in the eight provinces, and ensure fast and appropriate response to
population  needs.    Provincial  Directorates  will  be  expected  to  exercise
increasing authority in the management of the referral system.  At the lower
levels, health centers and district hospitals will be giver more responsibility
in the administration of their resources. Project investments in training,
infrastructure and equipment, would substantially improve the quality of
outreach services and permLt a more systematic implementation of existing
regulations  regarding  the collection of user  charges.    Additional  income
generated in district hospitals and health centers will mostly benefit the same
facilities, and their health posts, thereby improving the long-term financing
prospects of the public health system. Alternative methods of utilization of
these funds will be tested under the project, before their broader adoption.
9.          A large proportion of newly created positions are expected to be
filled through the redeploymenc and better utilization of existing personnel.
Nevertheless, by the end of the project, about 1,900 additional staff, i.e. 630
midwives; 550 doctors, nurses and technicians; and 720 support staff and drivers
would be assigned to outreach  facilities.    For  the eight provinces  this
additional personnel would represent an increase of 26% over the current staff
of 7300. For the health system as a whole, these 1900 staff would represent an
addition of 2.9X to MOH's current payroll of 66,000.
10.         Health  Programs.    Based on their epidemiological  profiles and
current service statistics, the provinces have adopted 15 health programs,
representing the core of common interventions. Specific objectives, as well as
criteria for monitoring and impact evaluation, take into account variations in
pathology and environment. Because of the poor quality of epidemiological data
and service statistics beyond major hospitals, these objectives will be updated
annually,  as the data collection system is improved.   In the longer term,
provincial targets will be derived from the Management Information System
developed under the project (see Second Component below). The health programs



5
and monitoring indicators are presented in Annex II and are targeted at:
a.    maternal care, including: family planning, pre-natal monitoring and
screening, improved midwife assistance for deliveries at home, risk
approach to hospitalization, and improv ' obstetrical care;
b.    child care, including: post-natal clinics, nutrition surveillance,
control of diarrheal diseases, control of acute respiratory
infections, and school health;
c.    control   of  communicable   diseases,   including   immunizations,
tuberculosis, rabies and parasitosis control; finally
d.    improved front line curative care.
11.         Particular attention will be paid to immunizations, to complete the
transition towards a routine activity integrated into the child care program
carried out at the local level; the consolidation of the cold chain will be
essential for this purpose.   The project will also strengthen the program for
the control of diarrheal diseases through better detection of cases of
mainutrition and repeated diarrheal episodes, generalization of the oral
rehydration technique, and improved distribution and utilization of ORS packets.
As regards family planning, the project will promote a more systematic and
targeted method of service delivery, as current approaches are too fragmentci,
ad-hoc, and lack an evaluation component.   On the other hand, much of the
contraceptive practice is presently focussed on traditional methods and the use
of condoms and, reportedly, use of orals has remained stagnant, while IUD
insertions  increased only slightly.   The method mix actually offered will
therefore be carefully reviewed in each project province in order to achieve the
most effective protection for those couples who want to control fertility.
Training of doctors and midwives in IUD insertion will be stepped-up, and the
availability of tubal ligation services will be extended for couples with
completed fertility.
12.         In-Service Training.   A program of continuing education,  to be
impl3mented by eight provincial training teams, under che leadership of the
General Directorate for Health Education, will be geared to:
a.    upgrading the skills of existing health personnel: up to the level
of district hospitals, refresher courses and direct training
programs will be organized for all categories of personnel, i.e.
about 540 MDs, 490 nurses, 2100 midwives and 1290 other staff; as
for provincial hospitals, the project will provide for training of
the trainers responsible of the continuing education programs within
their facility;
b.    providing induction training for all staff assigned in the project
provinces, either as new entrants in the health sector (about 1900
additional staff over five years] or as a consequence of the high
turnover which affects smaller facilities in particular; and



6
c.    increasing awareness of school teachers and community leaders on
health related matters, to generate a more active participation of
the population in the health improvement process.
13.         For each individual, an average of 25 days of training is planned
over the five-vear period. In-service and induction training will focus on the
specific morbidity patterns of the province and, in more general terms, on
preventive care and communication methods; training curricula will be updated
with the assistance of consultants provided by the project, which will also
finance health education materials. At the same time, the project will support
mass-media programs in the provinces to educate the population on family
planning, prevention of communicable diseases, environmental control, etc.
Finally, basic paramedical training will be improved in the 15 health colleges
by increasing teaching staff, curriculum development, better teacher preparation
and strengthening of library and laboratory facilities. The Governaent provided
assurances during Negotiations that, in filling current professional teacher
vacancies in MOH's health colleges, priority will be given to the 15 colleges
in the project area.
14.         The high mobility of health personnel, especially at the first and
second levels of the referral system, affects continuity and quality of
services.    Moreover,  it  increases  subscancially  in-service  and  induction
training requirements, and the cost of these programs. This situation can only
partly be remedied.   The high turnover of the new graduate MDs is unavoidable,
as they are assigned in health centers for two years of medical service; there
were 2450 entrants in 1987 (about 30 in health centers of the eight project
provinces] and 5000 were expected in 1989 [60 in health centers in the eight
project provinces].   To reduce mobility of paramedical personnel, and rural
midwives in particular, the 15 health colleges will seek to increase enrollments
of candidates from the project area and encourage graduates to serve in their
provinces upon graduation.
15.         The project will provide for: [i] construction of about 100 health
posts, 14 rural health centers, 69 urban health centers, 8 district hospitals,
2 public health laboratories, 2 vehicle maintenance workshops, 6 health colleges
and 2 training centers; upgrading or completion of about 620 health posts, 280
rural health centers, 140 urban health centers, 30 district hospitals, 8
provincial hospitals and 9 health colleges; [ii] equipment and furniture for
above facilities; [iii] additional equipment and furniture for existing health
posts [700], health centers [430], district hospitals [29], provincial hospitals
[9], public health laboratories [6] and vehicle maintenance workshops [7]; [iv]
books and training materials for the health colleges; and [v] about 330 vehicles
for replacements or additional and future needs, i.e. 30 sedans, 150 four-wheel
drives, 40 ambulances, 50 minibus, and 60 pick-ups and trucks.
Institutional Development [US$14.89 million]
16.         This  component  aims  at  launching measures  and  progra.-s  that,
starting with MOH, will strengthen the sector's institutions, ensure efficient
use of its resources, enhance the cost effectiveness of the system, and pave
the way for the introduction of more reforms.  It will include three parts: [i]



7
a health manpower development program; [ii] a Management Information System; and
[iii] a central level support program. Overall, the project will provide for
technical assistance (628 m/m], overseas craining fellowships [476 m/ml, study
tours (111 m/m equivalent], and local training [2874 m/m], as well as computing
and office equipment for the central and provincial project teams.
17.         The Health Manpower Development Program is designed to improve the
quality of care and planning, stimulate personal advancement and protessional
development of the health personnel and, in a longer term perspective, adapt
medical and paramedical education to the needs of a rapidly evolving system.
This sub-component, estimated at US$7.50 million will provide for:
a.    teacher training, i.e. 78 m/m of technical assistance [local and
foreign] for he revision and adaptation of teacher training
programs; workshops; textbooks, materials, equipment, furniture for
the Gevher Nesibe Institute; and minor repairs (for this Institute,
pending a decision regarding its relocation];
b.    curriculum development, i.e. 71 m/m of technical assistance (local
and foreign] for the review and revision of training curricula for
nurses, midwives and technicians, the design of continuing education
and community programs, and the development of short-term
specialized courses;
c.    local  training,  i.e.  1930  m/m  of  training  through  national
institutions of central and provincial public health staff in. such
areas as public health administration, hospital administration,
communicable and infectious diseases, MCH/FP, epidemiology,
environmental management, occupational health, etc.;
d.    the acquisition of textbooks and reference manuals  for health
colleges, copyrights and translation of new manuals, and the local
printing of training and health education materials; and
e.    overseas training, i.e. 456 m/m of fellowships in such areas as
epidemiology, statistics, MCH/FP, school health, etc.; the project
will also provide for the equivalent of 1ll m/m for study tours and
attendance at international meetings on architecture and design of
health facilities, health needs of the tourism industry, public
health nursing, financing of health systems, social security
institutions, etc.
18.         A Fellowships Selection Committee will be set-up within MOH, to
ensure an impartial award process; chaired by a senior MOH official, it will
include the General Director for Health Education, the Project Coordinator and
a representative of Y6K. Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that two-
thirds of fellowships will be awarded to health personnel directly invo'lved in
project implementation, and that upon their return all efforts will be made to
assign beneficiaries  to project-related activities.    The  creation of  the
Fellowships Selection Committee will be a condition of Loan effectiveness.

19.         The Management Information System.  The MIS to be developed under
the project (see Annex III for a detailed presentation] builds upon MOH's
current activities in informatics and strikes a balance between the need to do
a planning study bAfore undertaking major investments in informatics, and the
recognition that immediate opportunities and needs exist which can be exploited
and served through the development of microcomputer-based systems. It will be
composed of eight basic application components namely: a Statistical Data Base
System, a Hospital Administration System, an Equipment and Vehicles Control
System, a Financial Management System, a Personnel System, a PHC Management
System, an Epidemiology System, and a M..H-FP Management System.
20.         The Statistical Data Base System, will receive priority; its purpose
is to maintain up-to-date provincial and central statistical data bases on all
activities of the Ministry.   In determining the scope of the other seven
application systems, priority was given to the managerial and statistical
reporting aspects, leaving other operational aspects to be addressed in
subsequent projects.    The majority  of  the data will be provided by  the
individual application systems (PHC, Personnel, Hospital Administration, etc);
other data would be collected directly through surveys, special research
projects, etc.
21.         Achieving the objectives of the MIS would be a major institutional
challenge for MOH as the number of different activities is large and spans the
six years  of the Project.    It wil, be necessary to design a management
environment which relies heavily on external consultants and, at the same time,
make organizational and staffing decisions that ensure continuous and proper
discharge and management of the new functions.
22.         The whole effort will thus require a large accompanying training
program. A training plan, by province and category of personnel, will be aimed
at six categories of personnel: Managers, Section Chiefs, Health statisticians,
Technical staff in the data processing unit, End user programmers, and Regular
system users.
23.         The acquisition of equipment and corresponding software will be done
in phases, to dovetail with the training and system development activities. The
project will finance:  [i] 375 m/m of consultant services;  [ii]  20 m/m of
overseas  training;  (iii]  404 m/m of  local  training;  and  [iv]  about  260
microcomputers and one central computer in MOH.  The total cost of this sub-
component is estimated at US$4.92 million.
24.         A Steering Committee will be created to oversee the development of
the MIS and take all major decisions related to policies, priorities, budgets
and programs.   The Steering Committee will also ensure that the recommended
technology responds to the institutional needs of MOH and is not primarily
driven by technical considerations.   The Steering Committee,  chaired by a
national expert designated by the Minister of Health, will include selected
senior MOH managers, specialists and representatives from YoK, the SIO and the
Middle East Technical University.   Its Secretary will be the Head of the
Ministry's Research, Planning and Coordination Council. While the system will
be developed by consultants who would also provide for training services, it
will be essential for MOH to recruit a full-time MIS manager and qualified staff



9
to implement this sub-component. MOH's MIS team will include about ten staff,
i.e. two made available by the Data Processing Unit, three or four new recruits
to be trained as system analysts-computer programmers, and five experienced and
fully trained analysts-programmers recruited from outside.   Assurances were
obtained during Negotiations that the MIS team, headed by a specialist and
staffed by qualified full-time members, will operate through the closing date
of the Project. The creation of the MIS Steering Committee will be a conditions
of Loan effectiveness.
25.         Central Level Support Program.   The third set of interventions
covered by the institutional development component have been regrouped under a
Central Level Support Program which includes: [i] the strengthening of MOH's
central level organization; [ii] the implementation of well targeted applied
studies; and (iii] direct support to the Project Coordination Unit. The cost
of this sub-component is estimated at US$2.47 million.
26.         To strengthen MOH's management, planning, monitoring and supervision
capability, the project will finance an extensive program of overseas
fellowships,  complemented by study tours and participation in international
meetings by senior MOH staff (see above].  In addition, Consultant services will
be provided, to back-up MOH's specialists or fill existing gaps, with special
emphasis  on  evaluation  of  policy  alternatives  and  their  implications.
Considerable expertise, which has not been tapped so far, already exists in the
country, but outside consultants will also be required to take advantage of
other countries' experience.  A program of studies and applied research will
also be carried out with the technical assistance of local and foreign
specialists  to be financed by the project.   A total of 70 m/m have been
eatmarked to support seven research topics: the reduction of disparities in
health and fertility indicators; the reorganization of the referral system; the
critical evaluation of social security institutions; the design of a national
health insurance scheme; the improvement of the utilization of existing
hospitals; the reform of medical and paramedical training systems; and the
overall financing of health sector development. Assurances were obtained during
Negotiations that the conclusions of project-financed studies, and their
proposed implementation would be discussed with the Bank.
27.          To  strengthen  the Project Coordination  Unit and  improve  its
performance, 34 m/m of specialized consultants will be utilized to assist it in
monitoring, and adjusting when needed, the implementation of the fifteen health
programs, the trnining activities and the Management Information System; in the
final evaluation of the project;  and in the preparation of the follow-up
project.   For the same reason,  two thirds of overseas fellowships will be
awarded to central and provincial health personnel directly involved in project
implementation, in order to continue building-up the knowledge that will be
instrumental in the preparation and implementation of follow-up projects (see
above]. The project will also provide financing for semi-annual review meetings
of provincial coordinators and for the publication of a bi-monthly Project
Newsletter.   Finally, it will finance materials, supplies and transportation
needed for project monitoring and supervision.

III. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Costs and Financing
28.           The total cost of the six-year project,  to be completed by December
1996, is estimated at US$146.7 million equivalent. Base costs are calculated
at US$122.0 million and contingencies at US$24.7 million; project's base cost
with price contingencies  on base cost amounts  to US$135.4 million.   Physical
contingencies represent US$11.2 million.  Price contingencies2 (US$13.5 million]
reflect Bank guidelines on expected local and international price increases.
Import duties and taxes are  included in project costs.   The  foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$76.1 million or 52% of total project costs.
Project costs exclude incremental recurrent expenditure. A summary of project
costs by components and categories of expenditures is presented below.

29.                  Basis of Cost Estimates.  The costs of civil works are derived from
current contracts for similar construction in the project area, and from
quarterly guidelines published by the Ministry of Public Works.   Costs of
equipment, furniture and supplies are based on local market prices or CIF unit
prices, both adjusted to include local transportation and installation. Vehicle
costs are based on international prices, except for models assembled locally
which are generally  less expensive.   Costs of production of audio-visual
materials, training, local and expatriate consultants, applied research and
other services reflect local or international prices as applicable. Overseas
training fellowships are based on United-Nations rates for Europe, Canada and
the United States averaged at US$3,440 per month.   Base costs  reflect an
exchange rate of US$1 - TL2,500 and include a price contingency adjustment
between negotiations and June 30, 1990.
30.                  Customs  duties and taxes.   Project costs  include an estimated
US$16.9 million in direct and indirect taxes and duties on civil works and
goods, to be financed by the Government.

31.                  Contingency allowances.  Physical contingencies are estimated at lOX
for civil works, equipment, furniture, and materials, and 5% for vehicles and
technical assistance; overall, they represent 9.2% of baseline costs or 7.7% of
total costs.   Price contingencies are estimated at 10.1% of base cost plus



12
physical contingencies. Total contingencies represent 20.2% of the base cost.
The estimated price contingency allowance for imported equipment differs
slightly from the international price contingency rate, and is country specific,
to reflect Turkey's trade pattern which is predominantly oriented towards
Europe.
32.         Foreign exchange component.   The foreign exchange component is
US$76.1 million including contingencies, or 51.9% of total project costs. It
was estimated as follows: 20% for civil works; 85% for equipment: 75% for
vehicles; 25% for furniture; 100% for foreign consultant services and overseas
fellowships; and 15% for local technical assistance.   These percentages are
based on the expectation that: [i] all civil works contracts will be awarded to
local firms and most building materials will be produced locally; [ii] 80% of
medical equipment and 60% of other equipment will be imported; [iii] 80% of
vehicles will be rurchased through local suppliers; and [iv] 90% of furniture
will be purchased locally.
33.         Project financing.  The proposed Bank loan of US$75.0 million will
finance almost entirely the foreign exchange component, i.e. 51% of the total
project cost.   The Government will finance the balance of project costs,
including taxes and duties. The proposed financing plan is shown below.

34.         Incremental recurrent costs generated by project implementation over
the six-year period are not included.  They will be borne by MOH's oporating
budget and are expected to be gradually offset by a more general collection of
user charges in project-supported facilities. Assurances were obtained during
Negotiations that MOH will review every year the costs of health services
provided by public health facilities in the project area, and the revenues to
cover these costs.



13
B. Project Management and Implementation
35.         MOH had created a Coordination Committee to guide the Central and
Provincial teams during the preparation of the proposed project.   To ensure
continuing support and guidance during the execution of the project, assurances
were obtained during Negotiations that the Coordinating Committee, chaired by
the Under-Secretary for Health and composed of senior MOH staff and
representatives from YoK, Treasury and SPO will be maintained during the project
and given the responsibility of overseeing project implementation [ Chart II].
36.          The  project  will  be  implemented by MOH  through  the Project
Coordinating Unit [PCU] created to prepare the project. Under the authority of
a Project Coordinator reporting to the Coordination Committee and responsible
for implementing its decisions, the PCU will: [i] coordinate and supervise all
project activities; [ii] take all necessary steps to ensure prompt and efficient
implementation of the construction program by the Ministry of Public Work; [iii]
conduct all other bidding, procurement and disbursement operations; [iv] monitor
progress and expenditure and arrange for the audit of project accounts; [v]
liaise with the Bank and ensure adherence to Loan Agreement provisions. In each
province, the project will be implemented by a full-time Provincial Team (PT]
led by a Provincial Coordinator,  reporting to the Project Coordinator.   The
functions of the PT, and of its chief, reflect those of the central team. The
PCU full-time staff includes, in addition to the Coordinator, two physicians,
an architect, two technicians, a procurement specialist, an accountant and other
support personnel. The PTs include, in addition to the Coordinator, an MD, a
head nurse or midwife, a health technician, an administrator, and support staff.
The staff of the PCU and the PTs are all MOH officials detached from their units
for the duration of the project. Assurances were obtained during Negotiations
that the Central Project Coordination Unit and the eight Provincial Teams,
adequately staffed with full-time personnel, will operate through the closing
date of the project.
37.         The General Directorate for Primary Health Care will have overall
responsibility for improving and expanding health services in the eight
provinces, enacting the action programs in close collaboration with units
concerned, and coordinating their implementation. While the General Directorate
for Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning will be in charge of delivery
and supervision of family planning services, the GDPHC will ensure effective
integration of these activities into the package of services provided in public
health facilities.   The Project Coordinator will be responsible for ensuring
coordination and timely delivery of these inputs with those from the General
Directorate for Curative Services [hospitals] and the Malaria and TB Control
Units.
38.         The Research, Planning, and Coordination Council (RPCC], which acts
as the Secretariat of the MIS Steering Committee, will provide all needed
support for the implementation of the Management Information System. The RPCC
will also assist as needed the Project Coordination Unit, in all matters related
to annual budget allocations and to procurement of works, goods and services.
Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that the Government will
appropriate every year sufficient funds to ensure effective implementation of



14
the investment program, especially with respect to the annual construction of
all approved facilities.
39.         The General Directorate for Health Education will be in charge of
all project-related training activities, under the guidance of a Training
Advisory Committee, chaired by a senior MOH official, which will include the
General Directors for Health Education, PHC, MCH/FP and Curative Services, the
Project Coordinator, and representatives from YoK, the Ministry of Education,
and the major professional associations. Training activities will be carried
out through:
a.    a Ce-tral Training Team [CTT] responsible for overall coordination
of p:oject-supported training activities, the preparation of core
courses to be adapted at the provincial level, the supervision of
design and production of materials, sponsoring of related
operational research, monitoring, supervision and evaluation of
program activities in the eight provinces; this CTT, which was set-
up during project preparation, is headed by a member of the PCU and
includes seven specialists covering the following areas: public
health, health education, communication, midwives training, nurses
training, teachers training and sanitation;
b.    eight Provincial Training Teams (PTTs] responsible for adapting and
implementing the core programs, coordinating training activities
within the province, and conducting specific studies designed to
measure the impact and effectiveness of the program; the PTTs
created during project preparation are headed by anr MD and include
three or four other members, i.e. a health technii-lan, a nurse
and/or a midwife, and a sanitation technician.
40.         The creation of the Training Advisory Committee, will be a condition
of Loan effectiveness.
41.         In accordance with Turkish law, the Ministry of Public Works will
be responsible for conducting the whole construction process on behalf of MOH,
for all health facilities.  Remodelling and upgrading of existing facilities
will be done under the responsibility of local authorities. To ensure proper
implementation of the civil works program, MOH will nevertheless provide for
additional supervision, the cost of which will be borne by .he project.
Agreement was reached on architectural designs for all health facilities to be
built under the project.   In rural areas, land is readily available, and in
urban areas, the process of selection and acquisition of sites has been largely
completed. Nevertheless, assurances were obtained during Negotiations that all
remaining sites will be acquired by December 31, 1991.
42.                The technical assistance program would be instrume9tal in
achieving project objectives and, in particular for the implementation of the
training program, the development of the MIS, and in carrying out the applied
studies.  Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that project-financed
Consultants will be recruited in accordance with Bank Guidelines dated August
1981.



15
43.         Monitoring and evaluation.  The Project Coordinator will monitor and
report on progress achieved in the project on the basis of reports from the
eight provincial teams and the central directorates, and of regular field
supervision.   Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that:  [i] semi-
annual progress reperts will be prepared by the Project Coordinator, to be
submitted to periodic Bank review missions; and [ii] a Project Completion Report
will be submitted by the Government to the Bank, within six months of the
closing date of the project.
C. Procurement
44.         Procurement methods are summarized in Table 4 below.  Contracts for
civil works will be normally awarded through local competitive bidding.
However, force account procedures will be used: (i] when no satisfactory bids
have been received; or [ii] when LCB is not likely to succeed, as in the case
of small buildings in remote areas or minor remodelling work. The Bank's prior
approval will be required for individual civil works contracts exceeding
US$500,000; other contracts will be subject to post-award reviews.
45.         To the extent practicable, contracts for equipment and vehicles,
with an estimated aggregate value of US$60 million including contingencies, will
be grouped to permit bulk procurement of at least US$400,000 equivalent.
Contracts estimated to cost more than US$400,000 will be awarded on the basis
of ICB, in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts of less than US$400,000,
not to exceed US$7 million will be awarded on the basis of LCB in accordance to
local procedures acceptable to the Bank.   Items which cannot be grouped into
economical packages, which in the aggregate should not exceed US$2 million,
would be procured locally or internationally through prudent shopping, after
obtaining at least three price quotations. Procurement of medical equipment for
small facilities would be procured from UNICEF, up to US$5 million. Domestic
preference of 15X, or the applicable duty, whichever is less, will be given to
suppliers of locally manufactured items for supply of goods under ICB.   The
Bank's prior approval will be required for individual contracts exceeding
US$200,000; other contracts would be subject to selective post-award reviews.
Local and expatriate consultant services expected to total about US$4.8 million
would be contracted following Bank guidelines for the use of Consultants.
46.         The Turkish  local competitive bidding procedures  are generally
consistent with the need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the
project.   There are, however, a few provisions which are inconsistent with
Bank's Procurement Guidelines and other which require clarification. Agreement
was reached during Negotiations on the changes needed to make Government's local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank.

4]    About US$1.5 million and US$2 million respectively expected
to be procured through WHO and/or UNDP
D. Disbursements, Accounts and Audits
47.         Loan disbursements would finance:  [i] 18% of the cost of civil
works; [ii] for equipment and vehicles: 100% of foreign expenditures of direct
imports; 100% of ex-factory cost for locally manufactured items; and 50% of
local expenditures when purchased locally; [iii] 100 % the cost of consultant
services, and overseas fellowships; [iv] 80% the cost of local training, books,
materials, printing and copyright; and [vi] repayment of the PPF.
48.         Disbursement against contracts for goods and services exceeding
US$400,000 equivalent will be made against full documentation. Disbursements
against expenditures or contracts below that level will be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOE), to be kept by the Project Unit for annual
audits and examination by Bank missions. Disbursements will be made through a
Special Account in the Central Bank of Turkey, to be operated in accordance with



17
established Bank guidelines.   The initial World Bank disbursement of US$8
million to the Special Account represents the estimated average Bank counterpart
financing amount for a four-month period during the first three years of the
project.
49.         The proposed Bank loan of US$75.0 million would be disbursed over
seven and one-half years, which includes an additional 18 months to accommodate
unforeseen delays in procurement [see Disbursement Schedule in Annex V].  The
current country disbursement profile is six years, but the seven and one-half
year period reflects the sector's profile in the Region, and the fact that this
will be the first health project implemented in Turkey.
50.         Accounts and Audits.  Under the overall supervision of the General
Director of Management and Budget, the Project Coordinator will maintain
separate accounts and records of project expenditures.   Project accounts,
including the Special Account, will be audited in accordance with the March 1982
Bank "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by
the World Bank".  Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that the Bank
will be provided, within six months of the end of each fiscal year, with an
audit report of project accounts of such scope and detail as the Bank may
reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditors on
disbursements made on the basis of SOEs.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
51.                The project will help the government achieve its objective of
reducing inequalities in health status of large segments of the underprivileged
population,  while  slowing  the  rate  of  demographic  growth.    When  fully
operational, the project would result in effective coverage of about 9 million
persons living in the eight provinces. Particular attention will be paid to the
5.4 million persons who rely entirely on MOH for their basic health care needs.
These beneficiaries include 120,000 infants, 900,000 children below the age of
five, and 1.2 million women of reproductive age.   Through its institutional
development component, this project will also pave the way for more ambitious
objectives  to be  achieved under  subsequent  projects.    In  a longer  term
perspective, the goal would be to set-up an economically viable and partly self-
supporting health care delivery system.
52.         The project faces three risks.  The main risk lies in the limited
management capacity of MOH, and its lack of experience in implementing large
projects; this risk is offset by the relatively simple design of the project,
the decentralization of many interventions, and the provision of technical
assistance in key areas.   Second, the construction program includes a large
number  of small  and  scattered  rural  facilities;  to  ensure  good  quality
standards, and reduce the risk of cost overruns and delays, the project will
provide  for  additional  supervision  engineers.        Finally,  the  effective
implementation of the Management Information System will depend on MOH's success
in attracting, and retaining, the needed specialized personnel. This risk will
be minimized through the continuing association of the Middle East Technical
University to the development and introduction of this MIS by the Consultant,
and the substantial training program included in the component.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
53.         During Negotiations, agreement was reached on the changes needed to
make Government's local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank
(para. 46].
54.         During Negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
a.    in filling current professional teacher vacancies in MOH's health
colleges, priority will be given to the 1' colleges in the project
area [para. 13];
b.    two-thirds  of fellowships will be awarded to health personnel
directly involved in project implementation, and that upon their
return, all efforts will be made to assign beneficiaries to project-
related activities [para. 18];
c.    the MIS team, headed by a specialist and staffed by qualified full-
time members, will operate through the closing date of the Project
[para. 24];
d.    the conclusions of project-financed studies,  and their proposed
implementation will be discussed with the Bank (para. 26];
e.    MOH will review every year the costs of health services provided by
public health facilities in the project area, and the revenues to
cover these costs [para. 34];
f.    the Coordinating Committee,  chaired by the Under-Secretary for
Health and composed of senior MOH staff and representatives from
YoK, Treasury and SPO will be maintained during the project and
given the responsibility of overseeing project implementation [para.
35];
g.    the Central Project Coordination Unit and the eight Provincial
Teams, adequately staffed with full-time personnel, will operate
through the closing date of the project [para. 36];
h.    the Government will appropriate every year sufficient funds to
ensure effective implementation of the investment program,
especially with respect to the annual construction of all approved
facilities [para. 38];
i.    all remaining sites will be acquired by December 31, 1991 (para.
41];
j.    project-financed Consultants will be recruited in accordance with
Bank Guidelines dated August 1981 [para. 42];
k.    semi-annual  progress  reports  will be  prepared by  the  Project
Coordinator, to be submitted to periodic Bank review missions; and
that a Project Completion Report will be submitted by the Government



19
to the Bank, within six months of the closing date of the project
(para. 431;
1.    the Bank will be provided, within six months of the end of each
fiscal year, with an audit report of project accounts of such scope
and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate
opinion by the auditors on disbursements made on the basis of SOEs
[para. 50].
55.         Conditions of Loan Effectiveness would be the creation of [i] the
Fellowships Selection Committee; [ii] the Management Information System Steering
Committee; and (iii] the Training Advisory Committee.
56.   Subject to the above conditions, the project provides a suitable basis for
a Bank Loan of US$75 million equivalent.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
HEALTH PROJECT -- STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Project and Loan Summary
Borrower:    Republic of Turkey                 Amount:          US$75.0 million
Beneficiary: Ministry of Health (MOH)
Terms:       Seventeen years,  including a  five-year grace  period, at tkhe Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Project
Description: The project has three major objectives:   (i)  to improve  the health
status through access to basic health services of underprivileged
populations in ten of the country's  67 provinces;   (ii)  to enhance
efficiency in service delivery and imiprove financing prospects for
the sector;    and  (iii)  to  strengthen  the  Ministry  of Health's
management  capacity.    The  project  has  two  conponents:  (i) the
reorganization and expansion of provincial health services in ten
underserved provinces with a population of over 6 million; and (ii)
institutional development of the Ministry of Health, focusing on
training and curriculum development, management information systems,
and applied studies. Specifically, the project would finance: (i)
construction  or   expansion  of  provincial  health  facilities  and
training centers; (ii) furniture, equipment, and vehicles for the
above  facilities;    (iii)  technical assistance, overseas and local
training, and applied research;    and  (iv)  project  monitoring and
evaluation.
Benefits
and Risks:   The  project   would  reduce  existing  inequalities  in  health  and
fertility status by providing inproved access to basic health care
for  more   than  6  million  persons.    Through  its  institutional
development component, this project would also pave the way for
achieving broader sectoral objectives under subsequent projects. The
long-term goal would be to establish a higher quality and partly
self-supporting health care delivery system. The main risk faced by
tne project is the limited management capacity of MOH, and its lack
of experience in implementing large projects; this risk is offset by
the relatively simple design of the project, the  decentralization of
responsibilities for implementation, and the provision of technical
assistance in key areas. The construction program includes a large
number  of  small  and  scattered  rural  facilities;  to ensure good
quality standards, and reduce the risk of cost overruns and delays,
the project will provide for additional supervision engineers.
Finally, the inplementation of the Management Information System may
be held up owing to the shortage of specialized personnel; this risk
will be minimized through the close collaboration with Universities,
and the substantial training program included in the conponent.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
H E A L T H P R O J E C T
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Health, Nutrition and Fertility Status
1.        Over the past  two  decades,  substantial  improvements  have been
achieved in the health sector, and most Turkish health indicators are now at
a  level  conparable   with   those   of   other   middle-income  countries.
Nevertheless, striking inequalities in health and nutritional status,
fertility levels, and access to basic health care persist between and within
regions, between cities and rural and periurban areas, between Western and
Eastern provinces, and between educational levels and income groups. Large
segments of the population still suffer from surprisingly high infant and
child mortality rates, persistent infectious diseases, malnutrition, and
relatively high levels of fertility. These are caused and/or compounded by
environmeLtal problems  of pollution,  poor sanitation  and inadequate water
supply, especially in periurban areas.
Population
2.        Turkey has  a population of about 54.6 million', or 70 persons per
square kilometer; 53% of this population is defined as urban. The extensive
internal migration of the last two decades, which originated largely from
the northern and eastern provinces, has resulted in much higher densities
and urbanization rates in the western part of the country. The rural-urban
flow involved close to 3 million  persons  and    has  considerably worsened
living conditions in periurban areas. The natural rate of growth averaged
2.4% p.a. during the 1965-1980 period and 2.5% in the early 1980s; it is
projected at 1.9% for the 1985-2000 period, in spite of recent declines in
external migration2; this would yield a total population of about 67 million
by the end of the century. It is also projected that the net reproduction
rate of 1 would only be reached by the year 2010 while the hypothetical size
of the stationary population is put at 112 millions. The aging process of
the population is illustrated by the proportion of cnildren below fifteen,
which declined from 40.8% to 37.5% between 1973 and 1983.
3.        Life expectancy at birth is 62 years for males and 67 for females
compared to 52 and 55 years respectively in 1965; this means that rising
chronic degenerative diseases will be reflected in increaeing demand for
I Based on the October 1985 Census figure of 50,664,000 and a growth
rate of 2.5% p.a.

higher cost  tertiary care.   Mortality and fertility declined substantially
during the past two decades [by 41% and 27%], but progress was much slower
for infant  mortality.  The  crude death  rate now stands at 8 per thousand.
The crude birth rate fell from 41 to 29 per thousand between  1965 and 1986,
i.e. below the average for middle-income countries; however, it is still
twice as high as current rates in industrialized countries [13 per thousand
on the average]. The total fertil,-.y rate of 3.7 is again below the average
for middle-income countries, but saustantialiy higher than in industrialized
economies [1.7 in western countries and 2.5 in eastern European countries).
Health
4.        Improvements in  the health  status of  the Turkish population are
evidenced by the sharp increase in  life  expectancy.   However,  at  79 per
thousand [152  in 1965],  the infant morta I ity rate is substantially higher
than  in  industrialized  countries   [6-11   per   thousand).       Perinatal
complications account for half of the reported cases of infant mortality;
the second cause of infant deaths is pneumonia [18%], followed by diarrheal
diseases [8%], and other infectious diseases [5%]. Regional variations are
striking, reflecting, among other things, high fertility, low levels of
prenatal care,  improper delivery  and feeding  practices, and environmental
factors; they are also the consequence of unequal access to health services,
often linked  with reluctance  to use them.  The chi7d morta7ity rate [9 per
thousand, compared to 35 in 1965] is at the level of other middle-income
countries, but again much higher than in industrialized countries [less than
1 per  thousand].   The  major  causes  of  child  mortality  are pneumonia,
infectious  diseases,   accidents,  diarrhea  and  malformations;  diarrheal
diseases actually cause as many deaths each year as the vaccine preventable
diseases of  childhood.  Underlying causes include inconplete immunizations,
crowded housing,  adverse environment,  poor water  supply and malnutrition.
The high mortality by pneumonia and acute respiratory infections among
infants and children calls for increased attention, in health education
programs, to the effects of passive smoking.
5.        The causes  of adult nvrtaIity are  not well  known as data refer
mainly to recorded cases in urban areas. Major causes of adult death are
pneumonia, bronchitis,  emphysema, asthma  and malignant  neoplasm.  For the
population aged 45 and above, coronary diseases account for 40% of deaths;
they  are  followed  by  malignant tumors [12%] and cerebrovascular diseases
[8%); as many as 20% of cases are recorded as ill-defined, while  the number
of  coronary  diseases  seems  overestimated.   At  any  rate,  mortality by
cardiovascular diseases, and the high incidence of lung cancer among adult
males are direct consequences of very high levels of tobacco consunption. A
most striking feature is the very high rate of materna7 mortality, estimated
at 207  per 100,000  live births.   In some districts of the Eastern part of
the country, only 3% of deliveries take place in hospitals, a rate that,
even if  well targeted,  could not cover even the most severe oomplications.
In some areas, maternal mortality is probably as high as 250, reflecting
inadequate obstetrical care, short intervals between births, and high
incidence of abortions performed under unsanitary conditions.



- 5 -
6.        Identified  leading  causes  of  infant  morbidity  are  measles,
diarrhea, intestinal infections and pneumonia, with malnutrition as. a
contributing factor. As regards adult morbidity, highest incidence refers to
acute respiratory problems, diseases of genito-urinary system, gastr-o-
enteritis and diarrheal diseases.   Infectious and  parasitic diseases, sach
as rabies, leprosy, trachoma and syphilis, have been largely controlled.
Others, like hepatiLis, typhoid, hydatidosis, are increasing in spite of
active control programs.
7.        M0H  caiducted  in  February  1988, w4th the participation of WHO,
USAID  and  UNICEF  specialist-s,  a  review  of the   Expanded  Prog-amn  o-
Irmunization and the Program for the Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases. The
sanple  survey,  confirmed  the   major  gains   achieved  since   the  1985
immunization canpaign: 87% of children aged 12-23 months had received BOG
vaccination; 67% were immunized against measles and 86% had received three
doses of Polio-DPT vaccines. To illustrate this progress, it will be noted
that only 12% of infants [0-12 months] were immunized against measles before
1985.  Nevertheless, the proportion of fully immunized children is less than
optimal, and the protection of newborns from neonatal tetanus through
mothers'  imuunization  is  still  so  low  that its assessment could not be
included in the survey.
Nutrition
8.        The nation's food supplies  provide a  generous 3218  calories per
person/day,  and  the  population  continues  to  be  well  fed.    However,
malnutrition of specific segments of population is a cause of concern. In
1982, a Survey on Food Consumption and Nutrition showed that malnutrition is
correlated with education, cultural factors and family and cooking habits,
rather than income, food availability or distribution factors. The basic
assunption is that recent declines in income levels have not, so far,
affected the nutritional status of the population; nevertheless, close
monitoring of consumption will be required over the coming years.
9.        Malnutrition is the major contributing factor to infant mortality;
it also affects about a third of pregnant women. But malnutrition does not
appear in easily identifiable pockets, groups or geographic regions. The
newly urbanized population in the larger cities is probably the one that
suffers most from malnutrition as it is most affected by unemployment, low
earnings,  and  new  eating  habits.    As  can  be expected, severe calorie
malnutrition is concentrated in lower inoome groups and affects 25% of the
families in the bottom 20% of households, against 8% in the top income
bracket. In 40% of the families in the lowest income bracket, per capita
daily consumption  of animal  proteins is less than  f;  >esirable average of
10 gr, against 3% for the highest income group. So far, lower income groups
have adapted to inflation by replacing high priced foods by low cost ones of
equal nutritional value. However, the lower consumption of animal proteins
signals a possible deterioration of consumption patterns. The Government
has no established policy for food and nutrition coordination.



-6-
Fertility
10.       Progress in  contraception, rise  in age  of marriage, modernizing
influences of education, urbanization and high levels of external migration
have led to steady declines in fertility. Overall indicators are conparable
to those of other middle income countries, but hide striking regional
disparities.    Iow  fertility  rates  and  high  levels   of  contraceptive
prevalence in netropolitan areas coexist with high fertility rates in the
rest of t.he country where lower educational levels and cultura, and
religious factors are an obstacle to rapid response to family planning
programs. Turkey is a secular state, but is also a Muslim country and, as
such, has  not remained unaffected by events which are presently shaking the
Islamic world.  But high levels  of  female  literacy  and  participation in
economic activity are essential determinants for continuing fertility
reduction.
11.       The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated at  3.7 in  1986.  In
1983, Hacettepe   University  conducted   the  fourth  nation-wide  Turkish
Population and Health Survey3 which showed a TFR of 4.05 children per woman,
down from 4.61 in 1974.  The TFR was 3.17 in urban areas, compared with 5.08
in rural areas; regional variations were even more pronounced.  But the most
outstanding differences related to educational levels: illiterate women aged
45-49 had on average  6.9 ever-born  children, conpared  with 2.68  for high
school graduates  of the  same age group. The survey also revealed that more
than 90% of ever-married women had heard of contraception and knew of a
modern method.   Knowledge of specific methods was higher in urban areas; it
was also strongly correlated with  educational  attainment.    About  71% of
ever-married  women  had  used  contraception.    The  overall contraceptive
prevalence rate for women currently at risk was 62% [50% in 1978]; but only
44% were using a modern method (36% in 1978]. Urban and western provinces
show higher prevalence rates and wider use of modern contraceptive methods.
A major finding of the Survey was that, since 1978, the downward trend in
fertility had slowed down as "regional differentials, especially between the
East and  the West are widening i, such a way that a dual structure in terms
of population dynamics becomes more and more apparent".
12.       MOH statistics show a  steady  increase  in  family  planning: the
nunber of couples receiving services increased from 598,000 to 880,000
between 1983 and 1986. However, this still represented only 8% of eligible
couples and a large unmet need for family planning services persists. The
1983 survey confirmed that smaller families are generally desired, with the
same strong disparities between the East and the West, and between urban and
rural areas. This is an important indicator of future fertility trends.
The inadequacy of services and shortfalls in contraceptives supply are best
illustrated by continuing high levels of induced abortion which was
legalized in  May 1983.   Because  of early marriage and rapid attainment of
reproductive ideals, abortions start rather early in reproductive life;
3 '1983 Turkish Population and Health Survey", Hacettepe University,
Institute of Population Studies, Ankara, 1987.



- 7 -
ignorance of modern contraceptive methods in rural areas, and widely used
inefficient contraceptive methods, provide another explanation for the high
numbers of induced abortions. The 1983 survey showed that abortion was
still widely practiced in Turkey: 37% of ever-married women had at least one
abortion and the current national abortion ratio was estimated at 26 per 100
live births; 12% of pregnancies were terminated by induced abortions, 8% by
spontaneous abortions and 1% by still births; there were, again, marked
regional  variations.    But  e'ortions  still often take place under unsafe
conditions: in 1986, only 58,400 abortions were performed in MOH facilities,
i.e. one  third of  the total.   Tubal  ligations were only 3,033 and mostly
post-partum.
Envirorvnental Factors
13.       Deteriorating environmental  conditions  have  increased morbidity
associated  with  water  and  air  borne  diseases.   In  rural  areas, most
communities do not have piped water and rely on wells, public fountains or
springs. Sewers rarely exist, and liquid and solid waste disposal systems
are primitive. In urban areas, sewage collection and disposal constitute
the  nost  severe  problem  in  terms  of  unmet  needs, followed by garbage
collection and  disposal,  particularly  in  the  peripheral  areas.   Sewer
systems serve only 18% of the urban population. Only 42% of municipalities
with more than 3,000 inhabitants have a fully modernized water supply and
distribution  system.    Although  housing  conditions  continue to inprove,
overcrowding still affects most urban areas.
14.       High levels of occupational  diseases and  accidents are generated
by rapid industrialization; these are even higher in smaller enterprises and
family shops where unsaFe and unhealthy working conditions prevail. In 1986
for example, statistics of the Social Insurance Organization show that,
among the 2.8 million insured workers, there were about 151,000 cases of
serious work-related accidents or occupational diseases, resulting in 2,625
cases of permanent disability and more than 1300 deaths; this situation is
said to  have only  marginally improved.   Finally, Municipalities carry the
entire burden for enforcement of food quality control, with limited success
because  of   scarce  technical  and  financial  resources.    Moreover,  as
responsibility for design and supervision of this activity is diluted under
six different ministries, regulations in this area are not effectively
enforced.
B. Sector Organization
15.       The health sector  is  notable  for  its  conplexity  and  lack of
coordination between largely autonomous public and private organizations.
There are more than thirty providers of health services in the public sector
alone:  the  Ministry  of  Health  [MOH],  twenty one independent university
hospitals, the Social Insurance Organization [SIO], the Army, and other
ministries  and  public  organizations.    Moreover,  there is a very active
private sector which, in addition to for-profit facilities, includes many
foundations, religious groups and foreign conm.nities which operate their



-- 8 -
own facilities. Although MOH is formally responsible for the design and
implementation of the country's health policy, its authority over these
service providers remains rather limited.
The Ministry of Health
16.       At the central  level,  the  Minister  is assisted  by  an Under-
Secretary and  three Deputy Under-Secretaries [see Chart I].   There are six
General Directorates and eight  central  units.    General  Directorates and
units are  subdivided into  a large  number of  services.   For exanple, the
General Directorate for Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning
[GDMCHFP] has three Deputy General Directors, five Departments, and 14
sections with a total of about 100 staff. Vertical programs such as TB and
malaria control have survived the creation of the General Directorate for
Primary Health Care [GDPHC]. Moreover, two units still share responsibility
in matters of MCH/FP: the GDMCHFP in charge of population education and
which oversees service delivery, and the GDPHC which carries out the program
of integrated health services. At the provincial level the Health Director
is the senior health official, formally responsible for the delivery and
coordination of  all public  health services.   However, all funds come from
Ankara where are also taken all major decisions regarding health personnel
and  investments;  on  the  other  hand,  the  Health  Director is under the
authority of the Governor,  the highest  ranking Government  official in the
province.   In reality,  as budget allocations for each entity are separate,
each General Directorate in rAnkara operates its own program through its
provincial structure.
17.       MOH's present  organizational structure  is the  outcome of a long
historical evolution and pragmatic compromise. Formal lines of authority are
unclear, high level managerial positions are almost exclusively held by male
physicians, and practically none of them received formal training in
management  or  public  ackninistration.    The  continuity of the ministry's
operations is affected by frequent changes of minister and senior staff.
The weaknesses of the civil service in the health sector have long been
identified, but reforms have been hampered by passive resistance or open
opposition from officials concerned or special interest groups. The sector's
effectiveness is also affected by personnel management issues, many of which
are  beyond   MOH's  control.    The  country's  highly  centralized  public
administration system, with minimal delegation of authority, also affects
health services management. Provincial health directors, hospital managers
and all university trained health staff are appointed by the  Minister.  MOH
and SIO regulations stipulate that the hospital manager must be a physician,
and the Minister makes his selection among the hospital specialists.
Management experience or ability to manage is not a major criterium in the
selection of managers.
18.       A striking fact is  the  weakness  of  the  Ministry's information
system due to the absence, in the organizational structure, of a statistics
unit responsible for centralization, processing, analysis and feed-back of
epidemiological  and  management  data.    The  need to inprove the internal
information systems, not just to support a more efficient management of



institutional resources, but also to facilitate the provision of services
and the collection of statistics is now well recognized.   A Data Processing
Unit has been formed in the past year which, in spite of its relatively
small size and recent formation, has already made substantial progress in
the development of a personnel system and the definition of four small
systems to control vehicles, construction, personnel, and patient referral
in the  ten project  provinces.   Only a handful of microconputers have been
introduced in the Ministry, but considerable experience was gained in the
Project Coordination Unit during project preparation.
19.       MOH  provides  free  preventive  care  for  the  whole population;
curative services must be paid for, but fees are waived  for indigents.   In
1961, the  Government introduced  an Integrated Health Service Scheme [IHSS]
designed to unify under  the  same  delivery  systr-,   .   services formerly
provided by separate agencies, and increase coverage in rural areas. But
the ambitious goal set in 1963 to extend the new system to the whole country
was never  fully achieved.   The  IHSS includes  five levels,  the first two
providing primary care services; in principle, it operates as follows:
a.   at the first level, hea1th posts serve an  average of 2,000-2,500
population; they are staffed with a village midwife who works
generally alone; health posts are visited at least once a week by
a mobile team based in the health center;
b.  at the  second level,  the health center is the cornerstone of the
system; it serves  10-20,000  persons  in  scattered  areas, while
large [urban] centers serve 20-50,000 persons; each health center
is expected to cover at least 3 health posts through its mobile
teams, although the shortage of vehicles limits considerably
outreach activities;
c.   the t'-ird level consists of a district hospital with 50-100 beds,
staffed with four doctors [internist, pediatrician, OB-GYN and
surgeon], one dentist and three technicians; each local hospital
serves 5-6 health centers;
d.   at  the  fourth  level,  the  general regional  hospital serves a
population of 200-400,000 persons, as a referral facility for
20-40 health centers;
e.   finally, at  the highest  level of  the system are to be found the
national spec ia l ized hosp ita Is and teach ing hosp ita 7s.
20.       Primary health care shares  most of  the problems  of other health
services.   These are compounded by acute manpower shortages at the outreach
level, and about two thirds of health posts are not properly staffed.
Although 85% of health centers are manned by an MD, this is often an
inexperienced physician performing his or her ccmpulsory medical service,
under limited supervision; many MDs are actively involved in private
practice after hours and therefore neglect outreach activities.   Inconplete
integration  of  activities  raises  other  operational  problems.   Lack of



- 10 -
vehicles affects dramatically the efficiency of outreach services.   Medical
equipment, especially in health centers, is insufficient and obsolete.
Public facilities provide only very basic or emergency drugs and deliver
prescriptions for the rest; however, as there are no pharmacies in rural
areas, people tend to bypass the first or  second levels.   Finally,  as PHC
services do not charge fees, they cannot supplement their recurrent budget
allocations and frequent shortages of fuel, drugs or supplies paralyze their
activities.
21.       As  regards  popu7ation,  the  1982 Constitution mentioned for the
first time in a legal document the term "family planning". The May 1983 Law
on Population Planning set forth the principles of population planning,
defined the terms  termination  of  pregnancy,  sterilization  and emergency
situation requiring medical intervention, and regulated matters concerning
the procurement, manufacture and official recognition of contraceptive drugs
and devices. Abortion under 10 weeks of pregnancy was authorized for social
or economic reasons; over 10 weeks abortion was authorized for medical
reasons only; sterilization was no longer subject to medical justification,
and paramedical personnel were authorized to provide FP services, including
IUD  insertion.   MOH  was  given  the  responsibility  to coordinate all FP
services delivered by the various providers, and the President himself has,
on  many   occasions,  publicly   stated  his  support  to  family  planning
activities. Family planning services are available in most health centers
and hospital outpatient services; moreover, the GDMCHFP operates 600
clinics, 95 dispensaries and 20 independent facilities in periurban areas.
The Turkish Family Planning Association created in 1963 has 19 branches
providing supplies and education materials. The Turkish Family Health and
Planning Foundation, a private institution financed by contributions from
the industry, was created in 1985.   The  military, the  Turkish Development
Foundation, labor unions, the Railways Corporation, the Post Office, and
insurance companies also inplement their own programs. The private sector
remains the main provider of services in urban areas. But in rural areas,
where full health coverage has not yet been achieved, the absence of
services, supplies and promotional activity is clearly reflected in higher
fertility levels, infant mortality and abortions.
22.      AWintenance of buildings, equipment and vehicles  is remarkable by
any standard.   Hospitals' mechanical and electrical engineers are backed up
by seven Regional Maintenance Centers that carry out, with more ingenuity
than resources, impressive repairs that would not be undertaken in less
cost-conscious countries. Yet, declining maintenance budgets generate a
growing backlog of overdue operations; at least 20% of facilities and
equipment are  already totally  obsolete.   Finally, construction managewent
follows rigid procedures, and responsibility for construction lies with the
Ministry of Public Works. However, low government salaries do not permit
recruitment and retention of highly qualified architects and engineers;
limited expertise in design and in construction supervision of health
facilities   partially   explains   inefficient   design  of  oversized  and
dysfunctional buildings. Moreover, management practices result in excessive
delays, with hospitals taking 10 years or more to be completed. Design
parameters also have a  crucial inportance.   It  is customary  in Turkey to



- 11 -
provide housing for staff, usually nurses, within the health facilities.
This  practice  greatly  increases   the   surface   requirements   for  all
constructions of health posts and health centers. In contrast, the Higher
Education Council has set more modest standards for university hospitals.
Social Insurance Institutions
23.       Medical coverage of the  population  is  provided  under  a system
characterized by the juxtaposition of general and occupational schemes,
which include short-term as well as long-term insurance programs. Overall,
30.4 million persons or 58% of the Turkish population are partly or fully
covered under a health insurance scheme [Table I.5].
24.       Civi7 servants receive free medical carc for themselves  and their
dependents.    There  are  currently about 1.5 million government employees,
with 4.4  million  dependents.    The  budget  of  each  ministry  or public
institution includes earmarked funds to cover these health benefits. The
Government Enp7oyees Retirement Fund provides free curative care for some
650,000 pensioners and their dependents.
25.       The Social Insurance Organization [SIO] has the status of a state
economic enterprise.  It provides pre-paid short-term medical  and maternity
benefits, employment related accident and occupational disease benefits, and
long-term benefits for old-age, disability and survivors pensions; however,
family and unemployment benefits are excluded. SIO covers all employed
persons, with the exception of civil servants, the military, and domestic
servants. It operates 83 hospitals in 44 of the 67 provinces. The SIO also
negotiates contracts with private or public institutions, generally for
outpatient care, or for inpatient care in areas where it does not operate
its own hospital. In the case of MOH facilities, this constitutes an
indirect subsidy, as current fees in public facilities are well below real
operating costs of SIO hospitals. The SIO has more than 2.8 million insured
workers, with a very large majority of males, and a substantial number of
employees from public enterprises. When dependents and retirees and their
dependents are added, the L.utal number of persons covered by the SIO reaches
14.5 million, or more than one fourth of the Turkish population.
26.       The Socia7 Insurance  Agency  for  Merchants,  Artisans  and Self-
Enployed [BAG-KUR] was created in 1972 to provide coverage for these above
categories of workers, including farmers, on  a compulsory  and contributory
basis.    Until  1987  it  provided only long-term benefits; it now collects
additional contributions from its members to gradually include health risks,
eventually at the same level as SIO. BAG-KUR covers more than 9.5 million
persons, i.e. 1.8 active members and their 6.7 million dependents, and about
1 million retirees and their dependents.
27.       Whet, the various insurance schemes were regrouped under the SIO in
1964, a few private funds were authorized to continue their operations.
They include some 26 funds for employees of banks, insurance companies,
chambers of commerce and industry or  about 280,000  beneficiaries.  Primary



- 12 -
school teachers and Post Office personnel have also retained their Mutual
Assistance Fund, as have the coal mine workers.
University Hospitals
28.       Medical Schools assume three  functions in the health  sector: as
research institutions, training facilities for high level health personnel,
and as direct providers of health services. Ov-- .ll policy and coordination
takes place through the Higher Education Council (Y6K]. There are 22
medical schools, with an annual intake of 5,400 students, where the rapid
expansion has been accompanied by a decline in academic standards. The
number of graduates was 2,450 in 1987 and is projected at 5,000 for 1989.
29.       As service providers, university hospitals, especially  the oldest
ones, play a very important role in supplying curative care; many of them
actually serve more as medical than  teaching facilities.   Demand for tneir
services is very high as it is believed that these are of higher quality,
and this is largely true since they are mrore receptive to new knowledge and
technology, and have more resources to invest in equipment and materials.
However, like most Turkish hospitals, they are affected by inefficient
management, as  they are  directed by  prestigious physicians, appointed for
four years, with limited training or interest in ackdinistrative matters.
C. Sector Resources
Health personnel
30.       Turkey  has  about   37,100   physicians,   i.e.   16,400  general
practitioners and 20,700 specialists; 42% of physicians work as private
practitioners. There are about 8,400 dentists and 12,900 pharmacists, all
heavily  concentrated  in  urban  areas [Yable I.4].  MOH's payroll includes
12,800 physicians, 1,100 dentists and as many pharmacists.   Medical schools
and university hospitals enploy 3,800 physicians, and the SIO as many as
3,900. The oversupply of specialists explains the high rate of vacancies in
generalists positions in public hospitals, as well as the difficulty faced
by  MOH  in  extending  health  coverage  in  the  provinces.   The system's
effectiveness is also affected by the imbalance between the numbers of
higher level personnel and paramedics, as the number of nurses is in the
same range as the number of doctors.
31.       The country  has more  than 63,000  paramedicais, or about one per
864 population; most of them work  for MOH  [23,300 nurses,  17,500 midwives
and 8,400 technicians]. Nurses and nurse aides are largely concentrated in
hospitals, while most of the trained midwives a c. assigned to rural areas.
The midwife is the backbone of the rural health care system since she is
often the only resource at  the  village  level;  but  their  number  is not
sufficient to  cover the  36,000 villages.  The rapid increase in the number
of graduates at all levels was not accompanied  by parallel  progress in the
quality of training; as regards nurses, this is aggravated by low morale,



- 13 -
insufficient motivation, low salaries, and often the negative attitude of
nurses towards their profession.
32.       Higher education  and training  of health personnel is provided by
22 medical schools, 8 schools of dentistry, 7 schools of pharmacy and 6
schools for nurses and health technicians attached to the universities.
Nominal fees were introduced at the  higher  level  in  1984.    Since 1981,
medical graduates must serve two years in public health facilities.
Universities also train health personnel in specialized fields, such as
physiotherapy, rehabilitation, health administration, health technology, and
nuitrition. Until the early 1980s, MOH operated two higher level schools
%wiich were transferred to Hacettepe University: the School of Social Work,
End  the  School  of  Health  Administration  where  are   trained  hospital
administrators.    The  fate  of  MOH's Institute of Health Education, which
trains teachers of the nursing colleges, is uncertain, and a critical
evaluation by independent consultants has been reconmended.
33.       Paramedica7  training  is  provided  in  84 vocational schools for
nurses, midwives and health technicians, 78 of which, with a total capacity
of  16,300  students  and  4,800  graduates  in  1987,  are run by MOH.  The
entrance level is completion of the first cycle of secondary education and
training lasts four years.
Infrastructure
34.       The number  of health  facilities providing outpatient care is not
well known as private practitioners cover a considerable, albeit not well
documented, share of outpatient services, and all hospitals also provide
outpatient care.  For its part, MOH  operates an  extensive network  of more
than 13,000 facilities consisting of 10,000 health posts, 3,100 rural health
centers, 200 MCH/rP centers and 250 TB dispensaries [Table I.2]. There are
about 9,000 privatel; owned pharmacies.
35.       As regards  inpatient care,  there are  756 health facilities with
more than 111,000 beds4. Most of these beds belong to the three major care
providers, namely MOH [59%), the SIO [17%] and the Universities [16%]; the
remaining is distributed among State Economic Enterprises, other ministries,
large municipalities, minority and religious groups, and the private for-
profit sector  [less  than  3%].   Overall,  Turkey  has  2  beds  per 1,000
population, a relatively favorable ratio compared with other middle-income
countries.  However,  there  are   wide  geographical   differences  in  the
bed/population ratio [4.4 in Istanbul, against 0.3 in Agri and Hakkari
provinces].
36.       For the sector as  a  whole,  the  average  of  48  admissions per
thousand population is relatively low by international standards [for middle
income countries this ratio is in the 70-90 rangel. Occupancy rates vary
widely, but  are generally  low: 56%  for MOH, 53% for University hospitals,
4 Excluding 42 military hospitals with about 15,900 beds.



- 14 -
and 70% for SI0.   Average lengths  of stay  [ALOS] are  generally high, and
variations are quite marked for all providers; MOH and SIO hospitals, which
account for 85% of all hospitalizations, have an ALOS of 6.5 and 7.4
respectively; in University hospitals, ALOS are in the 6.7-13.8 range, with
an average of 9.8 days [Table  I.3].   The  seriousness  of  the  problem is
recognized, and a study has been reconmended to identify the causes of
inefficient utilization of public hospitals and suggest remedial actions.
Health Expenditure
37.       Not much attention  has  been  paid  so  far  to  health  costs of
outpatient care.   As for inpatient care, estimates of expenses per patient-
day and per bed, show wide differences linked to the nature of the
institution  and  variations  in  occupancy  rates.   But costs are very low
compared to other middle income countries. Personnel expenditures represent
more than 70% of expenses in general hospitals, against 40-50% in teaching
hospitals and around 40% in specialized institutions. User fees cover only
5-12% of total expenses in general hospitals, 13-19% in teaching hospitals,
and as much as 30-35% in specialized surgery  facilities.   While preventive
care is provided free, curative services must be paid for, except by
individuals recognized as indigents. However, cost recovery in the public
sector is only partial and adjustments hardly keep pace with inflation. User
charges represented 8.1% of MOH's budget in 1986 [against 3.3% in 1981 and
an estimated 6.2% in 1987]. Because of the low quality and limited services
provided to the population, fees are rarely collected below the general
hospital  level.    Experience  shows,  nevertheless, that the population is
willing to pay for better care and that health centers and district
hospitals which collect user charges and provide adequate services are
attracting larger number of patients.
38.       Total expenditures on health represent about 3.5% of the country's
GNP; this ratio is below the 4% or more found in other middle income
countries or in Latin America. They amount to less than US$40 per capita.
Private expenditures represent 58% of the total.   MOH expenditures  in 1987
exceeded TL360 billion [US$420 million]; this includes about 90% of
operating expenditures; for that year, the ministry's outlays represented
2.6% of total government expenditures [compared with 10.8% for public
education].   The share  of MOH in government's budget declined from 4.1% in
1979 to 2.3% in 1986. In real terms, total MOH's expenditures declined by
25% between 1981 and 1986 while total government budget increased by about
15%.  MOH budget now represents only  24%  of  what  the  country  spends on
public education.   These trends explain the deterioration in the quality of
public  health  services,  especially  at  the   outreach  level,   and  the
disparities in health status mentioned above. The Government has taken new
steps to correct the situation and raised MCH's budget by 19% in real terms
in 1987 [Table I.6]. The Extra-Budgetary Fund for Health and Education,
created in March 1988, will eventually finance part of MOH's current
expenditure; but it is not yet possible to estimate the resources it will
generate.



- 15 -
D. Sector Development Strategy
39.       The Government is pursuing a determined policy to  restructure and
liberalize its economy and promote the privatization of activities which the
private sector can handle more efficiently. However, this would not perm,it
the Government to extricate itself from the provision of basic health
services, as the State should retain  its primary  responsibility in matters
of preventive care, containment of conmmnicable diseases, provision of
emergency services and ensuring access to basic health services by the poor.
It is also in the national interest to support programs to improve health
and nutrition standards, and to achieve fertility rates conpatible with the
country's resources anid development prospects. Moreover, sustained public
expenditures are needed to lay the foundations for a more efficient and
equitable health system.
40.       The  fundamental  objectives  of  the  sector  are: [i] to redress
existing inequaliLles in health status, by improving access to basic health
services of underprivileged populations; and [ii] to raise overall health
indicators to a level more compatible with the country's educational and
income levels, development potential and political aspirations.  A rea7istic
goa7 would be to bring the country to par with other South-European regions
before the  end of  the century.   This  objective is within reach, provided
adequate steps are taken to strengthen institutions, starting with MOH, and
sufficient financial resources can be mobilized.
41.       The major  constraints to be overcome to achieve such an objective
relate to:
a.   management and organizational  issues which  reflect  an obsolete
structure, prolonged isolation, and consequent lack of exposure to
advances  elsewhere;  and  a  very  centralized  and  hierarchical
approach  to  health  services  management  at  all  levels of the
delivery system;
b.   personnel  management,  and   in  particular   inadequate  career
development prospects, and shortages in certain categories of
skilled personnel, compounded by deficient deployment of staff;
c.   the weakness of the statistical reporting system;
d.   limited, and for many years declining, financial resources;
e.   inconplete integration of basic health care, resulting in frequent
duplication of services and wastage of resources; and finally,
f.   an acute  shortage of modern medical and laboratory equipmert, and
vehicles at all levels of the public health sector, only partly
offset by remarkable maintenance standards.

E. World Bank Support to the Health Sector
42.       The  'Vorld  Bank  has  only  recently  been  associated  with  the
development of Turkey's health sector. Its involvement in this area started
in mid-1985 with the participation of the PHN Department in the second
Public Investnent Review. The review focussed on projects planned, or under
iffplementation, by MOH, YoK and SIO; it presented a critical evaluation of
the investment planning process, and analyzed the consequences of current
procedures on the effectiveness of public capital expenditure in a context
of  high  inflation  and  worsening  budgetary  situation.    The Government
subsequently agreed to a Hea7th Sector Review by the Bank, which took place
in October 1985. Its conclusions and recommendations5, which were largely
accepted by  the Government, were centered  around six themes: [i] sectoral
ooordination; [ii] the investment planning process; [iii] the integration of
health  services,  especially  family  planning  and  inwunization; riv] the
utilization of existing hospital capacity; [v] the level and structure of
user charges; and (vi] the financial foundation of the social security
system.    Priority  areas  for  applied  studies  and  research  were  also
identified. The discussions which followed led the Government to seek World
Bank support for this sector for the first time.
43.       The Government recognizes that the sector  has lagged behind and,
as its aspiration to join the European Eoonomic Community has given new
impetus to its social policiF,, it has repeatedly emphasized the priority to
be given to public health. The Bank has been responsive to Government's new
drive in the health sector. Through this operation, the Bank will support a
three-pronged strategy aimed at: [i] improving the lot of those who still
lack access to basic health services; [ii] improving cost-effectiveness; and
(iii] strengthening the sector's institutions. The Bank's policy dialogue,
as well as technical and financial supporti, could gradually be extended to
other leading institutions in the sector to improve, for example, management
information systems, hospital equipment and utilization, extension of social
security coverage, and medical and paramedical training.
Project Preparation
44.            To  prepare   the  project,   the  Government  established  a
Technical Advisory Comittee cocmposed of senior MOH, SPO and Treasury
officials, and a national Working Group headed by a Project Coordinator. In
each province, a Coordinator was also appointed to lead the provincial
preparation team.   Provinces  assembled standard  documentation and drafted
initial proposals based on guidelines prepared by the central group,
assisted by  Bank missions.   Three workshops, attended by Bank staff, were
organized for the provincial coordinators at critical stages of the
preparation process.   To  provide technical and financial support to MOH in
the preparation process, the Bank agreed to a Project Preparation Facility
of US$600,000. This was intended to finance the organization of the three
5 See  "Turkey:  Health  Sector   Revlew",  Report   No.6089-TU,  dated
September 19, 1986.



- 17 -
workshops, consultant services, conputers and office equipment, vehicles,
and crucial pre-project activities such as training of key personnel,
revision of curricula, equipment lists, bidding documents, etc. However,
because of lengthy adcinistrative procedures in the Ministry of Finance,
these funds became available only during the last phase of the preparation
process.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Objectives
45.       The Integrated  Health Service  Scheme [IHSSJ,  designed to expand
health coverage in rural areas through the integration of basic services,
was created by a 1961 Law referred to as "socialization".   It  was expected
to) cover  the whole  country in  fifteen years, but this ambitious objective
was never  achieved.   Until the  mid-1980s, public  health policy consisted
mainly of building hospitals; this left inadequate funds for equipment,
vehicles or major repairs, and only marginal resources for outreach
services.    Salaries  absorbed  most  of  the operating budgets, leading to
critical shortages of drugs, supplies and fuel, and a general decay of
public health services. To illustrate this point, it may be noted that, by
1980, less than 30% of Turkish children were fully immunized.  Nevertheless,
the institutional or legal setting needed to revanp the public health sector
generally exists in Turkey.    First,  the  IHSS  is  a  viable  health care
delivery  system  which  can  be  readily  inplemented.    Second, some cost
recovery is already applied in the public health  sector.   Third, Turkey is
one of the few countries where medical graduates must, and actually do,
serve in the public sector, including in rural health centers.   Fourth, the
personnel  assignment   policy  brings   midwives  to  remote  rural  areas.
Evidently, the system does not always operate efficiently, but there are no
obstacles that cannot be overcome with political will, popular support, and
adequate financial resources.
46.       The project therefore  aims  to  set-up  a  partly self-sufficient
public health system capable of providing quality services to an increasing
number of patients. While collecting user charges, it would be expected to
deliver free preventive services for all, and waive charges for indigents.
It was agreed with the Government that this project will cover the whole
public health system in 10 out of 67 provinces. Four criteria were used for
their selection: [i) basic health indicators about or below national
average; (ii] presence of a strong and motivated technical team; [iii] year-
round accessibility; and [iv] community and political support. The location
of  these   provinces  is  shown  in  the  attached  map  and  their  major
characteristics are  presented in  Annex I.   The  experience gained through
these provinces and their technical teams would be crucial for subsequent
phases of rehabilitation of the public health system.
47.       The project has three nmjor  objectives:  [i]  inprove  the health
status of about 10% of the country's population; [ii] initiate measures to
enhance cost effectiveness and improve financing prospects for the sector;
and [iii] institution building, to strengthen MOH's management capability



- 18 -
and set the stage for further interventions designed to address crucial
issues affecting the sector.
48.       No adverse impact on the environment is expected from the project.
B. Project Description
49.       The proposed project consists of two major conponents:
a.   Reorganization and  Strengthening  of  Provincial  Health Services
(US$134.47 million], in order to:
i.   extend  coverage  and  improve  services  in  ten underserved
provinces6 with a total population of 6.1 million, through
the implementation of 15 health programs, the strengthening
of management, the reorganization of referral procedures, the
upgrading or construction of health facilities, and the
provision of equipment and vehicles;
ii.  achieve a better distribution  of  health  personnel, provide
in-service and induction training for about 6,800 medical and
paramedical staff in the ten provinces, and health education
training for primary school teachers;
b.   Institutional  Development  [US$11.87  million] through three sub-
components:
i.   health manpower  development, focussed  on teachers training,
technical assistance for curriculum revision, local and
overseas   training,   study   tours    and   attendance   at
international meetings;
ii. development of  a Management  Information System, to be first
irrplemented in the ten project provinces; and
iii. support to the central level, through the strengthening of
MCH's  management,   planning,  monitoring  and  supervision
capability,   applied   studies   and   research,   and   the
strengthening of the Project Coordination Unit.
e The ten provinces are: Bilecik [167,000 population), Bolu [519,000),
Diyarbakir (1,006,000], Eskishehir [620,000], Kutahya [563,000], Mardin
[691,000), Mugla [507,000), Sivas [781,000], Tokat [702,000) and Yozgat
[563,000].

C. Detailed Project Features
Provincial Health Services [US$134.47 million]
50.       It is the responsibility of the  public sector  to ensure adequate
curative, preventive and emergency services for the whole population, and to
keep communicable diseases  under  control.    This  component  is therefore
designed to ensure full access to basic health services to 6.1 million
persons living in ten of the country's 67 provinces, and improve their
general health status. About 57% of this population depend entirely on MOH
for curative care, and emphasis will be put on these 3.5 million persons,
including more than 78,000 infants, 577,000 children and more than 820,000
women of reproductive age, who suffer from persistent infectious diseases,
high infant, child and maternal mortality rates and high fertility levels.
Moreover, most of the 2.6 million beneficiaries of the social security
system also turn to MOH facilities for curative care provided for under
their medical benefits and rely entirely on public services for preventive
care.   This nurmber  includes 1.2  million covered by SI0 [which operates 12
hospitals with more that 1600 beds]; 0.8 million covered by BAG-KUR; and 0.6
million covered by GERF.
51.       Under this component, new patterns of health care delivery will be
developed, to be gradually replicated in the rest of the  country.   The key
reform is a move away from a delivery system where the public sector
responds to population's demand for curative services, to a system geared at
anticipating population's preventive and curative care needs. This shift
from a passive attitude in care delivery, to active prevention, detection
and treatment is expected to generate profound changes in the organization
of services, personnel attitude and motivation, and result in a more cost-
effective and  equitable public  health system.   By the end of the project,
quality basic health care would be delivered through an improved and
expanded network of facilities which would include about 2700 health posts,
570 health centers, and 30  district  hospitals.    In  addition, supportive
capacity will be developed in terms of laboratories, medical and dental
equipment, vehicles, etc.
52.       At the same time, the project will support the development of more
decentralized procedures designed to improve cost effectiveness of public
health services in the ten provinces, and ensure fast and appropriate
response to  population needs.   Provincial Directorates will be expected to
exercise increasing autrtority in the management of the referral system.   At
the lower levels, health centers and district hospitals will be given more
responsibility in the acministration of their resources. Project investments
in training, infrastructure and equipment, would substantially improve the
quality of outreach services and permit a more systematic implementation of
existing regulations regarding the collection of user charges. Additional
income generated in district hospitlals and health centers will mostly
benefit the same facilities, and their health posts, thereby improving the
long-term financing prospects of  the  public  health  system.   Alternative
methods of utilization of these funds will be tested under the project,
before their broader adoption.



- 20 -
53.       A large proportion of newly created  positions are  expected to be
filled  through   the  redep7oyment   and  better  utilization  of  existing
personne7. Nevertheless, by the end of the project, about 2,300 additional
staff, i.e. 760 midwives; 670 doctors, nurses and technicians; and 870
support staff and drivers would be assigned to outreach facilities. For the
ten provinces this additional personnel would represent an increase of 31%
over the current staff of 7500.   For  the health  system as  a whole, these
2300 staff  would represent  an addition of 3.6% to MOH's current payroll of
64,400.
54.       Health Programs.   Based  on  their  epidemiological  profiles and
current service statistics, the provinces have adopted 15 health programs,
representing the core of common interventions.  Specific objectives, as well
as criteria for monitoring and impact evaluation, take into account
variations in pathology and  environment.   Because of  the poor  quality of
epidemiological data and service statistics beyond major hospitals, these
objectives will be updated annually, as the data collection system is
improved.   In the  longer term, provincial targets will be derived from the
Management  Information  System  developed  under  the  project  L    Second
Conponent  below].    The  health  programs  and  monitoring  indicators are
presented in Annex II and are targeted at:
a.   maternal care, including:  family  planning,  pre-natal monitoring
and screening, improved midwife assistance for deliveries at home,
risk approach to hospitalization, and improved obstetrical care;
b.   child care, including: post-natal clinics, nutrition surveillance,
control of diarrheal diseases, control of acute respiratory
infections, and school health;
c.   control  of   ccommunicab7e   diseases,   including  immunizations,
tuberculosis, rabies and parasitosis control; finally
d.   improved front line curative care.
55.       Particular attention  will be  paid to  immunizations, to complete
the transition towards a routine activity integrated into the child care
program carried out at the local level; the consolidation of the cold chain
will be essential for this purpose.   The project  will also  strengthen the
program for the control of diarrheal diseases through better detection of
cases of malnutrition and repeated diarrheal episodes, generalization of the
oral rehydration technique, and improved distribution and utilization of ORS
packets. As regards family planning, the project will promote a more
systematic and targeted method of service delivery, as current approaches
are too fragmented, ad-hoc, and lack an evaluation component.   On the other
hand,  much   of  the   contraceptive  practice  is  presently  focussed  on
traditional methods and the use of condoms and, reportedly, use of orals has
remained stagnant, while IUD insertions increased only slightly. The method
mix actually offered will therefore be carefully reviewed in each project
province in order to achieve the most effective protection for those couples
who want  to control  fertility.   Training of  doctors and  midwives in ILUD



- 21 -
insertion will be stepped-up, and the availability of tubal ligation
services will be extended for couples with conpleted fertility.
56.       In-Service Training.  A program  of  continuing  education,  to be
implemented by ten provincial training teams, under the leadership of the
General Directorate for Health Education, will be geared to:
a.   upgrading the skills of existing health personnel: up to the level
of  district  hospitals,  refresher  courses  and  direct training
programs will be organized for all  categories of  personnel, i.e.
about 540  MDs, 490 nurses, 2100 midwives and 1290 other staff; as
for provincial hospitals, the project will provide for training of
the trainers responsible of the continuing education programs
within their facility;
b.   providing induct ion tra in ing for all staff assigned in the project
provinces, either as new entrants in the health sector [about 2300
additional staff ove'r five years] or as a consequence of the high
turnover which affects smaller facilities in particular; and
c.   increasing awareness  of school  teachers and comunity leaders on
health related matters, to generate a more active participation of
the population in the health improvement process.
57.       For each  individual, an average of 25 days of training is planned
over the five-year period. In-service and induction training will focus on
the specific morbidity patterns of the province and, in more general terms,
on preventive care and comuunication methods; training curricula will be
updated with the assistance of consultants provided by the project, which
will also finance health education materials. At the same time, the project
will support mass-media programs in the provinces to educate the population
on family planning, prevention of communicable diseases, environmental
control, etc.   Finally,  basic paramedical training will be improved in the
14 health colleges by increasing teaching staff, curriculum development,
better teacher preparation and strengthening of library and laboratory
facilities. The Government provided assurances during Negotiations that, in
filling current professional teacher vacancies in MOH's health colleges,
priority will be given to the 14 colleges in the project area.
58.       The high mobility of health personnel, especially at the first and
second levels of the referral system, affects continuity and quality of
services. Moreover, it increases substantially in-service and induction
training requirements, and the cost of these programs. This situation can
only partly be remedied.      The high  turnover of  the new  graduate MDs is
unavoidable, as they are assigned in health centers for two years of medical
service; there were 2450 entrants in 1987 [about 30 in health centers of the
ten project provinces) and 5000 are expected in 1989 (60 in health centers
in the ten project provinces]. To reduce mobility of paramedical personnel,
and rural midwives in particular, the 14 health colleges will seek to
increase enrollments of candidates from the project area and encourage
graduates to serve in their provinces upon graduation.



- 22 -
59.       The project will provide for: [i] construction of about 500 health
posts, 27 rural health centers, 33 urban health centers, 4 district
hospitals7,  3   public  health  laboratories,  and  2  vehicle  maintenance
workshops; upgrading or completion of about 520 health posts, 332 health
centers, 30 district hospitals and 14 health colleges; [ii] equipment and
furniture for above facilities; [iii] additional equipment and furniture for
existing health posts [700], health centers [91], district hospitals [29],
provincia    .. : Ls [8],  public  health  laboratories  [9]  and  vehicle
maintenance workshops  [2]; [iv] books and training materials for the health
oolleges; and [v] about 860 vehicles for replacements or additional and
futLre needs, i.e. 80 sedans, 530 four-wheel drives, 120 ambulances, 40
minibus, and 90 pick-ups and trucks.
Institutional Development [US$11.87 million]
60.       This component  aims  at  launching  measures  and  programs that,
starting with MOH, will strengthen the sector's institutions, ensure
efficient use of its resources,  enhance  the    cost  effectiveness  of the
system, and pave the way for the introduction of more reforms. It will
include three parts: [i] a health manpower development program; [ii] a
Management Information System; and [iii] a central level support program.
Overall, the  project  will  provide  for  technical  assistance  [628 m/m],
overseas training  fellowships [476  m/m], study tours [111 m/m equivalent],
and local training [2874 m/m], as well as computing and office equipment for
the central and provincial project teams.
61.       The Health Manpower Development Program is designed to improve the
quality  of  care  and   planning,   stimulate   personal   advancement  and
professional developmant of the health personnel and, in a longer term
perspective, adapt medical and paramedical education to the needs of a
rapidly evolving  system.   This sub-component, estimated at US$5.56 million
will provide for:
a.   teacher training, i.e. 78 m/m of  technical assistance  [local and
foreign] for the revision and adaptation of teacher training
programs; workshops; textbooks, materials, equipment, furniture
for the Gevher Nesibe Institute; and minor repairs [for this
Institute, pending a decision regarding its relocation];
b.   curricu7um deve7opment, i.e. 71 m/m of technical assistance [local
and foreign] for the review and revision of training curricula for
nurses,  midwives  and  technicians,  the  design   of  continuing
education and community programs, and the development of short-
term specialized courses;
7 Schedules of accomTodation for the new constructions have been set at
154 m2  for health  posts, 500  m2 for  rural health centers and 1125 m2 for
urban health centers; they all include housing.   The 50-bed  hosoital has a
total surface of 5,000 m2 and the 100-bed hospital about 7,000 m2.



- 23 -
c.   7oca7  training,  i.e.  1930  m/m  of  training  through  national
institutions of central and provincial public health staff in such
areas as public health administration, hospital administration,
comnunicable  and  infectious   diseases,   MCH/FP,  epidemiology,
environmental management, occupational health, etc.; and
d.   the  acquisition  of  textbooks  and  reference manuaIs for health
colleges, copyrights and translation of new manuals, and the local
printing of training and health education materials;
e.   overseas training,  i.e. 456  m/m of  fellowships in such areas as
epidemiology, statistics, MCH/FP, school health, etc.; the project
will also  provide for  the equivalent  of 111 m/m for study tours
and attendance at international meetings on architecture and
design of health facilities, health needs of the tourism industry,
public  health  nursing,  financing  of  health   systems,  social
security institutions, etc.
62.       A Fellowships  Selection Cormittee  will be  set-up within MOH, to
ensure an impartial award process; chaired by a senior MOH official, it will
include the General Director for Health Education, the Project Coordinator
and a representative of YoK.   Assurances were  obtained during Negotiations
that two-thirds of fellowships will be awarded to health personnel directly
involved in project implementation, and that  upon their  return all efforts
will be made to assign beneficiaries to project-related activities. The
creation of the Fellowships Selection Committee will be a condition of Loan
effectiveness.
63.       The Management  Information System.  The MIS to be developed under
the project [see Annex III for  a detailed  presentation] builds  upon MOH's
current activities in informatics and strikes a balance between the need to
do a planning study before undertaking major investments in informatics, and
the recognition that immediate opportunities and needs exist which can be
exploited and served through the development of microcorrputer-based systems.
It will be composed of eight basic application components namely: a
Statistical Data Base System, a Hospital Administration System, an Equipment
and Vehicles Control System, a Financial Management System, a Personnel
System, a PHC  Management  System,  an  Epidemiology  System,  and  a MCH-FP
Management System.
64.       The  Statistical Data  Base  System, will  receive priority; its
purpose is to maintain up-to-date provincial and central statistical data
bases on all activities of the Ministry. In determining the scope of the
other seven application systems, priority was given to the managerial and
statistical  reporting  aspects,  leaving  other  operational  aspects to be
addressed in subsequent projects. The majority of the data will be provided
by   the   individual   app 7icat ion   systeffs   (PHC,   Personnel,  Hospital
Administration,  etc);  other  data  would  be  collected  directly  through
surveys, special research projects, etc.



- 24 -
65.       Achieving the objectives of the MIS would be a major institutional
challenge for MOH as the number of different activities is large and spans
the six years of the Project. It will be necessary to design a management
environment which relies heavily on external consultants and, at the same
time, make organizational and staffing decisions that ensure continuous and
proper discharge and management of the new functions.
66.       The whole effort will thus require  a large  accompanying training
program.   A training  p7an, by  province and category of personnel, will be
aimed at six categories of personnel: Managers, Section Chiefs, Health
statisticians, Technical staff in the data processing unit, End user
programmers, and Regular system users.
67.       The acquisition  of equipment  and corresponding  software will be
done in phases, to dovetaill with the training and system development
activities.  The project will finance: [i] 375  m/m of  consultant services;
[ii] 20  m/m of overseas training; [iii] 404 m/m of local training; and [iv]
about 260 microcomputers and one central conputer in MOH. The total cost of
this sub-component is estimated at US$4.39 million.
68.       A Steering Coomittee will be created to oversee the development of
the MIS and take all major decisions related to policies, priorities,
budgets  and  programs.    The  Steering Conmittee will also ensure that the
recofmended technology responds to the institutional needs of MOH and is not
primarily  driven  by  technical  considerations.    The Steering Comnittee,
chaired by a national expert designated by the Minister of Health, will
include selected senior MOH managers, specialists and representatives from
YoK, the SI9 and the Middle East Technical  University.   Its Secretary will
be the Head of the Ministry's Research, Planning and Coordination Council.
While the system will be developed by consultants who would also provide for
training services, it will be essential for MOH to recruit a full-time MIS
manager and qualified staff to implement this sub-conponent.  MOH's MIS team
will include about ten staff, i.e. two made available by the Data Processing
Unit, three or four new recruits to be trained as system analysts-conputer
prografmers, and five experienced and fully trained analysts-programmers
recruited from outside. Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that
the MIS team, headed by a specialist and staffed by qualified full-time
members, will operate through the closing date of the Project. The creation
of the MIS Steering Coanittee will be a conditions of Loan effectiveness.
69.       Central  Level  Support  Program.   The third set of interventions
covered by the institutional development component have been regrouped under
a Central Level Support Program which includes: [i] the strengthening of
MOH's central level organization; [ii] the implementation of well targeted
applied studies; and [iii] direct support to the Project Coordination Unit.
The cost of this sub-component is estimated at US$1.92 million.
70.       To  strengthen   MOH's  management,   planning,   monitoring  and
supervision capability, the project will finance an extensive program of
overseas fellowships, coffplemented by study tours and participation in
international meetings by senior MOH staff [see above]. In addition,



- 25 -
Consultant services will be provided, to back-up MOH's specialists or fill
existing gaps, with special emphasis on evaluation of policy alternatives
and their implications. Considerable expertise, which has not been tapped
so far, already exists in the country, but outside consultants will also be
required to take advantage  of other  countries' experience.   A  program of
studies and app7ied research will also be carried out with the technical
assistance of local and foreign specialists to be financed by the project.
A total  of 70 m/m have been earmarked to support seven research topics: the
reduction  of  disparities  in   health   and   fertility   indicators;  the
reorganization of the referral system; the critical evaluation of social
security institutions; the design of a national health insurance scheme; the
improvement of the utilization of existing hospitals; the reform of medical
and paramedical training systems; and the overall financing of health sector
development.     Assurances  were  obtained  during  Negotiations  that  the
conclusions of project-financed studies, and their proposed implementation
would be discussed with the Bank.
71.        To  strengthen  the  Project  Coordination  UnitL and improve its
performance, 34 m/m of specia,  ed    su'tants will be utilized to assist it
in monitoring, and adjusting when needed, the implementation of the fifteen
health programs, the  training  activities  and  the  Management Information
System; in  the final  evaluation of  the projcxct; and in the preparation of
the follow-up  project.    For  the  same  reason,  two  thirds  of overseas
fellowships will be awarded to central and provincial health personnel
directly involved in project implementation, in order to continue building-
up  the   knowledge  that  will  be  instrumental  in  the  preparation  and
implementation of  follow-up projects  [see above].   The  project will also
provide financing for semi-annual review meetings of provincial coordinators
and for the publication  of a  bi-monthly Project  Newsletter.   Finally, it
will finance materials, supplies and transportation needed for project
n,onitoring and supervision.
III. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Costs and Financing
72.       The total  cost  of  the  six-year  project,  to  be  completed by
December 1995, is estimated at US$146.3 million equivalent. Base costs are
calculated at US$118.5 million and contingencies at US$27.8 million;
project's base cost with price contingencies on base cost amounts to
US$133.8 million.  Physical contingencies represent US$11.1 million.   Price
contingencies8 [US$16.7 million] reflect Bank guidelines on expected local
and international price increases. Import duties and taxes are included in
8 International price increases, for October 1 - September 30 project
years, are set at: 2.7% for 89/90, 1.4% for 90/91, 2.1 for 91/92, 3.1% for
92/93, 4.9% for 93/94, and 5.5% for 94/95. Local price increases are set
at: 41.3% for 89/90, 36.3% for 90/91, 31.3% for 91/92, 26.3% for 92/93,
21.3% for 93/94, and 16.3% for 94/95.



- 26 -
project  costs.        The  foreign  exchange  conponent is estimated at US$75.0
million or 51% of total project  costs.              A  summary  of  project  costs by
conponents and categories of expenditures is presented below.  Project costs
exclude incremental recurrent expenditure [see estimates para. 78].

73.         Basis of Cost Estimates.    The  costs of  civil works  are derived
from current contracts for similar construction in the project area, and
from quarterly guidelines published by the Ministry of Public Works.    Costs
of equipment, furniture and supplies are based on local market prices or CIF
unit prices, both adjusted to include local transportation and installation.
Vehicle costs are based on international prices, except for models assembled
locally which are generally less expensive. Costs of production of audio-
visual materials, training, local and expatriate consultants, applied
research and other services reflect local or international prices as
applicable. Overseas training fellowships are based on United-Nations rates
for Europe, Canada and the United States averaged at US$3,100 per month.
Base costs reflect a Negotiations exchange rate of US$1 = TL1,950 and
include a price contingency adjustment between project appraisal and
negotiations.

74.          Custars   duties  and   taxes.             Project costs  include an estimated
US$17.4 million in direct and indirect taxes and duties on civil works and
goods, to be financed by the Government.

75.          Contingency allowances.    Physical   contingencies are estimated at
10% for   civil   works,  equipment,   furniture,   and  materials,   and   5% for
vehicles and   technical assistance; overall, they represent 9.4% of baseline
costs or 7.6% of total costs.   Price contingencies between   negotiations and
the end   of project   implementation are estimated at  12.8% of base cost plus
physical contingencies.   Total contingencies   represent   23.4%   of   the base
cost.       The   estimated   price   contingency allowance for  imported equipment
differs slightly from the international price contingency rate, and is
country specific,   to reflect   Turkey's trade pattern which  is predominantly
oriented towards Europe.
76.          Foreign exchange ccaiponent.    The   foreign   exchange   coaponent  is
US$75.0 million including contingencies, or 51.3% of total project costs.
It was estimated as follows: 20% for civil works; 80% for equipment; 75% for
vehicles; 25% for furniture; 100% for foreign consultant services and
overseas   fellowships;   and   15%   for   local   technical   assistance.    These
percentages are based on the expectation that:  [i] all civil works contracts



- 28 -
will be awarded to local firms and most building materials will be produced
locally; [ii] 80% of medical equipment and 60% of other equipment will be
imported; [iii) 80% of vehicles will be purchased through local suppliers;
and [iv] 90% of furniture will be purchased locally.
77.      Project financing.  The proposed Bank loan of US$75.0 million will
finance the foreign exchange component, i.e. 51% of the total project cost.
The Government will finance the balance of project costs, including taxes
and duties. The proposed financing plan is shown below.

78.       Incremental recurrent costs  generated  by  project implementation
over the  six-year period  are not included.  They were estimated at TL108.9
billion  [base  cost].    This  covers  salaries  for  new  staff, increased
allocations of drugs and supplies, and operating costs of additional
vehicles. They would grow from TL8.6 billion in the first year, to about
TL21.4 billion for the sixth year of the project. These could be borne by
MOH's operating budget, which was about TL324 billion in 1987 [TL234 billion
for salaries alone], and was set at TL462.6 billion in 1988 [TL345 billion
for salaries]. But incremental recurrent costs are expected to be gradually
offset by a more general collection of user charges in project-supported
facilities. Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that MOH will
review every year the costs of health services provided by public health
facilities in the project area, and the revenues to cover these costs.
B. Project Management and Implementation
79.      MOH had created a Coordination Comnittee to guide  the Central and
Provincial teams during the preparation of the proposed project. To ensure
continuing support and guidance during the execution of the project,
assurances   were  obtained   during  Negotiations  that  the Coordinating



- 29 -
Committee, chaired by the Under-Secretary for Health and coioposed of senior
MOH staff  and representatives from YoK, Treasury and SPO will be maintained
during the project and given the responsibility of overseeing project
implementation [see Chart II].
80.        The  project  will  be  implemented  by  MOH  throigh the Project
Coordinating Unit (PCU] created to prepare the project.  Under the authority
of a Project Coordinator reporting to th6 Coordination Comittee and
responsible for inplementing its decisions, the PCU will: [i] coordinate and
supervise all project activities; [ii) take all necessary steps to ensure
prompt and efficient  implementation  of  the  construction  program  by the
Ministry of Public Work; [iii] conduct all other bidding, procurement and
disbursement operations; [iv) monitor progress and expendaiture and arrange
for the audit of project accounts; [v] liaise with the Bank and ensure
adherence to Loan Agreement provisions. In each province, the project will
be inplemented by a full-time Provincial Team (PT] led by a Provincial
Coordinator, reporting to the Project Coordinator. The functicns of the PT,
and of  its chief,  reflect those  cf the  central team.   The PCU full-time
staff  includes,  in  addition  to  the  Coordinator,  two   physicians,  an
architect,  two  technicians,  a  procurement  specialist, an accountant and
other support personnel. The PTs include, in addition to the Coordinator,
an MD, a head nurse or midwife, a health technician, an administrator, and
support staff.   The  staff of  the PCU  and the  PTs are  all MOH officials
detached from, their units for the duration of the project. Assurances were
cbtained during Negotiations that the Central Project Coordination Unit and
the ten Provincial Teaff6, adequately staffed with full-time personnel, will
operate through the closing date of the project.
81.       The General Directorate for Primary Health Care will  have overall
responsibility for improving and expanding health services in the ten
provinces, enacting the action programs in close collaboration with units
concerned,  and  coordinating  their  implementation.    While  the  General
Directorate for Maternal and  Child Health  and Family  Planning will  be in
charge of delivery and supervision of family planning services, the GDPHC
will ensure effective integration of these activities into the package of
services provided in public health facilities. The Project Coordinator will
be responsible for ensuring coordcnaion and timely delivery of these inputs
with those from the General Directorate for Curative Services [hospitals]
and the Malaria and TB Control Units.
82.       The Research, Planning,  and  Coordination  Council  [RPCC], which
acts as the Secretariat of the MIS Steering Committee, will provide all
needed support for the irrplementation of the Management Information System.
The RPCC will also assist as needed the Project Coordination Unit, in all
matters related to annual budget allocations and to procurement of works,
goods and  services.   Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that the
Government will appropriate every year sufficient funds to ensure effective
inplenntation of the investment program, espssially with respect to the
annual construction of all approved facilities.



- 30 -
83.       The General Directorate for Health Education will be  in charge of
all project-related training activities, under the guidance of a Training
Advisory Caimittee, chaired by a senior A-H officia1, which wil7 include the
General Directors for Health Education, PHC, MCH/FP and Curative Services,
the Project Coordinator, and representatives from YoK, the Ministry of
Education, and the major professional associations. Training activities
will be carried out through:
a.   a Central Training Team [CTT] responsible for overall coordination
of project-supported training activities, the preparation of core
courses to be adapted at the provincial level, the supervision of
design  and   production  of   materials,  sponsoring  of  related
operational research, monitoring, supervision and evaluation of
program activities in the ten provinces; this CTT, which was set-
up during project preparation, is headed by a member of the PCU
and includes seven specialists covering the following areas:
public health, health education, conmunication, midwives training,
nurses training, teachers training and sanitation;
b.   ten Provincia l  Tra in ing Teajris [PTTs] responsible for adapting and
implementing the core programs, coordinating training activities
within the province, and conducting specific studies designed to
measure the impact and effectiveness of the program; the PTTs
created during project preparation are headed by an MD and include
three or four other members, i.e. a health technician, a nurse
and/or a midwife, and a sanitation technician.
84.       The  creation  of  the  Training  Advisory  Committee,  will  be a
condition of Loan effectiveness.
85.       In accordance with Turkish law, the Ministry of Pub7ic Works will
be responsible for conducting the whole construction process on behalf of
MOH, for all health  facilities.    Remodelling  and  upgrading  of existing
facilities will  be done  under the responsibility of local authorities.  To
ensure  proper  implementation  of  the  civil   works  program,   MOH  will
nevertheless provide for additional supervision, the cost of which will be
borne by the project. Agreement was reached on architectural designs for
all health facilities to be built under the project. In rural areas, land
is readily available, and in urban areas, the process of selection and
acquisition of sites has been largely completed. Nevertheless, assurances
were obtained during Negotiations that all remaining sites will be acquired
by December 31, 1991.
86.            The  technical  assistance  program  would be instrumental in
achieving project objectives and, in particular for the implementation of
the training program, the development of the MIS, and in carrying out the
applied studies. Assurances were obtained during Negotiations that project-
financed Consultants will be recruited in accordance with Bank Guidelines
dated August 1981.



- 31 -
87.       Monitoring and evaluation.   The Project  Coordinator will monitor
and report on progress achieved in the project on the basis of reports from
the ten provincial teams and the central directorates, and of regular field
supervision.   Assurances were  obtained during Negotiations that: [i] semi-
annual progress reports will be prepared by the Project Coordinator, to be
submitted to periodic Bank review missions; and [ii] a Project Completion
Report will be submitted by the Government to the Bank, within six months of
the closing date of the project.
C. Procurement
88.       Procurement methods  are summarized  in Table  4 below.  Contracts
for civil works will be normally awarded through local competitive bidding.
However, force account procedures will be used: [i] when no satisfactory
bids have been received; or [ii] when LCB is not likely to succeed, as in
the case of small buildings in remote areas or minor remodelling work. The
Bank's prior approval will be required for individual civil works contracts
exceeding US$500,000; other contracts will be subject to post-award reviews.
89.       To the extent practicable,  contracts for equipmnent and vehicles,
with an estimated aggregate value of US$60 million including contingencies,
will  be  grouped  to  permit  bulk  procurement  of   at  least  US$400,000
equivalent.    Contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than US$400,000 will be
awarded on the basis of ICB, in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts
of less than US$400,000, not to exceed US$7 million will be awarded on the
basis of LCB in accordance to local procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Items which cannot be grouped into economical packages, which in the
aggregate should not exceed US$2   million,  would  be  procured  locally or
internationally  through  prudent  shopping,  after obtaining at least three
price quotations.  Procurement of  medical  equipment  for  small facilities
would be procured from UNICEF, up to US$5 million. Domestic preference of
15%, or the applicable duty, whichever is less, will be given to suppliers
of locally manufactured items for supply of goods under ICB. The Bank's
prior  approval  will  be   required  for   individual  contracts  exceeding
US$200,000; other contracts would be subject to selective post-award
reviews. Local and expatriate consultant services expected to total about
US$3.4 million would be contracted following Bank guidelines for the use of
Consultants.
90.       The Turkish local  competitive  bidding  procedures  are generally
consistent with the need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the
project. There are, however, a few provisions which are inconsistent with
Bank's  Procurement   Guidelines  and other  which  require  clarification.
Agreement was reached during Negotiations on the changes needed to make
Government's local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank.

D. Disbursements, Accounts and Audits
91.      Loan disbursements  would finance:  [i] 18% of the cost of civil
works; [ii] for equipment and vehicles: 100% of foreign expenditures of
direct imports; 100% of ex-factory cost for loczlly manufactured items; and
50% of  local expenditures when purchased  locally; [iii] 100 % the cost of
consultant services, and overseas  fellowships; [iv) 80% the cost of local
training, books, materials, printing and copyright; and [vi) repayment of
the PPF.
92.      Disbursement against contracts for  goods and services exceeding
US$400,000  equivalent  will   be  made  against  full   documentation.
Disbursements against expenditures or contracts below that  level  will be
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE), to be kept by the
Project Unit for annual   audits and  examination  by  Bank missions.
Disbursements will be made through a Special Account in the Central Bank of



- 33 -
Turkey, to be operated in accordance with established Bank guidelines.   The
initial World Bank disbursement of US$8 million to the Special Account
represents the estimated average Bank counterpart financing amount for a
four-month period during the first three years of the project.
93.       The proposed  Bank loan of US$75.0 million would be disbursed over
seven and one-half years, which includes an additional 18 months to
accomnodate unforeseen delays in procurement [see Disbursement Schedule in
Annex V]. The current country disbursement profile is six years, but the
seven and one-half year period reflects the sector's profile in the Region,
and the fact that this will be the first health project implemented in
Turkey.
94.       Accounts and Audits.  Under the overall supervision of the General
Director of Management and Budget, the Project Coordinator will maintain
separate accounts and records of project expenditures. Project accounts,
including the Special Account, will be audited in accordance with the March
1982 Bank "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects
Financed by the World Bank".   Assurances were  obtained during Negotiations
that the Bank will be provided, within six months of the end of each fiscal
year, with an audit report of project accounts of such scope and detail as
the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the
auditors on disbursements made on the basis of SOEs.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
95.            The project will help the government achieve its objective of
reducing   inequalities   in   health   status  of  large  segments  of  the
underprivileged population, while slowing the rate of demographic growth.
When fully operational, the project would result in effective coverage of
most of the 6.1 million population living in the ten provinces. Including
the 2.6 million persons covered by social insurance institutions who
nevertheless rely heavily on the public sector for basic health services,
beneficiaries would include 137,000 infants, 1 million children below the
age of five, and  1.4  million  women  of  reproductive  age.    Through its
institutional development component, this project will also pave the way for
more ambitious objectives to be achieved  under subsequent  projects.   In a
longer term perspective, the goal would be to set-up an economically
viable and partly self-supporting health care delivery system.
96.       The project  faces three risks.  The main risk lies in the limited
management capacity of MOH, and its lack of experience in implementing large
projects; this risk is offset by the relatively simple design of the
project, the decentralization of many interventions, and the provision of
technical  assistance  in  key  areas.    Second,  the  construction program
includes a large number of small and scattered rural facilities; to ensure
good quality standards, and reduce the risk of cost overruns and delays, the
project will provide for additional  supervision  engineers.    Finally, the
effective implementation of the Management Information System will depend on
MOH's  suc.cess  in attracting,   and  retaining,   the  needed  specialized



- 34 -
personnel.   This risk  will be minim'zed through the continuing association
of the Middle East Technical University to the development and introduction
of this MIS by the Consultant, and the substantial training program included
in the component.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND REOOMMENDATIONS
97.       During Negotiations, agreenent was  reached on  the changes needed
to make Government's local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the
Bank [para. 90].
98.       During Negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
a.   in filling current professional teacher vacancies  in MOH's health
colleges, priority will be given to the 14 colleges in the project
area [para. 57);
b.   two-thirds of fellowships  will  be  awarded  to  health personnel
directly involved in project implementation, and that upon their
return, all efforts will be made to assign beneficiaries to
project-related activities [para. 62);
c.   the  MIS  team,  headed  by  a specialist and staffed by qualified
full-time members, will operate through the closing date of the
Project [para. 68];
d.   the  conclusions  of  project-financed studies, and their proposed
imrplementation will be discussed with the Bank [para. 70];
e.   MOH will review every year the  costs of  health services provided
by public health facilities in the project area, and the revenues
to cover these costs [para. 78];
f.   the Coordinating Cc:mittee,  chaired  by  the  Under-Secretary for
Health and conposed of senior MOH staff and representatives from
Y6K, Treasury and SPO will be maintained during the project and
given  the  responsibility  of  overseeing  project implementation
[para. 79];
g.   the Central  Project  Coordination  Unit  and  the  ten Provincial
Teams, adequately staffed with full-time personnel, will operate
through the closing date of the project [para. 80];
h.   the Government will appropriate  every  year  sufficient  funds to
ensure  effective   implementation  of   the  investment  program,
especially with respect to the annual construction of all approved
facilities [para. 82];
i.  all remaining  sites will  be acquired by December 31, 1991 [para.
85);



- 35 -
j.   project-financed Consultants will be recruited in  accordance with
Bank Guidelines dated AuJust 1981 [para. 86];
k.   semi-annual  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  by the Project
Coordiriator, to be submitted to periodic Bank review missions; and
that a Project Conpletion Report will be submitted by the
Government to the Bank, within six months of the closing date of
the project [para. 87];
1.  the Bank  will be  provided, within  six months ot the end of each
fiscal year, with an audit report of project accour,ts of such
scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a
separate opinion by the auditors on disbursements made on the
basis of SGEs [para. 93].
99.       Conditions of  Loan Effectiveness would be the creation of [il the
Fellowships Selection Conmmittee; [ii] the Management Information System
Steering Committee; and [iii] the Training Advisory Committee.
100.      Subject to  the above  conditions, the project provides a suitable
basis for a Bank Loan of US$75 million equivalent.

FIRST HEALTH PROJECT - STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
OONTE4T OF HEALTH PRORAMS
I.  -  The  objectives  assigned  to  each  program  vary with the
province, to reflect prevailing conditions.   Nevertheless, the  broad lines
of the fifteen health programs are basically the same and can be sufmfrized
as follows.
1.       Monitoring of Pregnant Wbmen.      Increase the  number of prenatal
visits, to ensure effective monitoring, laboratory testing and immunization;
screening, follow-up and hospitalization of  high  risk  pregnancies;   and
effective planning of haoe deliveries for low risk pregnancies.
2.        Delivery Care  and Obstetrics.   According to the province, health
services in obstetrics and natal care will seek to:
-    reduce, or eradicate altogether, unassisted deliveries at home; in
all   instances,   intensify   health   education  within  village
communities;
-    for low risk pregnancies, increase and  improve delivery  at hcme,
assisted by the midwife under safe and hygienic conditions;
provide  improve   transportation   in  case   of  complications;
strengthen  the  Health  Center  as a referral level for imrediate
back-up of hcme deliveries;
-    for high risk cases, ensure effective referral by improving access
to hospital for obstetrical care.
3.        Post-partum.   Increase the  number and  quality of  visits in the
imrediate puerperium.   Develop  health  education  on  family  planning and
advise on contraceptive methods.
4.        Family Planning.     Intensify health  education and acceptance of
contraception; improve delivery of family planning care and contraceptives;
generalize utilization  of modern contraceptive methods; reduce abortions as
a birth oontrol method; inprove referral to Health Centers for IUD
insertion, and cultural and financial access to tubal ligation at hospitals.
5.        Infant and  Child Care.   Standardize  infant and child clinics at
the rural midwife level (Health Post]; irplement the recording system with
family and individual files for the children; irprove clinical skills of
midwifes and physicians, raising the quality of pediatric care at the Health



- 2 -
Cen er level; facilitate access to hospital care when necessary; support the
four basic sub-programs, i.e.  immunization,  nutrition,  growth monitoring,
and oontrol of infectious diseases.
6.        Imiuization.   This program  is established at the national level
as a separate entity,  for technical and logistical  reasons.  However, at
provincial and local levels it tends to be integrated in the Cnild Care
program.  Essentially, over the next five years,  the program  should secure
the transition fran the national campaign concept to a routine activity of
local health services.   The  cold  chain  would be consolidated  for this
purpose.
7.       Control of Diarrheal Diseases.  The project would strengthen this
program already under i,rrl1gentation in most provinces. Enmhasis would be
on: (i) the detection of cases of malnutrition and repeated diarrheal episo-
des; [ii] the generalization of Oral Rehydration Technique, and ifproved
distribution and utilization of ORS packets; (iii] inproved referral and
transportation of  oomplications  to  upgraded Rehydration  Units  in Health
Centers and Hospitals; and tiv] irproved hcme sanitation in rural areas.
8.       Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI). Because of the high incidence
of ARI in project provinces, special attention would be given to secure: Ui)
primary hygienic and nutritional measures at hcme under supervision of the
Midwife; [ii] availability of first and second line of antibiotics  at the
Health Center  level;  [iii)  inprovement and  facilitation of referral to
hospitals; and tiv] systematization of treatment in pediatric services.
9.       Malaria Control.      Operations  will  oontinue   in the three
southernmst  provinces  of  the  project.    They essentially  consist of
surveillance and oontrol operations with screening through blood samples,
and passive and active detection.
10.      Control of Tuberculosis (TB). The incidence and prevalence of TB
remains unacceptably high in all project provinces and a new momentum would
be given to the program w'hich is otherwise well designed. The program
would: (iJ focus on poverty and malnutrition groups; (ii) extend coverage of
BSG vaccination; [iii] inprove clinical and rad-iological diagnostic skills
of Health Center staff; and tiv] imrprove the standardization of treatment
with follow-up of drop-outs, and increased follow-up of contacts.
11.      Environmental  Sanitation.    In the  past,  this program has met
serious operational difficulties in all the project provinces, especially in
urban areas.  Provincial health authorities would continue to focus on: ti]
health education of the cotunity; and [ii] actvice to the municipalities or
village councils  responsible  for  enforcing  regulations  and  imposing
sanctions. Additional interventions would be explored under the project
through imTproved collaboration with municipalities.



-3-
12.      Dental  Health.    In  absence of water fluorhydation, the program
would continue to inmrove dental education in schools, screening at village
and Health Center levels, obturation and minor treatment at Health Centers,
as well as preparatory work for prothesis for the elderly.
13.      Community Eye Care.  In addition to the high prevalence of eye and
vision disorders in all provinces, Trachoma reamins endemic in Diyarbakir
and Mardin. This justifies the introduction of a vigorous program of
blindness prevention.   In  a first  stage, the  program would provide for a
prevalence study and training of village midwives and Health Center staff.
In a  second stage, screening of congenital defects and early age strabismus
would accompany standardized treatment for chronic conjunctivitis (red eye),
and trachoma, as well as treatment of geriatric eye disorders.
14.      Health Education. Although each health program includes education
activities, health education was retained as a specific intervention at the
provincial level in order to coordinate the different activities and
messages to the community. Initial objectives and targets would be updated
upon completion of the first cycle of health programming.
15.      School Health.   The advancenet of school health programs varies
wioely with the province. In general, health services belonging to the
Ministry of Education (MOE) control effectively the main primary and
secondary schools in urban areas, while MOHSA staff does some control of
school  in  rural  or  isolated  areas.    Over the duration of the Project,
coordination between MOE and MOHSA services would be extended to all schools
to ensure adequate referral for treatment. Programs would also expand the
range of services provided. Village midwives and Health Center staff would
be trained accordingly.
II. - The Mbnitoring and Evaluation Criteria, which would be
adapted to prevailing conditions in each province, would be derived from the
following list:
a.   Child Health
-    % of fully immunized infants
-    X of infants receiving BOG
-    Average number of standard visits during the first year
-    Average nufber of standard laboratory tests during the first year

ANNEX  m
REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FIRST HEALTH PROJECT - STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM
1.       The  MIS  to  be  developed  under the project builds upon MOHSA's
current activities in informatics and strikes a balance between the need to
do a planning study before undertaking major investments in informatics, and
the recognition that inmediate opportunities, and needs, exist which can be
exploited, and served, through the development of microcaoputer-based
systems. Over the six-year period, the following five major objectives
would be achieved:
a.   Improve the content, design, and flow of data forms used by MCHSA,
to facilitate efficient management practices and prepare for the
gradual introduction of ccovrpterized systems, while maintaining
the discipline already established of using nationwide the same
forms.
b.   Prepare ar.  information system  master plan, to lay the foundation
of organizational structures, policies, and technical strategies
needed to ensure a cost effective use of information technology.
c.   Achieve immediate  efficiency gains, by introducing microcomputers
in the ten provinces; develop at the same time the existing
expertise in the use of microcomputer technology.
d.   Develop eight  basic application  system ccoRponents of the overall
MIS, namely: the Statistical Data Base System, the Hospital
Administration System, the Equipment and Vehicles Control System,
the Financial Management System,  the  Personnel  System,  the PHC
Management  System,   the  Epidemiology  System, and  the MCH}-FP
Management System.
e.   Test  the  feasibility  and cost  effectiveness  of ccmputerized
systems in support of operational activities such as provision of
primary health care, MCH/FP services, hospital care, etc. for
possible financing through subsequent projects.
2.        The Statistical Data Base  System, would receive priority.  Its
purpose is to maintain up-to-date provincial and central statistical data
bases on  all activities  of the Ministry; essentially it is a much improved
and ccmputerized version of the files created at the moment with summary
reports from hospitals, health centers, and provinces. In determining the
scope of the other seven application systems, priority was given to the
managerial and statistical reporting aspects, leaving other operational
aspects to be addressed in subsequent  projects.   The majority  of the data
would  be  provided  by  the individoaa app ication systems (PHC, Personnel,
Hospital Administration, etc); other data would be collected directly



through surveys,  special research  projects, etc.   The statistical aspects
of the various caiMonent systens would thus be developed first, making it
possible  for  the  MOHSA  statistical  data  base to be placed into service
nationwide within a relatively short time.
3.        The proposed approach would be inplemented in five phases:
a.   Phase I: Development of the Statistical  Data Base  System and the
statistical aspect of the other major MIS application systems so
as to place in operation the statistical data base of the ten
provinces and  of the  central ministry.   During this phase there
will be same overlap since under Objective Cc] coamuters would
have beeti acquired for the ten provinces, and users would be
developing the statistical system which is the most time consuming
yet the easiest to introxduce.
b.  Phase II:  Extension of  the Statistical  Data Base  System to the
remining  provinces;  concurrent  development   of  the Hospital
Adninistration System and the Equipment and Materials Control
System, and installation in the ten provinces.
c. Phase III: Development of the Financial Managemnt System and the
Personnel System, and installation in the ten provinces.
d.   Phase  IV:  Development  of  the  PHC,  Epidemiology,  and MCH/FP
Management Systems and installation in the ten provinces.
e. Phase V: Gradual extension of the core MIS System to other
provinces depending  on evaluation  of results  in the ten project
provinces. This phase will not be part of the current project,
but of subsequent ones.
4.        Achieving  the  five  objectives  of  the MIS  will  be a  major
institutional challenge for MDHSA. The number of different activities, for
example, will be quite large and will span the six years of the Project.
Some of them, such as the data analysis and forms redesign study [First
Objective] will be of a one time nature and highly specialized. Others,
such as the adninistration of institutional data bases and the development
of end-user and central systems [Objectives c and d] will beccme permanent
functions for the foreseeable  future.    For  the  first  type  it will be
necessary  to  design  a  management  environment which  relies  heavily on
external consultants; for the second, it will be necessary to mske
organizational and staffing decisions that ensure oontinuous and proper
discharge and management of  the  new  functions.    The vwole  effort will
represent a completely new experience for MCHSA and thus require a large
acconpanying training program.
5.        The training plan, by  province and  category of  personnel can be
summsrized as follows:



-3 -
a.   Training  for  3nagers would provide:  [i] general knowledge on
MISs, possibilities  and  limitations of  information technology,
criteria for management of data processing activities, and use of
microcanvuters  for management,  analysis,  personal  and office
productivity;   and   [ii]  opportunity  for managers  to  visit
institutions in other countries where relevant  systems have been
already installed, and to attend specialized seminars overseas.
b.  Section  Chiefs would  receive  training on MISs, limitations and
possibilities of informaticn technology, use of microconvuters for
management, analysis, personal and office productivity, and in the
query language needed to access the institutional data base.
c.  Health  statisticians  would  receive  training  in statistical
analysis, spreadsheet,  and data base management software, as well
as in statistical theory as required.
d.   Technical staff in the  data processing  unit would be trained in
the whole  spectrum of  software  technology acquired  by the
Ministry, as well as in data base design, structured programming
techniques, and project management.
e.   End user programmers at all levels would be trained to develop
sinple application systems on microccwVuters, by using spreadsheet
and data base software, and to solve the most cammn hardware
problems.
f.  Regular system users would be trained  in the use of spreadsheet
software, the operation of specific application systems, and the
query language to access the data bases.
6.       A Steering Committee would oversee the development of  the MIS and
take all major decisions related to policies, priorities, budgets and
programs.   The Steering  Committee would also ensure  that the reccmmended
information technology responds to the institutional needs of MOHSA and is
not primnrily driven by technical considerations.  The Steering Comittese,
chaired by an authority designated by the Minister of Health, will include
selected senior MCHSA managers, specialists and representatives  from the
other major health care providers. Its Secretary would be the Head of the
Ministry's Research, Planning and  Coordination  Unit.   While the project
would provide for consultant and training services, it will be essential for
MOHSA to recruit a full-time MIS manager and qualified staff needed to
implemant this  sub-cacponent.    MOHSA's MIS team will include about ten
staff, i.e. two made available by  the Data Processing Unit,  three or four
new recruits to be trained as system analysts-canputer programners, and five
experienced and fully trained analysts-programmars recruited from outside.
