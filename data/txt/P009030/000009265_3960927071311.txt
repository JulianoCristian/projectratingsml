HECRANDUM AM  RMENDATION OF THE pRESEn4T
OF 'D  INERTIOAL BC FOR REOOBNSTFRtCrIN AM  DEVELOFMF
TO X£ EXECUTrVE DICR  ON A PRPOSED LCIN TO
TM FBEPLIC CF 11JEY FOR A HEALTH PROIT
1.       The following memorandum and retion an a p-oposed  loan to
the Reblic of Turkey of US$75 million equivalent,  is submitted for
approval. The proposed  loan, would be for a term  of seventeen years,
ircluding five years grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
and would help firnnce a health project.
2.       Eand. Most of Turkey's aggregate health  indicators are
owparable to  those  in  other middle-inrowme countries. Yet striking
inerualities still exist between and within  regions, and  large se9nent of
the population su?fer fran surprisingly high infant, child and maternal
mrrtality rates, persistert prevalence of infectious diseases, malnutrition,
and relatively high levels of fertility. The comtry's population of 54.6
million has been growing at an average rate of 2.5% p.a. in recent years,
which  is expected to fall to  1.9% by the end of th century. Life
expectancy at birth is 62 years for mles and 67 for femles.  The crude
death rate stands at 8 per thoand, but the crude birth rate of 29 per
thousand is still twioi as high as in industrialized countries. . The total
fertility rate of 3.7 is below the average for middle-incax   coutries, but
substantially higher than in industrialized countries.   This  is also the
cse for  infant nmortality  (79 per thousand cosred to 6-11 per thOUSand]
and child nmrtality t9 per thousand conpared to less thn 1 per thousand].
A most striking feature is the very high rate of maternal mortality,
estimated at 207 per 100,000 live births t11  in industrialized countries];
in s    areas, maternal - mrtality is as high as 250, reflecting iradeate
obstetrical careo short intervals between births, and high incidence of
abortions performed under unsaitary conditias.
3.       The health sector  is notable for  its ccmlexity and lack of
coordination  betwee  largely  autonauus public, military  and private
organizations.  The Ministry af Health  EMD] is formally responsible for
designing and implementing the country's health  policy, but its authority
over other service providers remains limited.  MOH provides free preventive
care for the whole population; curative services must be paid for, but fees
are waived for indigents.   Primary health care shares most of the problems
of other public health services.   These are comounded by acute nmnpcwr
shortages at the outreach level, and about two thirds of health posts are
not properly staffed. Although 85X of health centers are manned by an MD,
thi3 is often an inexperienced, inadequately supervised physician performing
canpulsory medical sevice; many are actively involved in private practice
after hours and therefore  neglect outreach activities.  Lack of rural
facilities and inoa plete integration of activities raise aajor operational
problems.  The shortage of vehicles affects dramatically the efficiency of
outreach services. Medical equipment, especially  in health centers, is
insufficient and obsolete.  Public facilities provide cnly very basic or
emergency drugs and deliver prescriptions for the rest; however, as there
are no pharmacies in rural areas, people tend to bypass the primary health
care level. Finally, because they provide very limited services, mnDst
health cseters do not charge fees, therefore cannot supplement their



-3-
recurrent budget allocations, and otsequently freqen shortages of fuel,
drugs or supplies paralyze their activities.
4.       Proect Obiecti.          The  project would  have three majwr
objectives: (i]  inprove the health status of underprivileged populations in
ten of the country's 67 provinces; [ii] initiate miasures to enhane
efficiency  in sevice  delivery and  inprove financing prospects for the
sector; and Eiii] institution building, to strengthen MOI's mwnagement
capability and set the stage for further interventions designed to address
crucial issues affecting the sector's development potential.
5.       Projlct Descriotion. The proposed project consists of two major
crr onents: (a) the reorganization and sengthening  of provincial health-
services in ordcr to [i] extend coverage and inprove services in ten
underserved provinces, with a total population of 6.1 million, through the
impletuntation of 15 health programs, the strengthening of mangeemt, and
the reorganization of referral procedures; and [ii] achieve a better
distribution of health personnel; provide in-service and induction training
for about 6,800 i.edical and paramedical staff in the ten provinoes; and (b)
institutional development, through three sub-caiporents: ti] health nfnpower
development, focussed on teachers training, technical assistane for
curriculum revision, local and overseas training, study tours and attendance
at international meetings;  tii] development of a Mnaement Information
System, to be first inplemented in the ten project provinces; and tiii]
support to the central level, through the strengthening of M3H.'s maagemesnt,
planning, monitoring and supervision capability, applied studies and
research, and the strengthening of the Project Coordination Unit.  The
first coirpoent (US$134.4 million] would provide for: Ei] construction of
about 500 health posts, 27 rural health centers, 33 urban health centers, 4
district hospitals, 3 public health laboratories, and 2 vehicle maintenance
workshops; upgrading or corpletion of about 520 health posts, 332 health
centers, 30 district hospitals and 14 health colleges; Eii] equipment and
furniture for above facilities; tiii] additional equipiwit and furniture for
existing health posts (700], health centers [91], district hospitals (293,
provincial hospitals [8], public health laboratories [9] and vehicle
maintenance workshops [21; (iv] books and training materials for the health
colleges; and tv] about 880 vehicles for replacenints or additional and
future needs, i.e. 80 sedans, 530 four-wheel drives,  120 ambulances, 40
minibus, and 90 pick-ups and trucks.  The second c;nponent (US$11.9 million]
would provide for: Ei] technical assistance (626 m/m], overseas training
fellowships [476 n/mr, study tours t111 rmm equivalent], and local training
(2874 m/M]; and   iiI oomputing and office equipment for the central and
provincial project teams.
6.       The total cost of the six-year project, is estimated at US$146.3
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$75.0 million (51
percent]. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, as well as the
disbursement schedule are shown  in Schedule B.   A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bwn,s Group coerations in Turkey are
given in Schedules C and D. A nap showing the geographical coverage of the

project i  Is) attached.   The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7433-TU dated
April ?, 1983 is being distributed separately.
7.        Rationle for Wbrld Eank  Involve        ment. The Bank  supports
Goverrnent's policy to restructure its economy and promote the privati.7-tion
of activities which the private sector can handle more efficiently.
However, the State must retain primary responsibility in matters of
preventive  care, contai*ment of  communicable  diseases,   prevision of
e1mrgency servioes, and ensuring acceass to basic health services by the
poor.  It is also in the .Ational  interest to  support programs to inprove
health and nutrition standards, and to achieve fertility rates compatible
with the country's resources and development prospects.   The Bank therefore
supports Goverrment's twofold fundmental  objective in the sector: ti] to
redress existing inequalities in health status, by inproving access to basic
health services of underprivileged populations; and [ii] raise overall
health indicators to a level more compatible with the oountry's educational
and income  levels, development pc . ntial and political aspirations.  Given
the relative neglect of the health sector in the past, Bank's inwolvement at
this stage would be a crucial factor in modernizing the system, as much
through technical assistance as financial support, ensuring a more adequate
allocation of resources, and directing attention to those provinces where
health  services are  seriously  deficient.    If  implementation  proceeds
smoothly, the project would provide a satisfactory basis for further
interventions.
8.        Agreed  ict nThe Government has agreed to provide assurances
that: [i]  in filling techer vacancies in health colleges, priority will be
given to the 14 colleges in the project area;   iiI two-thirds of fellowships
will be awarded to personnel directly involved in project implementation,
and that upon their return, they will be expected to work on project-
related activities; [iii] the MIS team, the Central Project Coordination
Unit and the ten  Provincial  Units, adequately staffed with full-time
personnel, will  operate through  the closing  date of the project; [iv] the
conclusions of project-financed studies, and their proposed implementation
will be discussed with the Bank; tv] the existing Coordinating Committee
will be maintained and oversee project  implementation; [vi]  the Govermnent
will  appropriate   every   year  sufficient funds to  ensure  effective
inplementation of the investment program, especially with respect to the
*           annual construction  of all  approved facilities;  lvii] all remaining sites
will be acquired by MOH by Decenber 31, 1991; [viii] project-finanoed
Consultants will be recruited in accordance with Bank Guidelines dated
August 1981; tix] semi-annual progress reports will be prepared by the
Project Ooordinator, for review by Bank missions; and that a Project
COopletion Report will be submitted by the Government to the Bank, within
six months of the closing date of the project; and Ex] the Bank will be
provided, within six months of the end of each fiscal year, with an audit
report of project accounts of such scope and detail as the Bank may
reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditors on
disbursements made on the basis of S9Es.



-5-
9.        It was also agreed  that the creation of:  [i] a Fellovhips
Training COmittee; Eii] a Manageent Inforwtion System Steering COamittee;
and tiii] a Training Advisor,' Committee, will be a Condition of Loan
Effectiveness.
10.      Justification.  The project would help the goverrwnnt achieve its
objective of reducing inequalities in health status of large segments of the
under-privileged population, while slowing the rate of demographic growth.
When fully operational, the project would result in effective coverage of
most of the 6.1 million population living in the ten provinces. Direct
beneficiaries would be 137,000 infants, 1 million children below the aes of
five, and 1.4 million women of reproductive age; noreover, the project would
also benefit most of the 2.6 million persons covered by social insurance
institutions, who nevertheless rely heavily on the public sector for basic
health services.    Project  ifvestments would substantially  inprove the
quality of outreach services and permit a more systematic implementation of
existing  regulations  regarding the collection  of  user charges.   The
institutional development conponent would also pave the way for wider
sectoral objectives to be achieved under subsequent projects. In a longer
term perspective, the goal would be to set-up an economnically viable and
partly self-supporting health caire delivery systen.
11.      Risks.   The project faces three risks. The nmin risk is the
limited nenasenent capacity of MOH, and its lack of experieno in
inplementing large projects; this risk is offset by the relatively simple
design of the project, the deoentralization of nany interventions, and the
provision of technical assistance in key areas. Second, the construction
program includes a large number of small and scattered rural facilities; to
ensure good quality standards, and reduce the risk of cost overruns and
delays, the project will provide for additional supervision engineers.
Finally, the effective implementation of the Manageaent Information System
will depend on MOH's success  in attracting, and  retaining,  the needed
specialized personnel.  This risk will be minimized through the oontinuing
association of the Iqiddle East Technical University and the substantial
training program included in the caiponent.
12.      Rorwnendation.   I am  satisfied that the proposed loan would
omply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recmnmend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
