Key lessons learned\n            follow. Lack of an independent outside auditor reduced\n            project success. A strong policy dialogue, linked to the\n            provision of resources, would be more effective than\n            resources alone. MOH ability to provide adequate staff must\n            be an integral part of a project involving construction of\n            new facilities. The project would have benefited from more\n            flexibility and the presence in the resident mission of a\n            staff member dedicated to support of health projects."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
