Its three main\n            objectives will be to: (a) review instruments and related\n            measures; (b) strengthen technology infrastructure and\n            metrology services; and (c) expand and improve the\n            specialized financing program of Fondo de Equipamiento\n            Industrial (FONEI). These objectives will be achieved\n            through five components. They include (i) industrial\n            technology development analysis; (ii) strengthening of\n            technology infrastructure; (iii) strengthening of metrology\n            services; (iv) specialized finance for technology\n            development investments of industrial enterprises; and (v)\n            institutional strengthening of FONEI. The project will help\n            accelerate industrial technology innovation, thereby helping\n            private firms compete in domestic and export markets.\n            Increased availability of funds on terms suitable for\n            industrial technology development, selective use of\n            Government subsidy, and improved assistance in\n            identification and formulation of subprojects, are expected\n            to result in more, larger, or earlier technological\n            improvements in participating firms."}, "docdt": "1986-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
