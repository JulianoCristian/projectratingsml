outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the monitoring\n            and evaluation framework should be comprehensive and\n            indicative, showing the path to the project development\n            objectives. The output and intermediate indicators should\n            closely link and be fully reflective to outcome indicators\n            so that the project progress could be closely monitored,\n            correct actions could be adopted when necessary. A railway\n            cannot compete with road transport for multiple small\n            consignments. Such consignments were the core load of\n            Tanzania Railway Corporation (TRC) prior to concessioning.\n            During the two years of uncertainty between the bidding for\n            the concession and the eventual signing of the concession\n            agreement with the winning bidder the majority of the load\n            was lost to road transport and the concessionaire had no\n            chance to win the lost load share back for the railway. In\n            the current concession designs, the potential concessionaire\n            is faced with obligations to invest in liquidating the\n            backlog of maintenance and subsequently maintaining the\n            assets in workable conditions. When the infrastructure is in\n            very poor condition and heavy investment is required to\n            restore the infrastructure to standard condition, then the\n            burden on the concessionaire becomes too heavy."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
