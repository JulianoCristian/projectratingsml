To this end, the Singida Shelui Road - connecting Dar\n            es Salaam with northwestern Tanzania, and with landlocked\n            Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern Congo - will be upgraded to\n            bitumen standards (including drainage systems), bypassing\n            the hilly section of Sekenke (which cuts across a dense\n            forest) so as to prevent deforesation. Nevertheless,\n            implementation of the project, namely the Singida Shelui\n            Road upgrade, will have negative impacts on the people\n            living in, or in the proximity of major towns and villages\n            along the route. Relocation will be necessary of both\n            residential buildings, businesses or community facilities,\n            and farms. This resettlement action plan aims at improving,\n            or at least restoring, the livelihoods of project affected\n            people (PAP) to their current living standards. Following\n            community consultations, compensation will be provided as\n            follows: real estate losses will be paid at market values;\n            business and income losses will be paid, based on assessed\n            monthly net profits evidenced by audit accounts, multiplied\n            by thirty six months; agricultural land losses will be paid\n            at replacement costs, or in cash compensations, while crop\n            losses will be compensated on estimated market values. The\n            costs of relocation, and moving expenses will be covered,\n            and, grievance mechanisms will be in place should complaints\n            trigger the need for dispute resolution."}, "docdt": "2003-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
