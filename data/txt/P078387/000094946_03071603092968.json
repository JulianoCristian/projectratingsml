of the Central Transport\n            Corridor Roads Project, the Singida Shelui Road - connecting\n            Dar es Salaam with northwestern Tanzania, and with\n            landlocked Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern Congo - will be\n            upgraded to bitumen standards, to include drainage systems,\n            bypassing the hilly section of Sekenke (which cuts across a\n            dense forest) so as to prevent deforesation. In order to\n            extend sustainable rural production to the road influence,\n            promote access, and lower transport costs, the road\n            improvements would enhance socioeconomic development,\n            including the tourism sector. However, adverse environmental\n            impacts, such as soil erosion, loss of farmland, wildlife,\n            and natural habitats, as well as air, water and soil\n            pollution, in addition to safety and health hazards, call\n            for an environmental management to mitigate adversity, as\n            follows. To minimize impacts on wildlife, and forests,\n            sensitive areas should be realigned by separating road and\n            forest with green barriers, and, providing road crossings\n            for wildlife by smoothing embankment slopes at regular\n            distances, opening river weirs, and large culverts in\n            swamplands. The road design should blend in with the\n            landscape, avoiding cuts as possible, but stabilizing\n            necessary cuts with protective walls, favoring\n            re-vegetation. Culverts and cross-drainage should be\n            designed to maintain the hydraulic balance, including borrow\n            pit excavation and restoration, to avoid stagnation. Soil\n            erosion, sedimentation in drainage lines, and cascade\n            effects in drains can be minimized by paving drain outlet\n            areas with stones and concrete. Road safety measures should\n            be in place, as well as the creation of green barriers to\n            reduce dust and gas exhaustions."}, "docdt": "2003-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
