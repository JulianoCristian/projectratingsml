Ratings for the Sustainable Management of\n            Fish Resources Project (GDRH) for Senegal were as follows:\n            outcome was highly unsatisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: reforming the fisheries\n            sector is politically sensitive and a long term pursuit,\n            best suited to a phased programmatic approach in which\n            sustained support is ensured over a series of operations.\n            Operationalizing co-management requires actions at both\n            local and national level, lack of synchronization between\n            the two can disrupt implementation and the motivation of key\n            actors. Supporting alternative revenue generating activities\n            can potentially reduce the poverty-conservation tradeoff by\n            making up for lost income or subsistence opportunities that\n            stem from reduced resource access caused by project\n            activities. The Bank has continued to support Senegal in\n            reforming its fisheries sector beyond the close of the\n            projects though the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program\n            (WARFP). There was a delay of approximately one year between\n            the end of the GRIMAC and GDRH projects and the resumption\n            of activities under the West Africa Regional Fisheries\n            Program (WARFP)."}, "docdt": "2015-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
