                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The combined development objective/global objective of the project is to empower communities to reduce fishing pressure on the fish stocks supporting the central
                         coastal fisheries of Senegal (from the Cap Vert Peninsula to the Saloum River Delta), by (i) promoting co-management of the coastal fisheries, (ii) contributing to the
                         rehabilitation of the essential ecosystems for the coastal fisheries, and (iii) supporting alternative livelihoods and accompanying poverty reduction measures in targeted
                         poor fishing communities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project started slowly due to delays in contracting a firm to help implement activities related to the rehabilitation of the ecosystems essential for coastal fisheries, and another firm
                         to provide technical assistance for fishers wishing to pursue micro-finance through the project for alternative livelihoods to fishing. However, with the recruitment of these two firms in
                         early 2011, the project was back on track to achieve its objective as of June 2011.

                         Since August 2011 project implementation has slowed to a standstill. Many of the key activities in the work program for 2011, to complete agreements with communities to manage
                         targeted coastal fisheries, to support artificial reefs and reserved fishing zones in these areas, and to support alternative livelihoods to fishing, have not been implemented as
                         scheduled.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As of June 2011, and given the implementation progress at that time, it was agreed in principle and envisaged to extend the project for 18 months, in order to achieve the objectives.
                         However, with implementation slowing dramatically since August 2011, the project is now scheduled to close at the end of March 2012, as per the original design of the project.
                         Unless the project is restructured and the institutional management arrangements revised to improve performance, extension will not be considered.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
