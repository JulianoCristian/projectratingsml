                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The combined development objective/global objective of the project is to empower communities to reduce fishing pressure on the fish stocks supporting the
                         central coastal fisheries of Senegal (from the Cap Vert Peninsula to the Saloum River Delta), by (i) promoting co-management of the coastal fisheries, (ii)
                         contributing to the rehabilitation of the essential ecosystems for the coastal fisheries, and (iii) supporting alternative livelihoods and accompanying poverty
                         reduction measures in targeted poor fishing communities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project started slowly due to delays in contracting a firm to help implement activities related to the rehabilitation of the ecosystems essential for coastal fisheries, and another firm
                         to provide technical assistance for fishers wishing to pursue micro-finance through the project for alternative livelihoods to fishing. However, with the recruitment of these two firms in
                         early 2011, the project is back on track and well positioned now to achieve its objective.

                         The project has however made strong progress with respect to the scaling up of the 4 community-based fisheries management pilots from the Integrated Coastal and Maritime
                         Resource Management Project (GIRMaC), to 8 new sites in the central coastal region between the Cap Vert Peninsula and the Saloum River Delta. Local facilitators have been
                         recruited, trained and started work in each of these 8 communities, and the fishers in each case have now formed local fishers' committees (CLPs) as private associations that will
                         partner with the Government to co-manage the coastal fisheries. The CLPs in each of these 8 communities have prepared draft proposals for managing the coastal fisheries, that
                         would be finalized in the coming months and submitted to the Government for legal approval and funding, via the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The key upcoming decisions will focus on the completion of the management proposals for the coastal fisheries prepared by the local fishers committees in each of the 8 sites, in
                         consultation with the communities. Once agreed with all community members and stakeholders, these proposals will need thorough technical reviews by the Government prior to
                         entering into legal agreement with the communities, to ensure that (i) the fisheries to be managed by the local fishers' committees are well defined in each case, so that the proposed
                         management measures will yield tangible economic benefits to the fishers making the sacrifice for better resource management, and (ii) the goals and objectives of each local fishers'
                         committee for the targeted fisheries are clear and measurable.

                         Restructuring History
