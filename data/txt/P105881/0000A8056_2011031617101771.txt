                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The combined development objective/global objective of the project is to empower communities to reduce fishing pressure on the fish stocks supporting the
                         central coastal fisheries of Senegal (from the Cap Vert Peninsula to the Saloum River Delta), by (i) promoting co-management of the coastal fisheries, (ii)
                         contributing to the rehabilitation of the essential ecosystems for the coastal fisheries, and (iii) supporting alternative livelihoods and accompanying poverty
                         reduction measures in targeted poor fishing communities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project started slowly due to delays in procurement for the firms to help implement the component on rehabilitation of ecosystems essential for fisheries, and on technical
                         assistance for alternative livelihoods to fishing activities. However, these recruitments are now almost completed, and the project has a concrete work program for 2011.

                         In particular, the project is on track to scale up the 4 community-based fisheries management pilots from the GIRMaC, to 8 new sites in the central coastal region between the Cap
                         Vert Peninsula and the Saloum River Delta. Very soon these 8 communities should be completing local fisheries management proposals to submit to the Government for approval
                         and for funding, via the project.

                         At the national level, the project has supported the Government to complete the registration of the small-scale fishing fleet. The total registration rate (i.e. vessels registered and
                         physically marked with a registration number) has risen from 25% in early 2010 to 83% by the end of January 2011. Furthermore, the process has shown that there are far more
                         small-scale fishing vessels operating in Senegal than previously thought - a current total of over 16,000, compared to previous 2005 estimates of less than 12,000.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The full registration of the small-scale fishing fleet in Senegal is expected by mid March, 2011. The small-scale Senegalese vessels that are operating in neighboring countries would

                         be registered in the subsequent months. With the initial registration complete, the project will support the Government to freeze future registration, except for replacements, in order
                         to freeze the overall size of the small-scale fishing fleet. This fleet is significantly larger than was estimated, and together with other operating fleets has long since outgrown the level
                         of fishing effort that the resource base can sustain.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
