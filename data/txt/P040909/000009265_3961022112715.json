Insurance\n            Reform Loans Project are to start a process that will\n            improve the efficiency and equity of Argentina's health\n            insurance system and to contain the already high level of\n            health spending in the country. The loans will provide major\n            support for the first phase of the health insurance reform\n            by: 1) introducing competition into the market for health\n            insurance, while avoiding risk selection; 2) reallocating\n            resources in the Fondo Solidario de Redistribucion\n            (Redistribution Fund) (FSR) to Obras Sociales (Social Health\n            Insurance Funds) strictly on the basis of income and health\n            risk of their insured households; 3) developing an effective\n            regulatory framework and institutions for health insurance,\n            which promote competition, ensure greater transparency and\n            accountability and help to protect consumers' rights;\n            and 4) extending to the Obras Sociales and Instituto\n            Nacional de Servicios Sociales para Jubilados y Pensionados\n            (National Social Services Institute for Retirees and\n            Pensioners) (INSSJP) financial and technical assistance to\n            enable them to raise their internal efficiency, improve\n            their balance sheets, and comply with new standards and\n            regulations. The project consists of three components: 1)\n            policy reforms and regulatory development; 2) restructuring\n            of the Obras Sociales; and 3) restructuring of the INSSJP."}, "docdt": "1996-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
