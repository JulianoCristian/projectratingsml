Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are considered highly satisfactory.\n            Lessons for future adjustment programs involving difficult\n            and politically sensitive reforms include: At the project\n            design stage, the focus should be on conditionality and not\n            on specific restructuring activities. Intensive discussions\n            on conditionality help surface the areas of disagreement or\n            resistance to change, and define the political space within\n            which the reform operation will take place. The reform\n            program must keep the long-term vision in mind but take a\n            series of practical, achievable steps. Reform must be built\n            on broad, multi-agency support, not narrow sectoral backing.\n            The successes to date have depended on political support\n            from the highest levels of the Argentine Government,\n            including the president, a broad coalition of ministries,\n            and a substantial number of the social health insurance\n            funds and heath care provider associations. Crucial\n            institutional development must be assisted through long-term\n            technical assistance lending. Clear analytical work helped\n            establish clear and achievable goals. Technical clarity and\n            transparency was crucial in establishing a climate of trust.\n            Equally critical was the intense supervision capacity that\n            allowed the Bank to keep abreast of difficult political\n            situations and to adapt design accordingly. Finally,\n            introducing competition and tight regulation accelerated progress."}, "docdt": "1999-07-07T00:00:00Z"}
