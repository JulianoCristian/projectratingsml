Ethiopia achieved a satisfactory overall outcome,\n            particularly when viewed against the backdrop of the\n            protracted civil strife, breakdown in socio-economic\n            infrastructure, and weakened sectorial institutions. The IDA\n            performed satisfactorily throughout the project cycle. Its\n            active supervision, particularly during the last 2 years of\n            the project (1993 to 1994), contributed significantly to the\n            final result. The Borrower's performance was mostly\n            satisfactory. There were initial difficulties and delays in\n            procurement, the recruitment of technical assistance, the\n            commencement of training activities, and the compliance with\n            other covenants. The sustainability of the major initiatives\n            under the project is likely, thanks to the Government's\n            commitment to agricultural research and extension. The\n            project originally planned for a six year duration from 1984\n            to 1991, but was delayed twice up to 1994 due to the civil\n            war. The pace of implementation picked up rapidly after\n            mid-1991. The main lessons learned are institutional: to\n            optimize the results of institutional development measures\n            such as staff training, a well-designed training plan, with\n            clearly articulated needs and priorities, should be prepared\n            with IDA during appraisal. Assurances should be obtained\n            regarding implementation in the event that the project\n            management team is overhauled due to a force majeure, with\n            renegotiation or cancellation as possible consequences of\n            failure. Implementing institutions should be cognizant of\n            IDA's procurement and disbursement procedures. Up-front\n            training of staff and backup personnel in Bank procedures is\n            recommended. In order to enhance the benefits from technical\n            assistance, the arrival of consultants should be\n            synchronized with the availability of equipment."}, "docdt": "1994-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
