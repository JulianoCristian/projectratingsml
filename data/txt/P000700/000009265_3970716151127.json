Research Project will:  (i) strengthen field crop and coffee\n            research; (ii) strengthen irrigation/salinity research and\n            animal husbandry and pasture research; (iii) improve\n            adaptive research to translate findings into messages\n            suitable for farmers; and (iv) rehabilitate research station\n            plant and equipment.  It will also; (v) improve headquarters\n            support services to the stations; and (vi) provide technical\n            assistance and strengthen training programs.  The primary\n            focus of the project will be on field crop and coffee\n            research in high potential areas, since this research offers\n            opportunities for quicker returns than would be obtainable\n            from research in other subsectors. Increased crop production\n            in high potential areas would help stimulate economy-wide\n            growth and also to generate surplus food to cope with\n            frequent shortages in drought-prone areas."}, "docdt": "1984-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
