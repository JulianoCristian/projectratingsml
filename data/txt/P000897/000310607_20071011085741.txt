 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report

       The IndependentEvaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthrough the
dissemination of lessonsdrawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWBannually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lendingoperations throughfield work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations;those for
which Executive Directorsor Bank management have requestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generate
importantlessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.

       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System

       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.orglieg).

      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefitsat least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.

      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangementsfor regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievementof development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation,and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performanceand implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

 PREFACE

          This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Ghana Second Health
 and Population Project (HPP 11) and the Ghana Health Sector Support Project (HSSP). The first
 operation was financed through IDA Credit No. 2193 in the amount of US$27.0 million (19.5
 million SDR), with planned govemment and community contributions of US$7.0 million and
 US$0.4 million, respectively. The credit was approved on December 13, 1990,became effective
 on June 18, 1991, and was 97 percent disbursed when it closed on December 31, 1997,two years
 after the originally planned closing date. The second operation was financed through IDA Credit
No. 2994 in the amount of US$37.8 million (25.1 million SDR), with planned contributions of
 government (US$573.4 million), internally-generatedfunds (US$36 million) and bilateral and
multilateral co-financing (US$165.0 million). The credit was approved on October 21, 1997,
became effective on June 18, 1998,and was 99 percent disbursed when it closed as planned on
June 30, 2002. A third operation, the Second Health Sector Program Support Project, was
financed by an IDA credit of US$57.6 million and an IDA grant of US$32.4 million. Approved
on February 6,2003 and declared effectiveon May 22,2003, the IDA funds are 99 percent
disbursed and scheduled to close on June 30,2007. This PPAR includes some analysis of the
performance of this project to date.

         The findings of this assessment are based on an Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
mission to Ghana carried out in June 2006. The mission met in Accra with authorities and staff
of the Ministry of Health, the Ghana Health Service and the Ghana ALDS Commission; other
public sector agencies implementinghealth activities; selected NGOs and civil society groups;
and development partners. The mission also visited the Regions (Districts/Municipalities) of:
Greater Accra (Tema), Upper West (Wa, Nadowli), Upper East (Bolgatanga, Kassena Nankana
and Nawongo), Northern (Tamale, Tolon) and Ashanti (Kumasi), where it met with health
authorities, services providers and stakeholdersand assessed health inputs and activities
supportedby the Bank. Key sourcesof evidence consulted include: (a) World Bank project files;
(b) project-related reporting and evaluation;and (c) epidemiological data, studies, surveys and
research on health, much of it generated in Ghana.

         This PPAR is one of several to be conducted on the development effectiveness of the
World Bank's support to health, nutrition and population in different countries. Evldence from
these assessments will contribute to a forthcoming evaluation by IEG of the World Bank's
support to health, nutrition and population outcomes. As such, more material has been presented
in this "enhanced" PPAR than is the IEG standard.

         This report draws on the technical inputs of the following team members: Dr. Moses
Aikins, Health Economist, JSA Consultantsof Ghana, and Mr. Michael Azefor, Public Health
Specialist. The IEG team gratefully acknowledgesthe contributions of Ms. Flora Nankhuni, who
analyzed household survey data, and Ms. Mollie Fair, who contributed to the analysis of other
data on project performance and outcome. The IEG team also gratefully acknowledges all those
who made time for interviews and provided documents and information.

         Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the relevant
govemment officiaIs and agencies for their review and feedback. However no formal response
was received.


 SUMMARY

          Following dramatic improvementsin health status in the three decades after
 independence,the health of Ghanaianscontinuedimproving during the late 1980sand through
 most of the 1990s. In recent years, however, health indicators have leveled off. This report
 assesses the developmenteffectivenessof two completed Bank-financedhealth operations and
 the performanceto date of a third operation,scheduledto close in 2007. These projects were
 implementedduring a period of growing momentum, both within and outside of the Bank, to
 evolve developmentassistance into a Sector-WideApproach (SWAp). The SWAPrepresents a
 paradigm shift in the focus, relationshipand behavior of donors and government. It involveshigh
 levels of donor and country coordination,with the government in the lead, and the fuller use of
 country capacity for the achievementof nationally articulatedprogram goals. This evaluation
 explores:the extent to which health services and health status improved especially among the
 poor and disadvantaged;the contributionof the Bank's support to this end; and the effectiveness
 of the SWAPfor achieving sector developmentobjectives.

         The objective of the Second Health and PopulationProject (HPP 11),approved in 1990,
 was to improve the quality and coverage of health servicesand increase the availability and
accessibilityof family planning services with the goal of improving health and fertility indicators.
It also aimed to improve equity in the availabilityof servicesby rehabilitating facilities in the
three underserved regions in the north. Its outcome is satisfactory, based on its substantial
relevance,substantial efficacy, and substantial efficiency.

         HPP IT contributed to improvementsin service availability and quality by improving
essential drugs supply, strengtheningdistricthealth teams, and, in the northern regions,
rehabilitatingand expanding health infrastructure. Utilization of outpatient services increased
both nationally and in the North, although cost recovery was found to depress utilization by the
poorest. Investment in the immunization program supported increases in vaccination rates, which
rose among the poor and rural residents and in the northern regions. However, overall rates fell
short of project targets. Project support also facilitated a rapid response to a meningitis epidemic.
Utilization of pre-natal services was very high and quite equitable, but there was no change in the
very low rate of births attended by skilled staff and the use of these services remained highly
inequitable. Strategic sector management was strengthened,laying important groundwork for a
SWAp, but progress in involving NGOs in health sector operations was modest. Between 1993
and 1998infant and under-five mortality decreased.Project support contributed to the
improvement and expansion of familyplanning servicesin Ghana and is likely to have
contributed to the modest increase in the use of modem contraception. Between 1993and 1998
the total fertilityrate dropped from 5.5 to 4.6 children.

        The objective of the Health Sector Support Program (HSSP), approved in 1997,was to
assist Ghana in implementing its five-year Program of Work (POW)(1997-2001) to: (a) provide
universal access to basic health servicesand improve the quality and efficiency of health services;
and (b) foster linkages with other sectorsto reduce the population growth rate, reduce the level of
malnutrition,increase female education,increase access to water and sanitation and reduce
poverty. The IDA credit contributed annually to a common fund, made up of pooled donor
financing that was managed by GoG, along with its own budget, to achieve POWtargets
including reductions in child and maternal mortality, fertility and child malnutrition. Project
outcome is rated moderately unsaiisfactory, based on substantial relevance, modest efficacy and
modest efficiency.

         HSSP was successful in achievinga number ofprocess objectives, inherent in its SWAp
 design. The Government assumed leadership in sector management and established working
 partnerships with the consortiumof donors. Regular health summitsprovided a forum for the
 annual monitoring of sector performance and for the planning and budgeting of future activities
 and commitments.National capacity was strengthened and utilized, particularly for planning and
 budgeting, procurement, financial flows and financialmanagement. The SWAPwas less
 successful in mobilizing financialresources and in ensuring efficiencies in its allocation and use,
 and it was not sufficientlyresults-based. Important aspects of institutionbuilding were neglected,
which undermined sectorperformance: (i) chronic competitionand overlap in responsibilities
between the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service; (ii) failure to expand service
 deliverythrough contracts with NGOs and the private sector; and (iii) failure to implement fully
the Pow's highest priority, highest-impact programs and services.

         Despite substantialinvestment in the five-year POW(US$690 million) most health
 service and health outcome targets were not achieved. The quality and access of basic services
have not substantially improved. In 2003 national immunization rates achieved the target of 80
percent, with gains for the poor, rural residents and northern regions and improved equity in
coverage,but improvementwas marginal as the actual (1998) baseline was 72 percent and not 49
percent as originally estimated. Littleprogress was made on rnalana prevention, with less than 4
percent of children sleepingunder an insecticide treated bednet by 2003. The use of oral
rehydrationtherapy for the treatment of children suffering fi-omdiarrhea has not improved.
National rates for births supervisedby skilledworkers remained at unacceptably low levels, and
inequitiesin the use of these services were extremelyhigh. Gains were made on the use of family
planning services and on the already high rates of antenatal care visits. While general targets for
outpatientutilization rates were achieved, exemptionsfor poor people have not been adequate to
lift:financialbarriers to access. Program investmentsincreased the production of human
resources for health, but staffing of health facilitieswas undermined by brain drain and
inequitable distribution of health workers. Services efficiency has not improved notably. Inter-
sectoral action was undertaken to influence key determinants of health, but a clear framework and
strategy for selective action is lacking. Between 1998and 2003 there were no statistically
significantchanges in infant and under-five mortality and in total fertility.

         The Second Health SectorProgram SupportProject (HSPSP 11),the follow-on SWAP
operation,aimed to support Ghana's second POWfor 2002-2007 to improve the health status,
while reducing geographic, socio-economic and gender inequalities in health and health
outcomes. Pending an Implementation Completion Report (expected by end-2007) and a new
Demographicand Health Survey (planned for 2008), this project has not yet been rated by IEG.

         HSPSP I1has continued good progress in the building and utilization of sector capacity,
but some of the SWAPprocesses for sector management are in need of revitalization, including
the health summits and the dialoguebetween the Government and its partners. Health financing
continued to increase, but concerns about efficiency in the use of sector resources persist. Plans
to develop a performance-based management system and to monitor accountabilitieshave not
been realized.

         Exemption funding for the poor has increased, but is still inadequate; and current
exemption provisions are not financially sustainable. The national health insurance scheme is
intended to assume the role of protecting the poor, but this is unlikely to happen until coverage of
this schemeincreases beyond 50 percent. The expansion of community health services and the
support of health interventionshave improved service availability. However, under-financingof
districthealth services and the failure to reimburse district facilities for exemptions have put them
in financial difficulty and compromise the regularity of these services, as well as their
accessibilityto the poor. Annual reports provide little indication of improved services quality or

efficiency. The ratios of medical staff to the population have improved slightly during the
program period. Considerable challengesremain to: promote and exploitparticipation of the non-
governmental sector in health service delivery; streamline and render functionalthe MoH and
GHS; and ensure that priority programs and services are sufficiently financed and implemented.

        The main findingof this evaluation is that the first health SWAPin Ghana has
strengthened sector stewardship and sector capacity, but has not culminated in the achievement of
most health service delivery and health outcome targets set by Government. Between 1998
(when the first SWAPbecame effective)and 2003, the POWgoal of improvingkey health
indicatorswas not achieved. The SWAPprocess took precedence over a focus on results, and
sector dialogue became more deferential, even on issues of critical importanceto sector
performance. The followinglessonspoint to opportunities for improvingdevelopn~ent
effectiveness in the context of a SWAp.

        Success in establishinga process for sector-widemanagement and dialogue will not by
        itself ensure the achievement of health servicesperformance and outcome targets. The
        absence of a strong results focus,the absence of a viable system and incentives for M&E
        and the failure to move towards a performance-basedhealth system to ensure
        accountabilitiescan seriouslyundermine the achievementof sector objectives.
        A dialogue between Government and its health partners, which is not sufficiently
        rigorous or frank, can result in the neglect of critical constraintsto sector performance.
        The institutionalcompetition and overlap between MoH and GHS and the failure to
        harness the potential of the non-governmental sector for deliveringhealth services are
        issues with both technical and political dimensions, which might have benefited from the
        technical input and leverage of outsiders.
        High priority, high-impact health programs and servicesrisk not being implementedas
        planned if (a) they are financed almost exclusively by earmarked, outside funds; and (b)
        if district/local-levelautonomy and responsibility for health planning and spending are
       not checked or balanced with the technical and strategicknowledge of specialized staff
        and managers of these priority programs (located in the central and regional levels).
        Sector efficiencyneeds to be measured in order to be achieved. The failure to carry out
        annual public expenditurereviews and incidence analyses, and to define fully a program
       results chain and monitorprogress on each link has undermined Ghana's ability to
       measure and fine-tunethe development effectiveness of the substantial investments in the
       health sector.

  1       BACKGROUNDAND CONTEXT

 HEALTH,     POPULATION NUTRITION
                              AND                (HNP) IN THE LATE 1980s AND 1990s'

  1.1     Trends in HNP Status. Following dramatic improvements in health status in the
 three decades after independence,' the health of Ghanaians continued improving during
 the late 1980s and through most of the 1990s. However, since 1998 key health, nutrition
 and population indicators have plateaued (Figure 1-1). Likewise, trends in fertility reveal
 improvements between 1988 and 1998,and a stagnation in indicators thereafter. Fertility
 dropped fkom 6.4 to 4.4 children per woman between 1988 and 1998, and has remained at
 the same level over the past decade. The percentage of children 3-35 months who were
 stunted3declined from 29 percent to 21 percent between 1988and 1998but this gain was
 reversed in recent years when rates climbed to 28 percent in 2003. Analysis of household
 survey data corroborate that stunting did not decline between 1998 and 2003, with an
 estimated one out of four children being stunted throughout this period. These general
 trends in HNP status mask wide variations within Ghana. Rural populations, residents of
 the poorer (especially northern) regions and those in lower wealth quintiles all have
 higher infant and child mortality, fertility and malnutrition rates than their counterparts
 living in urban areas and in the better-off regions and belonging to the higher wealth
 quintiles.

 1.2     Disease Burden. Malaria, tuberculosis, respiratory and gastro-intestinal
 infections and nutritional deficiencies constitute the main burden of disease, with non-
 communicable diseases (diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases) assuming more
 significance. Since the mid-1980s HIVIAIDS has also added to this growing burden.
Ghana continues to face serious reproductive health problems with many women dying
from complications of pregnancy, childbirth or unsafe abortion.

 1.3     Determinants of Health, Nutrition and Fertility. Two categories of
determinants affect health, nutrition and fertility: (a) theperformance ofthe health sector
in meeting the HNP needs of the population; and (b) non-health sector determinants.

1.4      Health Sector Performance. A number of health systems issues and constraints
have undermined the delivery of essential health services to improve the health of
Ghanaians during the late 1980s and in the 1990s. These have been candidly and
consistently noted in the Government of Ghana's (GoG's) policy and strategy documents
(MoH, 1996, 1999 and 2003) as well as in analyses conducted by the World Bank (World
Bank, 1989, 1991, 1997b and 2002). In summary, geographical access to a primary
health care facilityhas been limited and exacerbated by a severe shortage of health
personnel, especially in remote areas. Financial access, especially of the poorest, has

 been impeded by cost recovery for services (introduced in the mid-1980s), with the poor
 less inclined to report illness and seek treatment than the rich. Service quality has been
 compxomisedby shortages of drugs and medical supplies, poorly maintained equipment,
 long lines, and the poor demeanor and low skills level of health staff. Weak quality
 assurance and underdeveloped monitoring and evaluation systems have also been factors
 of poor service quality. Inadequate funding of health services, especially non-salary
 recurrent costs, has also compromised the provision of services. Furthermore, the
 allocation of sector resources has not necessarily reflected stated priorities, a case in point
 being the chronic under-financing of primary health care in favor of secondary and
 tertiary referral hospitals through the late 1980s and first half of the 1990s. Inequitable
 distribution of financial and human resources have caused the poorest and most
 underserved regions in the north to be most neglected. Issues of sector organization and
 management have undermined sector efficiency and the accountabilities for delivering
 results have not been well defined or tracked. Until the mid-1990s, donor support4had
 been only loosely coordinated, and contributed to a proliferation of management and
 monitoring systems and approaches.

 1.5       GoG and strategy documents have also noted that communities have had limited
 involvement in the planning, management and monitoring of local health services.
 Ghana's large non-governmental sector (providing both for-profit and not-for-profit
 sesvices) has had weak links with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the potential for
 contracting with this existing capacity for health service delivery has not been exploited.
 Multi-sectoral coordination and collaboration for better health outcomes has remained
 elusive.

 1.6       Non-Health Sector Determinants of HNP. Poor health in Ghana during the late
 1980sand 1990shas also been attributed to poverty, poor nutsition of vulnerable groups,
 low literacy, especially among women, a high population growth rate, and limited access
to safe water and sanitation (MoH, 1996). Ghana has been very successful in its efforts to
 fight poverty, reducing almost by half the share of its population living in poverty, from
 52 percent in 1991192to 29 percent in 2005106. However, inequities persist: poverty
remains very widespread in the northern regions, even though it has decreased in these
regions in recent years. Poverty fell by about 16points in urban areas and by 23 points in
rural areas (Coulombe and Wodon, 2007). Ghana DHS data reveal increases in female
education and in access to clean water and sanitation facilities between 1998 and 2003,
but gains were very modest and extremely inequitable.*




4 In the late 1980sand early 1990sabout 15 donors provided about US$40 million from bilateral sources
and US$45 million from multilateral sources, or a little over US$1.OO per capita per annum. An additional
US$120 million was committed for the period 1991-1995 (World Bank, 1991).

5 During this period (a) the female population with no education decreased from 40 percent in 1988to 28
percent and the proportion of women with secondary school or higher increased from 8 to 12percent; (b)
there was an increase of 9 percentage points (hom 33 percent to 42 percent) in households with piped
drinking water, with urban access six times the level of rural access; (c) the proportion of women living in
households with a flush toilet increased from 7 to 14percent, with the urban rate for 2003 (26 percent) 13
times the rural rate (2 percent). Other indicators of low and inequitable access to water and sanitation
facilities documented in IEG's analysis of GLSS data (Annex H) corroborate these trends.

6The Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) is defined as a programmatic approach, designed for IDA
countries, that seeks to bolster a Government's poverty reduction strategy. The series of loans principally

(PRSP). PRSC programs are envisioned to have a lifespan of 3 to 4 years, allowing significant room for
change if needed. (World Bank OperationsPolicy and Country Services Department).

7The four PRSCs together provided IDA financing in the amount of US$515 million to support
implementation of GoG's poverty reduction strategy; although the PRSCs included health-specific
objectives, allocation of PRSC funding for health was not specified. Of the US$65 million in IDA funds
made available for community-based initiatives under the Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project
and the Community-Based Rural Development Project, an estimated US$24 million was allocated to
health.

 effective in addressing chronic implementationproblems. A package of six principles of
 soundproject developmentwas identified as a "Sector InvestmentProgram" (SIP) that
 supported a "broad sector approach to lending" (Box 1.1). Strongly advocated ". ..as the
 only sureway of increasingthe impact and sustainabilityof the Bank's assistance and of the
 country's own resources" (Hauroldet al, 1995),this approachwas relabeled as a "Sector-
 Wide Approach" (SWAp) two years later,but its definitionremains essentiallythe same
 (Box 1.2). Duringthe 1990sthe call for a broad sector approachwas also increasingly
 articulated by other developmentpartners and client countries working on health sector
 development in Africa (Box 1.3). Growingmomentum to move towards the SWAPinside
 and outsideof the Bank stronglyinfluencedthe nature of the Bank's health portfolio in
 Ghana, as will be discussedin this report.


 Box 1-1 Basic Features of a Sector InvestmentProgram

      A SIP must be sector-wide in scope, where a "sector" is defined as a coherent set of activities, which need to be
      looked at together to make a meaningful assessment, and it must cover all sector expenditures, both current and
      capital;
      A SIP must be based on a clear sector strategy and policy framework;
      Local stakeholders, meaning government, direct beneficiaries, and private sector representatives have to be fully in
      charge;
      All main donors must sign on to the approach and participate in its financing;
      Implementation arrangements should to the extent possible be common to all financiers;
      Local capacity, rather than long-term technical assistance, should be relied upon as much as possible for the project.

Box 1-2 World Bank's Definition of a SWAP

A Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP) is an approach to support a locally owned program for a coherent sector in a
comprehensive and coordinated manner, moving toward use of country systems. SWAps represent a paradigm shift in the
focus, relationship and behavior of donors and governments. SWAps involve high levels of donor and country
coordination for the achievement of prograni goals. A SWAP is not a lending instrument, nor a particular financing
modality. Programs to support SWAps can be financed through parallel financing, pooled financing, general budget
support, or a combination.

Box 1-3 Genesis of the Health SWAp: An International Consensus

During the 1990s, a forum on health sector reform, chaired by the World Health Organization with the active participation
of Ghana, Zambia, DFID and other partners, explored the concepts of a program-wide approach. Their deliberations led to
the first meeting of donor agencies to discuss this topic, held in 1997. Co-hosted by the Danish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and the World Bank, this meeting tool<three decisions: (a) to coin the term "Sector-Wide Approach" (SWAp), as
SIP was considered too closely associated with the World Bank; (2) to commission a SWAp guide for the health sector
(financed by DFID, EU and WHO); and (3)to create an Inter-Agency Group to foster learning and promotion of SWAps
with WHO as the chair and the active participation of partners and developing countries (including strong representation of
Ghana's Ministry of Health and development partners working on Ghana). Both Ghana and some of its development
partners were thus convinced of the rationale for adopting a scctor-wide approach.

 The problems that the SIP was des~gnedto address included: insufficient local ownership and
commitment; the lack of any noticeable "trickle-down" effect from some individual projects; projects not
sustained or maintained after initial implementation; confusion and dissipation of effort caused by different
approaches pushed by different donors; excessive numbers of expatriate technical assistance personnel and
weakening of govern~nentcapacity by the creation of donor-financed project units; and a lack of
satisfactory results from some adjustment operations, especially with regard to the allocation of public
expenditure (Harrold et al., 1995).

 1.9        This PPAR assessesthe development effectiveness of the World Bank's direct
 lending for Ghana's health sector during the period 1990-2005. Figure 1-1 shows that
 improvements in key HNP indicatorshave stagnated during a period when the Bank was
providing substantial financing for Ghana's health sector and had evolved its assistance
 into a SWAP approach. This assessment attempts to answer the following key questions
 in order to establish the links between Bank investments and health sector performance
 and outcomes. Did health services and health status improve, especially for the poor? To
what extent did the Bank's support contribute to any improvements? What has been the
effectiveness of the sector-wide approach employed by the Bank (and other partners)?
What lessons can be drawn from this experience that will contribute to improvements in
the performance and outcomes of the World Bank's support to health sector development
-  in Ghana and elsewhere?

2.       SECOND HEALTH AND POPULATION PROJECT
         (1991-1997)

BACKGROUND CONTEXT AND


2.1      Following a period of good economic performance during the 1960s' Ghana's
economy deteriorated significantly during the following decade and into the early 1980s.
Real GDP fell by 30 percent between 1975 and 1982,and exports as well as imports fell
by annual averages of 6.4 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. Inflation rose to an
average of 56 percent during the 70s and early 80s' peaking at 123percent in 1983. This
downward turn in Ghana's economy had a profoundly negative impact on the provision
of health services and on the health status of Ghanaians. Starting in 1983 Ghana
embarked on an Economic Recovery Program, which was eventually successful in
turning the economy around (MoH, 1999).

2.2      As part of its package of support to Ghana's economicrecoverythe Bank approvedin
1985a Health and Education Rehabilitationproject designed to provide critical inputsto the
health and education sectorsto keep them fi-omcollapsingduring the period of economic
adjustment. In 1988the Bank carried out an extensive review of Ghana's HNP sectorsin
order to provide the basis for a better informed dialoguewith MoH and for more sustainable
investment in the development of these sectors. Issues and recommendationsemanating
fi-omths report (Box 2.1) received the broad agreementof MoH and influenced their policy
choices.

has beenjointly prepared by the World Bank's team and GoG; and (b) the results of the 2008 GDHS are
available.

2.3      Immediately following the Bank's sector mission, Ghana's MoH organized in
June 1988a national health symposium and carried out additional analytic work which
underpinned a number of reforms to improve health sector performance, commensurate
with those recommended by the Bank. It launched a national drugs policy and
competitive tendering to improve drug availability and affordability and introduced a
cost-recovery scheme to replenish drug stocks in health facilities. Budgets were revised
to accommodate more recurrent financing for health services, and greater priority was
accorded to the rehabilitation and extension of primary health facilities, including district
hospitals. In 1990MoH and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP)
identified key priorities in health and population for the period 1991-93: (a) expansion
and strengthening of primary health care, including family planning; (b) strengthening of
procurement and distribution of supplies, especially essential drugs; (c) the
reorganization and decentralization of MoH, including: strengthening central and district-
level capacities, performance monitoring, and better cooperation with the non-

   governmental sector; (d) human resomce development, especially the establishment and
   application of staffing norms and performance incentives; and (e) improved public
   expenditures in favor of primary health care.




   2.4       In the late 1980sabout 15 donors provided about US$40 million from bilateral
   sources and US$45 million fiom multilateral sources, or a little over US$1.OO per capita
   per annum. An additional US$120 million was expected for the period 1991-95 with
   additional funding under discussion (World Bank, 1989).

   OBJECTIVES DESIGN AND


   2.5       The Second Health and Population Project (HPP 11),designed to support MoH in
   the implementation of its stated priorities, was financed through an IDA credit of
   US$27.0 million equivalent," approved on December 13, 1990 and declared effective on
   June 18, 1991. With the overall goal of improving health indicators in Ghana, its
   objectives were ". .to improve the quality and coverage of health services and increase
                           .
  the availability and accessibility of family planning services.""                         The project's focus on
   the rehabilitation of facilities in the underserved three northernmost regions of Ghana
   aimed to improve equity in the availability of basic health services. The project
  supported six components (Box 2.2).


  Box 2-2 Second Health and Population Project: Components

 2.6        Project Management. Overall responsibility for project coordination was vested
 in the MoH. The Director of MoH's Division for External Aid Coordination and Project

 currencies.

 l 2 Development Credit Agreement between the Republic              of Ghana and IDA signed on December 21, 1990.

Management, which had only recently been established under MoH's new organization at
the time of project design, was designated as Project Director. A project management
unit for IDA financed projects was to be established within this Division, staffed by a
project manager, a procurement specialist, a logistics specialist and a monitoring and
evaluation specialist. A working level project implementation committee was to be set
up and chaired by the MoH project manager, with membership to include NGO project
coordinators. Bi-monthly meetings of this committee were envisaged to address
constraints to smooth implementation.

2.7     Contracts with NGOsfor Component Management and Implementation. Two
well-established NGOs were given responsibility for implementing key components.
The National Catholic Secretariat (NCS) was to receive a grant of 590,000 SDR to
manage and implement the re-equipment of three of its mission hospitals operating in the
Northern, Upper West and Upper East Regions of Ghana; and the Planned Parenthood
Association of Ghana (PPAG) was allocated a 2.0 million SDR grant to manage and
implement the refurbishing of 26 of its clinics and the expansion of its community-based
distribution activities. An additional amount of 220,000 SDR was designated for grant
financing for the re-equipment of other missionary hospitals in the Northern, Upper West
and Upper East Regions. NCS and PPAG were expected to sign an agreement with
MoH, which would lay out the terms and conditions for the use and management of grant
funds, and to designate a project coordinator fi-om its staff,

2.8    Legal Covenants underpinned key elements of MoH policy and priorities and
aimed to ensure successful implementation Ten covenants involved decisions and
actions for formal collaborative arrangements with NGOs. Four supported the production
of plans for improving service quality and coverage. Covenants also supported the full
staffing of district health teams, the establishment of a management and health
information system and the annual review of public expenditure. Remaining covenants
aimed at ensuring fiduciary exigencies and sound project management. Conditions of
disbursement also underpinned recommendations of the Bank's sector review, agreed
with Government (Box 2.1): the establishment of a national population council,
improvements to drugs procurement and resupply; and the appointment of a hospital
equipment maintenance expert for the northern regions.

2.9    Risks. The main risks identified during project design were the limited
implementation capacity of MoH and weak commitment of the Government to
implement population and health reforms, allocate sufficient resources to primary health
care and support a major expansion of family planning services. The project sought to
mitigate these risks by: focusing on a number of priorities scaled to match capacity, the
sharing of implementation responsibility with NGOs, agreement with high-level
authorities and key conditionality on public expenditure and other policy commitments.

IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS


2.10   This project was implemented over a period of six and one half years, including a
two-year extension of the credit closing date from December 31, 1995to December 31,
1997.

 2.11      Planned versusActual Costs and Financing. The total project cost was US$28.9
 million or 84 percent of the cost estimated at appraisal. Final component cost estimates
                                                              - -

 reflect greater expenditures on civil works than originally planned and considerably less
 than planned expenditures on contraceptives and the prizes fund. Actual Government
 counterpart funding fell far short of projections at US$1.5 million, or 21 percent of its
 commitment. Of the total IDA credit amount of 19.5million SDRs, 18.9million SDRs
 (97 percent of the credit) were disbursed.

2.12       Planned versusActual Inputs/Activities by C~mponent'~.                           Project activities were
largely implemented as planned. US$4 million worth of essential drugs and vaccines
were purchased and distributed, estimated to cover seven percent of national needs and
80 percent of vaccine requirements. Five-hundred health staff were trained to manage
drug revolving funds and 850 professionals were trained in rational drug prescription. A
quality testing laboratory was set up and 8 regional medical stores were constructed or
rehabilitated. With technical and financial support: MoH was reorganized, a strategic
framework and five-year plan were developed, district action plans were produced and
new procedures were set up for improved aid coordination. Northern regions benefited
from the re-equipment of 7 public sector district hospitals and three NGO-run district
hospitals and the upgrading of two health centers into district Izospitals. An equipment
repair and maintenance system was also established for the northern regions. The
construction of 40 houses for medical staff attracted human resources to the districts; and
the equipment of DHMT offices and provision of 500 motorcycles strengthened district
capacity for managing primary health care. Some 100health centers were re-equipped to
improve public sector provision of family planning. PPAG received US$2.3 million in
contraceptives, logistical support for supervision, and 26 of their clinics were
rehabilitated. In support of PPAG community-based distribution activities, 800
community-based distribution agents were trained and supplied and 82 bicycles were
provided.

2.13      There were only a few departures from originally planned activities: (a) the
project supported a number of additional civil works and equipment activities in the

carried out by IEG, and available in IEG files.

 underserved northern regions (construction/equipmentof 11 district health offices;
 upgradingltransformation of 2 health centers into district hospitals;
 constructiodequipment of 10health centers); (b) contraceptives needs for MoH having
 been largely financed by USAID and UNFPA, project funding of contraceptives was
 devoted primarily to the supply of the NGO sector; and (c) the Prizes Fund component
 was dropped at the MTR because it was unfavorably perceived by the public and by other
 public sector agencies.I4

 2.14     Legal covenants were respected, for the most part. Their implementation is
 discussed in substance in the following section on achievement of objectives. Twenty-six
 of the 30 covenants were fully complied with, and three were partially complied with.I5
 Most dated covenants (guiding sector development and management) were delayed by
 two years through amendment of the credit agreement but were complied with. Four
 conditions of disbursement were ultimately met, but were cause for significant delays in
 project implementation.16

 2.15     Procurement under the project contributed to significant delays in
 implementation, attributable to: inadequate capacity and experience in procurement
 planning, a one-year vacancy in the procurement specialist position following the
 departure of two trained procurement specialists, the unavailability of counterpart funds
 for procured items, long processing delays, and inadequate specificity in tender
 documents. Procurement capacity was noted, however, to have improved significantly as
 a result of project support and experience (WorldBank, 1998). At the request of GoG
 and on an emergency basis, the Bank approved the purchase of meningitis vaccines to
mitigate an epidemic.

2.16     Disbursement lags were significant due to slow project start-up, with only 20
percent of the project funds utilized by the time of the MTR (a full three years into the
project). Disbursements picked up considerably after a successful MTR that effectively
addressed implementation bottlenecks and issues of ownership. Financial marzagement
was carried out as planned.

2.17     The Mid-Term Review (MTR) took place in June 1994, 18months after the
originally scheduled date of December 1992. Jointly carried out by IDA (under a new
task manager) and the MoH, this review culminated in recommendations to accelerate
implementation and to build long-term MoH capacity for program coordination and



14Thls scheme of awarding prizes for good performing units failed as staff objected to perceived non-
transparencyof the awards, and the decisions over the choice of prizes (e.g., televisions sets for waiting
rooms rather than staff bonuses). This is reported to have had a long-lasting effect on the unwillingness to
rest performance-basedpayments that was difficult to overcome.

15(a) making available project Eunds for grants to additional NGOs to expand service delivery; (b)
preparing a framework agreement governing the relationship between MoH and NGOs in areas of health
and population activities; and (c) designing a health information system.

16 For drugs disbursement: (a) formalization of competitive bidding for drugs and set-up of an advisory
tender committee;(b) functioning of the cash and carry system for resupply of drugs. For hospital
equipmentdisbursement: assignment of a MoH engineer for the maintenance of equipment in project
regions. For contraceptives disbursements: establishment of a National Population Commission.

 management. Implementation was to be facilitated through more rigorous civil works
 supervision, more technical assistance and capacity building for commodities planning,
 procurement and management. Agreementswere reached on MoH capacity building,
 including: measures to refine sector strategy, strengthen sector institutions, improve and
 consolidate partnerships with donors, and strengthen implementation skills and systems.

 2.18      Risks and Risk Mitigation. Project risks came to pass but were mitigated by (a)
 the integration of the PIU into the MoH; and (b) decisions taken at the MTR to support
 and nurture Government commitment and leadership through measures to utilize more
 fully and to further strengthen MoH capacity.

 MONITORING AND EVALUATION


 2.19      Design. The design of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) under this project was
 extremely weak. Targets were not quantified.l          7  Objectives were articulated more around
 the provision of services rather than around the performance and outcomes of these
 services. No baselines were established at the project's outset. Some baselines could be
 found in the 1989ESW, but these were not reflected in the project design document.
 Two years after the start of implementation the 1993 GDHS did provide some relevant
 baseline data. A M&E plan and system were not designed during project preparation, but
rather left to Government to undertake during implementation with apparently little
 guidance." The design document did specify the appointment of a M&E specialist to
 monitor implementation and to evaluate the impact of the project on expanding primary
health care, but provided no details or guidance on how this would be carried out.

2.20       Implementation. The MIS developed for project monitoring remained quite
rudimentary and proposed detailed project indicators were never adopted. As a
consequence, monitoring activities were limited to the tracking of inputs and
implementation progress. The MTR attempted to improve project monitoring, but other
items took precedenceI9during this review and this was never followed through.

2.21       Utilization. Failure to monitor and evaluate limited opportunities to utilize
information lo improveprojectlsector performance.




17The only two targets cited were: (a) a contraceptiveprevalence rate (CPR) of 20 percent (but it was not
specified whether this was for modern methods only or all methods); and (b) 80 percent immunization rate.

18Schedule4 of the Development Credit Agreement specified that MoH wouId design "...not later than
December 31, 1991,a management and health information system; and after having reviewed this system
with the Association, implement such a system not later than December 31, 1992..."

' h o s t notably: the acceleration of implementation;and discussions on how to improve partnerships
among donors and between donors and the MoH.

 Objective#I: Toimprove the quality and coverageof health services, with afoctis on the
 underservedthree nortlzernmost regions of GItana to improve equity in the availability of basic
 Izealtlz services

 2.22     HPP17 contributed to improvements in the quality and coverage of basic health
 services through its investments in critical inputs and in capacity building. The
 procurement of essential drugs improved the availability of this commodity at the point
 of service delivery. Investments in procurement capacity, medical stores and the
 strengthening of cost recovery all contributed to improving prospects for replenishing
 initial drug stocks on a sustainable basis; and training of service providers contributed to
 more rational use of drugs. Interviews, field visits and district-level data confirmed that
 drug availability improved significantly from pre-project levels and has remained
 reliable, and that these improvements are associated with HPP 11support. Substantial
 investment in the setting up andfunctioning of DHMTs improved the management and
 oversight of basic services. Equipment, logistical support and training have enabled more
 regular and disciplined supervision, an increase in outreach activities and more locally
 appropriate plans and activities. Targeted investments in the upgrading of dilapidated
 health infrastructure and in the strengthening of maintenance capacity andpractices in
 tlze north have rendered health facilities capable of delivering basic services. Interviews
with a number of managers and service providers who have worked in the north since the
time of this project attested to the major improvements such investments brought to
 service quality, although they did raise concerns about shortfalls in the maintenance
budget, especially in the recent past. Construction of newfacilities in the north and
supportfor outreach have extended coverage to areas that had no reasonable access to
health services.

2.23      Per capita utilization of outpatient services (aproxy for quality) increased
nationally Cfrom 0.20 in 1991 to 0.37 in 1997) aizd even more rapidly in the north, but
overall bvels remaiiz low." While these trends are positive, they are limited to public
sector facilities and thus difficult to interpret. Trends in utilization of non-governmental
facilities, including NCS facilities benefiting from project support, are not available.
Another important caveat in interpreting these trends is survey evidence (Core Welfare
Indicator Questionnaire, 1997),which indicates that the policy of cost recovery for

project could not be made available, despite many attempts by IEG to access them. Nevertheless, DHS
data showing trends between 1993and 1998roughly correspond to project implementationperiod 1992
through 1997.
   This section provides a summary of project outcomes. More detail is provided in a matrix on project
objectives and targets, prepared by IEG and available in IEG files.

22Assessment of service performance and outcome is based on analysis of GDHS and household survey
data detailed in Annexes F, G and H. Issues concerning comparability of data are detailed in these
Annexes to ensure that data are interpretedknowledgeably and cautiously. Annexes F and G also
document confidence intervals drawn from the GDRS reports.

23Trends in utilization for the Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions between 1995and 1998
indicated increases, respectively, from 0.14 to 0.23; 0.29 to 0.42; and 0.20 to 0.28 (MoHStatistics).

 health services negatively affected service access by the poorest segments of Ghana's
 population.

 2.24    Project investments in Ghana's national immunizatiorzprogram achieved
 immunization coveragejust below theproject target, but immurzi~ationimprovedfor all
 vulnerable groups: thepoor, rural residetzts, and the northern regions. And theproject
 didfacilitate a rapid response to a meningitis epidemic, thus mitigating itspotential
 impact. The project financed about 80 percent of Ghana's vaccine requirements and cold
 chain equipment and maintenance. The percent of children aged 12-23months who were
 fully vaccinated was 55 (CI: 51-59] in 1993 and 62 [CI: 57-67] in 1998,but this change
 was not statically significant. Immunization rates in the northern regions remained
 almost on par with national averages, increasing from 47 to 59 percent. The increase in
 DPT3 coverage was statistically significant, increasing from 62 percent [CI: 58-66] in
 1993to 72 percent [CI: 68-76] in 1998, falling slightly short of the project goal of 80
 percent. IEG's analysis of household surveys (Annex H) corroborates this trend of
 improved vaccination coverage over the project period and also indicates improved
 equity in coverage between the poor and rich, and rural and urban areas.

 2.25    The coverage of reproductive health services did not substantially improve at
 the national level. Throughout the project period, the percent of deliveries supervised by
 a doctor, nurse or midwife remained stable at a low 44 percent (Annex F, Table F.4).
 Inequities between the poor and rich and between rural and urban areas were extremely
high at the project's outset and did not change over the life of the project. Use of these
services by the rich was five times the level of use by the poor, urban use was twice the
level of rural use by rural residents, and national averages were one and one half times
the levels in the northern regions (Annex G, Tables G.1, G.2 and G.3). The percent of
women receiving ante-natal care remained virtually the same, but, unlike supervised
deliveries, coverage was already substantially high (at 87 percent) (Annex F, Table F.6)
and these services were delivered more equitably to poor and rich populations as well as
to rural and urban populations and to the northern regions (Annex G, Tables G.l, G.2 and
G.3).

2.26     The use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT)for the treatmetzt of diarrhea in
children improved substantially. Between 1993 and 1998 the proportion of child
diarrhea cases treated with the use of oral rehydration salts, recommended home fluids
and/or increased liquids24increased by more than 20 percentage points from 46 percent to
67 percent (Annex F,Table F.6). Improvements are documented for both the poorest
quintile (from 41 to 60 percent) and the richest quintile (fi-om 62 to 78 percent) (GDHS
1993 and 1998) (Annex G,Table G.1).

2.27    Capacityfor improved strategic sector management at central and district levels
was signiJicantlystrengthened withproject support, butprogress in involving NGOs in
health sector operations was modest at best. Project support culminated in the
production of a coherent policy and strategic framework, notably: a medium-term health
strategy; a five-year Programme of Work for the period 1997-2001;and a three-year
rolling investment program and annual recurrent budgets (WorldBank, 1998). This

 support complemented other financing for these activitie~.'~The project also provided
 technical assistance and other support for the reorganization of the MoH and the creation
 of the Ghana Health Service (GHS)26with a view to separating policy and regulatory
 functions from service provision. Project-financed training and logistical and technical
 inputs facilitated the production of annual plans and budgets by all districts. While a
 contractual arrangement with NCS in the north was functioning reasonably well, the
 extension of cooperative arrangements to other regions, private partners and activities
 was not fully developed or exploited.

 2.28     Child health outcomes improved rzatiorzally between 1993 and 1998. During this
period national infant mortality rates fell from 66 to 57 deaths per 1000live births and
 mortality among children under five fell fi-om 119to 108 (Annex F, Table F.1).27Given
 substantial project investment, it is plausible to assume that HPP IImight have
 contributed to these trends. Other non-health sector determinants of infant and child
mortality and the health sector support of other partners (para. 2.4) are also likely to have
contributed.

 Objective#2: To increasetlze availability and accessibilityoffamily planning services

2.29      Project support was i~zstrumentalto the successful inzprovernentand mparzsion of
farnilyplanning services in Ghanaand is likely to have contributedto the modest increase
in contraceptiveuse achieved during the life of theproject. Project investments in the
public sector complemented substantialfinancialand technical assistance provided by
USAID to the public sector and to contraceptivesocialmarketing activities. The project's
support to PPAG expandednational coverage considerably, in particularthe refurbishment of
26 fixed facilities and the training, supplyand oversightof 800 community-basedworkers.
Between 1993and 1998the use of modem contraceptionby married women increased from
 10percent to 13percent; the differencebetween actual and wanted fertility declined from 1.3
childrento 0.9;and the median length of the preceding birth interval increasedfi-om36 to 38
months (GDHS,1993and 1998).

2.30     A National Population Commissiorz was established in 1994 to strengthen the
coordination of efforts to implement Ghana'spopulatiorz policy and to raise
commitment to this effect. This outcome can be partly attributed to HPP 11,which
included this action as a condition of disbursement. However, the project did not include
any financial or technical assistance to establish and support the functioning of this




25In the context of the preparation of the follow-on operation, designed as a SWAp, the Bank's preparation
budget and a Japanese Grant Facility also provided financing for these building blocks of a coherent
framework for sector development and financing. SWAp preparation financing also supported the
definition of new management arrangements for the establishment of stronger partnerships between MoH
and its partners.

  the Commission.

  2.31 Between 1993 and 1998 the totalfertility rate droppedfrom 5.5 to 4.6 children.28In
  additionto familyplanning investments financedunder the project and by USAID and
  others,changes in fertilityare also attributableto other proximate determinants of fertility
  (girls' education,poverty reduction,women's empowerment,urbanization, among others).



  2.32       The outcomeof the SecondHealth and Population Project is rated satisfactory. This
  rating is derived from ratings of relevance, efficacyand efficiency of the two project

 2.33        The overall relevance of the project is substantial. The relevance of the project
 goals and objectives is substantial. They were fully supportive of MoH stated priorities
  at the time of project design. They are still highly relevant to Ghana's most recent
 Poverty Reduction Strategy, which includes a human development pillar, aimed at the
 achievement of the MDGs. The Bank's most recent Country Assistance Strategy (World
 Bank 2004) also emphasizes improved basic services delivery in support of the M D G s . ~ ~
 The relevance of the design is also substantial. It favored underserved areas of the
 country, prioritized primary health care and sought to build capacity at the central and
 district levels. Government ownership of the project was initially compromised by one
 design feature. While the PIU was appropriately established within the MoH's Division
 for External Aid Coordination and Project Management, its staff (mostly consultants) and
 somewhat autonomous functioning were found in practice to be inadequately integrated
 into the MoH's normal functions. This was corrected during project implementation and
 MoH's engagement in the project improved as a consequence.

 2.34       The overall efficacy of this project is substantial. The quality and coverage of
 basic health services improved, especially in the underserved north. Utilization rates
 increased for Ghana as a whole, and more rapidly in the north, although utilization by the



   Rates are for the five-year period preceding the GDHS surveys. The confidence internal for the 1998
 rate is 4.3-4.8. It is not provided for the 1993rate.

 29This CAS specifies in particular the goals of: improved nutritional status of children under five;
 improved health status of communities; reduced child mortality associated with malaria and other
 preventable diseases; improved access to essential quality obstetric care and implementation of behavior
 change communications activities.

 poorest may have been negatively affected by the cost recovery policy. Immunization
 coverage improved, although it did fall short of the project target. In addition, the project
 did provide emergency support to mitigate a meningitis epidemic. Capacity building,
 especially at the district level, also contributed to improved basic services. Infant and
 child mortality rates fell in Ghana during the project period, especially in the northern
 regions. Family planning services were expanded, contraceptive prevalence increased,
 albeit modestly, and fertility dropped substantially.

 2.35    Project efficiency is substarztial. The decision to channel funds to PPAG to
 improve and expand family planning service delivery made efficient use of a well-
 established, capable agency that complemented the efforts of the public sector. A focus
 on the three northernmost regions was an efficient way of targeting populations that were
both poorest and most underserved. Capacity building of district health management
 teams helped to make better use of this resource and to facilitate the decentralization of
 decision-making and oversight to the local level, which has a better grasp of sector issues
and challenges at the local level.

2.36    The project's risk to developmentoutcome is modest. Since this project closed
in 1997,MoH has transformed its way of managing the sector and coordinating its
partners. With increasing resources and a sector-wide approach to sector management
and aid coordination, the achievements under HPP I1have been consolidated and fwther
improved. Contraceptive prevalence continues to rise, district health care services
continue to receive financial and technical support, immunization rates continue to rise,
and efforts are ongoing to further decrease inequities across regions.

2.37    Bank Performance. The Bank's overall performance is moderately satisfactory.
Its performance duringpreparation was moderately unsatisfactory. The project was
based on good quality analytic work carried out by the Bank, which assessed the status
and dynamics of populationlfertility, health and nutrition in Ghana as well as national
programs and efforts to deliver services. Recommendations were in keeping with good
public health knowledge and practice. The design emanating from this analytic work also
reflected Ghana's policies and priorities for improving population, health and nutrition
indicators. A concern for addressing poverty was what incited a special focus on the
northern regions. The Bank did exchange with other donors supporting health during
project design, but did not work in full partnership with them. A significant shortfall of
the Bank's preparation work was the weak design of M&E.

2.38    The Bank's performance during implementation was satisfactory. In retrospect,
and compared with the current SWAP approach, some informants have noted that the
Bank had been somewhat rigid during the early years of implementation, monitoring very
closely adherence to clauses in the legal agreement and implementation progress.
However, close supervision of the project seems reasonable, given that (a) the project
was focused on stated MoH priorities; and (b) conditionali.tywas linked with actions and
decisions essential to good sector performance that were fully discussed and agreed with
Government in the context of technically sound sector work. Around the time of the
MTR, which coincided with a change in the Bank's Task Team Leader (TTL), the Bank
intensified and expanded its dialogue with MoH and especially with development
partners. The dialogue was said to improve both in terms of the technical quality and in
terms of the Bank's capacity for listening. Supervision missions were regular.

 2.39     Borrower's performance was moderately satisfactory overall. Government
 performance was moderately satisfactory. Legal covenants were ultimately complied
 with. Implementation was slow due to delays in the appointment of a procurement
 specialist. Government fell far short of its counterpart financing obligations.
 Government became more engaged after the mid-term review when the content and
 dynamics of the Bank's dialogue began to change and a SWAPprocess was launched.
 M&E were not adequately carried out.

 2.40     The performance of the PIU was moderately satisfactory. Day-to-day
 management and oversight were adequate, especially when the functions of the PIU were
 more fully integrated into the normal MoH Eunctions. Supervision of civil works was
 inadequate, and civil works implementation was considerably delayed. Poor procurement
 performance also delayed considerably project implementation. Over and above the long
 time it took to recruit a procurement specialist for the PTCT, procurement planning,
 management and execution were deficient.

 2.41     Monitoring and evaluation was negligible (paras. 2.19-2.21).


          HEALTH SECTOR SUPPORT PROGRAM (1997-2002)

 BACKGROUND CONTEXT  AND


 3.1      Policy and Strategic Framework. With the support of the Bank (under HPP 11)
 and other partners, Ghanaproduced a coherent strategic framework and plan for achieving
health sector goals laid out in Glzana Vision ZOZ0.30 A Medium-Term Health Strategy
 (MTHS), prepared in 1996(and later updated in 1999),specifies five objectives: increasing
access to health care; improvingthe quality of health care; improving the eflciency of
delivery of care and avoidingwaste; fosteringpartnership with other (non-governmental)
providers; and more and better management offinancing for health care delivery (MoH,
 1999). A five-yearProgramme of Work (POW)was also prepared to provide a framework
for the financing and implementationof the MTHS for the period 1997-2001(Box 3-1).
Those involved in the preparationof this fiamework (nationals and jnternational partners
alike) report that during this process MoH leadership of the sector emerged and donors
transformed into a more coliel-entconsortiumof support.

3.2       The preparation of this strategicframework and five-year POWin the mid-1990s
coincided with the very strong momentum, both within and outside of the Bank, to move
towards a SWAP (Chapter 1). Ghana's MoH, an active participant in international
deliberationsabout the SWAp, decided to embark on a sector-wide approach. Both the
process and outcome of the strategicplanning convinced Ghana that the POWgoals would

 OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN


 3.3     The Health Sector SupportProgram (HSSP)was financedby an IDA credit of US$35
million, approvedon October 21, 1997and declared effectiveon June 18, 1998. Its objective
was ". ..to assist the Borrower in implementing subprogramsunder the POWto: (a) provide
universal access to basic health services and improve the quality and efficiencyof health
services;and (b) foster linkageswith other sectors in the Borrower's economyto reduce the
population growth rate, reduce the level of malnutrition,increase female education,increase
accessto water and sanitationand reducepoverty."32 Program targets for 2001 were to: (a)
increase life expectancy from 58 to 60 years; (b) reduce the infant mortalityrate fi-om66 to
50 deaths per 1000live births; (c)reduce under five mortality from 132to 100per 1000live
births; (c) reduce maternal mortality from 214 to 100per 100,000live births; (e) reduce the
annualpopulation growth rate to 2.75 percent; (f)reduce the total fertilityrate from 5.5 to 5.0
births; and (g) reduce the proportion of childrenwith severemalnutrition from 12to 8percent
(WorldBank, 1997b).

3.4      The HSSP did not specifyproject comporzerzts. Rather it was designed to contribute
annualtranches of financingto a common h d , made up of pooled donor financing,33that
would be used and managed by GoG, along with its own budget, internallygenerated hnds
and other (non-pooled)financingto supportthe implementation of the seven strategies(or

 package of priorityhealth intervention^.^^

 3.5       Distinct from the objectives and targets of the POWthat aimed at improved health
 indicators and improved health services,the SWAPwas also expected to culminate in a
 number of achievementsor outcomesthat aremore process-oriented, related to how the GoG
 and its partners would coordinateand collaborateto achievePOWgoals and objectives. Box

     Box 3-2 Pow Components to Be Supported by the Health Sector Support Project

    (a) improve access quality arrd ejjjciency ofprimary health services, including, the establishment of
     standards, human resource development rehabilitation of infrastructure, essential drugs and other inputs,
    community participation and greater responsibility and resources for service delivery for districts;
    (6) strengthen and reorierrt secondary and tertiary service delivery, including rationalization of referral
    system, more support for regional public health disease control activities and for research, and rehabilitation
    and improved management of psychiatric and teaching hospitals and quality assurance programs;
    (c) train adequate lzumbers of new health teams, including in-service training, expanding and restructuring
    pre-service training, improved management of post-basic specialist training, rehabilitation and technical
    assistance for 23 training schools, improved personnel management and planning, including effective
    deployment and motivation;
    (d) improve capacityfor policy, regulation, resource allocation andperformance monitoring, including
    training, studies, continued policy monitoring and refinement, strengthening of statutory regulatory bodies;
    (e) strengthen national support systemsfor humall resources, logistics and sirpplies,firtancial
    tnanagemetrt and health information to support implementation;
    03 promote private sector irrvolvemetttin the delivery of health services, including development/expansion
    of contractual arrangements, development of regulatory and licensing mechanisms, and promotion of
    partnerships with traditional medical providers (clinical trials, professional association, and regulatory body);
    (g) Strengthen irztersectoralcollaboration, including advocacy and participation in the planning and
    monitoring of activities important to health, especially nutrition, population growth, water and sanitation,
    female education and poverty alleviation. This will involve collaboration with specific structures at the
    decentralized level (district assemblies and regional coordinating councils) and at the national level (National
    Population Council, and relevant sector Ministries).

3.6       SWAp Program Management and Imple~nentation.The SWAP (inclusive of the
Bank's and others' financial contributionto POWimplementation)was to be implemented
through the regular channels of the Government,with MoH retaining responsibility for
policy, monitoring, coordination of donors and inter-sectoral agencies and public financing
for health services. The GHS3'and two Teaching Hospital Boards were being established
at the project's outset to manage the efficient delivery of a decentralized public service.
District health management teams (DHMTs) in each of the 110districts were responsible
for organizingthe local provision of health services,preparing annual plans and budgets for
their districts and using effectively finances for non-salary recurrent expenditures. The ten

certain development sectors (health included) to separate policy and regulatory functions (responsibilities
to be retained by sector ministries) from service delivery functions (which would be assumed by newly
created service agencies).

3.7     Common management arrangements(CMA)for the management and
implementation of POWfurther defined and guided the transition to a sector-wide
approach, aiming for the further development and fuller use of national systems and
capacity (Box 3-4).

3.8    Risks. Themain risks identifiedduringproject designwere: the decentralizationof
budgeting and financialmanagement in the face of political sensitivities and limited
experienceof BMCs; capacityto manage an ambitiousprogram in line with the common
implementation procedures; and Government's ability to honor its financing commitments.
Proposed actionsto mitigatethese risks includedthe certification of BMCs as and when they
would fulfill eligibilitycriteria, the establishmentof a Government-donorforum and
framework for resource allocation, a focus on the developmentand use of national systems,
and the fixing of annual IDA funding amounts on the basis of GoG fiscal effort and
capacity.

     Box 3-4 Common ManagementArrangements under the Health SWAP
     Flow ofFuncIs and Disbursement. The CMA advocated the financing of the POWthrough GoG
     funds, ~ G funds and pooled donor funds, which would be managed
                  F                                                        by MoH    and the ~ckroller
     and Accountant General (CAGD), and disbursed and accounted for by Budget and Management
     Centers (BMCS).~~IDA funds would thus be transferred into a central Health Account, a basket
     fund to which other donors would also contrib~te,~'that would be under the direct control of
     MoH. These funds would be distributedto all eligible3' BMCs, which would use and account for
     funds in line with their approved plans and budgets.

     Planning and Budgeting. The CMA defined a consolidatedplanning and budgeting process that
     would be decentralized, strongly linked to national strategy, and organized around an annual
     planning and budgeting cycle. The preparation of guidelines and the provision of training were
     envisaged for needed capacitybuilding. Essentially, all BMCs would prepare plans and budgets
     in line with guidelines, that would be reviewed and consolidated at district, regional, and,
     ultimately, national levels for adherence with guidelines and approved for financing. The cycle
     also envisaged reviews of performance against program performance indicators and specified the
     timing of periodic joint meetings between Government and its partners, both to finalize plans and
     budgets and to review sector performance, Annex H provides the detailed components of the
     planning, budgeting and review cycles.

     Procurement arrangements under the CMA were designed to satisfy donor exigencies and at the
     same time enable the health sector to begin to undertake the purchase of some goods and services,
     includingthose funded by donors.39Thus, all procurement from the Health Account was to be
     carried out under MoH procedures,acceptable to IDA and other donors. A posteriori third party
     review was to become the main method of review, with IDA prior reviews limited to all ICB
     packages of works and goods if the financing involves funds from IDA either in whole or in part.

     Financial Management and Reporting. The CMA envisaged a consolidated system for financial
     zontrol, accounting and audit that would be used to manage and track all financial resources, no
     matter the source. While initially this system was to apply to donor funds that were pooled, it was
     ultimately to be applied to all donor funds. Considerable capacity building had already been
     zarried out to this end at project effectiveness,and hrther support (manuals, training) was
    danned. Accounting and reporting of expenditures for GoG funds were to be carried out in
    iccordance with the well-establishedGovernment procedures. The Financial Controller in MoH
    was responsible for monitoring and ensuring that eligible BMCs remained in compliance of the
    aeadinesscriteria. The delegation of monitoring tasks to qualified regional- and district-level
    iinancial staff was also envisaged. The Health Fund and larger BMCs were to be independently
    mdited annually, with remaining BMCs to be audited at least once over 2-3 years.




36BMCs were expected to include eventually over 1,000operating units at the district level (health centers
and hospitals), ten Regional hospitals, ten Regional and 110District health administrations, five tertiary
institutions and 8 headquarters Divisions.

annual budget for internally generated funds (IGF) and health account funds; statement of quantified targets
and objectives; satisfactoryprocedures for collecting and regular banking of IEG; acceptable procedure for
authorization of payments out of the IGFIHealth Account funds; books maintained and monthly
reconciliation of bank balance; and adequate staff and procedures to prepare regular reports on revenues
and expenditures.

39The ultimate goal was for the health sector to assume full responsibility for all procurement, but it was
recognized that this would not be fully achieved under POWI.

 IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS

 3.9     This IDA credit became effective on June 18, 1998, during the second year of the
 five-year POW. It closed four years later, on June 30,2002, as originally scheduled.

 3.10    Planned versusActual Costs and Financing. The total cost of the five-year POW
 was estimatedby MoH at US$773.4 million (MoH, 1996). Actual costs of program
 implementationamountedto US$689.5 million,or 89percent of GoG7soriginalestimates
 (Table3-1). World Bank's initial estimateof program costswas higher at US$823.9million.
 The analysisof planned vs. actual costs (Table 3-1) isbased on GoG estimates(MoH 1996).
 Neither the Governmentnor the Bank estimatedPOWcostsby component. Actual financing
 provided by Government and externalpartners fell short ofprojectionsby 65 percent and 81
 percent, respectively (Annex E, Table E.1). The SDR 25.1million IDA credit was 99
 percent disbursed,with a cancellationof SDR 0.14 million. (Annex E, Table E.2).

3.11     Planned versusActual Inputs/Activities by Program Component. Neither MoH
nor the Bank systematicallytracked Paw I implementation by component, to monitor
planned vs. actual inputs and activities. According to IEG's analysis (based on program
documentation, field visits and interview^)^' most components were implemented as
planned. The minimum package of services was defined. Health infrastructure
investments included the construction of three regional hospitals and 52 Iiealtl~centers,
the upgrading of 11 and the renovation and equipment of still more facilities, with
priority given to the north. Considerable investment in training of health personnel was
made, but net outputsjust made up for staff loss through attrition per annum. Districts
became more responsible for managing and overseeing services in their respective
catchment areas. Exploratory work on the potential of health insurance systems was
undertaken. Periodic reviews of sector performance at district, regional and national
levels were held. A procurement.unit was established within MOBand further
strengthening of other management systems was undertaken (drugs and supplies,
equipment management, estate management and capital investment, and financial
management). A number of program components, however, were implemented only
partially, including: quality asswance activities, performance monitoring, human
resources management, partnerships with the non-governmental ~ector,~'and inter-

sectoral collaboration for better health. Key inputs and activities implemented are further
discussed in this chapter in relation to program outputs and outcomes.

3.12   Legal covenants, focusing on fiduciary exigencies and the sector reviews and
reporting requirements in line with a SWAp approach, were fully complied with.

3.13   Other aspects of implementation (procurement, disbursement, annual sector
performance reviews) are discussed later in this chapter (see section on Achievement of
SWApObjectives).

3.14   Risks and Risk Mitigation. Risks were well managed overall. Implementation
capacity was effectively built and used. However, not all risks were fully mitigated. The
mobilization of funding fell short of expectations. The allocation and use of hnds were
not optimal. Partnerships with the private sector were slow to establish, and the creation
of the GHS caused turbulence and undermined sector management and implementation
capacity.

MONITORING EVALUATION
               AND


3.15   Monitoring and evaluation focused primarily on SWAP performance indicators
with insufficient attention to health services and health outcome indicators and to the
strengthening of accountabilities for results (Box 3-5).

     Box 3-5 Monitoring and Evaluation

     Design. At its very outset the POWI established baselines and targets for program impact for indicators of health
     status, health services performance and a few indicators outside of the health sector that were considered important
     determinants of good health (MoH, 1996). However, this document includes no discussion of a M&E plan, strategy,
     methodology, roles and responsibilities or design. It did include a subcomponent on Performance Monitoring and
     Evaluation and it also emphasized the importance of linking inputs, outputs and outcomes and measures of client
     satisfaction. The Bank's design document notes that the Government and donors subsequently agreed on a set of 20
     annual sector indicators to that would monitor some health objectives as well as policy, institutional and systems
    development. Presented in Annex E (Table E.l I), it is this set of indicators that was ultimately used for monitoring
    performance and impact under POWI through the process of semi-annual reviews.42 It is interesting to note that
    these indicators focused more on measuring progress in launching the SWAp and had only modest overlap with
    health service and outcome indicators proposed in the POWI document. Both sets of indicators were, in fact,
     important to sector monitoring and, together, they might have contributed to the development of a more coherent
    results chain for monitoring performance and outcomes under POWI. Two other elements were lacking in the POW
    logframe and M&E framework: (a) indicators to document systematically, costs, financing and efficiency of
    expenditures as they relate to objectives and equity issues, in short, a series of annual public expenditure reviews
    that would include incidence analysis;4' and (b) indicators to document systematically the extent to which planned
    activities under each of the seven POWcomponents (or strategies) were implemented. It was also envisaged under
    Pow 1 that operational research would bc supported at central, regional and district levels to document and enhance
    the cost-effectiveness of various schemes and interventions and to improve health sector performance and outcome.

    Implementation. MoH/GHS were very systematic in ensuring the regular reviews of sector performance, at central,
    regional and district levels, in line with the planningfreview cycles agreed under the CMA, analyzing and
    consolidating inforn~ationaround the 20 performance indicators agreed with their partners. Because the results
    chain was not clearly articulated, the relationship between the indicators and the strategic objectives of the POWwas
    not fully established, making it difficult to assess performance against POWtargets and objectives. Notwithstanding
    the inadequacies of these indicators, and the difficulty of interpreting them and collecting/aggregating information
    on them at various levels of the system, annual reviews did generate useful data and insight on progress achieved
    against these indicators; and they were refreshingly candid in citing shortfalls in meeting targets and weaknesses in
    implementation. Surveys envisaged to monitor an extremely important indicator (pcrcent of pregnant women and
    children sleeping under bednets) were not undertaken. Patient satisfaction surveys were not carried out as planned
    and so the client perspective was not fully incorporated into sector reviews. Data collected, for the most part, were
    limited to public facilities. Failure to collect and report on non-governmental services/facilities leavcs out some 45
    percent of all services in the country.

    Likewise, annual reviews of public expenditure on health were not carried out. This leaves an important void in the
    knowledge about the levels, adequacy and efficiency of expenditure. Indicators on the amount of health financing
    mobilized and on the allocation of budgets and expenditures are presented in annual reports in terms of shares and
    percentages and the actual values of numerators and denominators are not systematically presented to enable
    independent validation and trend analysis with any degree of certainty. A series of public expenditure reviews
    would have filled this important void.

    Utilization. Reports and meetings to review sector performance were used effectively at all levels to point to
    weaknesses and shortfalls in sector performance and to agree on and implement recommendations to improve
    performance. Districts and subdistricts visited noted the value of these reviews at all levels, which have provided
    them with perspective on their own performance vis-a-visother entities and inspired and guided them to further
    improve their performance. While performance contracts were signcd during POWI, they were not utilized as an
    effective management tool for monitoring and ensuring accountabilities of BMCs, their managers and health
    workers. Some health research was undertaken, but there is no evidence to indicate that it was focused on assessing
    and improving the cost effectiveness of health interventions or that it was utilized to this effect.




4'In its retrospective of POW I, MoH noted the inadequacy of the 20 monitoring indicators, their weak links
to program objectives, the failure to establish baselines on a number of them, the difficulty of BMCs to
report on some of them, their lack of clear definition, and their failure to provide a reasonable assessment
of the sector's performance against POWI objectives.

43The Bank's design document did note that program evaluation should include an analysis of how much
the poor and other vulnerable groups are benefiting from public expenditures on health, but provided no
specifics on how this would be carried out. The Bank's design document also noted that IDA was likely to
lead in areas of public expenditure and procurement issues.

 3.16      The World Bank's financial contribution to the implementation of POWI (1997-
 2001) amounted to about 5 percent of total program costs. However, given that the
 Bank's contribution was pooled together with that of other financiers and with the GoG
 budget for health, it was agreed, in the spirit of a SWAP approach, that all financiers
 would measure (and be measured against) GoG's health program objectives and
 indicators, since all were buying into the program. This section assesses project
 performance against two categories of outcomes: (a) the achievement of the expected
 benefits of a SWAp; and (b) the achievement of national health program outputs and
 outcomes.

3.17       Withthe support of HSSP and the assistance of otherpartners, the SWApwas
firmly established in Ghana's health sector arzd culminated in improved sector
coordirzution,manage~nentand oversight. Throughout program implementation MoH
convened two health summits per year, attended by development partners and other key
stakeholders: one (around April) to review annual progress against the 20 agreed
performance indicators and to agree on priorities and guidelines for preparing the
following year's program, the other (around September) to agree on the following year's
program of work and budget (including contributions of all donors). The process of
annual sector reviews and annual planning and budgeting exercises was participatory,
encompassing BMC exercises and their discussion and consolidation at the district level,
and, in turn, regional level exercises to discuss and consolidate district-level inputs. Final
consolidation of reviews and plans at the national level involved representatives fiom
districts and regions, as well as central-level agencies, and partners. By all accounts
(interviews, reports), MoH was successful in assuming sector leader-shipand national

objectives and targets, prepared by IEG and available in IEG files.

 ownership was broad-based and high. The transaction costs of a SWAp, expected to be
 reduced fi-omprevious transaction costs of dealing with donors bilaterally, were not
 measured.

 3.18      The process of sector review and management was comprehensive in scope.
 Because it was grounded in the strategic framework of the MTHS and POW,it covered
 the entire sector. This process improved the transparency of investment planning for the
 sector.45It also encompassed all financiers, both those that pooled their funding and
 those that continued their support through earmarked financing (or projects).
 Partnerships between MoH and development partners were strengthened through this
 process. It is important to note, however, that only donors providing pooled financing
 were allowed to sign the joint aide-memoires at the conclusion of summits.

 3.19     Efforts under PoWI to mobilizejhancial resourcesfor basic health services
fell short of targets. A total of US$689.5 million was mobilized for POWI, or 89 percent
 of the US$773.4 million target. Both Government and donors fell short of their targets
 providing, respectively, 65 percent and 81percent of their original commitments, while
 cost recovery activities succeeded in generating more than double the financial resources
 initially projected for this source (Annex E, Table E.                 Health expenditure per capita
 (all financing sources included) slowly declined during the POWfrom a high of US$8.10
 in 1997to a low of US$6.30 in 2001, falling short of the target of US$9.00. The Bank's
 and other pooled financing remained flexible in that it was programmed annually by
 MoH in light of needs and emerging challenges. However, it was not fully performance-
based. The establishment of performance-based management was a goal of the POW,as
well as of the SWAp, but this was not successfully implemented.

 3.20     Available data on the allocation and utilization of healthfinancing indicate that
some efficiency targets were met, while others have not.

3.21      Recurrentfinancing increased as aproportion of totalfiancing, exceedingtargets.
During the firstthree years of the POW,recurrent financing for health as a share of total
financing for health increased from 56 percent (1997) to 82 percent (1999) exceeding the
end-of-POWtarget of 74 percent (Annex E, Table E-3), with the share of the investment
component decreasing as a consequence.

3.22      EfSorts to shift noon-salay recurrentfinancing increasinglyto districts in support of
basic health services were successful. The district-levelshare of non-salary recurrent
spendingfor health reached 43 percent by 2001, fullymeeting the POWI target of 42
percent, and representing an almost doubling of the pre-POWI (1996) share of 23 percent


15Informants and documents have shown that the definition of the financing program of the health SWAP
during its preparation and the monitoring of plans during SWAPimplementation served both to reveal and
to mitigate a trend of investments in tertiary infrastructure financed with commercial loans, which was not
in keeping with the new policy of increased investments in district-level and primary health care facilities.

46Data on MoH spending as a share of total GoG spending reveal mixed performance against targets. Total
MoH expenditureas a share of total GoG expenditure in 2001 was 8.7 percent (MoH,2006) exceeding the
target of 7.3 percent. However, MoH recurrent spending as a share of total GoG recurrent spending fell
short of the 12 percent target: MoH2002 reports it as 6.9 percent, while MoH 2006 reports it at 10.2
percent. Annex E provides more detail.

 (Annex E, Table E-5). While this is an important step towards improved efficiency of
 spending,health reviews and key informantshave raised the continued challenge of
 developingtools to ensure more efficient allocations across and within districts.

 3.23    However, achievementsfell short of targetsfor increasingthe share of non-salary
 recurrentfinancing of the total recurrent budget. In 1999,59percent of recurrent
 financingwas spent on non-salary items, falling short of the target of 67 percent for that
 year (Annex E, Table E.5). Expenditureson wages and wage incentives for staff in
 deprived areas were increasedto addresspersistent and pressing issues of shortages and
 inequitabledistribution of human resources for health and were projected to further
 increase in this regard. Informants have also noted that strikes of health workers usually
 result in reductions in non-salaryrecurrent budgets and expendituresto compensate for
 increased expenditureson salaries.

 3.24    Capacities inprocurement, plaiznirzg, budgeting,firzancial managemetzt and
 strategic sector management were significantly strengthened and expanded.

 3.25    Procurement capacitywas strengthenedwith the establishmentof a procurement
 unit w i t h the GHS and the development of a Procurement and Procedures Manual and of
 standardbidding documents. This unit has become increasingly competent in carrying out
NCB and ICB (in line with Bank standards and guidelines, no matter the source of
 financing),as evidenced in the annual procurement audits. Bank monitoring included the
 conduct of post reviews. Remainingchallenges identified at the end of the project included
 the need to: increase the quantityof procurement skills including at decentralized levels,
 improve procurementplanning and linking it to finance, planning and implementation
tracking systems.

3.26     Disbursements/Financial Flows. Because the IDA credit became effectiveafter the
start of POWI, the credit agreement made provision for retroactive financing of a part of
program implementationcosts incurred prior to effectiveness. About three-quarters of the
Bank's disbursementswent into the Health Fund, with the remaining quarter used, at
Government's request, to advance funds to UN agencies for procurement of some
commodities and to make direct payments to suppliers. Flow of GoG and Health Fund
monies to BMCs in the regions and districts experienced some delays because
disbursementswere made on the basis of financial reporting, for which many BMCs had
difficulty,initially, completing. Financial flows improved as experiencewas gained and
districtsvisited expressed great appreciation for the additional liquidity at their disposal
which greatly facilitateddistrictplan implementation.

3.27     Budgeting, Planning, Financial Management. Objectivesto strengthen and
decentralizeplanning, budgeting and financialmanagement were substantially achieved.
While data are incomplete, they do indicate (and are corroborated with findings fi-om
field visits) that by the end of the Bank project, the staffing of BMCs with fiduciary
officers was achieved and BMCs were routinely preparing plans and budgets encompassing
all fimdingsources. By the mid-point (1999) of the POW92 percent of BMCs had satisfied
eligibilitycriteriapermitting them to manage and account for funds received, and these
BMCs were providing timely quarterlyincome and expenditure reports on all sources of
financing. In short, the BMC concept became firmly establishedwith strategic
improvements in capacitybuilding, planning, budgeting, and financialmanagement.

 3.28     However, sector institution building under the SWAPfell short of apectations. In
  1996the GhanaHealth Service (GHS) was establishedunder Act 525 as an autonomous
 executiveagencyresponsible for health services deliverythrough the public health system.
 Thisreform was articulatedin Ghana's MTHS and grounded in the national constitution,
 which called for a separationof the policylregulatory kctions (theresponsibilityof sector
 ministries)fi-omservicedelivery functions (to be assumedby new sector servicesagencies).
 The implementationof thzs refonn was plagued by a number of issuesincluding: the lack of
 clarityof roles and responsibilitiesand complementaritiesbetweenMoH and GHS, the
 duplicationof servicesbetween the two agencies,the weak capacityof MoH aftermost
 senior staff left ths agency tojoin the GHS and were replaced with less experienced staff,
 and the failureto reviewfadopt the legislativeinstrument to implementAct 525. While these
 issueswere repeatedlyraised in summit (and other) meetings and documented in progress
 reports,they persisted throughoutthe POWimplementationperiod, causingconfusion and
 inefficienciesin health sector operations,especially at the national level. The MoH also
 failed to expand its servicecapacitythrough the development of contractual arrangements
 with the NGO and private-for-profit sector.

 (B) Achievement of Health Outputs

 3.29     This sectiondrawsheavily on the analysisof GDHS data (1998,2003) that reveal
 trends in key indicators of health servicesperformance and health status,roughly coinciding
 with the implementationperiod of the POW(1997-2001) and the IDA credit (1998-2002).
 Annex F presents overallnationaltrends, and Annex G disaggregates this data to show trends
 for the poorest and richest wealth quintiles, rural and urban populations and the three
northern regions and the equityof health services utilization and health statusis assessed. It
 is criticalto note that the trends emanating from thesetwo surveys must be interpreted with
caution. Definitions, the way in which data were collected and presented, and timeframes for
these indicators differ from one surveyto the other. Annexes F and G includedetailed
annotationto highlight and clarifythese differencesfor careful and accurate interpretation of
the data. Confidenceintervals and standard errors drawn fiom GDHS reports are provided in
these annexes. This section also draws on IEG's analysis of household data (Annex H) and
on MoH serviceindicators.

Objective #I: Provide universal access to basic health services and improve the quality
and efficiency of health services

3.30      Thenzajority of health service and healtlz outcome targets establislzed by GoG
for the end of PoW I (2001) were not achieved. Table F.7 in Annex F provides an
overview of performance in achieving these targets and the following paragraphs provide
highlights. Table F.7 also reveals that POWbaselines and targets for health indicators,
established in 1997,were not updated in 1998 on the basis of newly available GDHS
data. The differences between the estimated (1997) and real (1998) POWbaselines was
significant for some indicators. A number of real baselines (GDHS 1998) were much
closer in value (in some cases almost equal) to end-of-program targets than to the
estimated baselines (e.g., infant and under-five mortality, immunization coverage, use of
oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea and tuberculosis cure rate). Actual baseline fertility
exceeded the program target. However, program targets were never adjusted
accordingly.

 3.31    Between 1998 and 2003 thepercent of children aged 12-23months, who were
 fully vaccinated7rosemodestlyfrom 62 to 69percent and overall equity irz vaccination
 coverage improved. Rates for the poorest and rural residents rose faster than those for
 their counterparts belonging, to the highest wealth quintile and living in urban areas,
 respectively; and rates in the northern regions rose at the same rate as the national
 average. TheDPT3 target coverage of 80percent was achieved. However, the
 improvement was marginal since the real (GDHS 1998)baselineof 72percent was
 considerablyhigher than thePoW's baseline estimate of 49percent (Annex F, Table
 F.S)." Immunization ratesfor thepoor, rural residents and northernpopulations are
 still unacceptably low (Annex G, Table G.l, G.2 and G.3). Immunization remains one
 of the most cost-effective public health interventions.

 3.32    Despite the highpriority accorded to malariaprevention and control in the
 PoW,very littleprogress was achieved between 1996 and 2003. Annual health sector
 reviews reported a very low level of use of insecticide treated bednets (ITN) (less than 1
 percent each year) from 1996to 1999, and no data was available from MoH for 2000-
 2001. DHS data for 2003 indicate that less than 4 percent of children slept under an ITN
 the previous night. This level is extremely low, given the effectiveness of ITN use for
 preventing malaria. The affordability of malaria treatment appears to be prohibitive for
 some. The average user fee for malaria treatment was 105,776 in 2001, with regional
 variations averaging 73,846 in the northern belt, 141,443in the middle belt and 124,237
 in the southern belt (MoHstatistics). A study in Kassena-Nankana District (Upper East
 region) found that, while the cost of malaria care wasjust one percent of the income of
 the richest households, it was 34 percent of the income of the poorest. The number of
 malaria cases that consulted the public health system increased by 50 percent from 2.0
 million in 1997to 3.0 million in 2001, but trends in the total number of cases in Ghana
 are not known.

 3.33    Interviews,field visits and documentation all indicatethatpriority disease
programs may sufferfrom (a) almost exclusive use of earmarkedfunds for tlzeir
filtanci~zg;and (6)failure of districtsto devote adequate attention and resources to
their implementation. MoH's strategy not to use its own resources to finance priority
interests of donors (malaria and HIVIAIDS, for example) is pragmatic because it makes
sense both to make effective use of funding earmarked for these programs and because it
has proven effective to raise additional resources for these programs. However, this has
also undermined the reliability and sustainability of financing. The malaria and
HIVIAIDS financing provided to the MoH is virtually all externally financed. Recent
analysis of HIV/AIDS accounts has revealed, however, that the financing of health sector
activities is inadequate to the needs (GhanaAIDS Commission, 2004). Districts are
reported to be still counting on parallel financing of priority programs through the central
programs and are thus not likely to use their discretionary financing to support program
activities.



47Full vaccination includes BCG, 3 doses of DPT and polio (not including Polio 0) and one dose of
measles. Beginning in 2002, the three doses of DPT were replaced with DPT/HepB/HiB (Annex F, Table
F.5).

 3.34     The use of oral relzydratioiz therapy (ORT)for treating diarrhea iiz children
 undercfive did not change significantly between 1998 and 2003.49In 1998,67 percent of
 children under three years with diarrhea were treated with ORT, and this proportion was
 64 percent in 2003, indicating no substantial change (Annex F, Table F.6). In 1998 8
 percent of child diarrhea cases received no treatment and this rate increased to 13percent
 in 2003. While the rural and northern populations had rates of ORT use close to the
 national average in 2003, inequities persisted between the poorest and richest income
 quintiles (with respective rates of 60 and 78 percent) (Annex G, Tables G.1, G.2 and
 G.3). There is considerable scope to increase the coverage of treatment of child diarrhea
 both nationally and especially for the poor, which is both a cheap and effective way of
 fighting child morbidity and mortality.

 3.35    Utilization of ante-natal care services was consistently high between 1998 and
 2003, and actual coverage of this service is equitable. In 1998, 88 percent of women
 who gave birth five years preceding the survey reported at least one visit with a doctor,
 nurse or midwife during their pregnancies. This level increased to 92 percent in 2003
 with the important caveat that auxiliary nurses were added to the "skilled worker"
 definition, so exact comparisons are not possible (Annex F, Table F.6). Poorest, rural
 and northern populations had greater rates of increase between 1998 and 2003 than rates
 for the richest, urban residents and the national average, thus improving equity (Annex G,
 Tables G.l, G.2 and G.3).

 3.36    By contrast, national ratesfor deliveries attended by skilled workers remained
 at unacceptably low levels, and inequitiesin the use of these services were extremely
 high between thepoor and rich, rural and urban residents, andfor northern
populations compared with Ghana as a whole. In 1998 of all births in the previous
 five years, only 44 percent were attended by a doctor, nurse or midwife. In 2003,47
percent of all births in the previous five years were reported to be attended by a skilled
worker (Annex F, Table F.4). The rate for 2003 was based on an expanded definition of
a skilled worker, which also included an auxiliary nurse, and thus is not likely to reflect
any real increase. Even with the inclusion of an auxiliary nurse in the definition of
skilled workers, in Ghana on average less than one half of all births are attended. Use of
these services by the richest quintile is four and one half times the level of the poorest
quintile, urban residents are more than twice as likely to use these services as their rural
counterparts, and the rate of use in the north is less than half the national average (Annex
G, Tables G.l, G.2 and G.3).

3.37    Exemptionsfor vulnerablepeople may have hadpartial success in lifting
finaizcial barriers to health services utilization. However, they were insufficient in
allowing them to takefull advantageof available services and are not sustainable.
Available data indicates significant increases in exemptions for pregnant women using
antenatal services (from 2.6 billion cedis in 1997to 3.5 billion in 2000), persons over 70
years (from 0.7 billion in 1997to 1.3billion in 2000), and children under 5 (from 54
million in 1998to 3.0 billion excluding Greater Accra Region, in 2000). High utilization
of antenatal services by all vulnerable groups is a likely outcome of such increases.


49According to the GDHS 2003 definition, ORT includes oral rehydration salts (ORS),recommended
home fluids (RHF) or increased liquids.

 Exemptions for paupers remained virtually unchanged (at 0.4 billion cedis); and data
 were not available for psychiatrylleprosy (Annex E, Table E.8). An estimated 3.6 percent
 of the recurrent budget was spent on exemptions in 2001. However, user fees are
 reported (MoH, 2001) to have risen faster than exemptions, and the poor were not
 necessarily the primary beneficiaries of exemptions (WorldBank 2003). It has also been
 documented that budgets for exemptions amounted to far less than actual exemptions.
 For example, the Northern Region, which performed very well in making exemptions
 available to clients, received a total of 1billion cedis to cover for exemptions in 2000, but
 total claims for that year amounted to 2.2 billion cedis. While DANIDA financed the
 difference for that particular year, the following year only 1.6billion cedis were made
 available to this region against a total claim of 2.6 billion cedis for 2001. Interviews with
 regional and district level staff noted the difficulties in honoring exemption policy when
 they are not reimbursed for these costs. It has also been found that under the "cash and
 carry" (drugs cost recovery) system, incentive has been stronger for health staff to
 generate resources for their facilities than to ensure the protection of the poor against
 financial barriers to access (Mofl, Bulletin of Health Information, Vol I, Number 2 and 3,
March 2002).

 3.38    Efforts and outcomes of service quality improvements were not well
 documented andpatient satisfaction was not systematically monitored. The adoption of
the practice of auditing maternal deaths is likely to have contributed to improved service
 quality. Another investment in quality was the establishment of quality assurance teams
 in some facilities and an increase in supervision. The program objective of monitoring
patient satisfaction through surveys was not achieved. Teaching hospitals did not carry
out patient satisfaction surveys. Regional hospitals improved their reporting from 33
percent of hospitals reporting in 1998 to 89percent in 1999, and subsequently stopped
reporting in 2000-2001. District hospitals for the most part did not carry out patient
surveys during 1997-2001, with the notable exceptions of routine surveys for all district
hospitals in the Eastern Region and 12 surveys for district hospitals in Brong-Ahafo.
Unfortunately, annual reports only recorded the number of patient satisfaction surveys
carried out, providing no information on the findings of these surveys.

3.39    Program investrneizts helped increase theproduction of Jzuman resourcesfor
health, essential to quality, but improved staffing of healthfacilities was undermined
by significant brain drain and inequitable distribution of health workers across the
country. Ghana's success in expanding and restructuring pre-service training culminated
in a quadrupling of state registered nurses (SRN) training intake since 1995. Average
annual output during POWI was 395 SRNs; 125post SRN Midwifery; 110 ENICHN
Midwifery; 162community health nurses and 52 environmental health assistants.
Shortages of inputs, staff, infrastructure, equipment and learning materials have
undermined the efficiency of SRN schools. Ghana also produced about 120doctors and
80 pharmacists, annually, with medical and pharmacy schools noted to be working at full
capacity. However, attrition rates following graduation are high, such that graduates
going to work in Ghana's health system on an annual basis just make up for staff loss
through attrition. Low motivation and remuneration of health workers, combined with a
high demand for Ghana's health workers overseas, add to the problem. Inequitable
distribution of scarce human resources across Ghana is exacerbated by the refusal of
some to be posted in remote areas. A US$4 million package to provide incentives to

those posted in hardship areas was developed at the end of POWI. In 2001 the doctor to
population ratio was 20,036, ranging from a high of 58,493 in the Northern Region to a
low of 8,288 in the Greater Accra Region. The nurse to population ratio for that same
year was 1,728, ranging from a high of 3,149 in Brong Ahafo (and 2,509 in the Northern
Region) to a low of 1,211 in the Eastern Region (and 1,280 in the Greater Accra Region)
(data on file in IEG). Considerable investment in Masters programs has contributed to
the increased specialization of Ghana's health work force."

3.40       Health services efficiency has not improved notably during Po WI. Over and
above the failure to prioritize adequately the implementation of key health interventions,
particularly as a result of integration and decentralization, health facilities services are
inadequately utilized. Program indicators are not a perfect measure of service efficiency:
national average bed occupancy was 59 percent in 2001, excluding (higher-occupancy)
psychiatric hospitals; and the hospital admissions rate increased only modestly from 30 to
35 percent. More significantly, at the end of 2001 hospitals were still providing primary
health care services, which are more cost-effectively delivered by lower-level facilities;
and the referral system is not well defined or developed. Furthermore, at the end of 2001
the potential for contributions from non-governmental health service providers remained
largely untapped. At the start of POWI a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was
developed and a consensus meeting was held with the Christian Health Association of
Ghana (CHAG)." No contracts were signed in 1997-1999, but 43 contracts were finally
signed with CHAG institutions in 2000. No contracts were signed with the private sector.
Given that there were an estimated 1,296non-governmental health facilities in Ghana in
2004 (MoHdata)52,the 43 CHAG institutions, which did have signed contracts, represent
a mere 3 percent of these facilities.

Objective #2: Foster linkages with other sectors in the Borrower's economy to reduce the
population growth rate, reduce the level of malnutrition, increasefemale education, increase
access to water and sanitation, and reducepoverty.

3.41       TheMoH undertook a number of initiatives tofoster inter-sectoral action to
influence key determinants of health. MoH: disseminated family planning information
(through active collaboration with the National Population Council); contributed to
poverty alleviation (through the financing of exemptions and its contributions to the
preparation of the national poverty reduction program); enhanced cross-sectoral
collaboration at the district level (through participation in relevant subcommittees, and
collaboration with other sectors on key health activities -- especially on immunizations
and guinea worm eradication); addressed malnutrition (through the passage of an act on



50Ninety masters programs were awarded in 2000 to staff working in all regions, in a number of
disciplines: health economics, health promotion, information sciences, hospital management, tropical
medicine, medical electronics, occupationaltherapy, radiology, Short specialization courses were awarded
in nutrition, reproductive health, and health services management. Ghana's requirement for specialized
staff is still not fully met.

51CHAG is an umbrella organization that coordinates the activities of the Christian Health Institutions and
Christian Churchs' health programs in Ghana. It is the body through which most of the Christian Church
programs and facilities liaise with MOWto ensure proper collaboration and complementarity.

52Including mission, quasi-governmentand private facilities.

 salt iodization and a Legislative Instrument on breastfeeding, although enforcement of
 these has been inadequate); addressed school health (through some collaboration with
 Ministry of Education on the School Health Programme). However, MoH reports that its
 contributions were suboptimal with regard to water and sanitation, girls' education and
 food supplementation. Constraints to inter-sectoral collaboration identified by MoH
 included: failure to identify common needs, goals and objectives across agencies; and
 weak or non-existent institutional arrangements for such collaboration (no definition of
 roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for planning, financing, implementation,
 monitoring and evaluation).

 (C) Overall Health Outcomes

 3.42        Between 1998 and 2003 there were no improvements in child health
 outcomes. GDHS data reveal that there were no statistically significant changes in infant
 and under-five mortality53during this period (Annex F, Table F.1). Infant mortality was
 57 per 1000 live births in 1998 and 64 in 2003,54and under-five mortality was 108 in
 1998 and 111 in 2003,55ending the long trend of improvements recorded since
 independence (Chapter I). Likewise, there was no statistically signiJicant change in
totalfertility (4.6 in 1998 and 4.4 in 2003) (Annex F, TableF.2).56

3.43         GDHS data on malizutrition reveal no major trends of improvemerzt. Severe
stunting of children under the age of 5 years was 9 percent in 1998 and 11percent in
2003. The proportion of children under five who were severely underweight did not
change, estimated to be 5 percent in 1998 and again in 2003. Likewise 1.4percent of
children under five were severely wasted in 1998; and in 2003 this proportion remained
at the same level (1.3 percent) (Annex F, Table F.7). XEG's analysis of household
survey data on stunted and underweight children show that 2003 ratesfor each
indicator are no different tlzan rates in 1988 (Annex H) corroborating tlze series of
GDHS survey data (Annex F, Table F.l). According to these data in 1988 and again in
2003 one in four children is stunted and one in four children is underweight.



3.44        The outcome of the Health Sector Development Project is nloderately
unsatisfactory, based on ratings of relevance, efficacy and efficiency summarized in
Table 3-3.




53 For the five-yearperiod preceding GDHS surveys.

54GDHS 1998provides the confidence interval for the 10-year infant mortality average, but not for the
five-year average, which is more appropriate for this assessment. The confidence interval for the 2003 rate
is 55-73.

5SLikewise, GDHS 1998 does not provide the confidence interval for the five-year average of under-five
mortality. The confidence interval for the 2003 rate is 99-123.

s6Confidenceintervals cited in GDHS:4.3-4.8 for 1998and 4.2-4.7 for 2003. The 1998 fertility rate is the
average for the five years preceding the survey, while the 2003 fertilityrate is for the three preceding years.

 3.45          The overall relevance of the project is substantial. Its objectives are derived
 ffom a five-year health sector program, which is a component of Ghana's PRSP. Its
 objectives are relevant to three of the five pillars of Ghana's PRSP (human resources
 development; implementing special programs for the vulnerable and excluded; and
 ensuring good governance through accountability and transparency), which targets
reductions in under-five mortality, maternal mortality and infant mortality. Its objectives
are also relevant to the Bank's most recent CAS (WovldBank, 2004), which includes a
human development and services pillar and which aims to improve the health and
nutrition status of women and children, improve access to quality obstetric care and
increase healthy behaviors. The project's SWAP design supports Ghana's goal to assume
leadership in the strategic management of its health sector and in the coordination of
technical and financial assistance to the sector. However, the design was deficient in that
the sector program results chain and causal links were not clearly laid out, nor were the
indicators and M&E plan and system sufficiently developed to enswe the proper tracking
and linkage of the various components of the program logframe.

3.46           Efficacy in improving service access, quality and efficiency of services was
modest overall. This rating is based on the facts that the majority of POWI targets was
not met (Annex F, Table F.7) and that changes in key health indicators between 1998 (the
year of project effectiveness) and 2003 were not statistically significant (Annex F). The
objective to strengthen inter-sectoral coordination was met only modestly (para. 3.40).

3.47           Project efficiency was modest, overall. The increased financial resources for
health were not used more efficiently. Trends indicate a growth in investment and
salaries budgets to the detriment of recurrent budgets (for administration and services).
There is still inefficiency in how the expenditures are allocated across regions. Likewise,
little progress was made in motivating and rewarding health managers and workers to be
posted to hardship areas, leaving the distribution of human resources for health
chronically inequitable. Hospital occupancy rates reveal an under-utilization of this level
of service. Furthermore, hospitals still deliver primary health care services, which are an
expensive proposition, and a referral system defining the different levels of services
offered at the different levels of the health system had not been developed by the
program's end. The underutilization of the non-governmental sector in the delivery of
health services is also an indicator of inefficiency. During the life of the project the
integration and decentralization of health programs and services led to inefficiencies in
the delivery of these programs at the district level, with priorities accorded these
programs by the districts not always commensurate with the epidemiological justification

 for action. While the benefits of two Summit meetings every year and similar meetings
 at regional and district levels are evident, the costs and opportunity costs of these
 meetings have not been calculated. Chronic overlap and competition between MoH and
 GHS also undermine efficiency.

 3.48       The project's risk to developmentoutcome is modest. The achievement of
 health outcomes, especially among the poor, remains a priority for GoG, as articulated in
 the PRSP. The SWAP is well established, with a follow-on five-year program (POW11,
 2002-2007) to be completed this year, and is likely to continue receiving the support of
 Government and its partners. Nevertheless, the SWAP is undergoing changes that will
 need to be managed to minimize the risks of health outcomes not being maintained or
 improved. Among these changes are: (a) the move of a number of partners away from
 pooled program financing and to general budget support, which requires adjustment of
 systems and processes for mobilizing and accounting for financial resources and for
 reporting on results; (b) the establishment of a National Health Insurance Scheme, which
 is replacing "cash and carry" cost recovery and assuming responsibility for protecting the
 poor's access to health services; and (c) significant staff turnover, both within GoG and
 among partners, that will require renewal and adjustment of Ghana's relationship with its
 health partners.

 3.49      Bank Performance. The Bank's performance during preparation was
satisfactory. The Bank's team had a strong technical capacity and health officials report
 that it was highly credible with Government in its technical discussions, providing
valuable technical input and guidance to the preparation of POWI. Perhaps even more
 importantly, the Bank's team recognized the strong leadership and technical capacity in
MoH at the time of preparation and was reported to be an effective listener and respectful
 and supportive of its potential for leadership. As a strong proponent of the SWAP for
 Ghana, the Bank's team was proactive in undertaking intensive advocacy work inside of
the Bank, successfully convincing, with the support of its managers, decision-makers at
the highest levels (legal, financial, procurement) to allow more creativity, flexibility and
client orientation in the Bank's procedures in support of a SWAp. The Bank was also
instrumental in catalyzing Ghana's health partners to work in a SWAPmode. The Bank
was the only one among all partners that put 100percent of its health support into the
Health Fund, the other Health Fund contributors having some projects/parallel financing
in addition to pooled financing. An important caveat to the Bank's (otherwise) excellent
performance during preparation was its failure to guide and support the development of a
sector-wide logframe, with a well articulated results chain and a viable M&E plan and
system that would have monitored more effectively health sector performance and


3.50       The Bank's performance during implementation was nzoderately satisfactory.
Supervision missions were regular, timed around the Health Summit meetings, and the
quality of the technical team is reported by informants to have remained high, despite a



57While the Bank's team has noted that considerable discussion and debate did in fact take place around
the challenge of program M&E, IEG could find no evidence of the production of a viable M&E plan and
system in the official POWdocument (MoH, 1996)or in any other MoH document reviewed covering the
POWimplementationperiod. The list of 20 program performance indicators shown in Annex E, Table
E.1I, was insufficient, as noted in Box 3-5, and in MoN 2001.

 change in task manager. By the very nature of the SWAp, dialogue and the quest for
 learning and improving through annual reviews remained prominent and actively pursued
 by the Bank and its partners. However, it was noted by a few informants that while the
 Bank task manager contributed significantly to the Summit Meetings, around which
 missions were timed, these missions did not include field visits to Ghana's regions. The
 Bank did have a full-time staff in the Ghana office who undertook frequent site visits, but
 this did not replace the needed technical supervisions by the HQ-based staff. Even in the
 context of a SWAp, the Bank neglected two important issues: inadequate program M&E
 and the tensions, duplications and competition between the MoH and the GHS.

 3-51      Borrower's Performance. Government's performance was moderately
satisfactory. It was successful in preparing for and implementing the semi-annual Health
 Summits and in carrying out procurement and financial management in a manner
 satisfactory to the Bank. It did, however, fall short of its financial obligations in support
 of POWI implementation. Ownership of the POWwas strong. Its relationships with
partners and stakeholders were strong. However, it has been noted by many informants
 that civil society participation in Health Summits was inadequate. The Borrower
deserves praise for the candor with which its monitoring reports were written, both
annual and the end-of-POWI reports. They were issues-oriented and focused on the
resolution of bottlenecks to smooth and efficient implementation and on efforts to
improve performance. While some indicators were changed at the end of POWI, in
preparation for (improved) POWI1monitoring, and while considerable effort was given
to strengthening the health MIS, the hndamental deficiencies of program M&E were
never addressed. Performance management through performance contracts was never
fully or successfully implemented.

3.52       Monitoring and Evaluation was modest for reasons noted in Box 3-5.

While it supported the same strategic objectives, it emphasized much more strongly than
the first POWthe importance of reducing inequalities in health outcomes Cpoor/rich,
rurallurban, and across regions). A number of observations and lessons from
implementation of the first POWguided the strategic focus of the second one. These
included low availability and use of health services; growing financial barriers to access;
unresponsiveness of health services to demand; underexploited potential of non-
governmental providers; significant brain drain of human resources for health; low sector
efficiency and lack of performance incentives and low per capita expenditure. As shown
in Box 4.1 these challenges are addressed in the POWstrategies.

OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN


4.2       The Second Health Sector Program Support Project was financed by an IDA
credit of US$57.6 million and an IDA grant of US$32.4 million, approved on February 6,
2003 and declared effective on May 22,2003. Its objective is "...to support the
Borrower's Program (the second Health Programme of Work for 2002-2007 -POW 11)to
improve the health of the Borrower's population, while reducing geographic, socio-
economic and gender inequalities in health and health outcomes."5s Key performance
indicators for measuring program performance are grouped under five categories, in line
with the five strategic objectives of POW11: access, quality, efficiency, partnership and
financing. The 11 key components of POWI1are listed in Box 1.2 and itemized in Annex


4.3       Theprogram implementation arrangements under the Health Sector Support
ProgrdPoW I were continued under this second SWAp operation, notably:
implementation through regular channels and systems of Government, common
implementation arrangements for the MoH and a core group of donors," and a MoU
between Government and these donors. The annual planning cycle defined at the
program's outset was slightlyrevised to improve the approval/availability of financing at
the beginning of the year.

an increasing part (about 75% or more) of their resources into a Health Fund managed by MoH, constituted
the core group of donors. Other donors maintained earmarked funds or projects (USAID, JICA and WHO).
At the time of design, some donors (EU and DFID) were considering moving from sector budget to general
budget support.

 4.4     Program risks were similar to those under the previous operation (insufficient
 political commitment, GoG failure to meet financing commitments and insufficient
 implementation capacity). The challenges of forging partnerships with mission and
 private sectors and of retaining human resources were also raised.

 4.5      With an effectiveness date of May 22,2003, and an imminent closing date of June
 30,2007 the implementation period for this IDA support is 4 years and one month. Total
 program costs were estimated at US$l.l billion (Annex E, Table E-9). Actual costs of
 POWI1 are not yet available. As of end-February 2007, IDA'S financial support of 68
 million SDRs (of which 43.5 million SDRs is credit and 24.5 million SDR is grant
 funding) was 99 percent disbursed.

 4.6     Planned versus Actual Inputs/Activities by ConzponenPo. Most components
 have been implemented, with some caveats. First, some health interventions, which were
 accorded high priority, are still not given sufficient priority in implementation (maternal
 health, outreach activities, and enhanced targeting of services to the poor), while others
 lack efficacy and efficiency (malaria). Second, activities to improve human resources for
 health were partially implemented. Third are shortcomings in efforts to enhance
partnerships with the non-governmental sector and with other public sector agencies and
 to consolidate and render fully functional the institutional and organizational frameworks
 for the MoH and the GHS. Fourth, while some progress in strengthening the health
management information system was made it is not yet fully functional or utilized for
 strategic management. Implementation of the immunization program, on the other hand,
was fully implemented, as was the further strengthening of financing and financial
management systems.

4.7      Legal covenants were few in number and hlly complied with, focusing on
financial flows, financial management and financial reporting and audits; key steps in the
annual SWAP process and their timing (reviews of performance; preparation of
plans/budgets; submission of the budget to Ministry of Finance), and the appointment of
a procurement auditor responsible for reviewing all procurement financed under the
Program.

4.8      Procurement continued to be strengthened, most notably with regard to (a) the
decentralization of procurement to MoH agencies and providers; and (b) the phasing out
of the Bank's practice under POWI of carrying out post-reviews of MoH procurement
and the transfer of that responsibility from the Bank to a procurement auditor.

4.9      Disbursements to BMCs were facilitated as (a) they gained more experience in
submitting financial reports necessary for releasing disbursements; and (b) financial
reporting was simplified and streamlined. However, field visits revealed that there was a
shortage of funds in the latter years of the program. Bank's disbursement pattern
indicates that the lion's share (88%) of the IDA financing was disbursed during 2004 and
2005.

 MONITORINGAND EVALUATION


 4.10    Design. POWI1Sector-Wide Indicators were almost the same as those for POWI.
 No indicators were included to track equity even though this was the theme of POW11.
 POWI1 took note of weaknesses in M&E, specifically that: data are not used
 systematically for decision-making; performance is not linked with resource allocation;
 data collected is of poor quality; sector information does not include the non-
 governmental sector; some performance indicators are difficult to interpret; the use of
 research findings is limited; and baseline data for POWI were lacking. POWI1thus
 resolved: to develop more relevant performance indicators, provide a stronger evidence
 base for policy and practice; build the capacity to monitor contractual arrangements;
 strengthen the capacity for operations research; and improve the use of information
 technology. In its annual report on 2001 (final year of POWI), MoH called for the
 development of sector-wide indicators that would be: aligned with strategic objectives of
 the POW;consistent with the measures for evaluating Ghana's PRS and other
 international commitments of Ghana; supported by the routine information system and
 applicable at the district level; and able to provide scope for monitoring input, output and
 outcome (MoN 2000). The indicators adopted for tracking performance under POW11
 included 9 of the original 20 and 20 new ones. The new ones consist essentially of those
 sector-wide indicators on service delivery performance that were envisaged in the
 original POWI document, but not adopted as part of the 20 indicators agreed with the
 development partners. While these indicators represent an improvement, they do not fill
all the gaps for a coherent M&E framework. Still missing are: more precise indicators on
costs, financing, and utilization of resources; and the tracking of planned vs. actual
interventionslactivities organized around the components of POW11.

4.11    Implementation. As was the case under POWI, MoH/GHS collected data and
reported on selected program indicators. The failure to track inputs and outputs
systematically and to link them to outcomes and impacts has persisted under POW11,
making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of different interventions and approaches.
Financial management and service delivery information are still not linked, which would
facilitate a more comprehensive and rigorous assessment. Operational research on the
cost-effectiveness of specific interventions has been under-funded and pilots have not
been fully evaluated before their expansion nationwide, community-based health
planning and services (CHPS) being a case in point. It has also been noted that sector-
wide indicators have been inappropriate for measuring outcomes of poverty and equity-
related objectives and thus are still in need of revision. Considerable investment has been
made in strengthening the MIS (software, training, decentralization to the district level)
and the quality and reliability of some information is likely to have improved, but there is
still considerable work to be done. An assessment of the health information system was
carried out as input for the 2005 annual Summit, which sought to improve performance in
this regard.

4.12    Utilization. Thanks to the process of regular reporting and review of sector-wide
indicators at all levels of the system, data and infonnation emanating from this process
are indeed used to raise issues and formulate and implement recommendations for
improved sector performance. However, the inadequacy of these indicators undermines

 the potential for corrective action. Performance agreements are signed between MoH and
 its implementing agencies, but still not used to track and ensure acc~untabilities.~'



 Project Objective:Support the Borrower's Program to improve the health of the Borrower's
population, while reducinggeographic, socio-economicandgender inequalities in health and
 health outcomes through improvements to access, quality, efpciency, partnership and
financing.

 4.13     Health financing continued to increase under PoW11, but concerns about
 equity and effiencypersist. GoG's 2006 budget for health amounts to 15percent of
 total GoG budget, meeting the Abuja target.64Of the total GoG recurrent budget 14.5
 percent was spent on health, exceeding the target of 13percent. The proportion of the
 non-wage recurrent health budget spent at the district level rose to 48 percent in 2005,
 exceeding the target of 42 percent, However, growth in the wage budget has not been
 matched by an increase in the servicebudget and there is a persistent trend of increased
 funding to the hospital sector at the expense of primary health care services.
 Overspending on the capital and personal emoluments budgets have forced an
underspending on non-wage recurrent (service and administration) budgets, causing
district and subdistrict services to be underfunded. Other financing issues, which have
undermined availability of funding for district and subdistrict services include:
unpredictability of financial releases, timeliness of financial reporting, persistently
complex disbursement procedures and consequently slow disbursement procedures. The
source of revenue for health is changing in three main ways: (1) the national health
insurance fund was established in 2003 and will replace internally generated funds
through cost recovery; (2) some of the partners contributing to the Health Fund have
shifted to budget support; and (3) there has been a reduction in partners' contribution to
the Health Fund relative to earmarked funds.

4.14     Exemption funding lzas increased, but is still inadequate; and current
exemptionprovisions are notJivlancially sustainable. Health facilities have not been
reimbursed for exemptions incurred. Existing exemption arrangements are estimated to



6' The Bank's team has pointed out that the introduction of national health insurance during POWI1 (in
2005) changed the dynamics and challenges of sector management, specifically the relevance of systems
and processes for performance monitoring and resource allocation. The fact remains that performance
monitoringand resource allocation were repeatedly raised by many informants as critical systems which
are in need of strengthening. A proposed IDA-financedHealth Insurance Project (scheduled for mid-2007
approval)includes support for the development of performance-based health care provider payment
mechanisms.

62As of end-February WSPSP I1 is 99% disbursedand is scheduled to close in June 2007. While a PPAR
on this project will not be undertaken until an ICR will have been completed and GDHS 2008 data will be
available, some assessment of this program is worth incorporating into this review as some trend data on
servicesis available through 2005.

63This sectionprovides a summary of program outcomes. More detail is provided in a matrix on program
objectives and targets, prepared by IEG, and available in IEG files.

for the health sector.

 cost over 600 billion cedis (US$66million). The national health insurance scheme is
 slated to assume the role of protecting the poor, but this is unlikely to happen until
 coverage of this scheme increases beyond 50 percent. There is a need to sustain
 protection of the poor through exemptions,but more selectivity and precision (in the
 definition of beneficiaries and types of services) is warranted.

 4.15    The expansion of community health services aizd the support ofpriority health
 interventions have improved availability of services. However, underfinancing of
 district health services and thefailure to reimburse districtfacilities for exemptions
 haveput them infinancial difficulty and compromised the regularity of these services,
 as well as their accessibility to thepoor. Under POW11to date considerable progress
was made in extending the Community-based Health Planning and Services Strategy
 (increasing from 19 compounds in 2001 to 270 in 2005). More effort was devoted to
malaria, TBIDOTS, and nutrition than under POWI. Nevertheless, inadequate funding of
priority health and nutrition interventions was raised as an issue both in annual sector
reporting as well as during field visits and district failure to accord priority to these
 services in district budgets and plans were raised. Measles and DPT coverage remained
high at 83 and 85 percent, respectively, but have not yet met the end-of-POWtarget of 95
percent. ANC coverage declined fiom 98 percent in 2001 to 89 percent in 2005, while
the percent of deliveries attended by a skilled health worker increased modestly fiom 50
percent to 54 percent. A 2004 survey of women (NetMark 2004 Survey, Insecticide
T~eatedNets in Ghana) carried out in five geographically dispersed cities in Ghana
revealed that 13percent of children and 8 percent of pregnant women slept under an ITN
the previous night, with still more sleeping under untreated nets and baby nets. This
would indicate a favorable trend over the less than 1percent rate documented by MoH in
its 1999 annual review, but falls far short of the target of 56 percent for POW11.

4.16    Annual reports provide izo indication ofprogress in institutionalizing quality in
all healthfacilities. Quality management and supervision are reported to be undertaken
but the nature, frequency and impact of this work has not been documented. Reports do
indicate that measuring quality poses problems for the sector and that currently utilized
indices are not appropriate.

4.17     Tlzere has not been a significant improvement in sector efficiency thusfar
during theprograin period. Current utilization of hospital beds indicates persistent
overcapacity and inefficiency of the hospital sector, but progress has been made in the
definition of a referral system that should provide the framework for more efficient
utilization of health services. Furthermore, no progress has been made in resolving the
inefficient functioning of MoH and GHS a decade after the GHS was created. Subjective
interpretations of the roles of MoH and its agencies and duplications in structures and
responsibilities across agencies continue to cause unnecessarily high overhead costs,
which the sector can ill afford.

4.18    The ratios of medical staff to thepopulation have improved slightly during the
program period. In 2005 the doctor to population ratio was 1:17,929, a slight
improvement over the 2001 level of 1:20,036. By the same token the nurse to population
ratio in 2005 (1: 1,508) was more favorable than the 2001 level (1:1,728). Still, wide
variations across regions and between urban and rural areas persist.

 4.19    There has been continuedfailure topromote and exploitparticipation of the
 non-governmental sector in health service delivery. Private sector activities are still not
 taken fully into account in the planning of government services or in the monitoring of
 health services performance. There has been virtually no progress in signing more MoUs
 with the non-governmental sectorto provide health services, a MoU with CHAG still
 being the only one in effect, despite the great number of non-governmental facilities in
 the country and their potential to contribute effectively to national health sector efforts.
 SWAp annual reports have systematically acknowledged this shortfall in performance
 and a specific lesson from POWI, documented in GoG's POWI1notes that "The potential
 for contributions from non-governmental health service providers.. .remains largely
 untapped" (Ministy of Health, 2003).



 4.20    Health,fertility and nutrition outcomes will be available when the results of the
 planned GDHS 2008 are issued. Preliminay data on key irzdicatorsfor 2006 show that
 infant and under-Jivemortality andfertility still have not changed substantially since
 1998 (Figure 1-1) (UNZCEF/MICS, 2006).

 5.1     Annex I presents a synopsis of the SWAP experience to date, broken down by
 SWAP component, and by three distinct time periods coinciding with the health sector's
 PoWs (and the corresponding Bank operations): Pre-SWAP (1991-1997), POWI (1997-
 2001), and POWI1(2002-2007). This matrix reveals many insights about the challenges
 and successes of the SWAP experience, a few of which are highlighted below.

 5.2     Ghana's evolution towards a SWAphas been a long, dynamic and incremental
 process, spanning more than 15years. Some of the seeds of the SWAPwere embedded
 in the HPP IIdesign, which predates the launch of POWI (and the Bank's first health
 SWAP for Ghana) by 6 years. This design envisaged: the definition of a master
 fsamework for cooperative arrangements with NGOs, the establishment of medium-term
 projections of resource availability and sector financing and spending plans, the conduct
 of annual health public expenditure reviews, the design and implementation of a health
 management inf*rrnation system and a related system of sector performance monitoring
 (WorldBank, 1990). However, these actions were incorporated into the project design in
 the form of credit conditionality, an approach which is reported to have undermined

 Government ownership and leadership. After its mid-term review and under the
 leadership of a new TTL who championed the preparation of a SWAp, this project was
 rendered more flexible. It supported critical components of a SWAp, most notably the
 cofinancing of the preparation of the MTHS and POWI and some of the costs of the first
 three Summit Meetings. The preparation and implementation of the following two
 operations (the first and second SWAps) consolidated, fwther strengthened and added to
 these building blocks.

 5.3     Technical andfi~zancialsupportprovided by developmentpartrzer~~~insupport
 of PoWZand I1 implementation culminated irz the building of sector management
 capacity and revolutionized the way Ghanaand itspartners act and interact in support
 of health sector development goals. Under POWI Government assumed a leadership
 position in the management of the sector. The POW1997-2001 became the framework
 for mobilizing and catalyzing the technical and financial support of partners. Under this
 first POWsystems and processes were implemented and refined that facilitated the
 documentation andjoint review of sector performance of the previous year and the
 preparation, review and approval of plans and budgets for the subsequent year,
 Government systems and capacities were developed at central, regional and district
 levels, especially in the areas of procurement and financial management. Reliance on
 these systems enabled the consolidated management of the public budget and pooled
 funding, particularly in the areas of procurement and financial management. The
 certification of BMCs facilitated the decentralization of sector planning, budgeting,
 financing, financial management, and monitoring. Conditionality was limited to actions
 of process rather than policy content, guiding the timely completion of the cycle of sector
planning, budgeting, and monitoring. Under POWI12002-2007 experience was gained
 and refinements to the SWAP process continued.

5.4      Notwithstanding these successes, some capacity building objectives of the S WAp
process have not beenfully achieved under the two SWAP operations supporting Pow1
and IL Established partnerships for the health sector do not yet include the adequate
participation of civil society in sector reviews and planning. The formula for allocation
of resources across regions and districts is not yet sufficiently developed to ensure equity
as well as to reflect the different costs of doing business in different environments. A
sound public expenditure framework is missing, making it difficult to ensure efficient and
equitable use of funding. Various systems that have been developed (planning, financial
management, procurement, performance monitoring) are not synergistic, thus
undermining sector management capacity. The monitoring of process, output and
outcomes is not linked with inputs and activities. Failure to define a results chain for the
sector and to establish links between inputs, outputs, outcomes and outputs makes it
difficult to assess the effectiveness of various approaches or to establish causality
between approaches and outcomes. No real progress has been achieved: to ensure a
sound institutional framework for health by rendering MoH and GHS fully operational,
since the creation of GHS in 1996;to address human resources issues systematically; or




65Especiallythose that contributed directly into the Health Fund and relied increasingly on Government
systems for sector management, procurement and fmancial management: World Bank (through HSSP and
HSPSP 11),DFID, EU, The Netherlands

 to develop and implement a functionalperformance management system that would
 define and monitor accountabilities for results.

 5.5     Capacity building objectives inherent in the SWAP design may never befully
 achieved, but rather are likely to be refined, or even redefivled, in light of the emerging
 issues and challenges of a constantlychanging country and sector environment. Two
 major developments in health sector financing bring to light challenges and opportunities
 for such refinement. First, the Bank and other key partners have decided to evolve their
 support to Ghana's health sector from pooled, sector-specific financing to budget support
 (Multi-donor budget support -MDBS), channeled to MoFEP for allocation to health and
 other priority sectors. Second, GoG has recently established a National Health Insurance
 System. Anticipated as an important and sustainable source of health financing, this
 system replaces the "cash and carry" cost recovery scheme and assumes responsibility for
 protecting the access of the poor to basic services. Together these developments demand
 refinements of the SWAP process, among which are: (a) the need to readjust partnerships,
 planning and review processes, and inter-governmental and inter-agency relationships to
 take into account the changing nature of health financing; (b) the need to improve and
 systematize public expenditure monitoring (including incidence analysis) and sector
 performance monitoring and accountability as a means of documenting value and results
 for money to establish more credibility with MoFEP and thus to attract andjustify
 adequate budget support; and (c) the need to review and revise the cycle of sector reviews
 and sector planning exercises, including the Health Summits, in light of the need to
 engage more fully MoFEP in sector dialogue and strategic decisions.

 5.6    Both Government officialsand healthpariners (past and current) iAevttiJed
very distinctphases of their evolvingpart~zershipthat were largely defined around the
critical notions of trust and dialogue. Phase I (prior to 1997),was marked by multiple,
uncoordinated projects, which were characterized by donor decision-making and
micromanagement, whether through heavy conditionality or donor management of
implementation. Mutual trust was reported to be low and dialogue fragmented and
(largely) dominated by donors. Phase 2, which coincided roughly with the latter years of
HPP I1and HSSP's support to POWI implementation (the initiation of the SWAP),was
considered the best performing phase of Ghana's health SWAP history. Donors
recognized and began utilizing COGcapacity and leadership, both through the initiation
of pooled health funding and through capacity building efforts. Dialogue was reported to
be frank, balanced and productive. Issues identified werejointly addressed, GoG
assuming very capably and professionally the leadership and donors financing or
providing directly technical support as value added to GoG efforts. All of those
interviewed reported that the partnership was genuine and seamless, with mutual trust
and the quality of dialogue at an all-time high.

5.7     Phase 3 (largely coinciding with POWI1 - 2002-2007) is marked by a significant
deterioration in the quality and nature of the partnership, and coincides with major
turnover in staff, both among MoH/GHS and its partners. A number of the most senior,
experienced and skilled leaderslmanagers and staff of MoH left for high-level
international posts, and most of those remaining left MoH to join the GHS. MoH posts
were eventually filled by the appointment of morejunior staff, assigned by the new
Government after the 2000 elections and tensions between MoH and GHS undermined
their capacity for collaboration. The group of health experts and authorities representing

 the various partners which pioneered the SWAP in Ghana also left around the transition
 time between POWI and POW11;and their replacements were reported by some not to be
 fully briefed or convinced of the SWAP and some were reported to be morejunior and
 less capable than those they replaced.66Mutual trust is reported by all actors to have
 deteriorated, and dialogue became more strained and adversarial. Partners reported
 frustration with GoG's failure to deliver on key priorities and commitments under the
 PoWS.~~National health informants reported that donors were reneging on the spirit of
 the SWAP in two ways: (a) rather than joint problem solving, donors became more
 removed and critical of health sector performance; and (b) some withheld financing
 because of their dissatisfaction with health sector performance. This was considered by
 nationals to be "old-style conditionality" and further undermined performance. The
 transition by some partners to budget support for all sectors, including health, has also
 undermined the trust of national health sector stakeholders because (a) they are concerned
 that the level of health sector financing may not be maintained with MoEFP deciding on
 allocations across sectors;68and (b) sector dialogue has further deteriorated because (i)
 some donors who transitioned to budget support are withdrawing their health experts
 from the field; and (ii) some national informants have expressed that they see no reason
 further reason to dialogue with health experts as they have little leverage in the context of
 budget support. In short, the threephases have been characterized by a startingpoint
 of low trust and inadequate dialogue,followed by a significant irnprovement in both,
 and, subsequently, a serious deterioration in both.

 5.8      The evolution in the nature of the Bank's (and otherpartners ') support to
 Ghana's health sector over thepast 15-20years laas revealed a tension between the
priorities of health services delivery and outcome, on the one hand, and national
capacity building and utilizationoiz the other. Under HPP 11,in the pre-SWAP phase,
investments and efforts were concentrated around the immediacy of basic service
delivery strengthening and expansion with a view to improving health outcomes.
Capacity, where it was considered to be weak, was brought in from the outside (the
establishment of a PIU, the use of parallel systems, the financing of procurement and
financial management expertise and technical assistance, and pedagogical supervision
and oversight) and strengthened through conditionality and project-financed training, all
with a view to accelerate project implementation and the achievement of objectives. In
contrast and by its very definition, a SWAP seeks to utilize and further strengthen
national capacity and leadership as a primary goal, which, once achieved, is expected to
contribute to improved sector performance and health outcomes. The SWAp's focus on
capacity building objectives was confirmed by key Bank informants and other (Phase 1)
partners, who emphasized that this evaluation of the SWAP should be against capacity
building objectives only and not against the programs, services and outcome objectives
and indicators articulated in Ghana's PoWs. However, given that the development



66It is important to note that national informants reported that the high caliber of technical competence and
support provided by the Bank has been maintained even with periodic changes in the lead health task team
leader.

67Malaria control, reproductive health and the fight against malnutrition, for example.

68This is despite the fact that PRSCs have required that Government guarantee the maintenance of health
financing at its SWAPlevels.

 objectives for the two Bank were articulated around the objectives of POWI and POW11,
 respectively they (a) are indeed accountable for the achievement of those program
 objectives (along with other financiers) and (b) must be evaluated against these, as well
 as against SWAP objectives.

 5.9      Health indicators improved during 1993-1998 under the traditionallydesigned
 HPP 11,thenplateaued during 1998-2003 under thefirst SWApfor PoWL New
 GDHS datafor 2008 willprovide importalzt insight on the trends in health under tlze
 second SWAPfor PoWI& butpreliminay datafor fertility and mortality show izo
 improvementand are causefor concern. Available data on health services performance
 that span the timeframes of the first and second SWAps also indicate an inadequate focus
 of Ghana's SWAP support on results, relative to its focus on capacity building. Key
 service performance data reveal a stagnation in service trends and a failure to achieve
 2005 objectived9for a number of indicators, including: utilization rates, family planning
 acceptors, pre-natal and post-natal care coverage, supervised deliveries by medically
 trained personnel. On the other hand, both immunization coverage and tuberculosis cure
 rates have ililproved. The failure to achieve more significant improvements on the bulk
 of key service indicators needs to be more carefully assessed once service data on the
 final year of POWI1 and outcome data for 2008 become available. Important questions,
 which remain to be answered are (a) "What timeframe for capacity building is needed
 before such efforts should be expected to culminate in improved sector performance and
 outcome?" and (b) "How might a stronger results focus be achieved in parallel with,
instead of subsequent to, capacity building efforts?" Theneglect of monitoring and
evaluation and performance-based management capacity building relative to the very
strong and successful focus onfiduciary (procurementandJiizancial management)
capacity building is likely to have seriously undermined the resultsfocus of the S WAp.

5.10     TheBank has modzped its health sector support to Ghana in two ways. Over
and above its evolution of SWAPPnancingfrom (healtlz-specific)program support to
(general)budgetsupport, it is also developing two traditional investmentprojects to
support Ghana in its efforts to (a)implement a viable national health insurance
scheme (estimatedIDA support of US$15million); and (6)accelerate child survival
through interveiztionsthat have not been very successful to date under PoW Iand PoW
II: thefight against nzalnutrition and malaria control (estimatedIDA support of
US$25million with US10 millionfrom Malaria Booster Program). The rationale for a
standaloneproject for health insurance is strong, given the nature of such assistance. But
the rationale for supporting child nutrition and malaria prevention and control objectives
outside of the Bank's SWAP support is not entirely clear in draft design documents
consulted by IEG. It is possible that these traditional projects, scheduled for mid-2007
approval, will provide additional leverage for dialogue, technical support, targeted
financing and a stronger results focus that may not be as assured under a SWAp.
Nevertheless, this represents a change in the Bank's strategy of support to Ghana's health
sector in the mid-1990s, which strongly advocated an increase in pooled sector financing
and the eventual elimination of earmarked funding.




692005 is the fourth year of POWI and the most recent year for which service data are available.

   5.11      Current wisdom about the theoretical differences between a "traditional
  project" and a S WApdo not reflect the Bank's experience in Ghana and need to be
   revisited (Table 5-1).

 6. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

 6.1       The main finding of this evaluation is that the first health SWAP in Ghana has
 strengthened sector stewardship and sector capacity, but has not culminated in the
 achievement of most health sewice delivery and health outcome targets set by
 Government. Between 1998 (when the Bank's first support to SWAP became effective)

and 2003, the POWgoal of improving key health indicators was not achieved. The
SWAPprocess took precedence over a focus on results, and sector dialogue became more
deferential, even on issues of critical importance to sector performance. Had the SWAP
not been undertaken, it is likely that country leadership in health sector development and
oversight and the development and utilization of national capacity in procurement and
financial management would not have been as strong. It is also likely that investment
planning would not have been as transparent. These accomplishments, directly
attributable to the SWAp, are likely to contribute to improved efficiency in the design
and implementation of future PoWs. The following lessons point to opportunities to
improve development effectiveness in the context of a SWAp:

        Success in establishing a process for sector-wide management and dialogue will
        not by itself ensure the achievement of health services performance and outcome
        targets. The absence of a strong results focus, the absence of a viable system and
        incentives for M&E and the failure to move towards a performance-based health
        system to ensure accountabilities can seriously undermine the achievement of
        sector objectives.
       A dialogue between Government and its health partners, which is not sufficiently
       rigorous or frank, can result in the neglect of critical constraints to sector
       performance. The institutional competition and overlap between MoH and GHS
       and the failure to harness the potential of the non-governmental sector for
       delivering health services are issues with both technical and political dimensions,
       which might have benefited from the technical input and leverage of outsiders.
       High priority, high-impact health programs and services risk not being
       implemented as planned if (a) they are financed almost exclusively by earmarked,
       outside funds; and (b) district/local-level autonomy and responsibility for health
       planning and spending are not checked or balanced with the technical and
       strategic knowledge of specialized staff and managers of these priority programs
       (located in the central and regional levels).
       Sector efficiency needs to be measured in order to be achieved. The failure to
       carry out annual public expenditure reviews and incidence analyses, and to define
       fully a program results chain and monitor progress on each link has undermined
       Ghana's ability to measure and fine-tune the development effectiveness of the
       substantial investments in the health sector.

 Confidence intervals which are available through the GDHS are reflected in Annex tables. Many are missing
for the earlier surveys. Still others (on mortality) were cited in the earlier surveys for data on 10-year averages,
but not for five-year averages. IEG has used five-year averages for mortality as the basis of its analysis, as they
are more appropriate for the purposes of this evaluation.

 ANNEX H. Trends in Health Outcomes,Water and
 Sanitation, Based on Household Surveys, 1988-2003

          This annex presents trends in indicatorsof health outcomes (nutritional status of children) and
service use or coverage (immunization,contraceptiveuse, household sources of drinking water and
sanitation), using data from the Ghana Living StandardsSurveys (GLSS) conducted in 1988189,
 1991192,and 1998/99. In addition, in 2003 IEG conducteda re-survey of households in 81 clusters
from the 1988189GLSS with a nearly identical questionnaire, for the purpose of examining changes
in those same clusters over the period 1988-2003. While the 1988189clusters were nationally
representative in that year, when re-interviewedas part of a cluster-levelpanel in 2003, they were not
nationally representative of Ghana. The 1988/89and 1991192surveys were self-weighted; results for
the 1998199surveyshave been weighted.

         Selectedresults are presented by poverty group: rural and urban groups; the lowest and
highest quintile of householdper capitaconsumptionexpenditure;and the "poor" and "non-poor",
defined as all individuals or householdsbelow the median value of household per capita consumption
expenditure of the first of any two surveys,adjusted for inflation. This latter category compares
individuals or householdswith similar absolutelevels of welfare across two adjacent surveys,while
the quintile analysismeasures relative welfare (the lowest and highest 20 percent of individuals or
households). However, because the GLSS fundamentallychangedthe way that consumption
expenditurewas collectedin 1991192and thereafter (shifting from recall to a diary method), absolute
levels of welfare (the poorlnon-poor categories)are not strictly comparable between 1988189 and the
two GLSS surveys that followed (Ghana Statistical Service, 2000), though they are comparable with
the 2003 IEG household survey. In addition, some of the variables were not collected by all four
surveys or were defined differentlyby the questionnaire,and thus not strictly comparable.
