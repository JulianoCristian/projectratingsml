The Project was the second International\n            Development Association (IDA) credit to the health,\n            nutrition, and population sector in Ghana. The objectives of\n            the project were to: (a) improve the quality and coverage of\n            health services; and (b) increase the availability and\n            accessibility of family planning services. The project was\n            originally divided into six components: (a) drug supplies\n            and drug infrastructure rehabilitation; (b) strengthening\n            the Ministry of Health ; (c) regional and district\n            hospitals; (d) primary health care (PHC) ; (e) population\n            and family planning; and (f) a prizes fund to provide\n            incentives to health workers and communities. As a means of\n            improving equity, the project emphasized PHC services in\n            three under-served, northern regions of the country. The\n            Borrower's performance was, on the whole, satisfactory.\n            The overall performance of IDA was satisfactory. Key lessons\n            learned from the project experience are as follows: (a) an\n            overly prescriptive design, having the nature of a\n            multiple-year blueprint, was not appropriate for the type of\n            complex institutional changes that were being addressed; b)\n            moving the management of the project more directly into the\n            mainstream of the MOH was important; (c) the use of the\n            mid-term review was critical to resuscitating the project;\n            and (d) supervision of civil works in the Ghana health\n            sector needs to change."}, "docdt": "1998-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
