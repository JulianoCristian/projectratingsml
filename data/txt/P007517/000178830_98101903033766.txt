INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A., OF MEXICO FOR THE
THIRD ROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in the amount in various currencies equivalent to US$27.5 million to Nacional
Financiera, S.A., of Mexico to cover the estimated foreign exchange cost
of a road project.
PART I: HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank's lending program in Mexico has given considerable emphasis
to highway development. Loans for this purpose were made in 1960 for $25
million, in 1962 for $30.5 million, in 1963 for $h0 million, and in 1965 for
$32 million. The proposed project, which would further expand the Bank's
activities in this sector, was appraised by a Bank mission in February-March
1967. Negotiations were held from September 27 - October 13 and December
11-13, 1967. Negotiators were Lic. Victor Navarrete and Lic. Pedro Galicia
of the Nacional Financiera, S.A., Ing. Diaz Diaz and Ing. Duran Romano of
the Secretariat of Public Works; they were assisted by members of the staff
of their organizations.
3.        The proposed loan, together with the $25 million Rio Colorado Irri-
gation Project, which has recently been recommended, would increase the
Bank's lending to Mexico to $677.6 million (net of cancellations). Mexico
has received no IDA credits. The following is a summary of Bank loans to
Mexico as at December 31, 1967:

4.        Construction and procurement have been generally proceeding satis-
factorily. Delays have occurred in carrying out the 1965 power sector loan
but the Closing Date of Loan 436-ME is being postponed from June 30, 1967,
to March 1, 1968, following approval by the Executive Directors of my recom-
mendation in R67-137. A part of the construction in one district financed
under the 1963 irrigation loan has been postponed pending completion of
studies to improve drainage and cropping patterns. Construction under the
1963 highway loan is now expected to be completed in late 1968, two years
behind schedule, because of delays caused by unusually heavy rains, limited
budgetary allocations, and a larger volume of works than had been estimated
on the basis of preliminary engineering.
5.        Loan negotiations have been completed for the Rio Colorado Irriga-
tion Project and a $25 million loan has been recommended to the Executive
Directors. Mexico has also requested further Bank financing for the power
sector and appraisal is awaiting additional information; in the meantime
arrangements are being worked out with major supplying countries for their
participation in joint financing for the power project.
6.        IFC's total commitment to Mexico amounted to $21.7 million as of
December 26, 1967, of which $h.2 million was held by the Corporation. As
a continuance of IFC's longstanding relationship with Compania Fundidora
de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey, S.A., a recommendation has been made to
the IFC Board for financing a further expansion, which would involve
maximum potential commitments of about $,7.3 million.
PART II: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.   BORRWER:                Nacional Financiera, S.A., a financial agency
of the Mexican Government which, under the
existing Mexican legislation, has to be the
borrower or co-borrower of Bank loans.
GUARANTOR:              United Mexican States
AMOUNT:                 The equivalent in various currencies of
$27.5 million.
PURPOSE:                To finance the estimated foreign exchange
cost of the reconstruction of three primary
roads, the improvement of four tertiary roads,
and the construction of a primary road.
AMORTIZATION:           20 years, with no repayments during the first
4-1/2 years; semi-annual installments beginning
July 1, 1972, to retire the loan on January 1,
1988.
INTEREST RATE:          6-1/4 percent per annum.
COMMITMENT CHARGE:      3/4 of 1 percent.



PART III: THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled:  "Appraisal of a Third Road Project -
Mexico" (TO-602a) is attached.
9.        Mexico has an extensive road system totaling 63,700 km of which over
half is now paved. The project is focused on the improvement and expansion
of sections of this network of priority importance in meeting the needs of
Mlexico's rapidly expanding economy. The project comprises:
(a) the reconstruction and resurfacing of three primary
roads totaling 1,231 km;
(b) the improvement and bituminous surface treatment of four
tertiary roads totaling 885 km; and
(c) the construction, including asphaltic concrete surfacing,
of one primary road, 66 km long, and the acquisition of
the necessary right-of-way.
10.       The planning, construction and subsequent maintenance of the high-
ways in the proposed project is a responsibility of the Secretariat of
Public Works. This Secretariat has a competent staff and extensive ex-
perience in highway construction and maintenance.
11.       The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is estimated
at the equivalent of about $76 million of which the proposed Bank loan of
$27.5 million represents the estimated foreign exchange component. The
balance of the financing for the project would be provided by the Federal
Budget. The proposed loan would be disbursed on the basis of a percentage
of the cost of the project.
12.       Contracts for the project works would be let on the basis of inter-
national bidding except for approximately $3.8 million of contracts, con-
stituting about 7 percent of the total project cost, for bridges over 15 mete.
span and miscellaneous works which would be awarded on the basis of local
competition, The Government has agreed to take several major steps which,
by comparison with past procedures, should encourage broader international
competitive bidding, reduce costs and improve efficiency in construction,
as explained in the appraisal report.
13.       The project is clearly justified on the basis of the substantial
resulting economic benefits, mainly through reducing transport costs. The
estimated rate of return ranges from 12 to 23 percent for the various sections,
with a weighted average of 19 percent for the project as a whole.
PART IV: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
1h.       The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Nacional
Financiera, 3 A., the Draft Guarantee Agreement between-the United Mexican



- 5 -
States and the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Art.
III, Section h (iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
15.       The provisions of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements are similar
to those contained in loan documents for the previous 14exican highway
projects.
PART V: THE EGONONMY
16.       In October 1967 a Report on Recent Economic Performance of Mexico
was submitted to the Executive Directors (R67-160). The report noted that
fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments management continued to be satis-
factory and that the econom-y was growing at a high rate. The maturity
structure of the external debt has been somewhat improved, but the debt
service requirements still weigh heavily on the balance of payments. The
report concluded that continuation of the Government's policies to further
"stretch-out" debt maturities, to limit the volume of new external borrowing
and improve its terms, and to strengthen the current account of the balance
of payments should progressively reduce the debt service burden and maintain
YIexico's good credit standing. No developments have taken place subsequently
which call for a change in the major conclusions of the report. Mexico's
performance continues to be satisfactory. Mexico should be considered
creditworthy for further Bank lending.
PART VI:  COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
17.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII: RECO1004DATION
18.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
"RESOLUTION NO.
Approval of Loan to Nacional Financiera, S.A.
in an amount equivalent to U.S. $27,500,000
to be guaranteed by United Mexican States.
RESOLVED:
TIUT the Bank shall grant a loan to Nacional Financiera, S.A. to
be guaranteed by United Mlexican States, in an amount in various currencies
equivalent to twenty-seven million five hundred thousand United States
dollars (U.S.$27,500,000), to mature on and prior to January 1, 1988, to



- 6 -
bear interest at the rate of six and one-quarter percent (6-1/4%) per annum,
and to be upon such other terms and conditions as shall be substantially in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the form of Loan Agree-
ment (Third Road Project) between the Bank and Nacional Financiera, S.A.,
and the form of Guarantee Agreement (Third Road Project) between United
Mexican States and the Bank, which have been presented to this meeting."
