The project was\n            successful in the establishment of a medium-term framework\n            for structural reform in financial, corporate, and social\n            sectors; and, played a part in Korea's total rescue\n            package. Both the Bank and the Borrower's performances\n            were satisfactory, in light of substantial advances in the\n            reform program, and, accomplishments in policy commitments.\n            The key lessons include: 1) Loan preparation under time\n            constraints is conducive to oversights which may delay the\n            final analysis. These constraints led to pressures during\n            negotiations, causing inefficient delays in loan\n            effectiveness. 2) Initiating policy discussions with top\n            policy makers, is advisable, particularly, under adjustment\n            operations, for, they are who will actually make the\n            decision or commitment on required reform policies. Early\n            discussions with technical staff, led to policy discussions\n            which could not advance. 3) The Bank and the Fund under\n            simultaneous negotiations in policy areas, should present a\n            consistent unified front, for, inconsistencies, can play one\n            institution against the other, as the Bank, under time\n            pressure, accepted non-commital external audit reforms. 4)\n            While single tranche instruments are better suited for a\n            volatile environment, double tranche, offers longer\n            enactment for reforms, and, are administratively less expensive."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
