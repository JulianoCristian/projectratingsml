It\n            builds on the work initiated under the Economic\n            Reconstruction Loan, approved on December 23, 1997. The\n            project will help Korea deal with the immediate foreign\n            exchange crisis as well as support a major program of\n            structural reforms in the financial and real sectors to lay\n            the basis for Korea's eventual return to strong and\n            sustained growth. The structural reform program spans four\n            important areas: a) financial sector restructuring and\n            development; b) corporate sector reform, including reform of\n            corporate governance and competition policies; c) labor\n            market reform and the strengthening of social safety nets;\n            and d) institutional reform in economic policy management.\n            There are some risks to the program. A key risk derives from\n            Korea's still fragile macroeconomic situation, and its\n            continued vulnerability to shifts in investor confidence. To\n            mitigate this risk, the Bank will work closely with the IMF\n            (International Monetary Fund), ADB (Asian Development Bank),\n            and other partners. Another risk arises from the weakness of\n            the domestic banking system. This project will expedite the\n            process of financial sector restructuring and corporate debt\n            workouts. There is also a risk that the economic downturn\n            may be more severe than currently expected, which will be\n            mitigated by the strong safety net measures. The loan will\n            be disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1998-03-19T00:00:00Z"}
