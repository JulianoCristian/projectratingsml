         Project will address the growing scarcity of arable land and\n            the lack of full participation of low income families in the\n            benefits of development. The project is also designed to\n            arrest the rapid depletion of forest and soil resources. The\n            primary mechanism for achieving these goals will be the\n            introduction of stable agriculture, involving appropriate\n            soil and water conservation measures, in place of shifting\n            agriculture, resulting in higher yields and production and\n            substantially reduced soil erosion and forest destruction.\n            The project also provides for: (a) evaluation and\n            strengthening of planning and development management\n            capabilities at the provincial and lower levels; (b)\n            short-term consultancy services for identifying and\n            preparing high priority development projects; and (c)\n            small-scale pilot operations, mainly for agricultural\n            development in rainfed areas of the North and the Northeast."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
