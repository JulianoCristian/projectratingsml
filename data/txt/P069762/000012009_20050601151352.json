A number\n            of lessons of relevance to future operations in Timor-Leste\n            and to operations in other post-conflict situations are\n            provided, lessons especially important in three areas: local\n            governance and institutional development (including in\n            regards to the role of women), project management and the\n            relations with the Government, and the revolving funds. The\n            lack of governmental presence at local levels in the\n            post-conflict situation requires that careful thought be\n            given to how local level institutional development can later\n            be related, to the extent possible, to emerging\n            administrative or representative structures, in order to\n            avoid competing authorities, side-lining of local\n            non-governmental institutions developed, or wasting capacity\n            and skills developed at the local level, which could be of\n            value to the emerging formal structures. Local capacity\n            building should remain a priority throughout a project,\n            particularly with regard to regular leadership training,\n            gender sensitivity training, and training in participatory\n            needs assessment, and project planning. It is important to\n            keep the women in the mainstream of the development process:\n            the establishment of one development council, rather than\n            several bodies in the community, promoted the mainstreaming\n            of women in community development. Gender disaggregating\n            project data is a prerequisite for a development project,\n            while lack of attention to this prevents management from\n            recognizing, and addressing critical gender-related issues\n            appropriately. Finally, it is essential to keep the local\n            governance objective high on the project agenda, and to\n            actively create awareness of this at the national, as well\n            as local levels to ensure that lessons learned are\n            integrated into the policies of the emerging government."}, "docdt": "2005-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
