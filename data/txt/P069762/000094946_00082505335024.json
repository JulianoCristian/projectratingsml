The project consists\n            of three components: a) Community Grants will support\n            development proposals that are produced by villagers for the\n            public good of their communities. Through district level\n            technical specialists and local level facilitators it will\n            provide village men and women with the information,\n            opportunity, and freedom of choice that they need to make\n            informed, responsible, proposals and decisions. b) Cultural\n            heritage will support core activities as follows: i) A small\n            grants program managed by a non-profit Timorese cultural\n            heritage trust will support community-based cultural\n            development programs. ii) The development of a national\n            heritage and performance center will include a small\n            vocational school, rotating displays, and a series of\n            gallery and performance spaces where international and\n            Timorese artists can perform. c) Civil Society Support Fund\n            will aid the development of regional and local Timorese\n            civil society groups who play an important role in\n            galvanizing the communities to work together on\n            reconstruction, thus contribute to the project's\n            objective to build social capital and ensure inclusive\n            patterns of growth."}, "docdt": "2000-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
