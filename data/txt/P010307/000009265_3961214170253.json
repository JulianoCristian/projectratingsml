The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was less than satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, in project\n            development, failure by IDA to understand fully and take\n            adequate account of the priorities of the implementing\n            ministry led to the lack of \"ownership\" of the\n            project on the part of that ministry, which seriously\n            compromised implementation. Second, in project development,\n            failure by IDA to ensure that senior managers understood and\n            supported project strategies for assistance to specific\n            programs resulted in the consequent failure to utilize\n            assistance for those programs. Third, project ownership and\n            implementation difficulties were further exacerbated by the\n            complexity of the project. Fourth, lack of effective project\n            management in the early stages of the project was a key\n            factor in implementation difficulties. Fifth, better\n            familiarization of project staff with IDA procurement\n            guidelines and procedures would have helped to avoid delays\n            in the procurement of equipment, furniture, and supplies.\n            Finally, the frank mid-term assessment of project status\n            carried out by the implementing ministry played a key role\n            in the mid-term revision of the project."}, "docdt": "1996-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
