 Planning Project are to: strengthen management of the\n            Government health system at central and regional levels;\n            increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the health\n            logistics system; and promote lower fertility and improved\n            maternal and child health through increased and more\n            effective use of modern and traditional methods of interval\n            contraception. To achieve the above objectives, the project\n            will finance a combination of institutional development and\n            operational support activities which will address issues\n            such as key health management and planning constraints,\n            including those affecting drug supply, vehicle and equipment\n            maintenance, and strategic planning needs for fertility\n            control. The project will also fund health operational\n            support in two health regions which were selected on the\n            basis of having infrastructure, population characteristics\n            and management capabilities."}, "docdt": "1988-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
