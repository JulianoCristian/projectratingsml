YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
SIXTH EDUCATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Socio-Economic Background
1.01     As late as 1970, the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) was still an isolated
and highly traditional country, with a very low national income derived almost
exclusively from agriculture. The end of the civil war in that year permitted
a start to be made on the pressing task of developing the country. Since
1970, much has been achieved: for example, a central administration has been
established, a small but thriving modern sector of the economy exists, and
many infrastructural projects have been completed. Accomplishments in the
human resources sector are equally impressive. In 1971, 125,000 children were
enrolled in primary schools, representing 12% of the school-age population.
By 1981, this figure had risen to almost 600,000 and represented 49% of the
school-age population. A diversified secondary school system is in existence
and Sana'a University is now well established. However, an inevitable legacy
of the lack of modern education facilities prior to 1970 is a very high
illiteracy rate (79% in 1979), especially among the older age groups, and the
development of the education and training system even to its present state has
been a major challenge to the Government.
1.02     The growth of school enrollments and the education budget are,
therefore, of particular significance. The Government faces the dilemma that
without expanding the school system, it cannot produce the trained manpower
urgently required for national development. However, the result of expanding
the school system is to increase the cost of education and requires the
importation of large numbers of expatriate staff. Government policy has been
to expand the school system as rapidly as possible, and to accept the need
for increased budgetary support for education. Much of the recurrent
education budget is accounted for by the salaries of teachers, and the high
proportion of expatriate teachers in the YAR exacerbates the problem (para.
1.16).
Recent Developments in the Education and Training System
1.03     Education Administration.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) exercises
responsibility for all aspects of formal education below university level,
including provision and administration of teachers, location of schools,
development of curricula and instructional materials, administration of
nation-wide examinations, educational planning and organization of the
inspectorate. It shares management of these tasks with ministry offices in
the governorates. The General Directors of the governorate offices, together
with ministry officials, form an Advisory Council to the MOE which
participates in setting policy. The 11 governorate offices of education have
considerable influence on education within the governorates, at least in part
because of their close relationship with the Local Development Associations



-2-
(LDAs). The LDAs are the focus for local development in the YAR, and consist
of the local community and their leaders. An LDA network exists throughout
the YAR, ancd their local organizations are represented nationally by the
Confederation of Yemeni Development Associations (CYDA) which has its
headquarters in Sana'a.  In recent years, the MOE has consolidated its control
over some fuinctions that have, in the past, been shared with the governorates,
such as decisions about location of schools, in order to rationalize the
functioning of the system.  The MOE is presently engaged in a major review of
all aspects of educational administration. The Second Five-Year Plan
highlights the need for reorganization within the MOE, and an in-depth
analysis of the MOE with assistance from USAID is underway. USAID is also
implementing the early stages of a project for institutional support to the
MOE, which comprises a long-term program of staff training and which   -
supplements the technical assistance under the IDA-assisted third education
project aimed at strengthening MOE's management and planning capabilities.
1.04     Primary Education (Grades 1-6).  Enrollment in primary schools has
been growing rapidly in the YAR. Since 1978/79, the annual rate of increase
has been 33%. Providing classrooms, teachers, and materials has been a major
challenge in recent years and, not surprisingly, the ratio of teachers to
students declined from 1:43 in 1978/79 to 1:49 in 1981/82. The average number
of students per school rose from 147 to 157 over the same period.
1.05     In 1981/82, about 12% of primary school students were girls.  While
up very slightly from 11% in 1971/72, this figure remains the lowest in the
world. It is government policy to provide schooling equally for boys and
girls, and mixed classes in primary schools are not uncommon. Although
strongly embedded social customs limit girls' participation in education,
their numbers in schools grew by 27% from 1979/80 to 1980/81.
1.06     Despite the achievement of the MOE in increasing the numnber of
primary school students, dropout and repetition rates are currently high, with
only about 15% of all first grade students graduating from the sixth grade.
The high attrition rates have several causes. Standards of education are low
in terms of teacher quality; provision of educational materials is limited;
classrooms are overcrowded; and the pupil teacher ratios are high (49:1) on
average. In 1980/81, about 75% of primary schools, with 50% of total
enrollments, were incomplete, i.e., they lacked facilities to accommodate all
six grades of primary schools. The result of incomplete schools is to
terminate prematurely the education of those students enrolled in them which
in turn is reflected in high dropout rates. In addition, young boys leave
school prematurely to work on farms, and traditional attitudes to women's
education also probably account for some early leaving amongst girls.
1.07     The Government is attempting to improve the retention rates as
rapidly as possible. In the Second Five-Year Plan, priority is being given to
additional classrooms required to complete existing schools. The total number
of qualified teachers has risen dramatically in recent years (para. 1.16),
with untrained Yemeni teachers being replaced by trained expatriate teachers.
There is now every likelihood that the above measures, together with
improvements in economic and social conditions, will substantially improve
retention rates. However, it will be several years before improved retention
rates translate into significantly larger numbers in postprimary education.



-3-
1.08     Secondary Education (Grades 7-9 and 10-12).  Lower secondary schools,
called preparatory schools in YAR, are open to all students who have passed
the primary school leaving examination. Almost all students at this level
follow a general program. Exceptions are those who attend vocational training
centers (VTCs) or who enter the new five-year teacher training program (para.
1.18). Enrollment in lower and upper secondary schools has been increasing
from a small base by 20% annually from 1978179 to 1981/82. Enrollments in
lower and upper secondary schools in 1981/82 were 35,200 and 10,300
respectively, representing 7.2% and 2.5% of the corresponding school-age group.
1.09     A variety of specialized schools and programs exist at the upper
secondary level, including a health manpower training institute, two technical
schools, two agricultural schools, a livestock school, and commercial and
teacher training programs. (One technical school, the agricultural schools,
the livestock school, and five teacher training institutes have been built
with IDA assistance).
1.10     Most of the specialized programs have only recently begun.  All of
them have experienced recruiting difficulties as a result of a shortage of
eligible students and the higher prestige of the pre-university programs
offered in general secondary schools. Vigorous recruiting, including use of
incentives, expansion (albeit slow) of the eligible pool of entrants, and good
employment records of graduates from some specialized programs are working to
alleviate the recruiting problems.
1.11     University of Sana'a.  The University has five faculties: Commerce,
Law (Sharia), Arts, Science, and Education, which in 1980/81, enrolled 4,300
students, i.e., about 1% of the corresponding age group. Two new faculties,
Medicine and Engineering, are being established, the latter with IDA support.
Classes in civil engineering commenced in September 1983. The University,
while well staffed, depends heavily on expatriate faculty. The College of
Education, which in 1980/81 had an enrollment of 700, trains only teachers for
secondary schools (grades 7-12). It has recently undergone reorganization,
introducing a credit system and better methods of tracking progress of
individual students. These measures are expected to decrease the time
required to receive a degree. Also, the College now requires that students
receiving financial support maintain an adequate attendance record. Shortly
after this policy was instituted, about 200 students left the College; the
long-run effect is expected to be a considerable improvement in the efficiency
of the program and the quality of the students.
1.12     Out-of-School Education.  Illiteracy in the YAR is widespread.  The
1975 census reported that the illiteracy rate amongst the population aged 10
to 45 was 74% for males and 97% for females. The formal school system is
expanding rapidly, but without affecting the educational status of those too
old to enter school. This low level of literacy is a major constraint to the
development of the country, and not least in agriculture, the sector from
which most Yemenis derive a living. Basic skill training for adults
particularly in rural areas is critical since modern techniques are now a part
of the rural economy; for instance, with the advent of roads have come
vehicles, pumps, tractors, and power generating plants. Operating and
maintaining this equipment calls for practical skills new to rural Yemen. In
1976, in response to this need, the MOE's Department of Non-Formal Education
began to establish district training centers (DTCs) in small rural towns and



-4-
literacy training centers in villages which provide literacy classes and basic
skills training for men and women. The program is now well established and is
in high demand amongst many communities.
1.13     Public Administration.  The shortage of technically qualified
personnel is a major impediment to the development of public administration.
Although the availability of qualified people is increasing, it will be some
time before there are enough well trained and sufficiently experienced
personnel to fulfill the country's requirements.
1.14     In recognition of this critical need, the National Institute of
Public Administration (NIPA) was established in 1974, as an autonomous agency
with a Governing Board of Trustees. It is the Government's principal civil
service training agency. Since 1981, NIPA has been formally attached to the
Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reform (MCSAR), but it retains
operational and financial autonomy under its Governing Board of Trustees of
which the Minister of MCSAR is Chairman. NIPA operates from three centers:
its headquarters in Sana'a and two branches in Taiz and Hodeidah, which have
been recently established with IDA assistance under the ongoing third
education project (Credit 915-YAR).
Educational Issues
1.15     The Government has accomplished a rapid expansion of its public
sector and the education system. The pace of expansion, growing demands, and
their increasing diversity and complexity have presented the Government with
new challenges. Amongst the major issues are: (a) the shortage of primary
school teachers; (b) the insufficient provision of basic education and skill
training; (c) the high cost of education; and (d) inadequacies in public
administration.
1.16     Shortage of Primary School Teachers.  The YAR has relied on
expatriate teachers for the development of the modern education system. From
1978 onwards, the number of expatriates grew considerably, from 3,360 in
1978/79 to 5,500 in 1979/80 and to some 13,300 in 1982/83. As a result, the
Government has turned with renewed emphasis to building up the indigenous
teacher training system. At the core of the system is a three-year upper
secondary level (grades 10-12) program, located in major cities throughout the
country. This program was supplemented by a three-year lower secondary
(grades 7-9) program, also located in major cities. Neither program produced
an adequate number of graduates to meet the demand for teachers in the
country. In an effort to increase the number of Yemeni teachers, an attempt
was made to condense the three-year program into two years (grades 10-11)
which proved too arduous. Moreover, the three-year lower secondary program
(grades 7-9) produced graduates who were judged to be too young and too poorly
prepared to begin teaching immediately. Attrition rates were also unduly high
in this program. As a result, and as a means of increasing the quality and
quantity of primary school teachers, the three-year lower secondary (grades
7-9) program is being phased out and replaced by the new five-year post
primary program (grades 7-11), which is being run in conjunction with the
existing upper secondary program.
1.17     The teacher training program has experienced severe problems in
recruiting students. Several factors have contributed to this. The most
important are: the very small output from lower secondary schools, in



-5-
comparison with the number of available upper secondary level places; the
attractiveness of the incentives provided by specialized secondary schools in
such fields as agriculture, technical subjects, and communications; and the
higher prestige and financial rewards of careers other than teaching.
1.18     The new five-year program represents the latest stage in an evolving
system of teacher training. With TA provided under the fitth education
project, the new program will try to integrate basic teaching principles with
subject content appropriate to teaching at the primary level. Establishing
the new program in existing PTTIs in urban and rural areas began in 1981/82.
The Government expects the new five-year postprimary program to recruit an
s           adequate number of students for several reasons:  (a) PTTIs in rural areas
will draw on populations that have not yet been reached: boys and girls whose
parents are unwilling to have them move to cities to continue their
education; (b) in rural areas, the Government plans to establish a teacher
training program before installing any new general lower secondary programs;
and (c) all the PTTIs in both urban and rural areas will provide
incentives--stipends for all PTTI students and free board and lodging for male
trainees coming from areas outside the location of the PTTIs.
1.19     The Government will also establish an innovative Senior PTTI (grades
13-14) which would provide primary teacher training to graduates of general
secondary schools and to a small number of graduates from the other two
teacher training programs. The Senior PTTI would annually enroll 120
secondary school graduates, representing less than 5% of their total annual
number. The Government would offer various incentives (paras. 1.18(c) and
1.20) and, in addition, Senior PTTI graduates would have opportunities of
rapid promotion. By providing the primary school system with teachers of
higher education qualifications and advanced pedagogical training, the Senior
PTTI would contribute toward the raising of efficiency and effectiveness of
primary education teaching.
1.20     A new Teacher Law, which became effective in September 1981,
substantially improved the conditions of service for teachers. It: (a) grants
an incentive allowance of 20% of basic salary, in addition to all other
allowances provided for by law and in addition to other occupation and
specialization allowances granted to government employees; (b) creates the
position of senior teacher, with a salary supplement; (c) authorizes teachers
to take study leaves with full salary and allowances; (d) authorizes inservice
training and study tours abroad; (e) provides salary increments for completion
of training courses; and (f) exempts male teachers from military duty. Both
X           the Government and IDA expect that the combination of better targeted
recruitment, incentives and improved terms of service will make teaching a
more attractive career and improve the drawing power of teacher training
programs.  Statistical data for 1982/83 indicate that the new incentives are
already proving effective in attracting students to the teacher training
prograns. The 1982/83 enrollments in PTTIs increased by more than 60% over
the enrollments of 1980/81 (Annex 2).
1.21     Yemenis who are trained as primary teachers may be exempted from
military service if they agree to work as teachers for a minimum of five
years. While this rule will be difficult to enforce in the YAR, it is
expected that wastage from the new teacher training programs will be low.



-6-
1.22     Despite these efforts to increase the supply of Yemeni teachers, the
demand for teachers is likely to be higher than the rate at which Yemenis can
be trained. Table I shows that the number of expatriate teachers is expected
to rise to 22,500 by 1986/87 from its 1980/81 level of 9,200. The growth of
teachers has serious implications for the recurrent budget for education
(para. 1.26).

1.23     Inadequate Basic Education and Skill Training in Rural Areas for
Youth and Adults. Although the YAR has made great strides in the expansion of
the formal education system for school-age children in the past five years,
the advance in learning opportunities for adults and out-of-school youth has
been very limited. To redress this situation, seven DTCs were established by
the Government and assisted by IDA under the first and second education
projects and another three will be established with IDA assistance under the
fifth education project. Through the DTC and village training unit network,
courses have been provided in remote rural areas in such fields as literacy,
agricultural skills, handicrafts, home economics, health, nutrition,
electricity and automotive mechanics. In 1976, the concept of locally based
out-of-school training centers was new, both for government officials and for
potential trainees. However, due to the diligence and enthusiasm of the MOE's
Department oE Nonformal Education and the staff in the centers, the program is
now well established. About 10% of the 10,000 literacy students have already
successfully completed the primary education course, and about 1,800 have
completed the basic skills training courses. In 1982/83 the total number of
trainees taking courses in the seven DTCs and their village training units is
approximately 17,000.
1.24     This is a promising beginning but the program covers only a small
fraction of the illiterate and unskilled majority of the population. The
projected labor demand and supply for the period covered by the Second
Five-Year Plan indicates that the manpower shortages in semiskilled manual
occupations requiring functional literacy and skills training would be
approximately 46,000, and underlines the urgent necessity for more
opportunities for basic education and skill training.



-7-
1.25     The High Cost of Education.  Expenditure on education has risen
dramatically through the 1970s and mirrors the growth in school enrollment.
By 1981, education expenditures represented about 11.5% of all government
expenditures and were 5.3% of GNP. In 1981, education capital expenditures
absorbed 9.7% of the national capital expenditure budget and 13% of the
national recurrent budget. These data indicate that education is becoming a
major item in government expenditure, which should be monitored closely as
population pressures continue to swell the ranks of school children.
1.26     The present structure of school enrollment and the plan of the MOE
both indicate a growth in school enrollments of at least 11% annually.
Moreover, further diversification and expansion is envisaged at secondary and
higher levels of education. If the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan are
realized, then by 1986 the Government will be allocating a sum equivalent to
about 12.3% of GNP to education, 1/ which would be amongst the highest in the
world. This target is reasonable given the relatively low level of
educational development at present, but is likely to be attainable, only if
the required external financial assistance becomes available.
1.27     The Second Five-Year Plan anticipates capital expenditure of YRls 1.5
billion for MOE (US$0.3 billion), 57.5% of which is expected to be financed
from external sources, and nearly YR1s 0.8 billion (US$0.17 billion) for the
University, 78% of which is expected from external sources. To date, no firm
external financing commitment for the University has been received except the
IDA Credit for the Civil Engineering Department. The Government has
collaborated with a wide range of international agencies, such as IDA and the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and numerous bilateral agencies.
Prominent amongst these are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and USAID. In view of
current financial constraints which were not anticipated earlier, the
Government is taking steps to delay implementation of lower priority new
projects not yet commenced. As the Government accords high priority to the
MOE investment program, a much smaller cut (about 5%) is anticipated. In the
meantime, the MOE has already begun taking some steps to lower education costs
by ensuring contractual obligations of minimum acceptable class contact hours
for expatriate teachers, and by encouraging the recruitment and retention of
Yemeni teachers whose average cost is about 20% lower than that of the
expatriate teachers. The MOE is also taking steps to gradually eliminate
incomplete primary schools (para. 1.07), which encourage high dropout rates of
students and low utilization of teachers.
1.28     A "Special Study of Education Administration and Finance", prepared
by IDA in August 1982 and discussed with the Government, showed that the unit
costs of education as a percentage of GNP per capita were much higher in YAR
1/ Compared to about 6.9% of estimated 1985 GNP in the neighboring People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY).



-8-
than in sample EMENA region countries. 1/ The reasons for these high unit
costs in YAR are the low retention rates, the absence of multigrade and
multisubject teaching, the high salaries of teachers, and the comparatively
high capita:L expenditures of the education system due to its early stage of
development.
1.29     The Government has taken this issue very seriously and has decided,
with the view to reducing the cost of education (para. 1.27), to execute
several measures aimed at avoiding waste and promoting efficiency. These
measures include standardization of designs and better use of local materials
in school building, and the recruitment or training of multisubject and
multigrade primary teachers. On the more complex issues with important
social, economic and institutional implications, including the introduction of
school fees and increased cost sharing with Local Development Associations
(LDAs), the Government decided to engage local experts to carry out an
in-depth study of these issues.
1.30     Inadequacies in Public Administration.  The shortage of adequately
trained personnel in public administration persists as a constraint upon the
Government's capacity to manage and implement a growing and increasingly
complex development program. As the central government sector alone
(excluding the MOE) is projected by the Central Planning Organization (CPO) to
grow from 21,000 to 51,000 employees (excluding 2,800 to 3,000 expatriates)
between 1981-1986, the constraint will be serious until inservice training
facilities are developed sufficiently to cater to the need for upgrading
personnel.
1.31     The Government's principal agency for public administration inservice
training is the National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA) (para.
1.14). NIPA offers a wide range of programs, from typing and language classes
to high level seminars and postsecondary and postgraduate courses at premises
in Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah. The latter studies, covering such areas as
public administration, business administration, and auditing and accounting,
are offered in close cooperation with the University of Sana'a, and with
technical assistance provided by the American University of Washington, D.C.
under the third education project.
1.32     Annual enrollments in courses, other than the language classes, have
averaged 550, but NIPA estimates that, with the full operation of the Taiz and
Hodeidah branches established under the third education project, the
enrollments will increase to 1,500 during 1983. Training on this scale,
however, is insufficient, compared with overall needs as reflected in the
current size and expected growth of the civil services (para. 1.30). An IDA
"Special Study of the National Institute of Public Administration" (dated May
1983) indicates that NIPA operates under two major constraints, the
1/ Countries included are Afghanistan, Algeria, Cyprus, Iran, Jordan,
Morocco, Portugal, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, and Yemen PDR and the data
pertains to the late 1970's.



-9-
first being the lack of a comprehensive national training plan for public
administration personnel, and the second being that NIPA does not as yet have
sufficiently qualified local staff (currently 40 professional staff) and thus
relies heavily on expatriate staff. The study makes several recommendations,
including the need for IDA assistance, to address the above mentioned issues.
Government Sector Policy and Strategy
1.33     The period covered by the Second Five-Year Plan (1982-1986) is
considered by the Government of critical importance for the establishment of a
sound educational infrastructure, capable of supporting and promoting needed
manpower development during the 1980's. The Government's development strategy
aims at the expansion of basic education and teacher training and a more
balanced geographical distribution of educational opportunities, with a
stronger emphasis on the development of rural areas and greater participation
of women in education and employment as described below. These educational
objectives are ambitious, but sound.
1.34     The specific programs for the education sector as outlined in the
Second Five-Year Plan include the following items:
(a) expansion and improvement of primary education to meet increasing
demand; primary school enrollments are projected to increase by more
than 11% annually during the plan period;
(b) extension and improvement of Yemeni teacher training to include: a
new system of primary teacher training (grades 7-11) and new PTTIs in
rural areas; a senior PTTI (grades 13-14) to provide primary teacher
training to graduates of general secondary schools; a program of
inservice teacher training; and upgrading of teacher trainers;
(c) development and modernization of curricula in order to improve
education and training;
(d) expansion in vocational and technical education to meet lower- and
middle-level manpower requirements including, in addition to
vocational and technical secondary schools, the establishment of a
polytechnic institute to produce senior technicians;
e)   expansion of functional literacy and basic skill training programs to
meet the needs of male and female semi-skilled workers;
(f) restructuring and reorganization of the MOE to increase its
efficiency in implementing the Second Five-Year Plan;
(g) improved utilization of resources to achieve a better return on
investments in education; and
(h) development programs for the University of Sana'a and NIPA. The
University is in the process of establishing two additional
faculties, medicine and engineering, the latter with IDA support; a
faculty of agriculture is currently under consideration.

IDA Lending Strategy for Education and Training
1.35     IDA lending strategy to the YAR has coincided with the Government's
priorities in establishing a modern education and training system, from a very
low base in 1972.   There have been five education credits, totaling US$51.0
million. Initially, IDA focused on basic education, particularly teacher
training and basic skills and literacy training in rural areas. The first
education project (Credit 421-YAR, US$11.0 million, approved in 1973 and
completed in 1980), provided support for expanding teacher training and
establishing training programs for skilled workers and middle-level
technicians and introduced the basic training scheme. Both the project
completion report (PCR) and the draft project performance audit report (PPAR),
dated Decembier 16, 1983, noted the significant contribution of the project
towards assisting the MOE in developing curricula for project schools and in
improving its school administration functions and in strengthening local
capacity to design and supervise school building construction. The second
education project (Credit 611-YAR, US$8.0 million, approved in 1976 and
completed in 1982) extended the initiatives of the first project in teacher
training, vocational training and basic education.    It also established the
basic traininig fund as part of the basic training scheme and supported the
local production of educational materials. The project completion report
(PCR) and the draft PPAR, dated December 29, 1983, commented that
implementation was timely and effective and that educational objectives were
generally met. They also noted the significant impact of the DTCs and the
Basic Training Fund (BTF) on rural development in meeting local needs for
training and, by the time of project completion, the full utilization of the
PTTIs for female students.
1.36     Lessons derived from the implementation of the above completed
projects and applied to subsequent projects and also to the design of the
proposed sixth education project include: (i) the provision by the Borrower
of appropriate incentives (allowances, boarding, job prospects, etc.) to
attract trairnees to the teaching profession, and to vocational training; (ii)
the establishment of the Basic Training Fund to promote the rapid development
of DTCs; and (iii) adequate staffing and training of the School Building Unit
(SBU).
1.37     In the third education project (Credit 915-YAR, US$10.0 million,
appraised in 1979), IDA assisted the Government with the diversification of
secondary education, to encompass agriculture and livestock practices and also
with the expaLnsion and improvement of civil servants training at NIPA.
Pre-investment feasibility studies related to basic health care training
included in the project led to the first IDA-assisted Health project. Except
for the TA component, the project is now completed. There have been no
implementation problems. The fourth education project (Credit 1203-YAR,
US$12.0 million, approved in 1982), is assisting the Government in
diversifying higher education and financing an engineering faculty at Sana'a
University. It has also assisted in the establishment of the Educational
Research and Development Center (ERDC) which is assisting the Government in
addressing educational issues and in developing policies. In order to
encourage Yemenis to become teacher trainers, a fund for supplementing their
salaries was included under the project. Sixty-five teacher trainers have
already benefited from these arrangements. The project also supports the
provision of boarding facilities to existing PTTIs and Vocational Training
Centers (VTCs) to increase their utilization. The fifth education project
(Credit 1340-YAR, US$10.0 million, approved in March 1983) supports the



-ll-
Government's objective of increasing the supply of qualified Yemeni teachers
through a first "tranche" of PTTIs in rural areas. The project includes
further support to the DTC network of basic education and skill training for
men and women in rural areas, and provides a Basic Training Facility (BTF) for
funding village training programs. All the projects under implementation are
proceeding satisfactorily.
1.38     The proposed Sixth Education Project (a credit for US$10.0 million)
would constitute a further "tranche" of PTTIs in rural areas initiated under
the fifth education project, and would also support an innovative senior PTTI
for primary teacher training of graduates of general secondary schools (para.
1.19).  Further assistance for the expansion of DTCs in rural communities
would also be provided (para. 1.24). In addition, the project would assist
NIPA in improving the quality of its training programs for civil servants
(para. 1.32), and support the Government's efforts to reduce the high cost of
education (para. 1.29).

II. THE PROJECT
2.01     The components of the proposed project were prepared by the
Government following an IDA project identification/preparation assistance
mission in October 1982. The project was appraised in March 1983.
Project Objectives and Scope
2.02     The proposed project has the following main objectives:
(a)  to increase the supply of qualified Yemeni primary school teachers by
expanding teacher training programs;
(b)  to provide additional basic education and skill training programs for
out-of-school youth and adults in the rural areas by expanding the
network of DTCs; and
(c)  to improve the public administration training programs through
upgrading the teaching staff of NIPA.
2.03     The project would comprise:
(a)  construction/extension, equipment and furniture for:

(b)  a Basic Training Facility (BTF) for assisting with funding
construction, equipment and furnishing and operating costs of village
training units administered by the DTCs; and
(c)  technical assistance (TA) related to (i) training of teaching staff
of the Senior PTTI; (ii) implementation studies for measures to
support education finance reforms; (iii) improvement of programs and
training of NIPA staff; and (iv) pre-investment studies for a
possible follow-up project.
Primary Teacher Training Institutes (PTTIs)
2.04     The project would further assist the Government in the expansion and
improvement of primary teacher training, initiated under the first and second
education projects and continued under the fifth education project, by
constructing, equipping and furnishing four new PTTIs for male teachers in
rural areas, an extension to a PTTI for female teachers in Taiz to support the
new five-year program (grades 7-11) and the three-year secondary program
(grades 10-12), and an innovative Senior PTTI (grades 13-14) for male teachers
in Sana'a.
2.05     Locations for the four new PTTIs were selected on the basis of the
substantial size of the rural school population from which the new
institutions would be able to draw, the local support for the proposed
program, and the distance of alternative facilities. They will be located in
Jahana (Sana'a governorate), Al Hajar (Taiz governorate), Zabid (Hodeidah
governorate) and Al Khabt (Mahweit governorate). Potential female teachers
would not be specifically excluded from the proposed PTTIs and their
participation in these institutions will depend on local customs and social
conditions; they are expected to attend the PTTIs at Al Hajar and Al Khabt.
The proposed project, however, would also provide an extension of 320 new
student places to a PTTI specifically for female teachers in Taiz to alleviate
present overcrowding (350 students are currently enrolled, against a capacity
of 280) and to increase its enrollment to 600 students. The Senior PTTI will
be located in Sana'a and will draw qualified students from all parts of the
country.
2.06     The Senior PTTI would introduce a new program of primary school
teacher training in YAR, and would be offered at a postsecondary level to
students of higher academic qualifications than those attending the other two
training programs. It would also offer for the first time opportunities for
advanced education and professional training to graduates of exceptional merit
from the other teacher training programs. The Senior PTTI program includes
general education in all subject areas (60%) and professional training in the
underlying principles and methodologies of teaching of the various subject
areas of the primary school (40%). Weekly demonstrations and observations at
nearby primary schools and actual teaching practice of five weeks in various
primary schools would also be included. These activities would provide the
trainees with opportunities for well-guided and systematic teaching practice,
and would also enable the teacher trainers to test and evaluate primary school
curricula, textbooks and teaching methods. An objective of the Senior PTTI
course would be to prepare primary school teachers capable of multisubject as
well as multigrade teaching. Such training would support an efficient and
economical use of primary school teachers, and would help to improve the
present costly and uneven distribution of teachers. The Senior PTTI training



-14-
is also expected to provide the primary teaching force with potential
candidates For such posts as school principals, school supervisors, and
administrators. The proximity of the Senior PTTI to the MOE and the Faculty
of Education at the University of Sana'a would be beneficial to its training
activities. It would facilitate support from the MOE, and also assistance
from the Faculty of Education in specific areas of learning and teaching.
2.07     The three primary teacher training programs supported by the project
have different admission requirements.  Under the five-year program (grades
7-11) students are accepted who have successfully completed primary education;
under the three-year secondary program (grades 10-12) students are accepted
who have successfully completed their preparatory education. Under the
proposed new style two-year Senior PTTI program (grades 13-14) about 120
successful graduates of general secondary schools 1/ would be admitted
annually together with a small number (about 20) of promising graduates from
the other two primary teacher training systems who would benefit from more
advanced training (para. 2.06). The above arrangements, enabling students
from different levels of education to become primary school teachers, are
expected, in conjunction with the new incentives provided by the 1981 Teacher
Law (para. 1.20), to attract more than sufficient number of students to the
proposed project institutions. The estimated annual output from these
institutions, when fully operational, would be about 335, or about 30% of the
total annual output of primary school teachers in the YAR. 2/
2.08     Each PTTI would accommodate 40 students per class while the Senior
PTTI, as a higher institution, would have 35. In addition to the necessary
teacher training facilities, the PTTIs for male teachers would include
boarding accommodations for about 60% of the expected enrollment, thus
facilitating the enrollment of students who live predominantly outside the
immediate (5-15 km) location of the schools. The PTTI for female teachers
does not have boarding facilities, because their families prefer them to stay
with local families, and therefore the existing boarding house was converted
earlier to a library, an arts and crafts workshop and staff offices. The
extension to this PTTI under the project would include eight classrooms
necessary to accommodate the additional enrollments. Boarding accommodation
for the Senior PTTI in Sana'a, which will be optional, would be limited to
about 40% of the students, the remaining students arranging their own
accommodation with financial support from the MOE. Staff houses for the
Director and Deputy Director of the Senior PTTI would be provided under the
proposed project to ensure continuous and efficient monitoring of all
activities, including the operation of the boarding facilities.
2.09     TA provided under the fifth education project (1340-YAR) would assist
in the development of appropriate curricula and syllabi for the subject areas
of humanities, social studies, mathematics and science for the PTTIs.
Curricula for the Senior PTTI in the pedagogical subjects and in the subject
areas of Aral)ic and social studies, and mathematics and science would be
developed by the General Directorate of Teacher Training with the assistance
of local educators and the guidance and advice of consultants to be provided
1/ This represents 5% of the successful graduates in 1980/81.
2/ The total annual output of PTTIs in 1991/92, including those to be
established under the fifth education project, is estimated at 800.



-15-
under this proposed project. Progress with the development of the new
curricula as well as their practical application would be reviewed by IDA
during project supervision.
2.10     A total of 70 teacher trainers would be required for the operation of
the four new PTTIs and the extension of the PTTI for female teachers, and 20
additional teacher trainers for the Senior PTTI. The MOE intends to staff the
project PTTIs mostly with Yemenis, who are expected to be available through
the instructional program initiated in 1979 under the Eastern Michigan
University (EMU) project funded by the USAID. Under this program, 175 Yemeni
teacher trainers will complete their training by 1986; 65 of these have
V          already completed their M.A. degree in education and have taken up their
duties in the existing PTTIs, which are mostly staffed by expatriate teachers
(258 in 1982/83). The number of future graduates of the EMU program would be
sufficient to provide the trainers for main subject areas for the regular
PTTIs, established under the fifth education project and the proposed sixth
project. Yemeni staff for the Senior PTTI would be drawn from existing staff
upgraded under this proposed project through 42 staff years of fellowships.
The fellowships (14) would cover academic and professional subject areas
(Annex 3).
District Training Centers (DTCs)
2.11     The proposed project would finance two additional DTCs and thereby
expand the basic training scheme which was initiated under the first and
second education projects and continued under the fifth project (paras. 1.35
and 1.37). It would extend literacy and basic skill training opportunities to
the non-literate adult and youth population in remote regions of the country.
The two DTCs will be located at Nadera (Ibb Governorate, population 1,350,000)
and Ma'rib (Ma'rib Governorate, population 108,000). The latter area is not
densely populated; poverty is rampant and educational opportunities are few
(the present literacy rate is 10% among men and 1% among women), but the area
has potential for socio-economic development. Plans for the construction of a
new dam, and for the economic development of the Ma'rib region have already
been prepared. The existence of local development boards in both the proposed
DTC areas is a favorable indicator of potential participation of the
population in basic training programs.
2.12     The proposed DTCs, similar to those established under previous
projects, would offer: (a) literacy courses combined with basic occupational
skills in agriculture, vocational and home management for men and women; (b)
agricultural and health courses organized in cooperation with the relevant
ministries for men and women; (c) home crafts, nutrition, health, child care,
sewing and agricultural programs, including livestock management, aimed
specifically for women; and (d) skills training courses in the fields of
automotive and farm equipment mechanics, carpentry, electricity and typing.
Other special courses could be offered to meet local needs. Most literacy and
occupational skills courses are organized on an eight-month basis, with
instruction from four to five hours a day. Afternoon classes are generally
planned for women, and evening classes for men. The skills training courses,
owing to demand and limited equipment, are organized into four-month training
periods of four hours daily. Those who complete the courses are qualified to
move into semiskilled positions in the local labor force, or advance within
their occupational areas.



-16-
2.13     Training activities in the centers are administered by local boards
at the district or community level. These, in turn are responsible to the
National Board for Nonformal Education (NBNFE) which determines policy and
budget requirements. The NBNFE was formed for this purpose under the first
and second esducation projects and is composed of the Ministers of Education,
Agriculture, Health and Social Services, a representative of CYDA, as well as
other concerned government officials.
2.14     The curricula adopted by the NBNFE for use in the DTCs have been
specially designed by the Nonformal Education Directorate. They are supported
by special textbooks for functional literacy and numeracy and by teachers'
guides for teaching vocational skills, health education, nutrition and child
care. Each DTC would act as the parent institution to the training units in
the surrouncding villages. The village training units would offer literacy and
occupational skills training as well as special courses adapted to the unique
needs of the villages. The villages are generally 3 to 30 kilometers from the
DTCs. Each DTC would serve about ten villages.
2.15     The target group ranges from 11-40 years of age.  Although not
primarily designed for younger age groups, the DTCs would offer literacy
opportunities to those who have been early school dropouts. Each DTC has the
capacity to train about 2,000 people per year and the surrounding village
training units service a similar number. About 20% of the participants are
women.
2.16     Each DTC would have a staff comprising eight skills instructors and
10-20 literacy teachers, the latter being drawn from the local primary school
teachers. The instructors are usually Arabic speaking expatriates, secured
through bilateral agreements (Holland, Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden) or
through recruitment from neighboring Arab countries. In order to increase the
proportion of Yemeni instructors, the MOE has begun to employ graduates of
local technical and vocational schools as counterparts to DTC expatriate
instructors. In addition, potential instructors have been identified for the
village units from the local communities, for whom short-term training
programs, utilizing the vocational facilities of the DTCs, have been devised
by the Nonformal Education Directorate of the MOE. Simple boarding
accommodation would be provided at the DTCs for the trainee-instructors of the
village training units. Instructors live in rented accommodation in the town
in which the DTC is located. Each Director would be provided with a house on
the premises under the proposed project.
2.17     In order to assist the Government with the long term development of
the basic training scheme, an evaluation of the program is being undertaken
under the fiEth education project (Credit 1340-YAR). This would be completed
by 1985. The evaluation is being conducted under the auspices of the
Educational Research and Development Center, in close cooperation with the
Directorate of Non-Formal Education of the MOE.
2.18     Basic Training Facility (BTF).  Under the second education project
(Credit 611-YAR), a basic training fund of US$1.0 million was set up to enable
DTCs to establish and foster village training units in areas surrounding the
centers. This fund is now totally disbursed. The fifth education project
established a BTF of US$1.0 million with the same objectives. In line with
previous projects, an additional BTF of US$0.4 million is proposed for the two
new centers.



-17-
2.19     The original BTF was remarkably successful. in encouraging and
facilitating locally-identified development activities. Individually the
items supported by the BTF have been small, but they have nevertheless had a
major impact on their immediate environment as providers of education training
facilities and as catalysts of change and development in remote areas. Items
financed under the BTF include civil works, equipment and furniture and
operating costs of village training unit activities. The BTF is a means of
providing flexibility during the life of a project and it has been used to
support some 75 village units under the second education project.
2.20     The conditions of disbursement from the new facility would be the
same as those presently applying to the fifth education project (Credit
1340-YAR). The BTF would be administered by the National Board for Non-Formal
Education (NBNFE) and would be subject to the following conditions (para.
5.01(a)):
(a) the NBNFE would not approve investment of more than US$50,000 in any
single community;
(b) only training programs consistent with the objectives of the
Nonformal Education Directorate or such special courses as may be
approved by the NBNFE would qualify for funding;
(c) proposals for funding for any community would be approved only where
the community had indicated its wish to participate in basic training
programs and where a commitment in kind (approximately 25% of the
cost of the proposed investment) was made by the community;
(d) proposals made by the Director of the DTC to the NBNFE for funding a
community training scheme would be supported by details of the
proposed training programs including furniture and equipment lists,
construction drawings with estimated costs, and estimates of
recurrent costs; and
(e)  the Director of the DTC submitting a proposal for funding would
confirm that instructors would be available for the proposed training
program and that adequate funds would be available within the budget
of the DTC to meet the recurrent costs of the program.
Technical Assistance (TA) 1/
2.21     This would be provided in four main areas:
(a) Teacher Training. To ensure the success of the Senior PTTI, the
proposed project would provide 42 staffyears of fellowships for staff
training (para. 2.10). It would also include three staffyears of
consultancies to assist in the development of curricula of the main
subject areas of the Senior PTTI (para. 2.09).
1/ Composition of the technical assistance program and implementation
schedule is detailed in Annex 3.



-18-
(b) Support for NIPA Training Activities. The third education project
effectively supported the establishment of the two branches in Taiz
and Hodeidah and provided technical assistance for the extension of
training including the introduction of two-year postsecondary diploma
programs and one-year training courses. Four experts are in post in
each branch, and while NIPA staff are under training abroad, the
experts are largely instrumental in enabling the branches to develop
the new programs. Funds under the third project for the experts will
be exhausted in 1984, and for the fellowships in 1986. This proposed
project would provide NIPA with about an additional two staffyears of
specialist services and about 7 staffyears of fellowships. The
fellowship program, together with the previous programs funded by the
UNDP and under the third education project, would ensure that up to
75% of NIPA staff would receive training abroad by 1987 or 1988. It
is proposed that half of the assistance provided by expert services
and fellowships be devoted to upgrading NIPA's capability in training
methodology and the use of equipment and resources. The project
would also fund a pre-investment study to be conducted by experts
(six staffmonths) to include a review of: (i) the role of NIPA and
other training institutions within the framework of a comprehensive
national training plan for public administration personnel to be
developed by the Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reform
with UNDP assistance (para. 1.32); (ii) the educational and training
programs of NIPA, including curriculum development, evaluation and
follow-up; and (iii) the personnel and physical resources of NIPA.
The study, with recommendations, would be completed by December 31,
1985 and forwarded to IDA for review.
(c)  Education Finance.  This TA component would finance the services of a
consultant, fully knowledgeable of local conditions and procedures,
who would be employed for six months by the MOE to conduct an
in-depth study of the feasibility and implications of the
recommendations on education finance included in the "Special Study
of Education Administration and Finance" (para. 1.29). The study
would: (i) evaluate the potential impact of each proposal; (ii)
identify actions to be taken; and (iii) recommend methods of
implementation. The consultant's report would be completed within
one year of the effective date of the Credit, and the findings of the
report would be discussed with IDA for further appropriate action.
(d)  Preinvestment Studies.  The project would fund feasibility studies
and engineering designs (about 12 staffmonths) for a possible
follow-up project.
2.22     During negotiations, the Government has provided assurances that
arrangements will be made for the timely implementation of the TA program, and
that terms of reference for specialist services will be satisfactory to IDA
(para. 5.01(b)).

3.03     Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated civil works costs for the project
are based on unit prices derived from current contracts and cost analysis of
similar institutions of the second, third and fourth education projects and on
information on construction cost in general. Furniture and equipment costs
are based on current c.i.f. prices and are adjusted upward to include local
transportation and installation costs. The estimate of TA costs is based upon
average costs per staff-month of about US$11,000 for short-term expatriate
consultants, US$4,500 equivalent for expatriate long-term teacher/specialists
and local consultants, (consisting of salaries, fees, overhead, international
travel cost and subsistence) and about US$2,100 1/ for overseas fellowships.
These costs are based on recent experience in YAR. Baseline costs reflect
1/ This cost figure is lower than that typically used, because about 85% of
the students are expected to study in neighboring countries, where tuition
is government subsidized and travel costs are lower.

Estimated prices at the time of negotiations (March 1984). Project
institutions are exempt from import duties and taxes.
3.04     Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions equal to 10% of the estimated
costs of civil works, furniture and equipment, and 5% of the estimated cost of
TA. The project cost also includes price escalation contingencies calculated
for the period beginning at negotiations (March 1984) and in accordance with
an agreed schedule of implementation (Annex 6). Estimated annual rates of
price increases for various categories of expenditure are indicated below.

Prices are expected to increase during the project implementation period by a
total of 13.9% for civil works, 14.7% for furniture and equipment, 16.3% for
TA specialists and 23.2% for fellowships. Accordingly, aggregated price
increases are estimated at about 14.4% of baseline cost plus physical
contingencies. Total contingencies are estimated to be about 24.8% of the
baseline cost.
3.05     Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange component
is US$9.8 million equivalent or about 51.0% of the total project cost. The
calculations of the foreign exchange component are based on the expectation
that: (a) all of the civil works contracts will be awarded to local firms
(para 3.13); (b) all furniture and equipment will be directly imported; and
(c) 40% of the BTF will be expended for civil works cost and the remainder for
equipment, furniture and operating costs. The resulting foreign exchange
content of each category of expenditure is as follows; (i) civil works, 36%;
(ii) furniture and equipment, 90%; and (iii) experts and fellowships, 80%.
3.06     Project Financing.  The proposed credit of US$10.0 million would
finance 100% of the total estimated foreign exchange cost of the project and
1.7% of the total local cost, which represents the local component of the
civil works, equipment and operating costs financed through the BTF. The
Government would finance 98.3% of the total local costs, which amounts to
US$9.3 million (48.3% of the total project cost). The proposed financial plan
is summarized below:

Total project cost          9.28        10.00      19.28
3.07     Recurrent Costs.  When fully operational the annual recurrent cost of
the project institutions would be about YRls 39.0 million which would
represent about 1.9% of the projected education recurrent expenditures in
1987. This additional cost is not expected to cause any undue constraints on
the education budget.
Project Implementation
3.08     Implementation Period.  The construction, furnishing and equipping of
all institutions and the TA component are scheduled to be completed by June
30, 1990 (Annex 6). In order to allow sufficient time for submission of the
final withdrawal applications, the closing date would be December 31, 1990.
3.09     The MOE has designated a senior official as Project Coordinator who
would have the overall responsibility of the MOE project components under the
general supervision of the Deputy Minister of Education. The coordinator, in
close collaboration with the Director of Teacher Training and the Director of
Non-Formal Education, will have specific responsibilities for: (a) ensuring
appropriate provisions of capital and recurrent budgets for the project;
(b) liaison with the School Building Unit (SBU)/Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) 1/ in the development of architectural designs and procurement of
equipment and furniture with the assistance of his staff; (c) financial
records, and with the advice and assistance of the SBU accountant, the
preparation of withdrawal applications for disbursements of allocated IDA
funds in respect of TA; and (d) timely recruitment of staff and nomination of
counterparts for the project schools and preinvestment studies. The

under the ongoing third education project.
3.10     Architectural designs.  The SBU would have responsibility for
architectural services under the project. Preliminary designs have been
approved by IDA. Final construction drawings and bid documents for
international competitive bidding (ICB) are scheduled for completion by
September 1984.  Except for the senior PTTI, all civil works components under
the project are "repeater" items and therefore no problems are anticipated.
*       3.11      Sites.  Suitable sites for each project institution have been
selected.  All sites are satisfactory and will have sources of water for
general use. Where the supply of municipal electricity is inadequate, which
is the case in about 30% of the sites, an on-site power generator will be
provided. Aquisition of all sites is underway and will be completed by
July 1984. Topographical surveys of all sites have been made.
3.12     Furniture and equipment lists.  The preparation of the detailed
equipment lists, specifications and bid documents for ICB would be undertaken
by the MOE Directorate of Teacher Training in collaboration with the SBU and
are scheduled for completion by January 1985. The contracts for major
equipment bid packages will include installation and commissioning of
equipment. Contracts will also include equipment maintenance seminars by
manufacturer or supplier representatives.

-24-
Civil works contracts (amounting to US$13.3 million including contingencies)
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB). It
is anticipated that due to the dispersion of the project institutions within
the country all civil works contracts (average size, US$1.7 million) would be
awarded to local firms. Construction of village training units covered under
the BTF, which are small and dispersed, estimated at US$0.15 million total (on
average, about US$10,000 each), would be carried out on the basis of local
bidding procedures acceptable to IDA. Detailed lists and specifications of
furniture and equipment would be presented to IDA for review and approval
prior to procurement. Equipment and furniture items (amounting to US$3.4
million, including contingencies) would be grouped, to the extent possible, in
large packages to permit bulk procurement. Contracts for furniture and
equipment in excess of US$50,000 would be awarded on the basis of ICB. Small
items or groups of items estimated to cost less than the above figure or items
of specialized nature for which ICB is not practical, would be procured by
obtaining and conmparing at least three price quotations, in accordance with
procedures acceptable to IDA. These items would not exceed an aggregate total
of US$0.6 million, which would represent about 18% of the estimated furniture
and equipment costs including contingency allowances. Draft tender and
contract documents for furniture, equipment and civil works would be forwarded
to IDA for review and approval; IDA's approval of tender evaluation documents
would be required prior to the award of all contracts for furniture, equipment
and civil works estimated to cost over US$100,000 each. Other contracts will
be subject to selective post-award review. For the purpose of comparing
foreign and local bids under ICB, local manufacturers of furniture and
equipment would be allowed a margin of preference equal to the existing rate
of customs duties applicable to competing imports or 15% c.i.f. price,
whichever is lower. Specialists for technical assistance and consultants for
preinvestment studies will be selected in accordance with IDA Guidelines.
Operating expenses covered under the BTF include about US$20,000 for
incremental instructors' salaries for which procurement is inapplicable and
for consumable materials (fuel, etc.), which will be procured through normal
commercial channels.
Disbursement
3.14     Disbursements (Annex 7) would be on the basis of:
(a)  Civil works;  PTTIs and DTCs 36% of total expenditure; village
training units financed under the BTF 100%;
(b)  Furniture and Equipment:  100% of foreign expenditures, and of local
expenditures ex-factory; 85% of local expenditures for imported items
procured locally;
(c)  Technical Assistance:  100% of foreign expenditures.
(d)  Basic Training Facility;  100% of total expenditures, subject to a
ceiling of $50,000 for each Village Training Unit, and based on
statements of expenditure.
Withdrawal applications for contracts above US$10,000 equivalent financed by
the Credit would be fully documented. Documentation for contracts below
US$10,000 may not be submitted, but will be maintained by the SBU and are



-25-
subject to review during project supervision missions. To facilitate timely
withdrawal of the proceeds of the credit, the Borrower will open, maintain and
operate a special account with the Central Bank of Yemen on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. The initial deposit would be about US$0.4
million equivalent.  Opening of the special account would be condition of
effectiveness (para. 5.02).
3.15     Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1990,
amounting to a period of about six and one half years. The estimated
disbursement profile is at a higher rate and is of a shorter duration (by one
and one half years) from the IDA country-wide disbursement profile for YAR.
This is reasonable because: (a) the actual disbursement profile for the
recently completed second IDA education credit is both at a higher rate and of
shorter duration (six years) than the country profile; (b) the SBU's
performance in implementation has progressively improved with each succeeding
IDA assisted education project; (c) the advanced stage of the proposed project
with the completion of construction and bid documents for civil works of all
project items, so that bidding is scheduled for November 1984; and
(d) disbursements for the BTF are expected to be expeditious because of the
experience gained during the first and second projects.
3.16     Accounts and Audits.  The SBU accountant will coordinate the
financial affairs of the proposed project. Pre-auditing is carried out by an
accounts unit of the Ministry of Finance located in the MOE. Under existing
Credit Agreements (Credits 915-YAR, 1203-YAR and 1340-YAR), the Borrower has
agreed to have project accounts for each year audited by auditors acceptable
to IDA.
3.17     During negotiations, the Borrower has given assurances that:
(a) project accounts including the special account (para. 3.14) will be
audited by auditors acceptable to IDA and in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles; and
(b) IDA will be provided within six months of the end of each fiscal year
with (i) certified copies of the project accounts; and (ii) an audit
report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request,
incloding a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against
certified stateraents of expenses (para. 5.01(c)).

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01     The main benefits expected to accrue from implementation of this
proposed project are as follows:
4.02     Education Finance.  The project would finance the development of an
action plan which would assist the Government to contain the rising education
costs and mobilize resources to reduce the burden of education expenditures.
4.03     Primary Teacher Training.  The Senior PTTI to be established under
the project would play a key role in raising the educational level and -
effectiveness of the primary teaching force and would enable primary teachers
to qualify fcr leadership positions in education and local communities. The
emphasis on multisubject and multigrade teaching would also promote efficiency
and economy and support a balanced distribution of teachers. The project
would significantly increase the number of qualified Yemeni primary school
teachers and thus reduce the dependency on expatriates. It would contribute,
by 1992/93, an annual addition of about 335 (270 male and 65 female) teachers
to the existing stock of Yemeni teachers, increasing the annual output of new
teachers by about 30%. The extension of the PTTI for female teachers would
increase their total annual output by 6% thus increasing the participation of
women in the teaching profession. The new PTTIs would be located in rural
areas and, as a result, the project would improve the regional distribution of
teacher training facilities.
4.04     Out-of-School Education.  This project would improve provision of
urgently required out-of-school literacy and basic skills training in regions
presently lacking such facilities. From 1986/87 onwards, an additional 4,000
from each of the two DTCs and village training units supported in this project
will participate, representing an increase of about 15% over the estimated
1986/87 annual total enrollments for functional literacy and basic skill
training programs. It would also assist about 1,500 women to participate in
development by extending specific training programs in agriculture, health and
home management which are a focal point for women's development in rural areas.
4.05     Public Administration.  The project would make a modest, but
significant contribution toward upgrading the Civil Service. It will
facilitate a review of the national training needs for public service and the
possible further development of NIPA. It will also foster the consolidation
of four recently introduced one-year training courses, with a projected annual
intake of 200 participants and will assist in the upgrading of qualifications
of about 20% of NIPA teaching staff to facilitate the consolidation of the
training activities.
Risks
4.06     There are no undue risks anticipated with the project.  The
incentives provided to students of PTTIs, including the Senior PTTI (paras.
1.18 and 1.19), and under the new Teacher Law (1981) (para. 1.20) and the
careful selection of the locations of the PTTIs (para. 2.05) would ensure the
required supply of students to the project institutions. In addition, the
salaries and allowances of the PTTI teachers under the new Teacher Law, and



-27-
the provision of TA under previous projects and this proposed project for
their training (para. 2.10) would also ensure adequate qualified staff for the
new PTTIs. Judging from the progress made in project preparation to date, and
the well-established nature of all the project items (except the new Senior
PTTI), the existence of an experienced SBU, and the known Government
commitment to successful project implementation, based on past performance, no
undue risks or delays in implementation are expected.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During negotiations, the Government has provided assurances that:
(a)  the BTF will be administered by the National Board for Non-Formal
Education (NBNFE) subject to the following conditions (para. 2.20):
(i) the NBNFE will not approve investment in any single community of
more than US$50,000;
(ii)  only training programs consistent with the objectives of the
Non-Formal Education Directorate or such special courses as may
be approved by the NBNFE will qualify for funding;
(iii) proposals for funding for any community will be approved only
where the community had indicated its wish to participate in
basic training programs and where a commitment in kind was made
by the community of approximately 25% of the cost of the
proposed investment;
(iv)  proposals to be made by the Director of a DTC to the NBNFE for
funding for a community training scheme will be supported by
details of the proposed training programs and of required
furniture, equipment and construction with estimated costs, and
estimates of recurrent costs; and
(v) the Director of the DTC submitting a proposal for funding will
provide confirmation that instructors will be available for the
proposed training program and that adequate funds will be
available within the budget of the DTC to meet the recurrent
costs of the program.
(b)  arrangements will be made for the timely implementation of the TA
program and that terms of reference for specialist services will be
satisfactory to IDA (para. 2.22); and
(c)  accounts will be audited by auditors acceptable to IDA and in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles (para. 3.17) (a); and
IDA will be furnished, within six months of the end of each fiscal
year, with; (i) certified copies of the project accounts; and (ii) an
audit report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request
(para. 3.17(b)).
5.02     Condition of Effectiveness.  The Borrower will open and maintain a
special account on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA and operate the
special account in accordance with IDA guidelines (para. 3.14).
5.03     Subject to the above conditions, the project would provide a suitable
basis for an IDA Credit of US$10.0 million equivalent to the Government of YAR.
