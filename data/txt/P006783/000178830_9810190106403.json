The proposed project also seeks to support the\n            development of Fen, the recently-established financial arm\n            of the power sector, created to tap domestic and external\n            capital markets on its behalf. Support is provided under the\n            project to assist FEN in its role of strengthening power\n            sector financial management. The project consists of\n            subprojects representing a two-year time slice of priority\n            ongoing electricity development investments, several of\n            which are already partly financed with Bank loans. A group\n            of subprojects has been selected on a primary basis, with\n            final selection and sub-loan amounts to be based upon\n            detailed proposals in each case. Subprojects will consist of\n            a portion of the civil works, goods and services associated\n            with the investments and the proposed subloans to be made by\n            FEN to the utilities would finance foreign exchange costs\n            not covered by other sources."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
