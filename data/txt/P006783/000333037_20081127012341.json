The project had two main objectives: a) to provide\n            the external financing required to sustain during 1984-85\n            the scheduled pace of several high priority electricity\n            development projects that were under construction, and in\n            their connection to re-enlist the support of foreign\n            commercial lenders to the power sector and to Colombia\n            through a co-financing package; and b) to support the\n            development of Financiers Electrica Nacional (FEN). FEN had\n            been created in 1982 in conformance with an undertaking made\n            by the Government in 1981 under the Guavio Hydro Power\n            Project when it was recognized that the local currency cost\n            component of the power sector investment program could not\n            be met entirely through self generated funds. FEN's\n            development was to be supported in several respects: to\n            enable it to serve as an effective channel for power sector\n            lending projects in Colombia; to strengthen the financial\n            management of the sector by enhancing FEN's ability to\n            monitor the financial performance and prospects of Colombian\n            power companies and to act as power financing strategy\n            adviser to the Government and the sector; and to enhance\n            FEN's image in the domestic capital market and thus\n            help facilitate its access to future savings."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
