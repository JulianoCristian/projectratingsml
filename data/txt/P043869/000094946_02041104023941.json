improving\n            the management of natural resources. This project will be\n            implemented over six years and has four components. The\n            first has four subcomponents: 1) stakeholder training to\n            promote economic, social, and environmental sustainability\n            at microcatchment level; 2) environmental education of\n            farmers and fishermen that enables them to solve\n            environmental problems, and environmental teaching projects\n            implemented in municipal and state schools; 3) recruiting\n            and training extension agents; and 4) adaptive and social\n            research as well as socioenvironmental mapping. The second\n            component identifies and carries out rural investments that\n            increase value of agricultural products, improve land\n            management practices, equip rural homes with basic\n            sanitation, protect water sources, and dispose of pig waste\n            satisfactorily. The third component focuses on environmental\n            management by implementing sub-catchment plans, establishes\n            ecological corridors, consolidates protected areas, and\n            creates economic incentives. The fourth component finances\n            project monitoring, and monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2002-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
