      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20–25 percent of
the Bank’s lending operations through fieldwork. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers ’ comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank ’s Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to
which the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s
objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency
is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of
capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates two rural poverty reduction,
community-driven development (CDD) projects supported by the World Bank in the states of
Ceará and Santa Catarina, Brazil.

The Ceará Rural Poverty Reduction Project was approved in June 2001 for US$50 million,
including a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) of
US$37.5 million to Ceará. Additional financing (AF) was approved in June 2006 for US$50
million, supported by an IBRD loan of US$37.5 million. The actual total cost of the project
was US$113.1 million. Cost overruns were driven by a decline in the relative value of the
U.S. dollar and increased construction costs in the domestic currency. Ceará covered the
excess of US$13.1 million. The original project was to close in June 2005, but it was
extended to 2006 to carry on operations until the AF project was approved. The AF project
closed in June 2009.

The Santa Catarina Natural Resource Management and Rural Poverty Reduction Project
(NRMRPRP) was approved in April 2002 for US$107.5 million, including an IBRD loan of
US$62.8 million to Santa Catarina. The actual cost was US$108.5 million. The project was to
close in December 2008, but it was extended to September 2009 to allow for preparing an AF
operation. Its preparation was dropped and substituted by the Santa Catarina Rural
Competitiveness Project, approved in August 2010.

The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) selected these two projects for several reasons. The
projects are comparable examples of CDD approaches to rural poverty reduction under
different conditions. Both projects sought to improve the incomes and living conditions of
the rural poor, although the Santa Catarina project had an integrated environmental focus.
But poverty conditions in the two states were very different. At approval, Ceará had the
second largest rural poverty rate in Brazil, and Santa Catarina had the lowest rate. Second,
the assessment was commissioned to provide inputs into IEG’s ongoing macro-evaluation of
World Bank Group support for growing the rural nonfarm economy. Both projects envisaged
rural nonfarm activities as a way to reduce rural poverty. Lastly, the assessment of the Ceará
project will provide inputs to the IEG’s global macro evaluation of water and sanitation.

The PPAR is based on a review of all relevant documentation, including a 2009 impact
assessment and other evaluative material commissioned by the project, interviews of Bank
staff, government, state and municipal officials, and the findings of an IEG mission to Ceará
and Santa Catarina in January–February 2016. Appendix B is a list of people met during the
mission. Their cooperation and assistance in preparing the report is gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to government
officials for review and feedback, and comments received appear in appendix D.

Summary
This clustered PPAR assesses two rural poverty reduction projects carried out by the World
Bank in two Brazilian states during 2001–-2009. The Ceará Rural Poverty Reduction project,
approved in 2001, closed in 2009 following an additional financing (AF) which was
approved in 2006. The Santa Catarina NRMRPRP was approved in 2002 and closed in 2009.
The two projects share the objective of improving the economic and social conditions of the
rural poor, but under very different conditions. Rural poverty rates in the two states were, and
remain, polar opposites. At design, Ceará had the second highest rural poverty rate among
Brazilian states, and Santa Catarina had the lowest. The Ceará project mainly focused on
basic service delivery such as water and electricity plus some productive assets. The Santa
Catarina poverty reduction project also focused on land and natural resource management.

The objectives of the Ceará Rural Poverty Reduction Project (RPRP) were to increase social
and economic opportunities for the municipalities’ rural poor by improving access to basic,
social, and economic infrastructure; to increase the social capital of rural communities to
organize collectively and meet their own needs; and to foster local governance and
citizenship. A fourth objective, added with the AF, was to scale up impact by using the social
capital created to further increase incomes of the rural poor. The Santa Catarina
NRMRPRP’s objectives were to integrate environmental and social sustainability into the
borrower’s development and poverty reduction strategies; to enhance local governance and
community participation in decision making; to reverse land degradation and ensure
protection of natural resources; and to improve the income-generating opportunities and
living conditions for the rural poor.

The relevance of objectives of the Ceará PDO was high and that of the Santa Catarina was
substantial. The relevance of design of the Santa Catarina project is rated substantial, and the
relevance of design of the Ceará project is rated modest. In the case of Ceará, the project
lacked a transparent mechanism for targeting beneficiaries beneath the municipal level which
inhibited clear tracking of the investment benefits (especially for the productive, collectively
and individually owned assets ) against relative poverty levels. While the Santa Catarina
project was relevantly geared toward addressing underlying productivity constraints, there
was a need for a differentiated approach for less cohesive communities within the poorest
micro-catchment areas. Also, challenges were associated with the less precisely defined state
level managerial actions required compared with actions taken at the micro-catchment level.

The efficacy of the Ceará RPRP is mixed. The project substantially improved access by the
poor to water and electricity and, to some extent, productive capacity (mainly tractors), but it
had negligible results with regard to health and education. A 2009 Impact Assessment finds
positive and significant impacts for permanent work and for income obtained from crop and
vegetable production. However, overall, gains in income, while positive, were found not to
be statistically significant compared to a control. Since profitability was only assessed for
four out of the 264 productive subprojects (masonry, cashew nut marketing, hammock
marketing, and irrigated agriculture), data was not available to validate the income effects of
a statistically representative sample of productive investments, many of which were rural
non-farm activities. Social capital strengthening of the community associations engaged in
                                             xi


the project process was also substantially achieved, with the caveat that perceptions were
measured between baseline and midline- at the height of the disbursement cycle - not ex-post
or long enough after the disbursement cycle to measure sustained outcomes. The objective of
fostering local governance and citizenship through the creation and strengthening of
municipal councils, rated modest, was not fully met. The AF objective of scaling up impact
of to further increase incomes of the rural poor was modestly achieved.

The efficacy of the Santa Catarina NRMRPRP is also mixed. The project substantially
achieved its objective of integrating environmental and social sustainability into development
and poverty reduction strategies. However, it only modestly helped to enhance local
governance and community participation in decision making. The objective of reversing land
degradation and achieving better protection of natural resources was modestly achieved
based on data obtained on water quality and soil protection from seven of the assisted
microcatchments. Efficacy of the fourth objective, improvements to income-generating
opportunities and living conditions for the rural poor, is rated substantial.

Efficiency in the case of Ceará is rated modest based on a lack of sufficient evidence of the
rates of return on a representative sample of the subprojects. Efficiency in the case of Santa
Catarina is rated substantial. An internal rate of return of 41.5 percent was calculated based
on data for different productive activities under a Rural Investment Fund, aggregated into a
set of production models for typical properties in different regions of the state.

Overall outcome for the Ceará RPRP and the Santa Catarina project are rated
moderately satisfactory and satisfactory respectively. For the Ceará project, this rating
reflects a high relevance of objectives, modest relevance of design, substantial achievement
in providing access to services and in maintaining support for social capital objectives (where
the majority of the project funds were spent) but modest achievement in enhancing local
governance and for scaling up impact, combined with modest efficiency due to lack of
evidence. For the Santa Catarina project, the overall outcome rating reflects substantially
relevant objectives and design, and substantial achievements with regard to the most
significant objective as it relates to the overarching goal of poverty reduction, namely
increasing the incomes of the rural poor. The rating also considers the project’s substantial
efficiency due to its robust internal rate of return on the rural investments.

The risk to development outcome under both projects is rated moderate. On living
conditions, access to electricity in Ceará remained in place seven years after the project
concluded and is reflected in statistics pointing to much improved access. Although access to
water connections also improved and remains higher than at the beginning of the project,
actual access to water and its sustainability depend on the state’s varying climatic conditions,
which are subject to severe drought seasons. Droughts will also reduce productivity and
small farm incomes. Brazil’s present macroeconomic developments, with gross domestic
product turning negative in 2014 and 2015, presents potential risks for the projects’ poverty
achievements however. The adverse effect negative growth on fiscal revenues puts social
transfers, on which many of the poor depend, and other poverty reduction programs at risk.

Lessons
Where projects seek improvements in incomes and living conditions of the poor, a
multidimensional approach will help to better define objectives and monitor
achievements. In the Ceará project, targets on “well-being” and “social welfare” would
benefit from more precise definitions of these concepts, which will typically be
multidimensional to enable measurement and aggregation of impacts across beneficiaries.
Similarly, in the Santa Catarina project, a precise indicator to track achievements under the
“living conditions” objective would have improved the value of monitoring and evaluation.

A community-driven development (CDD) project may not be the best option to provide
access to “last mile” public services, such as electricity. Historically, in the northeast of
Brazil, services have not reached the rural poor. Region-wide, 60 percent of households
gained access to water and electricity (1992-2003) through the Bank financed CDD
programs. In Ceara, during the early part of the project period, neither the State Water
Company nor the State Electricity Company was providing public services to the most poor
and remote areas, due to minimum scale and other eligibility standards. However, once the
federal universal access programs were fully rolled out, what was most needed was accurate
data about access and a service delivery model that reached the rural poor, such as
performance based contractual commitments by distribution companies to achieve the goals.

Reaching the rural poor through a community driven development approach requires
clear participation criteria underpinned by accurate welfare knowledge or data and a
system of aid allocation that is transparent and accounted for by beneficiaries. The two
projects confirm that area poverty targeting arrangements, unaccompanied by clear terms of
village, group and household level selection criteria, are likely to result in reaching less of the
rural poor than is desired. Both projects targeting mechanisms were limited to an assessment
of the relative welfare of the municipal level. In Ceará, selection of communities, for lack of
data, was by design left at the discretion of MCs. And in Santa Catarina, where the targeting
process was more transparent, delays in producing the needed data resulted in the application
of a less informed targeting process than originally intended.

Although productive subproject approaches may have a more direct and visible impact
on incomes, the provision of complementary basic services—within or outside of the
project framework—is also key to ensuring sustainability. In Ceará, access to tractors was
the intervention found to produce the most income, but complementary services such as
providing access to electricity and water underpin the feasibility of these activities, as well as
provide additional welfare benefits at the household level.
                                            xiii


Integrating poverty reduction and natural resource management (as in the Santa
Catarina project) may be a better option than addressing these objectives in a separate
project. In Ceará, assistance to farmers, particularly on productive (tractor) subprojects, did
not benefit enough from land management techniques, resulting in farming technologies that
may have had an adverse effect on soil quality. Nevertheless, as water availability and
adaptation to the adverse impacts of periodic droughts are the main natural resource-related
challenges in Ceará, the project’s support for small water infrastructure subprojects partly
addressed these challenges.

1. Background and Context
1.1    This clustered Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses two rural
poverty reduction projects that the Bank carried out in two Brazilian states during 2001–
2009: the Ceará Rural Poverty Reduction project (RPRP), approved in 2001 and closed,
following a 2006 additional financing (AF) project, in 2009; and the Santa Catarina Natural
Resource Management and Rural Poverty Reduction Project (NRMRPRP), approved in 2002
and closed in 2009.

Poverty Reduction and Environmental Challenges
1.2     The two projects shared the objective of improving the economic and social
conditions of the rural poor operated under very different conditions. Rural poverty rates in
the two states were, and remain, polar opposites. In 2001, Ceará had the second highest rural
poverty rate among Brazilian states, after Piaui’s. Santa Catarina had the lowest rural poverty
rate (Neder and Silva 2004). The extreme rural poor in Ceará accounted for 39.1 percent of
the state’s rural population (IPEA 2012a).1 The extreme rural poor in Santa Catarina
accounted for only 8.1 percent of the state’s rural population (IPEA 2012b). Differences
between Ceará’s and Santa Catarina’s poverty levels can be traced to differences in the
states’ per-capita incomes as well as their income distribution. As shown in figure 1.1, in
2001, Santa Catarina’s monthly per-capita household income was almost three times as large
as Ceará’s, and its income was more equally distributed, with a Gini coefficient 6 percentage
points lower than Ceará’s. In turn, differences in average incomes can be explained largely
by differences in productivity linked to geography. In particular, according to Folegatti et al.
(2011, 5), Santa Catarina’s availability of water (13.7 cubic meters per capita per year) is far
above Ceará’s (1.7).

1.3     The Santa Catarina project objectives combined improvements in incomes and living
conditions of the rural poor with natural resource management, the latter a key factor with a
bearing on farm productivity and incomes. In contrast, the Ceará project sought primarily to
improve the social and economic conditions of the poor. This difference was due in part to
the way the Bank programs had been shaped in each of these states. In Santa Catarina, the
Bank opted for integrating productivity, income, and environmental dimensions more closely
within projects. The Santa Catarina project was the successor to the 1989 Land Management
II Project, which focused on land management as a means of raising agricultural productivity
and incomes. The Santa Catarina project added a poverty reduction dimension to the
objective. In Ceará, the Bank supported environmental objectives through separate projects.
The successor project to the Ceará RPRP integrated productive and environmental
dimensions more closely but with a weaker focus of its objective on poverty reduction.

1.4      Both states faced, and continue to face, environmental challenges. As one of Brazil’s
driest states, Ceará experiences chronic water scarcity, with long and severe droughts that
hamper agricultural development and reduce social welfare. Parts of the state lack basic
access to water and sanitation services. Inadequate land use and solid waste management
practices impair water quality. In contrast, Santa Catarina is abundant in water. Yet, it suffers
from some similar environmental problems, including from poor solid waste management
practices, land degradation, and pollution caused by runoff water and inadequate disposal of
animal wastes. Scarcity of water has adversely affected agricultural productivity in Ceará,
and land degradation has reduced productivity in both states but to a comparatively greater
extent in Santa Catarina (Braga et al. 2008; Suliano et al. 2009).

Country Context
1.5      In 2002, the poverty levels in Ceará and Santa Catarina reflected the considerable
progress made by Brazil in reducing poverty. In particular, Brazil’s 2004 stabilization plan
led to sharp gains for the poor between 1993 and 1995 from lower inflation, lower food
prices, and rising incomes in the services sector (Rocha 2013). These factors resulted in a
slightly more equitable income distribution, which partly explained poverty reduction. But
progress in reducing poverty ceased after 1995 when economic growth declined due to
several developments, including the 1997 Asian and 1998 Russian crises, the 2001 electricity
crisis, and market jitters from the 2002 presidential election. These economy-wide
developments account for a “frozen” national poverty rate until 2003. Economy-wide factors
are noted here as background to this PPAR’s argument that much of the progress in poverty
reduction that occurred during the life of the two projects can be attributed to new economy
                                             3


wide developments, including increasing conditional cash transfers and other social programs
by the federal government, that occurred after 2003, noting furthermore that the poverty
reduction outcomes apply both to Brazil’s urban and rural populations.

CDD Rural Poverty Reduction Paradigm
1.6     The core elements of community-driven development (CDD) comprise the
investment of resources through local community structures and the devolution of decision
making regarding the use of those resources for them (Bennet and D’Onofrio 2014). CDD
projects aim to reduce poverty by targeting the resources toward and responding directly to
the needs and demands of poor communities. In Ceará, the project allocated resources to and
through community associations (CAs) created for this purpose. Similarly, in Santa Catarina,
the project invested resources through microcatchment associations (Mas). Both targeted
rural communities in municipalities with high poverty rates, although in the case of Santa
Catarina, a territorial (i.e., microcatchment) approach was used.

1.7     The Bank has had a long history with CDD projects in Brazil prior to the Ceará and
Santa Catarina projects, beginning with the 1986 Northeast Rural Development Project that
covered four states in Brazil’s northeast. This was followed by state-level, poverty alleviation
projects (also in the northeast), one of which was the immediate predecessor of the Ceará
poverty reduction project under review. In turn, the Santa Catarina project evolved from the
Land Management II Project in the same state. It included financial support to farmer
associations for land management purposes as well as an investment fund for farmers, but
with the purpose of both land management, which was the primary focus of the predecessor
project, and poverty reduction.

1.8     The Ceará and Santa Catarina projects were preceded by research that identified the
possible impacts as well as pitfalls of previous CDD programs in Brazil. As early as 1995, a
series of studies concluded the poverty alleviation projects improved the living conditions
and nutritional situation of the rural poor, and increased value added, production, incomes,
and employment in rural communities (van Zyl et. al 1995). Furthermore, from a sample of
completed and fully operating projects under the Northeast Rural Development Program, the
review estimated high internal rates of return (IRRs), over 50 percent, for productive
projects. At the same time, the review noted shortcomings identified by existing research,
including mistargeting of beneficiaries, weak community participation in subproject
prioritization, lack of participation and financial contribution by municipalities, political
interference, and lack of sustainability of subprojects and CAs.

2. Ceará Rural Poverty Reduction Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
2.1      This operation included an original project approved in 2001 and an AF project
approved in 2006. The original loan agreement articulated the project development objectives
as: (i) to increase social and economic opportunities for the municipalities’ rural poor by
improving access to basic, social, and economic infrastructure through community
subprojects; (ii) to increase the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively
                                             4


and meet their own needs; and (iii) to foster local governance and citizenship through
creation and strengthening of municipal councils (MCs), at the same time forging links with
governmental and nongovernmental agencies, civil society, financial institutions, and the
private sector (World Bank 2001b).

2.2      The loan agreement for the AF project added: (iv) to scale up the impact of the
original project by using the social capital created by it to further increase incomes of the
rural poor and by fostering closer integration of development policies, programs, and projects
in rural areas at the local level by assisting MCs to extend their role in seeking funding from,
setting priorities for, and making decisions concerning the allocation of resources from other
programs beyond the project (World Bank 2006b).

2.3     Compared to the objectives articulated in the project appraisal document (PAD), the
objectives articulated in the AF project paper (World Bank 2006a) and in both loan
agreements omitted the overarching objective of poverty reduction. Following IEG’s
standard practice, this PPAR uses the objectives as articulated in the loan agreements.

Relevance of Objectives under the Original Project

2.4     Relevance of the original project objectives is rated High. The original project’s
objective to increase social and economic opportunities for the rural poor responded directly
to Ceará’s high rural poverty rates. In 2001, the year the project was approved, Ceará’s rural
poor accounted for 67.2 percent of its rural population, well above Brazil’s average of 51.7
percent2 (Pero and Freitas da Cruz Undated). Extreme poverty affected 39.1 percent of
Ceará’s rural population.3 Ceará’s rural poverty rate ranked second in Brazil, after Piaui’s
(Neder and Silva 2004). The other two original project objectives—covering enhanced social
capital of rural communities, and local governance through MCs and their forging of links
with governmental and nongovernmental agencies, civil society, financial institutions and the
private sector— also responded to Ceará’s high rural poverty as a means to help poor rural
communities define, obtain, and implement development assistance to improve their incomes
and living standards in a more relevant, targeted way. Furthermore, the significant variation
in the social development of Ceará’s municipalities also suggests gaps in social capital, local
governance, and the forging of links between municipal governments and other entities.4

2.5     The objectives are aligned with Bank and state government strategies. The country
assistance strategy (CAS) for 2000–2002 included poverty reduction as its overarching
objective, with fiscal adjustment, growth of per capita incomes, effective public institutions,
and environmental management as ingredients toward the overarching goal (World Bank
2000). The next two country strategies, covering the 2003–2007 and 2008–2011 periods,
reshuffled these dimensions by placing equity, environmental sustainability, and
competitiveness objectives at the same level, with effective public institutions and sound
macro management as their cross-cutting foundations (World Bank 2003a, 2008). At the time
of project closing in 2009, the Bank’s country partnership strategy for 2008–2011, under its
Equitable Brazil pillar, focused on reducing extreme poverty, vulnerability, and social
exclusion. The project fit well with the federal government’s Projeto Alvorada framework for
poverty reduction (launched at the time of project preparation), which supported efforts in

scores. Poverty reduction also featured prominently in Ceará’s three development programs.
In particular, the state government’s 2008–2011 Multiannual Plan indicated in its Fair and
Solidary Society pillar an aim to break away from a perpetual poverty policy model through
productive and social inclusion actions. It cited the Bank’s project as one of its four main
programs on rural development and family agriculture (Government of Ceara 2007, 54). Both
the Ceará RPRP and the Santa Catarina NRMRPRP that this report also covers had Bank
follow-up projects, albeit with different approaches to rural incomes (See Box.2.1).

 Box 2.1. The Bank’s New Objectives in Successor Projects
 Both the Ceará RPRP and the Santa Catarina project were succeeded by new projects with different
 approaches to rural incomes. Under the new approaches, the focus was more on raising rural
 competitiveness and less on building social capital and local governance, and without explicit
 objectives to reduce rural poverty. The Ceará Rural Sustainable Development and Competitiveness
 Project (known as the Sao Jose III project), which succeeded the Ceará RPRP (known as the Sao
 Jose II project) sought to improve the sustainability of rural production and rural income
 generation and to universalize access to water services. The Santa Catarina Rural Competitiveness
 Project, which succeeded the Santa Catarina Natural Resource Management Poverty Reduction
 Project, sought to increase the competitiveness of Family Agriculture Producer Organizations
 while providing support for an improved framework of structural competitiveness inducing public
 services activities. The new Ceará project, in particular, reflects the Bank’s revised strategy in
 Brazil’s Northeast with a “new generation of projects that will help raise agricultural productivity,
 increase the efficient use of scarce water, and promote climate change resilience.”
 The objectives of both new projects reflect the new set of broad objectives in the 2012–2015
 country partnership strategy (CPS), which seek investment efficiency, public services quality,
 regional economic development, and sustainable natural resource management. Although the CPS
 objectives do not explicitly refer to poverty reduction, the recently issued Systematic Country
 Diagnostics has an extensive discussion of poverty reduction and shared prosperity that suggests a
 continued Bank focus on poverty reduction.

Relevance of Objectives under Additional Financing

2.6     Relevance of the AF objectives is rated high. The AF maintained the three original
project objectives and added the objective “to scale up the impact of the Original Project by
using the social capital created by the original project to further increase incomes of the rural
poor and by fostering closer integration of development policies, programs and projects in
rural areas at the local level, by assisting MCs to extend their role in seeking funding from,
setting priorities for and making decisions concerning the allocation of resources from other
programs beyond the Project.”

2.7      The new objective is closely related to the first and third objectives under the original
project, covering opportunities for the rural poor and local governance. The aim of increasing
incomes is aligned with the original project objective “to increase social and economic
opportunities.” The original project included an “increase in well-being and incomes of
project beneficiaries” as one of the KPIs (key performance indicators). Similarly, the second
part, closer integration of development policies, was part of the original project objective to
                                             6


“foster local governance and citizenship through creation and strengthening of MCs, at the
same time forging links with governmental and nongovernmental agencies, civil society,
financial institutions, and the private sector.” The “scaling up” dimension of the new
objective referred to the use of AF resources and the resources that would be mobilized from
other federal and state programs. The second of these sources was to involve the “use of the
participatory municipal councils to strengthen coordination and effectiveness of other
programs in the rural space.”

2.8     Accordingly, the same considerations discussed regarding relevance of the original
project’s objectives apply to relevance of the AF objectives. Both shared the first three
project objectives, and the objective introduced by the AF was similar to the first and third of
the original project’s objectives. The objectives in both were consistent with the state’s
development priorities (poverty reduction) and with Bank and state strategies.

Relevance of Project Design

2.9     Relevance of design is rated modest. The main reason for this rating is the project did
not design sufficiently adequate arrangements to select the poor because of a poorly defined
targeting framework that did not choose beneficiary communities transparently.

Table 2.1. Ceará RPRP Results Framework
 Target population: The project expected to reach about 120,000 poor rural families (22 percent of
 Ceará’s rural population) with at least one subproject. These families were to primarily comprise
 small-holders, tenants, sharecroppers, and landless laborers.

2.10 Table 2.1 summarizes the project’s results chain. Matching-grants were to finance
community investments including infrastructure (electricity, roads and water), health,
education and in small-scale productive subprojects (tractors, agro-processing etc.) These
were to increase the social and economic opportunities of the rural poor. Training and
                                             7


technical assistance provided to rural CAs, MCs, and other participating entities were to
improve participatory planning and financial management, subproject assessments including
their environmental impacts, and the maintenance and operation of those investments. These
training activities would help enhance rates of return on investment and their impact on
incomes and well-being of the poor, and develop social capital, governance, and integration
of policies and programs.

2.11 The results chain was underpinned by the CDD approach that had been tested in prior
operations, which demonstrated both successes and failures. In principle, communities are
well-positioned to identify the needs of their constituents and implement projects that will
help address those needs, as they have incentives to improve their living conditions.
Municipal councils, with good representation from CAs—whose representatives were
intended to comprise at least 80 percent of the council voting members—were expected to
have incentives aligned with project objectives.

2.12 However, a key problem with project design was the poverty targeting framework,
which was subject to potential biases. It did not have a fully transparent and reliable way of
selecting the poorest communities. The project assigned priority targeting to the poorest of
the poor municipalities. Poor communities were to be targeted through a two-step process
that first prioritized municipalities on the basis of human development indices. These
municipalities were to select poor communities at their discretion on the basis of their
knowledge of local conditions. But it was unclear how MCs would identify and prioritize the
poorest communities and whether discretionary allocation of these resources would reach the
poorest. Furthermore, many of the poorest communities would need time and support to
develop the capacity to govern themselves and might not get as much representation as the
less poor communities. For example, the project’s September 2002 Aide Memoire (World
Bank 2002c, 4)5 refers to the 46 municipalities with the highest infant mortality rates, noting
that they have few organized communities or active MCs, and they are the most poor.

2.13 It was also unclear how MCs would play a strong role in decision making, since they
lacked the budget and infrastructure to do so, remained dependent on the municipal
governments, and were not empowered to allocate resources, only to clear projects for
consideration at the state level. Pitfalls in these two institutional arrangements could well
weaken local participation and governance. This evaluation shows that links between MCs
and CAs were indeed not as strong as they were deemed to be, particularly for reaching the
more remote and poorer communities.

Implementation and Outputs
2.14 The original project was coordinated by the state Secretariat for Rural Development
(SDR) and administered and co-executed by the State Technical Unit (STU) within its
Technical Directorship6 and the State Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Agency
(EMATERCE).7 Subprojects were identified, prepared, implemented, supervised, operated,
and maintained by the CAs, groups of rural citizens with a common interest who organized
into legally constituted associations.
                                             8


2.15 Three different mechanisms were used to approve projects and release funds. Under
the most widely used, MCs decided on CA subproject proposals except in cases where the
councils did not function properly, in which case the state decided on proposals. The project
envisaged graduating some MCs to have them manage an annual budget envelope, allocating
and distributing funds to their CAs. After subproject approval under any of these three
arrangements, the CAs received a share of their subproject costs for design and
implementation as well as technical assistance and training made available by their MCs and
by the STU. Project implementation revealed that in practice, MCs mainly preselected
subprojects for STU consideration; they did not decide whether to finance them or not.
Municipal councils had veto power over CA proposals. But so did the state government,
which rejected 910 subprojects (19.8 percent of total submitted) during the life of the project.

2.16 Other actors played more specific roles. The Superintendence for Water Infrastructure
helped build water systems for communities with more than 50 families. The Ceará Water
and Sanitation Company helped likewise for water systems for communities with less than
50 families. The project leveraged the resources of the Secretariat of Infrastructure and Ceará
Electricity Company for rural electrification under the program Luz para Todos (Electricity
for All), as well as CAGECE resources for household sanitation, water supply, and sewage.
The STU engaged consultants through the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in
Agriculture.

2.17 Project Costs and Component Financing. The original project and the AF comprised
three components, with a planned total cost of $100 million (table 2.2). The actual cost
increased to $113.1 million primarily because of an increased infrastructure subcomponent
(resulting partly from increased domestic currency construction costs and a lower value of
the U.S. dollar) that was funded with increased counterpart funds. The community
subprojects component ($104.54 million, including government counterpart funds and
beneficiary contributions, normally in kind) provided the matching grants to rural CAs under
the three mechanisms outlined above and accounted for 92.4 percent of project costs. The
Institutional Development Component ($6.65 million) provided training and technical
assistance and accounted for 5.9 percent of project costs. Project administration component
($1.94 million) covered supervision, monitoring, and impact evaluation, and accounted for
1.7 percent of project costs.

Note: The breakdown of the community subprojects component was estimated using the average project costs and number
of projects reported in the Implementation Completion and Results Report.


2.18 The project was to finance infrastructure (water, sanitation, and electricity),
productive community subprojects (rural mechanization—tractors—and community
businesses such as agribusiness), and social community subprojects (education and health).
As indicated, project implementation resulted in a substantial increase in the infrastructure
subcomponent of community subprojects that was financed by an increase in local financing
and by a reduction in productive and social subprojects. This reflected stronger than
anticipated community demand for water and power infrastructure, the state’s policy focus
on building infrastructure as a condition of success of productive subprojects, higher project
costs, and an appreciated currency. Furthermore, the project leveraged $68.7 million more
from formal arrangements with state and federal agencies and programs that provided
cisterns, water supply and sewage systems, and electrification. The original project envisaged
2,000 subprojects, including 904 infrastructure, 420 productive, and 676 social subprojects
(World Bank 2001). In the end, the first project financed 1,203 infrastructure subprojects,
218 productive (only tractor) subprojects, and only 2 social (education) subprojects.
Similarly, the AF project funded 1,189 infrastructure, 267 productive (somewhat broadened
beyond tractors), and only 8 social subprojects (Government of Ceará 2009,).8

2.19 The project expected and achieved a fairly smooth linear disbursement path, which
was extended with AF. In fact, as the two projects began, disbursements picked up quickly
due to ready subprojects in the pipeline (on water in the original project and electricity in the

AF project) .9 In contrast to the Santa Catarina project, no novel project features had to be put
in place, as the project was a continuation of the predecessor 1995 Rural Poverty Alleviation
Project. Furthermore, the political transition in 2002 did not affect readiness for
implementation as much as it did in the Santa Catarina operation.

a. Includes other infrastructure subprojects for agriculture and cattle faming.

2.20 Table 2.3 summarizes subprojects, beneficiaries, and costs by type of subproject. All
in all, the project reached a total of 185,461 families, about 105 percent of the project’s target
of 109,000 under the original project plus 68,000 under the AF. This was done through a
total of 2,932 subprojects, which exceeded the revised target10 of 2,850 but fell short of the
original target of 3,300. The project covered 2,470 CAs, exceeding the project target of
2,300. These CAs covered about 65 percent of all rural communities and about 50 percent of
all rural families (World Bank 2009).

Achievement of Objectives
Objective 1: Increase social and economic opportunities for the rural poor through
improved access to basic, social, and economic infrastructure.

2.21 Efficacy is rated substantial. The project reached the poor, albeit with biases in favor
of the less poor within the target population. It improved access by the poor to water and
electricity, and to some productive capacity (mainly tractors), but less so for health and
education. Project data suggest a possible impact on “social and economic opportunities,” as
reflected in incomes and well-being of the target group (a key performance indicator).

2.22 Targeting the Poor. To reach the poor the project sought to target the poorest
communities in a project area that covered all municipalities in Ceará except the seven that
comprise the metropolitan area of Fortaleza, Ceará’s capital city (World Bank 2001a). The
first step in this selection was to stratify the 177 municipalities into three groups based on
development and social indicators. Average poverty levels varied across municipalities, with
minimum and maximum poverty headcount ratios, respectively, of 53 percent and 92 percent
in 2000, and an average of 78 percent (FECAMP 2004). The first group (Area 1) was
                                                                                      11


determined by applying cluster analysis methods to a municipal development index
calculated by the state government that combines various development dimensions such as
social, demographic, and infrastructure (IPECE 1999). This yielded the poorest group of 59
municipalities. The next poorest group of 51 municipalities (Area 2) was determined using
the HDI to select those not included in the first group and with an HDI less than 0.4. The
third group (Area 3) included 67 municipalities with HDI more than 0.4 and less than 0.5.11
The three groups had similar numbers of persons occupied in agriculture (370,000 to
386,000) and of farms (106,000 to 114,000), and percentages of farms with less than 10
hectares (69.4 to 71.9). They differed, however, in average incomes, as suggested by per
capita municipal taxes, which ranged from R$1.6 in the first group to R$3.1 in the third
group, all well below the average for Ceará (R$17.5) and the metropolitan areas (R$39.3).

2.23 The original project plan was to allocate R$595,000 (US$246,000) per municipality
to the poorest 59 municipalities, R$460,000 (US$190,871) per municipality to the next
poorest 51 municipalities, and R$374,000 (US$155,187) to the remaining 67 municipalities.

Source: Amounts per area for each phase were calculated from project data published in Government of Ceará (2009).

2.24 The AF project planned an equivalent distribution of resources across the
municipalities. Figure 2.1 compares the planned allocations with the actual amounts per
municipality. It shows that actual allocations per municipality for Area 1 (the group of
poorest municipalities) were lower than planned allocations; and actual allocations per
municipality for the two less poor groups (Areas 2 and 3) were higher. This result was partly
the outcome of a relatively higher number of projects than planned for the less poor
municipalities and partly the outcome of larger average projects for Areas 2 and 3 during the
second phase of the project. During the first phase of the project, subproject sizes averaged
R$85,000 ($35,270) for the three groups. During the second phase, the average subproject
size was respectively R$80,000 ($33,195) for the poorest group, R$88,700 ($36,805) for
Area 2, and R$89,800 ($37,261) for Area 3. The project covered 17.1 percent of families in
the poorest group, 20.4 percent of families in Area 2, and 23.3 percent in Area 3
(Government of Ceará 2009; World Bank 2001a).

2.25 The next step consisted of selecting poor communities within the municipalities. It
relied on the MCs’ prioritization process to allow the communities (through their majority
representation on councils) to determine where project resources were best applied based on
their first-hand knowledge of socioeconomic conditions and investment needs (World Bank
2001a, 43). With no social indicators at the community level, there is no documented record
of what happened in practice. Nevertheless, further bias toward the less poor may have
occurred. Based on interviews with CAs, the project evaluation prepared by Fundaçao
Economia de Campinas (Federal University of Campinas, São Paulo, FECAMP) concluded
that MCs played a weak role (FECAMP 2004). They exercised subproject veto power rarely,
thereby suggesting the less poor and more enabled communities had a better chance of
moving subprojects through the MCs. The same evaluation points to the logistical challenges
of engaging the poorest and more disperse communities and CAs’ minority role in the
makeup of the MCs, as well as the practice of some MCs of delegating their functions to
“representative commissions” that further distanced MCs from the CAs. This opened a space
for elite capture and left CA access to project resources more unpredictable, where various
kinds of intermediaries played a role in connecting the CA to the project. The ICR notes that
targeting was influenced by agreements between the federal and state governments to
intensify investments in agrarian reform and colonization areas (e.g., the Landless Workers
Movement), and by political pressure on some councils to approve large numbers of projects
prior to elections, further detracting from the project selection criteria.

2.26 The data available are inconclusive on the average income levels of selected
beneficiaries. Table 2.4 compares average per-capita income from the project’s 2004 and
2009 surveys with a standard poverty line. The 2003 average income estimate is 34.8 percent
above the standard poverty line. The 2009 average income estimate for the treatment group is
1.5 percent below the poverty line and, for the control group (which after the survey
benefited from project investments), it is 14.5 percent below the poverty line. These averages
have large variations, as indicated by high standard deviations. The income levels and their
variations further suggest that the project reached some non-poor.

Water Subprojects

2.27 The project’s chief output was infrastructure to increase access to water. During the
time of the project, the state government assigned high priority to improving access to water
and electricity and conducted information campaigns stressing these priorities (World Bank
2009). Project data suggest that community demand for access to water was also strong,
which is not surprising given the state’s climatic conditions of frequent and long droughts.

2.28 With access to water as a high priority, the state arranged for a significant
contribution in counterpart funds, largely earmarked for water infrastructure. Programa
Cisternas, a federal effort, provided R$7,689,153 (US$3,190,520) for water cisterns, and
Plano de Ações para a Convivência com a Seca, a state drought program, provided
R$2,028,818 (US$841,833). A second important source for counterpart funds for water was
the state water company, which provided R$23,309,130 (US$9,671,838). The water
component was one factor that allowed the project to start up rapidly. The STU had
cumulative experience on these subprojects, and a large number of pending water supply
subproject proposals had been generated during the predecessor project.

2.29 The project financed 1,837 water supply subprojects with R$162.6 million, or 63.5
percent of total project cost (World Bank 2009). The subprojects comprised water wells with
fountains, small water pipelines, and small dams. About 70 percent of the investments were
typically for deep wells.12 The total number of subproject beneficiaries was 142,020 families,
or about 568,000 rural dwellers. Thus, about a quarter of Ceará’s rural population benefited
from the water component. Accordingly, the project accounted for part of the progress that
Ceará made in improving access to water over the years during which the project was
implemented. In 1999, only about 12 percent of all rural households had access to piped
water supply. Water access has increased despite being affected by long-lasting droughts. In
2013, 29.9 percent of households had access to piped water.13

2.30 Maintenance arrangements for piped water systems varies. The systems can be
maintained by the beneficiary community itself, with municipal mayors contributing part of
the fees. Alternatively, operation and maintenance are entrusted to Sistema Integrado de
Saneamento Rural (SISAR), a nongovernmental organization formed by CAs in 1995 that
built water systems through the Bank and other sources. SISAR is organized by river basins
(eight in the state). It maintains infrastructure, controls water quality, trains operators, and
bills users. CAs remain in charge of operating the systems, including water treatment. SISAR
presently services 760 autonomous water and sanitation systems in 135 municipalities (73
percent of Ceará’s total) with a population of 435,021 and 115,000 connections.

Electricity Subprojects

2.31 Electricity subprojects were next in importance under the project, largely driven by
the federal program Luz para Todos (Electricity for All), which in 2009 achieved its goal of
giving free electricity access to 10 million people in rural areas. Under this program, the state
Infrastructure Secretariat contributed $21.7 million. The project supported subprojects only
through 2006, as coverage of 98 percent was achieved by the time of the AF.
                                                                           14


2.32 The Bank project financed 586 rural electrification subprojects, for which it
contributed $22.6 million, or 21.6 percent of total subproject cost. They involved extensions
of high and low tension lines averaging, respectively, 2.1 and 10.2 kilometers, and provided
monophasic lines in all cases and triphasic lines in 37.5 percent (World Bank 2009). The
subprojects helped expand electricity consumption (figure 2.2) and benefitted 22,080 rural
families (about 88,300 rural dwellers). Between 2004 and 2006, 28,571 electricity consumers
were added. Bank-funded subprojects appear to account for 77.2 percent of the expansion.

2.33 The experience of the electricity subcomponent illustrates how the project was
inserted into broader government programs that benefited other rural municipalities and
communities. Following the contribution by the Bank’s project, the Electricity for All
program invested $221.9 million during 2007–2010, thereby continuing to provide expanded
access to electricity (IPECE 2012b). All in all, the number of rural electricity consumers
increased from 89,191 in 2000 to 448,223 in 2013. Census data show that rural and urban
household access to electricity increased from 89.27 percent in 2000 to 98.94 percent in 2010
(IPECE 2011) largely as the result of expanding rural access (World Bank 2009). This
insertion within a broader program limits the idea that the project provided a differential
contribution over areas outside of the project, since many of those areas were being served by
the broader program. It helps explain why the project’s 2009 impact evaluation did not show
a significant impact by the subprojects when compared with areas not yet treated under the
project; many of those areas had already benefited from the Electricity for All program.

Productive Subprojects

2.34 A contributing factor to the increased project attention to water was reduced project
attention to productive investments. Productive subprojects were dominated by agricultural
mechanization (371 subprojects, primarily tractors), followed by agro processing (38),
nonfarm businesses (19), breeding (15), fruit trees (15), fish farming (12), and other
activities. All nontractor productive subprojects were implemented under the 2006 AF
project. Of the 810 originally planned productive subprojects, only 531 were implemented
(World Bank 2009) partly due to the 2003 shift of the project from the SDR to the Secretariat
for Local and Regional Development (SDLR). The latter directed more project efforts toward
infrastructure. SDLR’s objective was regional development through the strengthening of
rural nonfarm activities, especially around cities. This discouraged the development of
productive subprojects because they were not a priority while efforts were being directed to
universal access to electricity and water. In 2007, with the project transferred to the
Secretariat for Agrarian Development (SDA), attention to productive activities received
greater attention.

2.35 Tractor subprojects provided the community with access to plowing at an acceptable
price (around $20 an hour), increased community income through rental fees, employment,
productivity, increased area farmed, and transport for crops and water. In 2000, a year before
the first project was approved, Ceará already had experience with community tractor
subprojects through the predecessor Rural Poverty Alleviation Project, having financed 573.
On average, each subproject benefited 95 families, created an estimated 29 jobs, increased
cultivated area by 23 hectares, and at a tractor cost of about $31,000, generated an average
income per community association of $4,370, thereby yielding an internal rate of return
exceeding 30 percent (World Bank 2001).

2.36 The tractor subproject consisted of a technology package that included implements
(e.g., plow). After subproject approval, a community association invited bids from
concessionaires and selected the offer on the basis of price. To obtain a tractor, the
community provided counterpart funding, normally in the form of construction of tractor
garages or other machinery. The tractor was then entrusted to someone in the community
who allocated its services and arranged for its maintenance. By renting it to users in and
outside the community, it generated income, which was used for maintenance or other
purposes. Some municipalities rented the tractors from beneficiary communities to provide
its services to other communities lacking tractors, thereby increasing overall impact.

2.37 The FECAMP (2004), World Bank (2009a), and Tecno Metrica (2009) evaluations
illustrate, in most cases, the tractor subprojects worked well. In FECAMP’s beneficiary
survey, more than half of those interviewed felt the tractor increased income, and 65 percent
said it helped to better provide for their families. Those interviewed pointed to increases in
household income, increased production for self-consumption, reduced time required for
farming activities, reduced expenses on external services, increased real estate values, and
enhanced community activities.

2.38 Despite the benefits, community tractor subprojects were subject to pitfalls. The
Tecno Metrica (2009) survey notes cases where the tractor accessories were not delivered,
                                            16


thereby impeding the tractor’s use. The same survey indicated subutilization of old tractors in
pristine condition. Cases of maintenance and parts problems arose, particularly in the poorest
communities with reduced managerial capacity and where proceeds from rentals were not
used for maintenance. In some cases, politics undermined subproject benefits. For example,
an elder created an association to obtain a tractor and did not use it to benefit the community.
The PPAR mission witnessed an evident conflict on tractor use as the result of political
rivalry between the community leader and the tractor administrator. Moreover, there were
cases of malfeasance, for example, where a tractor was withdrawn from the community by
intermediaries that presented themselves as responsible for the release of funds and
transferred the tractor to others. Finally, the project’s mid-term review also noted low tractor
utilization rates because of climatic and soil conditions, and maintenance costs, and
recommended “a more rigorous analysis of these subprojects and mainly caution with the
demand stimulated by third parties; prioritizing financing when adequately linked to a
productive subproject with a guaranteed market and environmental sustainability.”14

2.39 There are many examples of other productive subprojects (FECAMP 2004; World
Bank 2009; Tecno Metrica 2009). In the Municipality of Maranguape, close to Fortaleza, a
subproject financed a CA of 40 producers to invest in an agro-industrial facility that extracts
juice from a variety of tropical fruits produced by the community. A small factory has simple
processing machinery and a freezing chamber. The subproject began in 2007 with a monthly
production of 200–400 kilograms. Today it produces about 80 tons per year, selling most to
the state government for distribution at schools and the rest to area supermarkets.

2.40 Farmer incomes could increase through the expansion of nonfarm productive
activities. As indicated above, the project financed only 19 nonfarm businesses, including
activities as varied as confection, stone grinding, handicrafts, and marketing of hammocks.

Social Subprojects

2.41 There were only 10 social subprojects, on education (4) and culture (6), reflecting low
community demand. Also, the STU viewed many of the few proposals submitted as
unfeasible or unsustainable (Government of Ceará 2009).

Training

2.42 The second project component (institutional development) financed technical
assistance and training to increase the project’s institutional capacity and covered MCs, CAs,
and the STU. The component included about 600 events, of which 500 were conducted
during the AF phase. Most of the 600 (74 percent) were on project operations (e.g.,
environmental standards). Institutional development (e.g., management of small scale water
supply) accounted for 18 percent. STU capacity building (e.g., procurement and financial
management) accounted for 5 percent. The remainder was for monitoring and evaluation
(M&E); for example, presentations on evaluation studies. All in all, participants in the events
(e.g., local leaders, beneficiaries) numbered 23,452.

2.43 In the project contributed to water access for the rural population. In 1999, only about
12 percent of all rural households had access to a piped water supply. By 2010, 23.1 percent
                                            17


had access, and by 2012, access had increased further to 38.9 percent. The project
contributed to increased electricity coverage of the rural population. Tractor subprojects
accounted for the bulk of the project’s contribution to productive capacity. The project’s
contribution to health and education outcomes was negligible.

Social and Economic Opportunities

2.44 The meaning of the broadly articulated “increased social and economic opportunities”
objective is somewhat clarified by a project key performance indicator, namely the “increase
in well-being and incomes of project beneficiaries.” Statewide poverty data indicate that
incomes of the poor improved during the life of the project and thereafter. Broad declines in
poverty were found in Ceará as a whole as well as the urban, rural, and Fortaleza metro areas.
However, most of the rural poverty reduction is likely to be attributable to country-wide
macroeconomic factors. Although the project made some contribution, there is no firm
evidence of how many beneficiaries raised their incomes or became nonpoor as defined by a
standard income poverty line.

2.45 Figure 2.3 depicts Ceará’s poverty trends. Extreme poverty declined throughout the
whole period, including a dip in rural poverty in 2008. However, overall poverty declined
less rapidly, in fact increasing in Fortaleza’s metropolitan area until 2003. After 2004, the
decline in overall poverty accelerated. This acceleration mirrors what was happening at the
country level. Three developments explain this acceleration. First, as a result of GDP growth,
the labor market became more dynamic, resulting in an acceleration of employment growth.
Second, adjustments in the nominal minimum wage resulted in higher real minimum wages,
which had an effect on the value of social transfers to the poor. And third, the consolidation
and increased coverage of social transfers further increased the incomes of the poor (Rocha
2013). Presently, 4.5 million people benefit from the Bolsa Familia Program in Ceará. Social
transfers accounted for about 57.5 percent of rural incomes in 2014. 15 Furthermore, Ceará’s
program to combat poverty (Fundo Estadual de Combate à Pobreza, FECOP)16provided a
total of $372 million for different poverty reduction programs between 2004 and 2009,
including some counterpart funds to the project under review (FECOP 2009, 13). The size of
this program reached $160 million in 2014.

2.46 Measured project impacts on incomes were not statistically significant. The project’s
impact evaluation compared a sample of families that had implemented subprojects in 2009
with a sample that had not yet implemented them (ACEG 2009). The evaluation assessed the
impact of each type of subproject on a range of variables related to the project objectives.
Table 2.5 shows the results on total family income. Although average incomes in the sample
of families that had implemented project subprojects were higher than in the sample of other
communities, the differences were not found to be statistically significant.

2.47 This does not necessarily mean that subproject investments did not have a return.
Rather, it suggests the group did as well or as poorly as the control group and, in the absence
of the project, farmers would have found other programs to improve their income and living
                                             19


conditions. Accordingly, results should be interpreted with caution. Given the broad coverage
of the government programs financed by the project, it is possible that families not yet
reached by the project were reached by government programs. The Electricity for All
program was broad-based and continued expanding after operations under the project
stopped in 2006. Accordingly, the differences between the treatment and control groups
might be small.

2.48 From an income generation perspective, the project envisaged helping to raise rural
incomes. It sought to (i) intensify the economically viable small farm sector (in particular by
raising labor productivity); (ii) revitalize commercial agriculture (in particular to absorb
wage labor); (ii) stimulate growth of the rural nonfarm sector; and (iv) provide adequate
safety nets for those poor who cannot intensify farming or migrate (World Bank 2001a, 4).

2.49 The first option would require larger farms to improve labor productivity. As figure
2.4 shows, Ceará, in contrast to Santa Catarina, does not have a record of improved yields per
hectare. Yields have been static for many years from the limited water access and poor soils.
Accordingly, farmers would need larger areas for farming to achieve higher labor
productivity, giving credence to the critical role of land ownership structure around
poverty.17 Surveys of project beneficiaries indicate tractors were used to add land under
cultivation. Increased access to water could complement intensification, but the project’s
focus was primarily on water for human consumption and less so for irrigated farming. The
dearth of evidence suggests that income from subprojects came primarily from farm
activities. Income appeared to be generated through employment under electricity
(temporary, for construction) and productive (permanent) subprojects—a statistically
significant result in the project’s impact evaluation, with water projects generating little or no
employment. Impacts on total income were not statistically significant.

2.50 It is unclear whether the project could achieve much under the second option—
revitalizing commercial agriculture. Under this option, farmers who cannot live off their land
could become employed by larger, commercial farmers, but this would be an unlikely effect
of a project that targeted small landowners. Furthermore, few large commercial farms are
found in Ceará, where most of the larger rural landholdings are for raising livestock, which is
relatively labor nonintensive. In fact, the project’s expectation would have been that small
farms be more productive—the first option—and thus provide sustainable employment to
their owners.

2.51 The third option—stimulating the nonfarm rural sector—is one that the project could
potentially achieve through its productive investments facility, taking advantage of the
feasibility of those investments once farmers have access to water and electricity. Alves
(2009) shows that growth of nonfarm activities by small-farm families was positive (in
contrast to growth of those activities by larger farm families), confirming its well-known role
as a farmer strategy to combat poverty and diversify risks. Furthermore, Pereira et. al (2015),
from a semi-experimental impact assessment of nonfarm activities on rural poverty in Ceará,
concluded hose activities reduced rural headcount ratios (ratio of the number of rural poor to
the rural population) by over 25 percentage points.

2.52 Unfortunately, project support for water and electricity access appears to have come
at the cost of developing other income options that might have contributed to the project’s
impact on incomes. The project supported few such investments. It is unlikely that much of
the employment generated by the project came from nonfarm activities. Most productive
projects involved mechanization (tractors). An impact evaluation by Associação Cultural e
Educacional de Garçadid (ACEG) did not find significant effects on nonfarm income
(ACEG 2009). For households in communities that benefited from productive, water, and
electricity subprojects, the shares of income from their nonfarm production in total income
were 3.4, 2.6, and 1.7 percent of total income, respectively. Similarly, in the FECAMP
(2004) survey, the shares of income from nonfarm production in total income for families
                                            21


that benefited from infrastructure and productive subprojects respectively amounted to a
paltry 2.9 and 1.1 percent, respectively.18

2.53 Finally, the fourth option—adequate safety nets—was not one the project could
deliver. This was achieved through the impact of increased minimum wages on social
benefits and by the expanded coverage of those benefits.

2.54 The possible income gains from intensifying farming weakly suggest that the project
may have played a role in rural poverty reduction trends. From a rate of return perspective,
the project may have contributed to raising incomes and reducing poverty. For example, most
beneficiaries of tractor subprojects felt that the availability of a community tractor increased
their incomes or production for their own consumption, reduced agricultural labor time and
payments for external services, helped generate new activities, and increased land values
(FECAMP 2004). This is consistent with IRR estimates for tractors from former projects.

2.55 Providing access to electricity and water had a positive impact on well-being.
Ceará’s rural population consumed over four times as many kilowatt-hours per capita in 2013
than in 2000; and its access to piped water increased from 12 percent of households in 1999
to 29.9 percent in 2013. Part of this progress occurred under the project. Access to piped
water increased from 12 percent of all rural households in 1999 to 38.9 in 2012. Between
2001 and 2003, the homes of project beneficiaries with a piped water supply expanded from
17.8 percent to 49.5 percent; with electricity from 61.5 percent to 89.9 percent, and with
septic tanks from 41.7 percent to 50.9 percent (FECAMP 2004). The ICR cites research
pointing to a decline in infant mortality and diarrhea (World Bank 2009). In a survey, most
beneficiaries (93.3, percent) indicated the project improved their living conditions (FECAMP
2004). A study of social indicators for project beneficiaries indicated significant positive
correlations between the number of project subprojects and those indicators (Khan et al.
2007). This suggests an increase in the social welfare of rural communities, a key
performance indicator.

2.56 The 2009 impact evaluation found other statistically significant impacts of interest.
These included the impact of productive subprojects on income from permanent jobs and on
sales of crop produce; the impact of access to water subprojects on consumption goods and
social capital; and the impact of electricity subprojects on the same variables.

2.57 These results suggest incremental employment generated from subproject
investments, another key performance indicator, although the evidence is limited. The ICR
notes the subproject investments directly generated an excess of 20,350 jobs, including
10,870 from tractors, 7,680 from other productive investments, and 1,800 from electrification
subprojects. It highlights employment and income creation potential in several productive
activities and showcases a success story, but does not provide hard representative evidence. It
does provide an estimate of time freed up by water subprojects. By not walking long
distances to fetch water, beneficiaries had more time to earn wages and fill operation and
maintenance jobs generated by those subprojects (World Bank 2009).

2.58 Identified effects on education are limited to night schooling through making
electricity available. The ICR provides an educated guess on income impact. Many
                                            22


communities established night schooling for adults, but the project supported only four
school subprojects. Effects on consumption further suggest the subprojects improved living
conditions.

Objective 2: Increase the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively to
meet their own needs.

2.59 Efficacy is rated substantial, with the caveat that the IEG PPAR did not measure
social capital ex-post, unlike in other assessments it has conducted (e.g. Nigeria, Sri Lanka)
that have been designed to determine whether this objective was achieved at the level of an
outcome, or an input (a means necessary) to achieve project level results.

2.60 The project created 1,354 new Community Associations, adding to the pre-existing
2,192 from the predecessor project. A total of 3,546 CAs applied for participation in the
RPRP. All but 614 received subprojects by the end of the project (World Bank 2009).

2.61 Data collected at two points during the project period (2002 and 2005) for three of the
World Bank CDD poverty reduction support projects in Brazil’s northeast, show that there
was a sharp increase in the perception that a majority of community residents took part in
decision-making, from an average of 58 percent in 2002 to 70 percent in 2005. However,
impact evaluations of CDD programs – like the National Solidarity Program in Afghanistan
have since shown that these effects tend to be highest during the height of project
disbursement cycles. The perception of the legitimacy of the community associations, also
rose, with 77 percent of those surveyed in 2005 as opposed to 45 percent in 2002 perceiving
that associations encourage participation in decision-making. With that said, overall, the
governance and management performance of the RPRP councils appears mixed. For
example, by 2005, only 49 percent, (of the councils were perceived to be run democratically
(a small increase from 44 percent in 2002) and the perception that community associations
were capable of assisting those that need help dropped from 75 to 70 percent between the two
periods.

2.62 A noteworthy finding that emerges from more recent research on the topic suggests
that variability, with regard to community association performance, can in part be explained
by the average literacy of its members. Carrick-Hagenbarth (2013) find that CAs with low
average literacy were at a relative disadvantage because they had more difficulty complying
with subproject processes. The working paper further argues that variation of literacy within
a community created some space for elite capture by its more literate members and more
marginalization of those less literate.

2.63 Nevertheless, the investment in social capital appears to have yielded trust dividends,
with a significant increase in trust reported in working with the Municipality and the State
between the two periods (from 22 percent to 45 percent) and a slight increase in the number
of demands that the community associations were lodging with the Municipal Councils (from
50% more demands since the community was set up as of 2002 to 58 percent in 2005).

2.64 More targeted research on the type and strength of social capital achieved under the
Bank financed CDD projects as compared to the agency and voice within communities that
                                            23


already existed – through participation in various associative arrangements, including
neighborhood, producer, social movement, church-linked and union associations, and
nongovernmental organizations could have helped to establish a stronger causal link between
the project model, its objective statement and the reported results. For example, the 2004
FECAMP evaluation compared social capital before and after project initiation. Investigating
a sample of project beneficiaries in 30 municipalities in 2002–2003, the FECAMP evaluation
noted a significant pre-existing associative tradition in the state prior to the creation of the
MCs in 1995. That assessment found that 90 percent of CAs indicated their communities had
some form of community organization prior to the project, with more than half of those with
experience in collective work that was independent of external resources and aimed at
discussing and resolving common problems. Beneficiaries cited community leaders, church
organizations, and municipal officials as having had strong roles in encouraging the
development of the community organizations. CAs noted that most had been created (or
recreated) to participate in a public project (including the 1995 predecessor project), in some
cases even if the community already had some other form of prior association. The creation
of CAs did not indicate an increase of social capital; it was enabled by pre-existing social
capital and responded to a project requirement.

It Objective 3: Foster local governance and citizenship through creation and strengthening
of municipal councils.

2.65 Efficacy is rated modest. The evidence suggests that MCs did not become stronger.
Evidence cannot be found that MCs forged the links indicated in the objective.

2.66 Social capital can aid governance as it helps focus projects on the communities’
interests, monitor project performance, enforce contracts, use resources, resolve disputes, and
respond to citizen concerns more efficiently. The evidence suggests that local governance
remained largely unchanged. CAs were created as a formal requirement to submit
subprojects to MCs, with modest added value to the community social capital and
governance already embedded in pre-existing community associative arrangements. MCs
played a subsidiary role. Leadership for the formation of MCs rested mainly on state
technical staff and the municipal government, and rather exceptionally on community leaders
(FECAMP 2004).19 Their function was mainly to clear or reject subprojects. Since the MCs
were not subject to budget constraints, they were not forced to choose. They ratified most
proposals (92.8 percent during 2001–2003), rejecting only those that did not meet project
rules, with some MCs more active than others in vetoing projects and with the state playing a
strong role in overall governance.20 After approval of proposals, the MCs did not play a
further role in the subproject’s timeline. Most subprojects operated under Fundo Municipal
de Apoio Comunitario (Municipal Fund for Community Support, FUMAC), whereby
decision making on project proposals is delegated to the MCs while the state remains
responsible for reviewing councils’ recommendations for consistency, final approval, and the
release of funds. The lack of progress toward empowering resource allocation by MCs
(through Pilot Municipal Community Funds, FUMAC-P)21 is an indicator that the
strengthening of MCs was modest. Some MCs exercised their veto power by blocking
subproject requests that did not meet community needs (FECAMP 2004, 64). Still, rejection
rates were low (3.9 percent during 2001–2003), suggesting that MCs largely abided by CA
choices.
                                             24


2.67 With MC preselection of subprojects, it then behooved the state to finally approve
projects and release the funds. In February 2009, the borrower’s completion report noted that
of 4,600 subprojects submitted during the life of the project, the state had rejected 910
(Government of Ceará 2009, 26), further giving credence to the limited empowerment that
MCs had at their disposal. In its role, the state followed its own priorities. At the time of the
2004 evaluation, the top state priority was providing water connections to reduce reliance on
the low-quality water distributed by trucks, to help reduce child mortality, and to cover the
poorest municipalities. Other documents and mission discussions confirmed this priority
throughout the life of the project, which nuances the “community-driven” dimension. The
state played a strong role in deciding where resources would go, although it is possible that
state water (and electricity) programs were well aligned with community needs.

2.68 In sum, the project modestly contributed to local governance, mainly through the
creation of MCs. The local governance embedded in CAs was already largely available in the
communities. The governance contribution of MCs was limited primarily to reviewing and
clearing projects for state consideration, with little capacity or incentives to decide on
resource allocation. The 2004 evaluation attributed the weak role of MCs to their weak
empowerment to allocate resources; a fragile capacity to mobilize technical, human, and
operational resources toward the project; and financial constraints on their operation (See
Fecamp 2004, 67-88). As MCs reasonably depended operationally and financially on
municipal governments, the support they received often depended on the political alignment
of the MC leader with that of the municipality’s leader. This tended to make aligned MCs
more active, due diligent, and closely related to the communities than the nonaligned MCs as
the result of better support first received from municipal governments (FECAMP 2004).
Mission discussions suggested further that the MCs became progressively weaker over time,
and they were used at times as political tools. Project governance remained somewhat
dispersed, with the state government as the main decision maker of priorities, CAs deciding
on projects that benefited them within those priorities, and a long list of intermediaries (e.g.,
government technical staff and local politicians) bringing the two together.22

Objective 4: Scale up the impact of the original project by using the social capital created
by the original project to further increase incomes of the rural poor and by fostering
closer integration of development policies, programs, and projects in rural areas at the
local level, by assisting MCs to extend their role in seeking funding from, setting
priorities for, and making decisions concerning the allocation of resources from other
programs beyond the project.

2.69 Objective 4 was added by the additional financing project. The efficacy of the first
part of this objective—to further increase incomes of the rural poor—is rated modest. The
project’s impact evaluation did not find a statistically significant effect on the incomes the
rural poor. This indicates that incomes of beneficiaries, compared with those in a control
group, were not different. Nevertheless, the subprojects may have generated positive income
returns. Although there is no direct evidence of impact on incomes from the scaling up of the
project through the additional financing, the additional investments in mechanization (131
subprojects) as well as the nontractor productive subprojects (136) emphasized during the AF
may have increased incomes.23
                                             25


2.70 Efficacy of the second part of this objective—closer integration of interventions at the
local level—is rated negligible. This sub objective was to be achieved by assisting MCs to
extend their role in seeking funding from, setting priorities for, and making decisions
concerning the allocation of resources from other programs beyond the project. It follows
from the discussion of objective 3 that the MCs did not extend their role. Their function
remained limited almost to approving CA subprojects for submission to the state
government. Integration continued through CA access to various state and federal
government programs, with funding, priority setting, and resource allocation largely
dependent on state government, not on municipal councils.24 The ICR notes that integration
was strengthened through an agreement between the federal Ministry of Agrarian
Development and SDA. Under it, MCs belong to one of 13 Territorial Development Councils
that draw up annual Territorial Development Plans, which set priorities and allocate
resources from a range of federal, state, and municipal programs. But integration to
Territorial Development Councils was the result of a countrywide federal initiative. The ICR
also refers to US$13.6 million of additional state counterpart funds processed on behalf of
project beneficiaries through the MCs.25 This represents an increase in total project and
nonproject financing allocated through the municipal council mechanism (a key performance
indicator), not an extension of the MC role as defined above. This increase did not include
”resources from other programs beyond the project”. There is no firm evidence of increased
MC participation “in priority-setting and decision making on resource allocation on project
and nonproject funded development activities” (a key performance indicator), other than the
review and largely automatic approval of CA subprojects for consideration at the state-level.
Although the AF “scaled up” the impact of the original project, the role of MCs was very
limited in seeking funding, setting priorities, and making decisions about the allocation of
resources from other programs beyond the project.

Efficiency
2.71 Efficiency is rated modest based on a lack of sufficient evidence. The PAD had
expectations of high rates of return, based on the experience of similar subprojects. It
calculated rates of return that ranged from 15.4 percent for investment in feed production
equipment to more than 50 percent for a cashew processing plant. The methods to assess
these rates of return relied on activity models, the construction of which relied on interviews
with subproject managers. Given the focus of the project under review on water, electricity
infrastructure, and tractors, the main relevant expectation from those estimates was with
respect to the rate of return on tractors, which was 37.6 percent. There were no ex-ante IRR
estimates for infrastructure subprojects. Nevertheless, the PAD noted that those projects,
being community driven, had relatively low costs and a good record of sustainability, the
latter resulting from adequate user fees to operate and maintain the investments.

2.72 The ICR reported on ex-post IRRs, but this was based only on a sample of 20
subprojects (representing less than one percent of all 2,932 subprojects) financed by the
project from 2002 to 2007.These reflected the focus on water and electricity, as these two
investments accounted for 89.3 percent and 81.5 percent, respectively, of subproject numbers
and costs. The exercise calculated an IRR of 18 percent for water supply projects that
reflected estimates of time saved from water collection, reduction of waterborne diseases,
and willingness to pay (as a proxy for unmeasured benefits). The estimate for electricity was
                                             26


an IRR of 13 percent. It reflected estimates of more employment opportunities from new
businesses (reportedly each rural electrification subproject generated on average 3.4 new
jobs) and more income for adults who benefitted from night schooling. It was assumed,
without testing, that night schooling added 20 percent to the minimum salary governing a
person’s income. No IRR estimates for tractors were provided.

2.73 IRR estimates for four productive subprojects (without tractors) ranged from 10 to 17
percent. For the project as a whole, and considering various scenarios such as higher costs
and lower benefit streams, as subproject failures would warrant, the estimated IRR ranged
from 10 to 17 percent, at least equal to the assumed cost of capital of 10 percent.

2.74 Regarding cost-effectiveness, the ICR reports benefit cost ratio estimates of 1.48 and
1.23, respectively, for water supply and electricity subprojects from the small subproject
sample it covered. Implementation efficiency was somewhat compromised, particularly at the
beginning, as government turnover disrupted project management. Despite the disruptions,
implementation proceeded more or less as planned after the initial delays.

Outcome
2.75 Outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Relevance of the project objective was
high, while implementation was affected by the targeting methodology introduced at design.
Relevance of design is rated modest.The project substantially increased social and economic
opportunities for the rural poor through improved access to basic, social, and economic
infrastructure. Social capital strengthening of the community associations engaged in the
project process was also substantially achieved, with the caveat that perceptions were
measured between baseline and the height of project disbursements, not following the
disbursement cycle. Support for improved governance at the level of the Municipal Council
was modestly achieved and efforts under the short time frame afforded during the additional
financing stage to scale up impact was also positive but modest in its effects. Efficiency is
rated modest, mainly for weakness associated with collecting economic and financial data of
the project’s investments.

Risk to Development Outcome
2.76 Risk to development outcome is rated moderate. Project development outcomes face
several risks. The main one is the risk that declining economic growth will increase income
poverty, at least for some time. Brazil’s GDP stagnated and turned negative in 2014.
Declining growth may erode income gains and reduce the government’s capacity to provide
social transfers. Ceará’s extreme rural poverty rate declined during the life of the project
from 39.1 percent in 2001 to 20.7 percent in 2009. It continued declining after the end of the
project, to 13.5 percent in 2014. With Ceará’s GDP growth declining, from 3.9 percent in the
first quarter of 2014 (year on year) to 1 percent in the first quarter of 2015 (IPECE 2015, 14),
and possibly negative thereafter, poverty rates could increase, although temporarily.

2.77 Furthermore, the adverse effect of weak or negative growth on fiscal revenues puts
social transfers, on which many of the poor depend, at risk. Reduced fiscal revenues may also
reduce capacity to fund other programs targeted to the poor.26 And faltering leadership under
                                             27


present political conditions could exacerbate these risks. Another risk is that government
policy could de-emphasize the direct focus on poverty reduction, as reflected in the successor
project, which is not tracking rural poverty reduction as an outcome. An exogenous risk is
that of recurring droughts that periodically affect the state and reduce productivity. They
have been severe in recent years.

2.78 Some development outcomes relating to living conditions are likely to be sustained.
Access to electricity remains in place seven years after the project concluded and is reflected
in statistics pointing to much improved access. Access to water connections improved and
remains higher than at the project’s beginning, although actual access to water, and its
sustainability, depend on the state’s varying climatic conditions. Indications are that access to
tractors—the main productive investment—has been largely sustained, although there are
cases of underutilization, poor maintenance or elite capture. Nevertheless, the question
remains as to what will happen after the tractors fully depreciate. There are no indications
that communities are accumulating resources to replace them, perhaps expecting that the
state will continue to provide them. The ICR reported good indicators of operation and
maintenance on water, electricity, and tractors, however (World Bank 2009).

2.79 Nevertheless, some subprojects may have failed or were not sustained. For example,
the April 2003 project Aide Memoire (World Bank 2003d, 3-4) notes how a community
received first a dry water well, and replaced by another with water unfit for human
consumption and that dried up in times of drought, requiring the community to go back to
using water from water trucks. Furthermore, Carrick-Hagenbarth (2013, 4) notes that among
eight communities that she visited in land reform areas, three of eight projects failed.

2.80 There is little evidence on the sustainability of social capital or local governance
created under the project. Social capital earned through the CAs created for project purposes
may have suffered some attrition as they lost their original rationale upon project completion.
Nevertheless, inclusion in the successor project of community associations among its
participating organizations may help sustain this form of social capital. Furthermore, a
significant amount of social capital in Ceará is likely to subsist independently of the project,
as communities continue to pursue common interests as they had in the past, although the
poorest communities will be more challenged. On local governance, mission interviews
suggested that MCs weakened as they became “political tools” and were devoid of capacity
to assess development projects. Nevertheless, several MCs remain in operation, which may
be participating in forging local governance through, for example, their role as participants in
territorial development councils.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

2.81 Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. The project was prepared fairly
quickly, in about six months, taking advantage of the readiness provided by the arrangements
under the predecessor project. The project’s objective was relevant to Ceará’s high rural
poverty rate and to state government and Bank objectives that identified poverty reduction as
a priority development challenge. Design of the operation envisaged reducing poverty
                                             28


through grants to poor rural communities for subprojects to increase their basic infrastructure
and productive assets, using a CDD approach to selecting subprojects. Implementation faced
inadequate readiness of the poorest communities to govern themselves and the likelihood that
they might not be as represented as the less disadvantaged poor communities. The decision-
making role that MCs would play, when they lacked the power, budget, and infrastructure to
do so, was limited to approving or rejecting CA subproject proposals (under the FUMAC
arrangement) to be submitted for state government consideration (which the state
government could accept or reject). Nevertheless, the project envisaged MC graduation to an
arrangement were MCs would receive the funds and decide which projects to finance.

2.82 The project’s technical, financial, and economic aspects were generally well
considered. Its prospects of success rested on the CDD approach, including a good record of
satisfactory rates of return on subproject investments under the predecessor project. The
technical aspects of infrastructure subprojects benefited from the experience in the previous
CDD operation in Ceará. Financially, the project rested on the ability of the state government
to bear the cost of the grants to beneficiary communities, and the significance of this grant to
help communities acquire the assets. The intended means to decide on subproject proposals
to be submitted for preliminary approval or rejection by the state government—through the
municipal councils—was sound, although still being tested, for not all councils had good
performance capacity or standards. Design envisaged a more advanced process whereby MCs
managed final approval and funding of subprojects summited by CAs.

2.83 The project’s attention to environmental aspects was limited. The PAD did not expect
subprojects to have an adverse impact on the environment. While they were screened for
potentially adverse environmental effects, the project lacked a proactive environmental
approach to address issues such as land degradation from planting practices. These
environmental effects were far less serious than in Santa Catarina given the different agro-
ecology, including soil quality and climate conditions as well as the traditionally far lesser
degree of mechanization on small farms in Ceará and elsewhere in the Northeast.
Nevertheless, discussions during the PPAR mission indicated that initial technology
packages in tractor subprojects had adverse impacts on soil quality—although this was
resolved later in the project—and a stronger role of extensionists would have been
appropriate.

2.84 On attention to social development issues, and as in the Santa Catarina operation, the
Ceará project incorporated the building of social capital as an integral part of the results
chain leading to poverty reduction. The project aimed to strengthen social capital through
CAs and MCs, as the engines of community driven collective action. Gender dimensions
were largely excluded from the project, except to note that women would benefit from
subprojects that improved family health, generated timesavings, and allowed them to
participate in productive activities. Furthermore, the percentage of women in MCs and CAs,
and as project beneficiaries, were project performance indicators, although with no target.27

2.85 Institutional and policy dimensions received attention. The project was to spend $3.3
million in technical assistance and training activities to enable participants to discharge their
responsibilities, including by strengthening the STUs capacity for monitoring, supervision,
and supply tasks, and to help expand information technology use by MCs and CAs. Attention
                                              29


was to be provided to improve MC decision making capacities as well as to create their
capacity for investment planning and financial administration. The capacity building
component also envisaged providing advice to the state on reform issues, as the fiscal
situation of the state could affect project implementation and counterpart funding.

2.86 One area where the Bank could have done better on quality at entry was on the
method to target the poor. As designed, the method of choosing the poor communities was
not fully reliable. It was subject to biases that could deviate it from the aim of prioritizing the
poorest of the poor that the PAD envisaged. Perhaps investing in means-testing could have
avoided the biases that occurred in excluding some of the poorest of the poor. As designed,
targeting was not fully subject to a transparent process based on adequate data at the
community level.

2.87 Monitoring and evaluation of the project received good attention. The project’s third
component was to finance the establishment of a monitoring system, expanding the existing
management information system (MIS) from the prior project to contain technical, financial,
and socioeconomic subproject information as well as cost, physical, and other quantitative
indicators for impact monitoring. Evaluation was to include annual physical implementation
reviews, a mid-term review, a socioeconomic impact evaluation that would include a baseline
of socioeconomic indicators, and a follow-on final evaluation. However, a key shortcoming
was the project did not monitor poverty rates.

2.88 The project developed a matrix that identified risks to development objectives and
outputs. In hindsight, those risks were well-considered. For example, the project identified
the risk that subprojects do not target the rural poor. This risk materialized to some extent, in
that subprojects tended to concentrate in the less poor areas among the poor and that some
nonpoor may have been selected. The project also identified mitigation measures that
appeared appropriate, such as training MCs for better targeting with greater oversight of
targeting by the STU. Unfortunately, the targeting outcomes suggest that such mitigation
measures were either not implemented or were not strong enough to avoid the biases
discussed earlier in the selection of beneficiary communities

Supervision

2.89 Quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. Aide memoires from several
supervision missions indicate efforts to address implementation issues and focus on results.
Early missions, for example, afforded attention to the early delays in implementation and
articulated early concerns with ensuring that the project’s investments in access to clean
water reach the 46 municipalities with the highest child mortality indices (World Bank
2002d, 4). This example also provides positive evidence of Bank inputs, where the Bank
organized a seminar with the government to help prioritize those municipalities.

2.90 However, project files indicate a reduced frequency of supervision from November
2004 to August 2006, a period for which there are no aide memoires on record, other than
one on financial management in February 2006 (World Bank 2006d).28 This gap suggests
insufficient follow-up on some issues raised during 2002–2003. For example, early aide
memories focused on the operation of MCs as a key tool to process community demand for
                                            30


subprojects, and expressed concerns with political interference in the councils and with their
capacity building to move beyond simply accepting or rejecting subproject proposals. As key
project participants, MCs required more attention than that which aide memoires record after
2003, particularly after many councils weakened following the 2007 extinction of the SDLR,
the agency which coordinated the activities of MCs (World Bank 2007, 4).

2.91 According to IEG rating standards on combining the quality at entry and supervision
ratings, overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Government Performance

2.92 Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. There are two indicators of
government ownership and commitment to development objectives. First, the state
government prioritized rural poverty reduction, not surprisingly for a state with the second
highest level of rural poverty. Second, the government allocated a substantial amount of
resources to rural poverty reduction programs, including those under the two Bank projects
(i.e., both the predecessor project and the one presently under review). These resources
included not only the counterpart funds, but also the loans themselves, as the investments
thus funded did not yield a financial return to the government, altogether with the additional
resources that the government leveraged from other sources.

2.93 The enabling environment the government provided was good, albeit not stellar. The
government provided counterpart funding, although, particularly at the beginning of the
project, 29 the state’s fiscal constraints delayed allocation of those resources and,
consequently, project implementation. Similarly, although institutional arrangements for
project management were in place, the project shifted first (2003) from the Secretariat of
Rural Development to SDLR (now defunct), reflecting changes in project priorities with its
insertion in Sustainable Rural Development Policy (Government of Ceará 2009). This change
created some degree of confusion and discontinuities in implementation. It resulted in a
reduction of STU staffing, a period during which the Bank team worked to persuade the
SDLR to take ownership of the CDD approach, and a distancing of the project from
EMATERCE, the rural extension agency (World Bank 2009). Later, with additional
financing in 2006, it shifted back to the now named Secretariat of Agrarian Development. In
the initial period, staffing of the STU appeared inadequate to handle the project, but the state
government responded to Bank requests to increase staff at the STU. There is no indication,
in the PADs or in the ICRs for the project and its predecessor, that the project was preceded
by government consultations with stakeholders. Implementation readiness was compromised
at the beginning by inadequate counterpart funds and thin STU staffing.

Implementing Agencies

2.94 Implementing agency performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The STU and
EMATERCE were the main implementing agencies. The STU worked well, although at the
beginning of the project its performance was compromised by thin staffing. EMATERCE
provided a statewide network of 71 field offices that were expected to be key for project
                                            31


implementation and supervision. However, EMATERCE’s role was compromised when, in
2003, the STU was transferred from SDR to SDLR, which shifted the focus toward
infrastructure and away from productive subprojects. However, the shift back to the Agrarian
Secretariat led to renewed efforts toward productive subprojects, where EMATERCE would
play a larger role. Nevertheless, the government’s implementation report, the ICR, and
project aide memoires refer little, if at all, to EMATERCE’s actual role in the project. PPAR
mission discussions indicated that EMATERCE suffered from staffing constraints that
weakened its role.30 Another weak area, as discussed earlier, was the performance of MCs.
They did not become as strong as expected. The fact that no MCs that remained had
graduated to manage project funds is an indication of their limited progress.31

2.95 According to IEG rating standards on combining the government and implementing
agency and ratings, and rating this in line with the overall outcome rating, the overall
borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.96 Overall quality of M&E is rated substantial. Design was fairly complete, covering
development of the required monitoring systems as well as an outline of evaluation products.
Although the project started with a MIS that had been inherited from the predecessor
operation, it needed to be upgraded for better monitoring. Such upgrading was to cover
several areas. First, it was to include variables on beneficiary communities, control groups,
and subprojects that would serve as inputs for the impact M&E. Second, online connection of
the EMATERCE headquarters to its regional offices was expected to enable field entry of
data at the collection point. Third, the system was to allow for generating reports comparing
planned with actual performance that could be used in reports submitted to the Bank. Fourth,
it was to integrate a financial management system office. Fifth, the MIS was to be launched
on the internet for public access. With these capabilities, the STU and the Bank could better
monitor implementation performance.

2.97 The proposed set of evaluation products was standard: annual physical performance
reviews assessing subproject quality and sustainability; a mid-term review, including a
beneficiary consultation; a baseline evaluation to establish indicators of socioeconomic
impact; and a final impact evaluation using those indicators. A key weakness of M&E
implementation was that it did not monitor poverty levels and track incomes more
systematically. A panel approach would have been desirable to better assess project impacts.

2.98 To a large extent, the planned M&E program was implemented. The MIS changed
from MIS I (that served the predecessor project from 1995 to 2001) to MIS II, inaugurated in
2002 and that imported subproject data from MIS I. The new system included online
connection to the field, inclusion of variables to support impact evaluation, internet launching
of the MIS, community profile variables, and integrated financial management. There were
some areas where the system did not work well. The ICR notes the failure to establish
capacity to monitor the share of poor beneficiaries graduating to commercial credit. Other
significant difficulties included the MIS’s inadequacy to generate reports customized to
users’ needs, and its use of proprietary software increased costs to the state.
                                             32


2.99 The project produced the planned evaluation reports. Project files indicate that annual
reviews were being conducted. The mid-term review was conducted in October 2007, over a
year after approval of the AF project. FECAMP (2004) was the intended baseline evaluation,
and ACEG (2009) was the intended final impact evaluation.

2.100 M&E use was more than adequate. The STU used the MIS to register subproject data,
analyze subprojects, and update communities and beneficiaries. Project aide memoires reflect
a use of project data to inform decision making on project implementation. The FECAMP
(2004) study provided baseline information on beneficiaries, but no record exists of how the
study was used. The 2007 mid-term review was a comprehensive document that highlighted
two salient issues discussed in this evaluation: (i) the need to increase the participation of the
more vulnerable areas and municipalities; and (ii) the need to improve management of
environmental safeguards. Topics included fully incorporating environmental management
(EM) of completed community investments into the project’s EM plan, creating EM
synergies of different programs in a given area, and adding a learning component to the plan.
The ACEG (2009) impact evaluation provided evidence that incomes in project areas were
not significantly above other areas. This may have played a role in the change of emphasis
adopted by the next project—to focus on product chains that could lead to more significant
results on incomes. Nevertheless, this change of emphasis from the Bank, the PPAR mission
was told, emerged before, at around 2007.

3. Santa Catarina: Natural Resource Management and
Rural Poverty Reduction Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
3.1      The PAD articulated a dual overarching objective: “the project objective is to reduce
rural poverty in the state of Santa Catarina, while improving the management of natural
resources.” Four subobjectives aimed to improve the income and livelihoods of poor rural
families through (i) support for government efforts to integrate environmental and social
sustainability into development and poverty reduction strategies; (ii) enhanced local
governance and community participation in decision making; (iii) reversed land degradation
and better protection of the state’s natural resources; and (iv) improvements to income-
generating opportunities and living conditions for the rural poor” (World Bank 2002a, 2).
The project’s loan agreement articulated these objectives: (i) to integrate environmental and
social sustainability into the development and poverty reduction strategies of the borrower;
(ii) to enhance local governance and community participation in decision making; (iii) to
reverse land degradation and better ensure protection of the borrower’s natural resources; and
(iv) to improve the income-generating opportunities and living conditions for the rural poor
(World Bank 2002b). Accordingly, it omitted the overarching objective relating to poverty
reduction and environmental management. Following IEG’s standard practice, the PPAR
uses the loan agreement’s objectives.

Relevance of Objectives

3.2     Relevance of objectives is rated substantial. The project objectives addressed Santa
Catarina’s rural poverty levels and its environmental concerns of land degradation, water
pollution, and threats to forest resources. Santa Catarina’s rural poverty headcount rates are
among the lowest in Brazil. Extreme poverty in 2001 was just 8.1 percent, well below
Brazil’s rate of 25.4 percent and Ceará’s 40.6 percent (IPEA 2012a,b).32 However, the
number of rural poor still amounted to about 160,000 people in 2000.33 Although land
degradation had been reportedly reduced through efforts implemented with Bank support in
the 1990s, this problem continued in areas occupied by poorer and marginal farmers, causing
declines in their land productivity and earnings (Freitas 2000; Bertol et al. 2007). Water
pollution increased during the 1990s, triggered by a rapid expansion of pig, poultry, and
aquaculture production that exacerbated waste disposal problems. Threats to forest resources
included removal of shrubs and forests for settlement, pressures from the growing number of
people and cattle, expansion of tourism, and poaching of selected species. Park and reserve
areas covered only 1 percent of the state’s territory. Nevertheless, the natural resource
management dimensions of the objectives were in part less precisely defined than for the
objectives relating to incomes, living conditions, and land degradation. While improvements
in water and soil quality were fairly precise, other natural resource management goals were
largely limited to enacting legislation and elaborating natural resource management plans. As
in the Ceará RPRP, the objective to enhance local governance and community participation
in decision making sought to help poor rural communities define, obtain, and implement
development assistance to improve their incomes and living standards.

3.3      As with the Ceará project, Bank Group strategies supported the project’s objectives.
In 2000, a year before the Bank approved the project, the Bank Group issued its CAS for
2000–2002. It identified poverty reduction as its overarching objective, with fiscal
adjustment, growth of per capita incomes, effective public institutions, and environmental
management as elements that would contribute toward achieving this overarching goal
(World Bank 2000). The next two Bank Group Strategy documents, covering 2003–2007 and
2008–2011, respectively, reshuffled these elements by placing equity, environmental
sustainability, and competitiveness objectives at the same level, with effective public
institutions and sound macromanagement as their cross-cutting foundations. Thus at the time
of project closing (2009), the Bank’s country partnership strategy for 2008–2011 , under its
Equitable Brazil pillar, called for supporting the country’s goal to reduce extreme poverty,
vulnerability, and social exclusion (World Bank 2008). Furthermore, its Sustainable Brazil
pillar called for supporting the goal of natural resource-based growth through sustainable use
of resources, addressing in particular the inadequate protection of water resources and
increased deforestation, which were key issues in Santa Catarina. Nevertheless, toward the
end of the project, a change in Bank strategy reduced the relevance of part of the project
objectives. The successor project to the Santa Catarina NRMRPRP—the 2010 Rural
Competitiveness Project—signaled a change of emphasis in the Bank’s strategy away from
the CDD poverty reduction approach to one focused on competitiveness. In this project, the
building of social capital and local governance, and the reversal of land degradation at the
microcatchment level, were not included among the objectives.34 Instead, the Bank focused
on improving the competitiveness of family agriculture.
                                            34


3.4     Objectives were also relevant to state government strategies. The state’s planning
document in force at the project’s closing date did not contain a reference to poverty
reduction (Government of Santa Catarina Undated). Nevertheless, its section on agriculture,
in addition to emphasizing sustainability (preservation and biodiversity) and referring to the
land degradation effects of agricultural production, aimed at raising land productivity and
promoting nonfarm activities as a means of raising rural incomes. Furthermore, the state’s
completion report for the NRMRPR acknowledged the state’s focus on rural poverty
reduction, following the lessons from the Bank-supported Land Management II project (State
of Santa Catarina 2009, 5). Finally, the state participated actively in federal rural poverty
reduction and small farmer support programs, including the National Family Agriculture
Strengthening Program, and financing of land purchases by the poor.

3.5     Even for a comparatively rich state such as Santa Catarina, the 2000 CAS’s
expectation of further gains in rural poverty reduction was relevant. As indicated in the
discussion of relevance of objectives for the Ceará project above, the CAS envisaged higher
growth, minimum wages, and social transfers as the main measurable developments that
would further reduce poverty after 2000, with a host of other policies having less tractable
effects. By improving income generating opportunities (e.g., through improved production
systems, greater value added schemes, and job creation), the project could plausibly
contribute to and benefit from a higher growth environment. Expected increases in
productivity for staple crops from the project—ranging from 20 percent to 30 percent (World
Bank 2002a)35—could be a part of higher growth expectations. These expectations rested on
the experience of the preceding project, thereby suggesting the project under review was not
overambitious with regard to its objective of improving incomes and living conditions of the
rural poor, with rural poverty rates the order of 14 percent of the rural population in 2001.

3.6     With regard to improvements in the management of natural resources—including
integration into poverty reduction and development strategies and the reversal of land
degradation trends—the state’s prior achievements and its identification of other key
environmental issues suggested a feasible path, albeit not well defined, toward further
improvements in environmental management and results. Those achievements included
increased monitoring and research capacity on environmental issues, regulatory steps with
respect to environmental licensing (for pig production and aquaculture activities), and
increased environmental policing. Identified challenges included the need to better integrate
land use with water management and to improve overall natural resource conservation,
including protection of the state’s widely scattered parks and reserves.

3.7     In sum, the project objective addressed well-diagnosed conditions—a significant
population of rural poor and natural resource management challenges—that government and
Bank Group programs intended to address, and with a plausible contribution of the project to
rural productivity and incomes and to environmental outcomes.

Relevance of Project Design

3.8     Relevance of design is rated substantial. Table 3.1 summarizes the NRMRPR project
results chains from financing to the project objectives. To improve rural incomes and poverty
living conditions, the project primarily envisaged a Rural Investment Fund (RIF) to provide
                                             35


grants for investments in income-generating subprojects, conservation and environmental
protection, and housing. The first could increase incomes through creation or improvements
of small rural businesses (both farm and nonfarm) and community arrangements to stabilize
supply and improve sales quantity or quality. Improved conservation and environmental
protection practices could also increase incomes by raising farm yields as a result of better
soil quality. Better housing conditions (e.g., access to water and sanitation) could also help
raise production through improved health.

3.9      Under the project’s CDD approach, MAs could be well positioned to identify and
implement the 100,000 or so subprojects that would help address their needs. The territorial
approach focusing on microcatchments36 was a means of integrating environmental and
social sustainability into development and poverty reduction strategies (World Bank 2002a).
By focusing on these units, subprojects could simultaneously address a microcatchment’s
specific adverse poverty and environmental conditions as delineated in the development plan
that the microcatchment was required to prepare. Decision-making bodies “”at municipal,
regional, and state levels37 with at least 50 percent representation by beneficiaries could align
’beneficiary incentives with the project’s objectives. These arrangements were aimed at
enhancing local governance and community participation in decision making. However, it
might be more challenging for some of the poorer microcatchments to organize themselves
into associations and to secure enough representation in the deliberative bodies. Also, the
multilevel deliberation might prove too cumbersome to implement.

3.10 Support for more environmentally friendly practices at the microcatchment and farm
levels would also be part of natural resource management, aimed at reversing land
degradation, as indicated by positive effects on water and soil quality. At the statewide level,
frameworks for protected areas, ecological corridors, and river basins, as well as additional
resources for environmental actions at the municipal level (covered by a state tax), could,
together with environmental incentives at the microcatchment and farm levels, comprise an
improvement in integrating environmental and social sustainability into development and
poverty reduction strategies. These statewide actions, however, were less sharply defined
than those at the microcatchment and farm levels, where the project targeted specific
problems such as poor waste disposal in pig, poultry, and aquaculture production. As
concerns management of parks and reserves, the PAD focused mainly on the legal
framework, with little attention to the actual managerial challenges that an environmental
protection agency faces. Similarly, with respect to river basin management, project design
could have looked more closely at how basins are actually managed and how basin
management plans would direct decision making regarding water management and its
integration with conservation. These design limitations left interventions regarding
environmental legislation and water management plans with undefined goals. In contrast,
raising incomes and living conditions and reversing land degradation were well-defined goals
of interventions at microcatchment and farm levels.

Implementation and Outputs
3.11 The project was led by the Rural Development and Agriculture Secretariat (today’s
Agriculture and Fishing Secretariat, SAP), with support from the Urban Development and
Environment Secretariat (today’s Sustainable Development Secretariat, SDS), the state’s
environmental agency (FATMA), the state’s agricultural research and extension services
agency (EPAGRI), and the state’s Agricultural Economics and Planning Agency (today’s
Agricultural Socioeconomics and Planning Center). EPAGRI implemented most of the
institutional development component (training, environmental education, and rural
extension)38 and oversaw the selection of beneficiary microcatchments. In the environmental
management component, SDS implemented the river basin plans and FATMA implemented
the ecological corridors and protected areas component. SAP was in charge of the project
management unit (PMU), where a manager coordinated the RIF, which was established as a
special program under the state’s Rural Development Fund.39

3.12 Implementation proceeded through a five-tiered structure: state (1); operating regions
(14 originally; 20 in 2003 and after);40 municipalities (294); microcatchments (936); and
farm families (105,000). The first three levels operated through deliberative bodies and
executive units. The deliberative committees, where project target groups were to have at
                                             37


least a 50 percent representation, set project implementation policy and priorities, approved
annual operational plans and fund allocations, resolved conflicts between stakeholders,
approved subprojects and grants, monitored and evaluated progress, and approved
implementation reports. The executive units consisted of the PMU at the state level and
subunits attached to the PMU at the regional and municipal levels and staffed by EPAGRI
personnel. These discharged project management tasks. Despite the participatory decision
making, the multilevel structure proved challenging. Marcondes (2011, 133) reports that
deliberative committees “practically did not exist or operate” at the state and regional levels.

3.13 Table 3.2 summarizes the project components and costs aimed at the objectives. The
project planned that the bulk of the resources would be used to finance rural investments and
spent more than expected on this component. This increase was due to higher expenditures
on technical assistance to MAs, from $19.1 million to $36.2 million, and on home
improvements, from $7.5 million to $12.1 million. These increases were partly offset by
lower expenditures on economic and environmental subprojects. Currency appreciation from
mid-2005 to late 2008 reduced access to the RIF, with 12,000 families among the targeted
priority cohort of 80,000 unable to make any investments and 68,000 priority families unable
to access the full range of investments contemplated in their plans (World Bank 2011a). The
total for institutional development and organization declined due mainly to lower than
expected expenditures on training of extensionists (who were to support MA beneficiaries on
social, environmental, and technical matters) and on adaptive and social research (covering a
host of project related issues). The total for environmental management also declined due to
similar declines in its two components (aimed at supporting watershed committees and the
establishment of a coherent system of protected areas). Increased project management and
M&E costs were due to higher management costs, partly offset by lower M&E costs.

3.14 The project expected a smooth implementation path, with disbursements linearly
increasing from end-2002 through mid-2008. Actual annual project expenses remained
minimal through 2004 and became significant ($20 million to $26 million) from 2005 to
2006. Bank disbursements remained minimal through end-2005 and then increased more or
less linearly through mid-2009. Several factors accounted for delays in implementation. First,
2002 was an election year that delayed activities to promote the project. Second, availability
                                              39


of data from the 2003 Santa Catarina Agricultural Survey was delayed; these data were
needed to prioritize microcatchments for project attention. Their absence required the
alternative approach of obtaining data from each municipality to prioritize microcatchments,
a procedure used throughout the life of the project. Third, it took some time to establish the
legal conditions for transferring funds under the RIF. This required farmers to associate
under an entity with legal status (Cadastro Nacional de Pessoa Juridica). The formation of
these institutions took a considerable amount of time. Fourth, training of extensionists added
more time before the RIF could become active. Finally, the change in the state’s leadership
team in 2003 also led to a change in the project’s leadership, following the change of
administration, further delaying implementation.

Institutional Development Outputs

3.15 Under its first component, the project financed capacity building, environmental
education, rural extension, adaptive and social research, and studies on state structural
adjustment. Capacity building covered all actors involved in the project, including technical
staff, indigenous people,41 rural employees, deliberative bodies, and environmental education
participants. It reached 153,040 stakeholders at closing (including 96,000 farmers),
exceeding project targets. Environmental education focused on environmental degradation
and the human behaviors that relate to it. It was delivered in partnership with NGOs,
universities, MAs, education secretariats, and teacher associations. It exceeded targets by
reaching 122,000 students or beneficiaries. The rural extension subcomponent financed
technical staff available to MAs and indigenous people (through grants) to prepare their
microcatchment proposals. It achieved most of its targets, although staff shortages occurred
as additional MAs were created. Quality of the technical staff was uneven and
microcatchments were unwilling to pay for their services when the project ended, despite the
dependence of the latter on the former to convey demands and resolve problems. The
adaptive and social research subcomponent, implemented primarily by EPAGRI, completed
the 2003 agro-livestock census, mapped microcatchments, and conducted other research,
with 108 research projects under execution by project end. Studies on structural adjustment
covered a water resource management study that led to the creation of Santa Catarina’s water
information system and the grants of water usage rights, a water and sanitation study that
contributed to sector restructuring, a study for restructuring the state’s electricity centers, and
studies of microcredit and poverty reduction programs.

Rural Investment Fund

3.16 Through the RIF, the project allocated 122,475 group and individual grants, of which
56,339 were for improved housing, 34,293 for income improvements, and 31,843 for
conservation and environmental protection. These reached a population of 197,653 people, of
which 81,218 benefited from home improvement grants, 42,992 benefited from income
improvement grants, and 73,442 benefited from conservation grants. Most proposals (67
percent) were individual, followed by group (27 percent) and community (6 percent)
proposals. The project reached 86,532 families (Prapem/Microbacias 2009), of which 36,343
benefited from improved housing (above the target of 15,000), 30,286 from income
improvement (well below the target of 40,000), and 19,902 from conservation grants (well
below the target of 50,000). These numbers were below those expected in the PAD’s total of
                                             40


105,000 families (World Bank 2002a). Differences with targets reflect the changes in project
costs, where the project costs of the house improvements line increased and those of the
income improvement and conservation lines declined. This reflected a higher than expected
demand for house improvements, lower than expected demand for conservation grants, and
difficulties in implementing the technical demands of the income improvement line. The
types of activities that were supported were mostly small scale and individual, not group, and
with little market insertion or sophistication, deviating from the types of activities and
arrangements contemplated by the PAD.

Environmental Management

3.17 Outputs from this component included: (i) preparation of three river basin plans
(Chapecó, Timbó and Jacutinga) with the goal of initiating their implementation; (ii)
development of planning models for ecological corridors, validation of these models for two
ecological corridors (Chapecó and Timbó), and development of socioeconomic development
strategies for these corridors with the goal of actually creating the corridors and initiating
their implementation; (iii) approval of the Law for the Conservation Units System with the
goal of regulating and implementing it; (iv) submission of an ecological tax law with the goal
to achieve its approval; and (v) improvement of the Serra de Tabuleiro State Park’s visitor
infrastructure with the goal of “consolidating” the state park, although the PAD did not
specifically indicate what this meant in practice.

Achievement of Objectives
Objective 1: Integrate environmental and social sustainability into development and
poverty reduction strategies.

3.18 Efficacy is rated substantial. The project sought to integrate sustainability into
development and poverty reduction strategies through (i) natural resource management
practices at the micro catchment and farm levels to invest in green productive practices; (ii) a
State System of Protected Areas (SEUC) to consolidate protected areas, develop ecological
corridors, and underpin participatory management of protected areas; (iii) watershed
management; (iv) legislation to allocate resources from the state’s tax on goods and services
to municipalities that set up protected areas; (iv) environmental education; (v) social and
adaptive research; and (iv) structural adjustment studies on water and energy management
and on poverty reduction programs.

3.19 The project achieved progress in most areas. First, microcatchments were mapped,
936 MAs were established (appraisal target: 880), micro catchment plans were prepared for
the 936 associations (880), and farm plans were prepared for 47,869 individual farms
(70,000). These plans were the basis for RIF subprojects addressing poverty and
environmental conditions in the microcatchments. Second, the state enacted the law
underpinning SEUC in 2009. The state’s environmental agency (FATMA) manages 10
conservation units (seven parks where public access is permitted and three reserves where
access is allowed only to researchers). The state completed plans for an ecological corridor in
two major river basins (Rio Chapecó and Rio Timbó), covering 10,000 square kilometers
(about 10.7 percent of the state’s area). In the corridors, the natural forest and landscape
                                            41


constitute the strategic planning unit, and the microcatchments serve as operational planning
units.

3.20 Third, six watershed management plans have been completed thus far.42 They are
used by watershed management committees—comprised by government, water users, and
watershed population representatives—to manage water resources at the watershed level.
Field interviews indicated that the plans are focused mainly on water resource management,
although the state is now considering broadening them to include other dimensions (e.g.,
infrastructure). A case study suggests that the watershed management committee is the
driving force for policy, which is marked by the views of its technically oriented members.43
The management plan appears to be the result of a consensus building exercise with other
stakeholders. There is no evidence on how the plans have translated into more watershed
management effectiveness, where river basin committees are the key driving force behind
water policy. Nevertheless, a project-financed study (Instruments for Water Resources
Management) led to a state census of water users by catchment. Based on this, systems for
grants of water usage rights were developed and implementation has started. Furthermore,
water resources information systems were developed and implemented.

3.21 Fourth, the environmental tax law has not been enacted yet. Santa Catarina is one of
the nine states in Brazil that has not enacted an environmental tax law, which would earmark
resources from the state tax to environmental protection at the municipal level.

3.22 Fifth, adaptive and social research implemented under the project completed the 2003
agro-livestock census, mapped the microcatchments, and included other research activities.
Unfortunately, the census information came in too late to be used as intended to target
eligible microcatchments. As the ICR points out, this prevented the inclusion of new
municipalities, initiation of planning in many microcatchments, and delineation of
beneficiaries in municipalities already defined. Although the Bank agreed to use a
provisional targeting strategy while EPAGRI staff helped conclude the census, data issues
impeded use of the latter for targeting, and the provisional strategy continued through the end
of the project.

3.23 Finally, the project conducted structural adjustment studies that led to the creation of
Santa Catarina’s water information system and the grants of water usage rights and
contributed to restructuring the water sector.

Objective 2: Enhance local governance and community participation in decision making.

3.24 Efficacy of this objective is rated modest. The project’s management structure was
decentralized by putting in place executive bodies at the state, regional, municipal and micro
catchment level. In parallel, the project established state, regional (14 bodies), municipal
(293 bodies) and micro-catchment (936) deliberative bodies.

3.25 The project used three indicators to measure this objective. The first was that project
participatory mechanisms are operating all levels (state, regional, municipal, micro-
catchment and community). This indicator was reported to be 100% achieved. Participatory
mechanisms were established as planned, and were operational at all levels at end-project,
                                               42


although sustainability (of MAs and GAMs) post-project were projected to be weak. The
second indicator was that social capital would be increased in assisted micro-catchment.
Social capital was measured in only 19 micro-catchments, and these showed mixed results.
For example, across the 19 micro catchments, family empowerment was reported to be good
in 18 of the 19 and social network development was good or very good in 14 out of the 19
catchments. However, pro-activity was weak (74%) at the municipal level and the
sustainability of the MAs was in question with only 3 out of 19 surveyed showing strong
results. The third indicator was that at least 10 percent of micro catchment development
associations could practice self-management. This target was not achieved, nor was it
measured. According to project documentation, most micro catchment development
associations are dependent on the project financed technicians and facilitators to convey their
interests to relevant authorities. The project concluded that) MA organizational levels and
sustainability are variable and fragile and that self-management (i.e. autonomous) is a complex,
longer-term process and that the project lacked instruments/mechanisms to achieve it.
(EPAGRI/CEPA 2008).


Objective 3: Reverse land degradation and better protection of the state’s natural
resources.

3.26 Efficacy of this subobjective is rated modest. The project sought to achieve this
objective through investing in green productive practices. Key expected outcomes under this
subobjective were improved water quality and reduced soil loss that would result from better
farm practices in assisted microcatchments. Supported practices sought to increase ground
cover and biodiversity, water infiltration of the ground, pollution control, and surface runoff
control.

3.27 The project achieved or closely achieved project targets on (i) natural resource
management practices, which covered 29,013 families (target: 32,855), 263,000 (250,000)
hectares, and 936 (616) microcatchments; (ii) soil conservation, which covered 228,815
(250,815) hectares; (iii) adequate pig waste disposal, which covered 3,660 (3,831) families;
and (iv) replanting of riparian gallery forest, which covered 2,306 (901) hectares (Bassi
2009). Project beneficiaries used environmentally friendly production systems (such as
conservation tillage, use of organic fertilizers, green cover and mulching, use of dunghills in
pig farms, and human waste disposal in septic tanks) somewhat more than non-project
beneficiaries.

3.28 The data suggest the project’s contribution to water quality and soil protection was
mixed. The project monitored water and soil quality in seven assisted microcatchments. On
drainage water, thermo-tolerant coliform concentration declined in some microcatchments
but none achieved a reference standard.44 On soil quality, progress was mixed, with improved
organic content in 30.4 percent of points monitored and a decline in 47 percent of those
points; mixed progress on chemical parameters (alkalinity, potassium, molybdenum, calcium,
and base saturation) and positive progress on most physical parameters (soil density, water
conductivity, and aggregate stability), but not on macro porosity. Perceptions of erosion were
somewhat stronger among non-beneficiaries than beneficiaries. Perceptions of fertility
improvements were somewhat stronger among beneficiaries than among non-beneficiaries.
                                            43


3.29 Improved water quality, based on stakeholder perception and quality measurement
was an indicator used to measure this objective. Data on quality is only available for 7
microcatchments. The seven microcatchments improved alkalinity levels, and nitrate and iron
remained within potability limits, coliform concentration declined, but not sufficiently to
achieve potable levels (although the latter was not an explicit goal of the project).

Objective 4: Improve income-generating opportunities and living conditions for the rural
poor.

3.30 Efficacy of this objective is rated substantial. The project appears to have reached the
poor despite some biases—though much less strong than in the Ceará project—in favor of the
less poor within the poor. Estimates are that the project helped increase incomes and reduce
poverty, although those estimates were restricted to beneficiaries of only one of the RIF
subcomponents. Indications are that the project improved living conditions, mainly on
housing.

3.31 Targeting the Rural Poor. The PAD defined a targeting process to prioritize the
poorest of the poor (World Bank 2002, 51). The project identified beneficiaries by selecting
municipalities and microcatchments using a system that weighed poverty (60 percent) and
environmental conditions (40 percent). The poverty weight (60 percent) was given by a
socioeconomic factor combining the percentage of the population in the “marginal” (less than
one minimum wage per capita) and transition 1 (less than two minimum wages per capita)
income groups, the percentage of indigenous people and rural youth in the population, and
access to public services for health, education, and sanitation. Within this combination, the
concentration of marginal farmers would receive twice the priority weight of transition 1
farmers, and indigenous people four times the weight. The environmental weight (40 percent)
covered water quality, density of the pig population, intensity of use of agrochemicals,
remaining forest cover, and the proportion of cropped land still under conventional tillage.
Within this combination, the pig population density index would receive the highest weight,
followed by agrochemical use, then by forest cover and conventional tillage together. All
residents within a selected microcatchment were eligible as project beneficiaries.

3.32 Accordingly, the project selected microcatchments through a two-step process. First,
the criteria above were used to grade municipalities from “neediest” to “least needy.” Based
on their grade, municipalities would be classified into three groups, each with about a third of
the total number of 293 municipalities. In the one-third of municipalities considered to be the
neediest (98), two-thirds of microcatchments would be eligible for assistance. In the middle
third of municipalities (97), half the microcatchments would qualify. In the least needy third
of municipalities (88), only one-third of the microcatchments would qualify. Second, the
same criteria would be applied to grade microcatchments in each municipality and allocate
the assistance accordingly. This process resulted in choosing 936 of the state’s 1,910
microcatchments in the 293 municipalities, with 53.4 percent of beneficiaries belonging to
the first, neediest group of municipalities, 31.2 percent to the middle group, and 15.3 percent
to the third, least needy group (World Bank 2010; Prapem/Microbacias II 2009).45

Notes: Peripheral farmers have per capita net farm income of less than one minimum wage; transition 1 farmers have per
capita net farm income from one to two minimum wages; transition 2 farmers have per capita net farm income from two to
three minimum wages; consolidated farmers have per capita net farm income of more than three minimum wages; employer
farmers are larger, mechanized, market-oriented farms with employees accounting for more than half of farm labor.

3.33 Inevitably, with its spatial and environmental focus, the criteria included some non-
poor population as beneficiaries. Table 3.3 shows the shares of categories of beneficiaries
that resulted from the targeting criteria. The clearly non-poor categories (employers,
consolidated farmers) accounted for 9.3 percent of beneficiaries, largely because of
environmental investments, and to lesser extents from home improvement and income
investments. The clearly poor (peripheral and transition 1 farmers) accounted for 75.2
percent of beneficiaries. With indigenous people and employed rural workers, also part of the
project’s primary priority targets, the percentage rises to 78.5. And with transition 2 farmers
(those families earning between two and three minimum wages), a secondary project priority,
the percentage rises to 88.7. The remaining 2 percent (rural youth and nonfarm workers) may
include some non-poor, as it comprises groups defined by non-income criteria, although
these groups are likely to include a significant number of poor. The income subcomponent
was the one focused most on the poor, with 88.6 percent of beneficiaries falling into this
category. The natural resource subcomponent was the least focused on the poor, with 64.7
percent of beneficiaries being poor (i.e., belonging to the peripheral, transition 1, indigenous
people, and employed rural worker categories). And the home improvement subcomponent
was in the middle with 77.4 percent of beneficiaries being poor.

3.34 As with the Ceará project, it could well happen that the richer families benefitted
from higher grants, as suggested by project suggest although only to a minor extent. In the
poorest group of municipalities, the average total assistance value per beneficiary was about
R$198. In the next poorest group, the average value was R$206, and in the least poor group,
                                             45


it was R$213 (Prapem/Microbacias II 2009, 12). The differences were wider for the income
generation subcomponent, where the poorest beneficiaries received an average of R$474 and
the least poor received R$624. It would not be surprising to find some elite capture within
each group, resulting in a bias in the assistance toward the least poor within the group. But
the data to measure this are not available. Given these considerations and the shares of poor
beneficiaries discussed above, it seems fair to say that the combined criteria had a modest
bias against targeting primarily the poorest in the target population.

3.35 Poverty Reduction. The project’s original rural poverty reduction target was to
“reduce the incidence of rural poverty in 70 percent of the 880 microcatchments assisted”
(World Bank 2002, 2). The mid-term review changed this target to “20 percent reduction in
beneficiaries below the poverty line” (World Bank 2006c, annex 2b).46 Because the baseline
for this target was unavailable, the 2009 evaluation reformulated the target to say,
“Transposition of at least 20 percent of beneficiaries in the Peripheral and Transition
Categories to higher categories.” The evaluation assessed this target only for beneficiaries of
the “income generation” subcomponent of the rural investment component and concluded
that about 19.3 percent of those beneficiaries had moved from the lowest categories
(peripheral and transition 1) to higher categories between 2004 and 2008
(Prapem/Microbacias II 2009). This outcome is low compared to that of Santa Catarina’s
rural sector as a whole, for which the extreme poor declined by more than one half, from 4.08
percent of the rural population in 2004 to 1.70 percent in 2008 (IPEA 2012b). This average
decline was triggered mainly by general country conditions. Nevertheless, project
beneficiaries appear to have reduced their poverty more than non-project beneficiaries have;
their incomes increased more than those of a control group.

3.36 The project’s target with regard to incomes was “improved family incomes and
employment among the target group” (World Bank 2002, 3). The mid-term review changed
this target to be more specific: (i) “family income of priority public47 increases by 10 percent;
and (ii) “average farm productivity increases by 20 percent through application of the
productive practices supported by the project” (World Bank 2006c, annex 2b). The
employment dimension was accordingly dropped. It was not monitored the evaluations.

3.37 Available assessments suggest project beneficiaries improved their incomes. A survey
of 445 beneficiary families indicated that 85.9 percent of the families improved their incomes
between 2005–2006 and 2007. Income increases ranged widely. For dairy cattle, for
example, average gross income increased by 81.8 percent, with no increase for 9 percent of
beneficiaries and more than a 150 percent increase for 25 percent of beneficiaries. For crop
production, income increases ranged from the 24.4 percent of beneficiaries that did not
increase their incomes to 16.1 percent of beneficiaries that increased their incomes by more
than 50 percent (Reiter et al. 2008). These increases suggest impacts on income for
subprojects implemented in the first two years (2005–2006) that the RIF extended a
significant amount of grants, as indicated by comparing 2005–2006 with 2007 incomes.

3.38 Furthermore, the 2009 impact evaluation prepared under the project estimated that
farmers supported by the income-generation subcomponent of the project’s investments
component increased their incomes by 30.6 percent between 2003 and 2008. Those in a
control group increased theirs by 16.5 percent (Prapem/Microbacias II 2009, 35). The 30.5
                                             46


percent increase is not fully consistent with the IRR estimate. Assuming the average
beneficiary family earned one minimum wage before the project, the 30.5 percent increase
implies that the 32,000 RIF beneficiary families experienced an increase in yearly income of
about $20 million, well above the economic return in one year of about $9 million, as
estimated from the income subproject IRR of 45.1 percent.48 There was no evaluation of
income outcomes for beneficiaries of home improvement or environmental investments
supported by the RIF.

3.39 The income assessments above were incomplete, as they only considered
beneficiaries of one subcomponent. The project envisaged that environmental investments
would also improve incomes by enhancing land productivity. In fact, an analysis of
productivity impacts is critical to capture both a source of the increased incomes from
“income-generating investments” as well as possible increased incomes to other
beneficiaries, stemming from better land management practices.

3.40 Under the project, some crop yields increased modestly, for example, 6.3 percent for
beans and 11 percent for corn on average, below the range of 20–35 percent expected based
on the experience of the predecessor project. The reported increases compared two points in
time (2003 and 2008). In a control group, only corn silage had an increase in productivity
(Prapem/Microbacias 2009, 39). Compared to statewide yields, yields in project areas were,
not surprisingly, below average and in some cases at the lowest levels in the state, consistent
with the project focus on the rural poor. Panel A in figure 3.1 depicts Santa Catarina’s long-
term productivity data for key crops, indicating a strong positive trend, unlike the stationary
yields observed in Ceará. Panels B, C, and D compare the reported productivities under the
project with the statewide paths of minimum, average, and maximum statewide
productivities for the specific crops. These comparisons place the project productivity
achievements in the context of statewide trends, illustrating different project yield outcomes:
below average performance for beans, levels at minimum regional averages for corn, and
some improvement over minimum levels for tobacco. Productivity increases for these crops
averaged 12.7 percent for 2003–2009. On eight other crops or dairy production, productivity
increases were higher, averaging 24.7 percent (World Bank 2010a). It is thus unclear that the
project achieved the mid-term target of an average productivity increase of 12.7 percent.

3.41 The 2008 evaluation reported on subprojects directed at rural nonfarm rural activities
(Reiter et al. 2008). In a sample of 44 nonfarm projects, 42.5 percent of beneficiaries or their
spouses worked full time on farm activities, and 33.8 percent worked part time. In the same
sample, 45 percent had farm income as the only source, with the others relying on income
outside the farm (26.8), income inside the farm (15.9 percent), and pensions (11 percent).
Considering all family members, 51.9 percent had farm work as the sole source of income,
24.4 percent had other sources of income outside the farm, 14.5 percent had nonfarm sources
inside the farm, and 9.1 percent received pensions. For 44.2 percent of beneficiaries, the
nonfarm subproject did not increase income. For most of the rest, income increases ranged
from 0 to 75 percent. Of the 44 projects, 41 percent indicated that the production was for
their own use and 34 percent indicated that they marketed the production or services (e.g.,
fixing motorcycles). Only 45 percent used accounting or cash flow to control costs, with
others only having a vague idea of costs. Most activities are not formally registered.
Activities include sewing, weaving, embroidery, handicrafts, prepared foods, and servicing
                                                                      47


motorcycles. As factors motivating these activities, beneficiaries cited opportunities for
women to work, personal improvement, savings on clothing, and profitability.

3.42 The 2009 evaluation reported that 15 percent of income in those families that
received income generating RIF grants came from nonfarm activities (Prapem/Microbacias II
2009, 52). Most of it came from occupations in trade and services, followed by occupations
in industry. A negligible amount came from nonfarm activities within the farm. An example
of this is the indigenous community visited by the mission where farm activity was limited to
self-consumption and handicrafts made with farm inputs and sold for cash income in the
nearby capital city, Florianópolis. More broadly, the 2006 agricultural census indicated that
25.2 percent of income came from off-farm activities, of which two-thirds were nonfarm
activities (EPAGRI 2015, 20–21). It further showed that nonfarm income is comprised of
pensions (47.6 percent), wages (45.3 percent), other government programs (2.5 percent), and
other (4.6 percent). Nonfarm incomes helped reduce poverty in Brazil’s southern states—
                                            48


Parana, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul (Ferreira de Lima and Piacenti 2009).
Similarly, rural properties that had animal production or any nonfarm activity carried out by
at least one member of the household lowered the probability of being poor (Santos Filho
2008). Nevertheless, the project did not seem to contribute to poverty reduction.

3.43 Living Conditions. The other dimension of the objective—living conditions of the
rural poor—is captured primarily by investments in water and sanitation, home
improvements, and community centers (Prapem/Microbacias 2009; World Bank 2006c).
Sanitation facilities improved for 21,569 families, covering 24.1 percent of the state’s human
waste disposal needs. It also improved bathroom location facilities for 8,459 families,
thereby covering 24 percent of the state’s needs. The project also financed construction of
8,730 clean water sources and improved 2,852 water wells, protecting water sources for
31,265 families. In total, the houses of 47,250 families were improved, exceeding the 40
percent target (of the total number of participating farm families) established in the mid-term
review. A survey suggests most beneficiaries were satisfied with these investments,
indicating their contributions to better housing conditions, family health, comfort, privacy,
and social relations (Prapem/Microbacias 2009, 64). Interestingly, the survey also suggested
that the MAs, which the project supported as community self-management mechanisms,
were not being proactive as actors in promoting these improvements. Although the project
also financed construction or improvement of community centers in 177 microcatchments,
suggesting that the MAs were proactive in promoting community affairs, these investments
covered only 18.9 percent of assisted microcatchments, falling far short of the project’s target
of 80 percent.

Efficiency
3.44 Efficiency is rated substantial. The project appears to have surpassed efficiency
benchmarks. The ICR reported on internal rates of return, both economic and financial, only
for economic subprojects (18.7 percent of total costs) and as estimated independently by a
team from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). FAO’s IRR estimate was 41.5
percent and is based on project data for different productive activities supported by the RIF,
aggregated into a set of production models for typical properties in different regions of the
state. Financial rates of return to farmers are smaller, presumably because some of the
benefits from subproject activities accrue to other beneficiaries. For example, investments on
environmentally friendly practices to a farmer could reduce runoff water and erosion, leading
to improved soil conditions for the farmers and better water quality more generally. The IRR
estimate appears not to be consistent with the increased family incomes reported earlier.
Assuming the average beneficiary family earned the minimum wage before the project,49 the
32,000 beneficiary families benefited from an increase in yearly incomes of about $20
million (based on an estimated income increase of 30.6 percent), well above the project IRR
value in one year of about $9 million on the $20.3 million invested on economic subprojects.

Outcome
3.45 Outcome is rated satisfactory. The overall outcome rating reflects substantially
relevant objectives and design, and substantial achievements with regard to the most
significant objective as it relates to the overarching goal of poverty reduction, namely
                                             49


increasing the incomes of the rural poor. The economic rate of return was high and reflected
increases in agricultural value added that are commensurate with increases in rural incomes.
Overall, with a rating of substantial for the relevance of objectives and the relevance of
design, substantial for two out of the four project objectives (including the most relevant with
regard to the overarching poverty reduction aim), and substantial efficiency a satisfactory
outcome rating is assigned. In this case, IEG’s evaluative judgment was required to reach an
Outcome rating of Satisfactory. This rating does not aggregate by sections, rather it
prioritizes the important aspects of Efficacy that were rated Substantial to reach this result.

Risk to Development Outcome
3.46 Risk to development outcome is rated moderate. Project development outcomes face
several risks. The main one at present is the risk that declining economic growth will increase
poverty. Brazil’s GDP stagnated and turned negative in 2014. Declining growth may lower
poverty gains as it erodes income gains and reduces the government’s capacity to provide
social transfers. Santa Catarina’s extreme rural poverty rate declined during the life of the
project from 8.1 percent in 2001 to 1.5 percent in 2007 and then rose slightly to 2.1 in 2009.
More recent data on rural poverty rates are not available. Available data indicate that the
share of Santa Catarina’s overall (rural and urban) population earning less than one-half
minimum wage declined from 2.9 percent in 2009 to 2.3 in 2013, the latest year for which
data are available.

3.47 Another risk is that government policy—following the competitiveness approach that
the Bank supported—could de-emphasize the direct focus on poverty reduction. This is
suggested by the development objective of the successor project, which focuses on
competitiveness and does not include the poverty targeting criteria introduced under the
project under review.50 The focus on competitiveness could help encourage the state’s
economic growth, with a favorable effect on poverty, but explicit efforts are need to make the
project inclusive. If attention is deflected from the poorest farmers, state policy could fail to
address the pervasive productivity gaps of those farmers, which lie at the root of their income
poverty. The data in figure 3.1 indicate that minimum productivity levels, which mainly
affect poor farmers, are dynamic in some crops (corn) and static in others (tobacco, beans). It
also shows that productivity of selected crops for areas under the project made progress but
remained near the state minimum averages.

3.48 Some development outcomes relating to living conditions and incomes are likely to
be sustained. These included better access to water and other improvements achieved under
the house improvement subcomponent as well as some of the income-generation subprojects.
Similarly, some farmers are likely to continue using the green practices they introduced
under the projects, as these may have contributed to higher productivity and incomes.

3.49 There is also the risk that the government de-emphasize environmental interventions
at the micro catchment and farm levels. The successor project suggests this. Its
environmental interventions only extend the focus of the prior project on water resources and
ecological corridor management, and on environmental education (including education at the
micro catchment level), not on land management interventions at the micro catchment and
farm levels. The latter are needed to improve the mixed results the project obtained on water
                                            50


and soil quality. Reduced interventions at the micro catchment and farm levels would
compromise the project’s aim to integrate environmental and social sustainability into
development and poverty reduction strategies, where those interventions are critical.
Furthermore, with the transition to the successor Bank project—the Santa Catarina Rural
Competitiveness Project—the focus on microcatchments declined. This reduced focus may
have weakened the sustainability of results on rural incomes and productivity, where
continued attention to land management practices is needed.

3.50 The project’s contribution to local governance and community participation in
decision making appears to have been more limited. This contribution materialized primarily
through the creation of MAs and their participation in decision-making committees under the
project. These dimensions do not appear to have been sustained as this approach has been
abandoned in the follow-on project. Discussions during the PPAR mission suggested that
many MCs have subsequently ceased to operate. Decision-making committees did not
operate well under the complex multilevel structure designed under the project.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

3.51 Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. Strengths are reflected in the
project’s comprehensive PAD, which followed a project preparation period of about two
years. Objectives were relevant to the state’s condition (pockets of rural poverty and
environmental challenges covering agriculture, protection of threatened areas, and
management of river basins) and to state and Bank country priorities that included both
poverty reduction and environmental protection. Design was strongest in the results chain
toward poverty reduction, where the project envisaged a menu of technical assistance and
investments to improve agricultural productivity and increase income-generating assets of the
poor, using a well-considered poverty targeting method. The results chain for enhanced
natural resource management benefited from designed actions to instill environmentally
friendly agricultural practices. However, it lacked a sufficiently defined track for better
management of forests and water resources, proposing only issuance of protected areas
legislation and of an environmental tax law, and design and implementation of river basin
plans, but without indications of what the plans were aimed to achieve or how
implementation was to be monitored. Furthermore, project design was burdened by an overly
complex, multilevel decision-making framework that taxed the capacity and resources
needed to implement it.

3.52 Interventions at the micro catchment and farm levels were based on sound knowledge
of the low farm productivity levels and limited income generating activities bearing on rural
poverty; livestock management practices with adverse environmental effects; land
management practices needed to protect soil from erosion in areas of heavy rainfall; needed
improvements in water infiltration and handling of rainfall runoff safely; and the potential
financial as well as environmental benefits of conservation practices. Interventions at broader
levels were underpinned by a knowledge of existing threats to biodiversity and the
environment and identification of the need to manage water resources in a comprehensive
                                             51


manner. Nevertheless, the more detailed knowledge on how to address these latter issues was
largely absent from the PAD.

3.53 Given the project objectives, the Bank’s attention to its environmental aspects was
strong, particularly those related to RIF subprojects. An environmental assessment confirmed
the expectation of positive environmental effects. The state developed an environmental
management plan that covered environmental screening, evaluation, approval, and
monitoring of RIF subprojects and improvements in the environmental assessment capacity
of staff linked to the project. The impacts of the environmental management component
received less attention, perhaps because of its limited aims of enacting legislation, drafting
river basin management plans, and initiating pilot ecological corridors and protected areas.

3.54 In addition to focusing on the poverty reduction dimension of social development, the
project incorporated the building of social capital as an integral part of the results chain. The
MAs were intended to strengthen and empower rural communities and enable them to play a
stronger role in the development process. Furthermore, under its indigenous people’s
strategy, and by including their presence in the targeting criteria, the project aimed to reach at
least 70 percent of the indigenous people in the state, including attention to them through
institutional development and RIF components. Gender dimensions were given limited
attention, except to note women might benefit from new job opportunities created by the
project. Nevertheless, the project financed a gender and generation study that sought to
understand gender and intergenerational relations within beneficiary families and derive
implications for the project (Aguiar 2008). There is no indication that this study translated
into actions under the project.

3.55 Institutional and policy dimensions received considerable attention. In project
preparation, the PMU engaged in an institutional development program that covered
financial, procurement, and disbursement management dimensions. The program hired
financial and procurement staff, provided training on Bank policies and procedures,
developed the financial management system, and prepared the final procurement plan for the
first two years of the project as well as a detailed global procurement plan. Furthermore, the
project envisaged training for the complex participatory institutional arrangements for
decision making at the municipal, regional, and state levels. The choice of institutions for
project implementations was well-considered and straightforward. The key set of policies
driving the project included the provision of grants to poor farmers to help improve their
incomes as well as the productivity and environmental impact of their farms, legislation for
protecting forests and developing ecological corridors, and preparation of river basin plans.

3.56 However, the Bank did not adequately consider the time needed to get the project up
and running. The factors that delayed implementation could have been better anticipated. As
a result, the initial two and a half years of the project were largely spent on preparation
activities that should have taken place before approval and effectiveness.

3.57 Monitoring and evaluation of the project received good attention. M&E was designed
to engage the full range of stakeholders; to cover economic, social, and environmental
indicators; and to include ex-ante, mid-term, and ex-post evaluations of its main dimensions.
                                             52


3.58 The project identified relevant risks, including that of failing to reach the target
population, failing to sustain political commitment after the 2002 elections, a low buy-in of
proposed practices, weak awareness of the impact of environmental problems on livelihoods,
failure to enact proposed environmental tax legislation, and inadequate capacity to implement
the environmental management component. Some of these risks materialized. Faltering
political momentum contributed to delay project implementation, and the environmental tax
law did not pass. An unarticulated risk was that the participatory mechanism involved four
levels of governance (state, regional, municipal, and micro catchment) that might be too
complex to function smoothly.

Supervision

3.59 Quality of Bank supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank supervised the project
closely and periodically, with 13 well-staffed supervision missions during 2002–2009. These
covered implementation issues as they emerged and invariably reflected a thorough and
detailed coverage of those issues. For example, the February 2003 mission, occurring six
months after effectiveness, focused on actions needed to accelerate implementation. Six
years later, as the project approached the closing date of September 2009, the mission
focused on steps to secure additional financing, which in the event came in the form of a new
project—the 2010 Santa Catarina Rural Competitiveness Project. Supervision ratings in the
Implementation Status Report during 2003–2004 were, however, higher than warranted:
“satisfactory” for implementation performance when no implementation was taking place
and “highly satisfactory” for development objectives when no results yet related to the
project objectives. The focus of supervision on development impact could have been
stronger.

3.60   Overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Government Performance

3.61 Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Project performance
benefited from the government’s strong commitment to its development objectives. This
commitment was in evidence throughout the predecessor project—the successful 1990 Land
Management II project—by the government’s efforts to prepare the project under discussion,
beginning four years before approval, by its piloting of the actions the new project would
support, by its efforts to address the new project’s implementation challenges following the
2002 political transition, and by its financial contribution to the project, as manifested in its
willingness to provide grant assistance to farmers with loan proceeds and its own counterpart
fund contributions. The government conducted extensive consultations, prior to project
approval, involving 2,000 beneficiaries and multiple stakeholders. They covered its
environmental dimensions and helped inform the constraints and opportunities facing the
target group of poor farmers. Interest in sustaining the project’s development efforts was
strong. The government sought additional financing that led to a new project, albeit with a
different approach focused much more on competitiveness than on poverty reduction.
                                            53


Implementing Agencies

3.62 Implementing agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Despite the
efforts outlined above, the government was less than fully prepared to implement the project.
The lack of a ready project team, data for identifying target microcatchments, RIF legal
requirements, and training of extensionists delayed the project. Over time, the team’s efforts
to resolve implementation issues improved. These efforts included training the considerable
number of staff required to implement the second component (RIF); effectively mobilizing
RIF operations after 2004; setting up systems to collect data and conduct evaluations; and
implementing an effective targeting system that covered the poverty reduction and
environmental management dimensions of the project objective, with increased attention to
poverty reduction. Despite these efforts, the project suffered from human resource
constraints, particularly on technical specialists. In some areas (e.g., planning of ecological
corridors and river basin plans), delays persisted through the end of the project. Many MAs
were poorly organized as they were hastily created to accelerate lagging implementation
(State of Catarina 2009). The M&E record shows some shortcomings in collecting
benchmark data. This made the implementation of impact evaluations more difficult.
Procurement and financial management were satisfactory.

3.63   Overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
3.64 The quality of M&E is rated substantial. Design envisaged the tracking of physical
and financial data through an enhanced MIS as well as ex-ante, mid-term, and ex-post
evaluations of its main dimensions. The MIS was to be designed as web-based to facilitate
interface among the PMU, service providers, and beneficiaries. The project envisaged six key
performance indicators that were aligned with the project’s four objectives:

      A reduction in the incidence of rural poverty in 70 percent of the 880
       microcatchments assisted;
      Effective operation of project participating mechanisms set up at community, micro
       catchment, municipal, regional and state levels;
      Improvement of natural resource management practices in all assisted
       microcatchments;
      Improved water quality and reduced soil loss in benefited microcatchments;
      Improved family incomes and employment among the target group; and
      Enactment and publication of state environmental regulation, its application in the
       design and initiation of pilot ecological corridors and protected areas.

3.65 Three of these were well defined. The first (poverty) and the fifth (incomes and
employment) reflected well the objective of improving the incomes of the poor. The fourth
(water and soil), although only directional not quantitative, was a good indicator for the
objective of reversing land degradation and better protecting the state’s natural resources.
The other three were less precise.
                                            54


3.66 Monitoring was to cover more precise dimensions relating to the indicators in pilot
microcatchments: (i) water quality and quantity; (ii), vegetation cover, pesticide use
reduction, soil-water content, and adoption of agriculture conservation practices by farmers;
(iii), effective participation and empowerment of communities in project-related decision-
making process, farmers perception of environmental issues, improvement in family living
conditions, financial and socioeconomic situation; and (iv), computation of the economic
value of external impacts of natural resources management activities, the value of increased
carbon dioxide stored, reduced sedimentation, reduced pesticide runoff, and other
environmental impacts on downstream users.

3.67 M&E implementation included physical and financial data tracking and the impact
evaluation as well as some of the monitoring of socioeconomic and environmental aspects
indicated above in seven pilot microcatchments. Furthermore, in addition to impact
evaluations, implementation also included assessments of community self-management,
productive investments, and the project’s approach on indigenous people. However,
implementation of the impact evaluations suffered from the lack of adequate benchmark data
on incomes, to the point where the performance indicator was modified. As a result of the
mid-term review, some indicators were made more precise—a 10 percent increase in the
income of priority beneficiaries and a 40 percent coverage of families with improved homes
(an indicator of living conditions).

3.68 There is no hard evidence on the use of M&E results. Nevertheless, developments
after project closing suggest poor attention to evaluation results. Most significantly, while
evaluations pointed to successful project impacts on rural poverty, the project’s rural poverty
reduction approach ended with the project and was replaced by a different, competitiveness
oriented approach that reduced the focus on the poor and on microcatchments. Furthermore,
mission interviews suggested that extension efforts had declined, despite views captured
during the mission on the substantial accomplishment of those efforts during the life of the
project. There is no evidence of government response to the apparently limited results with
respect to micro catchment water and soil quality. Although the project suggested some
impact on social capital formation at the micro catchment level, MAs were left at their own
volition, with tracking of this dimension of social capital all but abandoned.

4. Lessons
4.1     The key lessons derived from the two projects, based on the findings of this PPAR,
are the following:

      Where projects seek improvements in incomes and living conditions of the poor,
       a multidimensional approach will help to better define objectives and monitor
       achievements. In the Ceará project, targets on “well-being” and “social welfare”
       would have benefited from more precise definitions of these concepts, which will
       typically be multidimensional to enable measurement and aggregation of impacts
       across beneficiaries. Similarly, in the Santa Catarina project, a precise indicator to
       track achievements under the “living conditions” objective would have improved the
       value of M&E.
                                                   55


       A community-driven development (CDD) project may not be the best option to
        provide access to “last mile” public services, such as electricity. Historically, in
        the northeast of Brazil, services have not reached the rural poor. Region-wide, 60
        percent of households gained access to water and electricity (1992-2003) through the
        Bank financed CDD programs. In Ceara, during the early part of the project period,
        neither the State Water Company nor the State Electricity Company was providing
        public services to the most poor and remote areas, due to minimum scale and other
        eligibility standards. However, once the federal universal access programs were fully
        rolled out, what was most needed was accurate data about access and a service
        delivery model that reached the rural poor, such as performance based contractual
        commitments by distribution companies to achieve the goals.

       Reaching the rural poor through a community driven development approach
        requires clear participation criteria underpinned by accurate welfare knowledge
        or data and a system of aid allocation that is transparent and accounted for by
        beneficiaries. The two projects confirm that area poverty targeting arrangements,
        unaccompanied by clear terms of village, group and household level selection criteria,
        are likely to result in reaching less of the rural poor than is desired. Both projects
        targeting mechanisms were limited to an assessment of the relative welfare of the
        municipal level. In Ceará, selection of communities, for lack of data, was by design
        left at the discretion of MCs. And in Santa Catarina, where the targeting process was
        more transparent, delays in producing the needed data resulted in the application of a
        less informed targeting process than originally intended.

       Although productive subproject approaches may have a more direct and visible
        impact on incomes, the provision of complementary basic services—within or
        outside of the project framework—is also key to ensuring sustainability. In
        Ceará, access to tractors was the intervention found to produce the most income, but
        complementary services such as providing access to electricity and water underpin
        the feasibility of these activities, as well as to provide additional welfare benefits at
        the household level.

       Integrating poverty reduction and natural resource management (as in the Santa
        Catarina project) may be a better option than addressing these objectives in a
        separate project. In Ceará, assistance to farmers, particularly on productive (tractor)
        subprojects did not benefit enough from land management techniques, resulting in
        farming technologies that may have had an adverse effect on soil quality.
        Nevertheless, as water availability and adaptation to the adverse impacts of periodic
        droughts are the main natural resource-related challenges in Ceará, the project’s
        support for small water infrastructure subprojects partly addressed these challenges.

  The latest municipal development index data (2012) show that about 13 percent of Ceará’s population lived in
54 municipalities clustered with the lowest social development, with an average index of 13.97 percent. In
addition, 2.9 percent lived in two municipalities clustered with the highest social development, with an average
level of 88.88 percent (IPECE Undated, 83).

  In 2003, the STU was transferred from SDR to the new State Secretariat for Local and Regional Development.
In the additional financing, the STU was transferred to the Secretariat of Agrarian Development.

  EMATERCE, a public company operating under the SDR that specializes in providing technical assistance to
small farmers, had 71 regional offices to reach project beneficiaries and decentralize supervision.

  The number of productive subprojects reported by the government is 485; the number reported by the World
Bank (2009, 27) is 531.
9
  At the beginning of the original project, however, the state’s fiscal problems delayed execution as the result of
lack of counterpart funds (World Bank 2003b, 1).
10
   In 2004, the target for the original project was reduced from 2,000 to 1,550 (World Bank 2009).

   The PAD (World Bank 2001a, 48) notes that four municipalities with HDI between 0.4 and 0.5 were selected
in the first group, which used the municipal development index in the first step of the process. The actual
number of municipalities in third group are unclear. Project data show the project covered a total of 170
municipalities in the first phase and 168 in the second phase and 176 in total (Government of Ceará 2009).

15
   The Bolsa Familia program began in 2003 by combining previous social assistance programs and has
significantly expanded. In Ceará, social transfers in rural areas increased from 44.6 percent of rural incomes in
2004 to 57.5 percent in 2014.
16
   FECOP was created in 2003. Its purpose is to facilitate access by the poor and extremely poor population of
Ceará to decent subsistence levels by providing resources for nutrition, housing, education, health, sanitation,
strengthening of family income, drought mitigation, and other social programs to improve quality of life.
17 Research by the Institute of Applied Economic Research highlights the high correlation between municipal
Human Development Indices and land concentration indices.
18
   Household members possibly earned other income from nonfarm productive activities as off-farm employees
and other nonfarm income as beneficiaries of government transfers (e.g., Bolsa Familia).
19
   In FECAMP’s survey, 89.7 percent of council members attributed aby leadership for MC formation to the
state government. Only 24.1 percent attributed such leadership to communities.
20
   This is a different take on the role of the MCs than the one the ICR provided of “177 MCs (100 percent)
setting priorities and deciding allocation of project resources” (World Bank 2009, iv). FECAMP (2004, 63)
notes that MCs rejected subprojects only when they did not meet Program rules and that, “therefore, had no
chance of being approved in subsequent stages.” Accordingly, MC subproject review was the first stage in
filtering out subprojects that did not meet program rules, with the second filtering stage conducted by the STU.
As noted before, the STU rejected 910 of the 4,600 requests it received through the MCs.
21
   Under the FUMAC-P arrangement, which did not prosper, MCs would have been responsible for managing
the distribution of funds to CAs and assisting them with implementation of subprojects (World Bank 2001a, 7).
22
   A weak MC role opened a space for other intermediaries acting between CAs and project management to
obtain CA access to project funds (FECAMP 2004, 66–67).
23
   The limited evidence on the possible impacts on incomes from the mechanization subprojects comes from the
FECAMP (2004) beneficiary survey and from the IRR estimates of a nonrepresentative sample of productive
subprojects reported by the ICR.
24
   A 2014 directory lists 45 municipal councils. See

25
   This is the same additional US$13.6 million that appears in Table 2.2 as the difference between total actual
cost and total planned cost.. This additional amount was largely triggered by the value of the Brazilian currency,
which appreciated after 2003 and by higher construction costs of subprojects (World Bank 2009; 2011a).
26
  For example, in the early stages of the RPRP, the state’s fiscal constraints delayed allocation of counterpart
resources and, consequently, project implementation.

27
  The ICR reported that at the end of the projects the shares of MCs and CAs respectively with female
leadership were 20 percent and 25 percent (World Bank 2009).
28
 The Aide Memoire for the August 2006 supervision mission (World Bank 2006d, 1) refers to an August 2004
Mid-term Review for which there is no record in the project files.
29
   This was primarily at the beginning of the project. A November 2003 Aide Memoire (World Bank, 2003b, 1)
refers to underperformance in implementation due to delayed counterpart funds as a result of fiscal constraints
that were being faced by “practically all states in Brazil.”
30
   The FECAMP (2004) beneficiary survey found EMATERCE technical staff playing some role in bringing
project information to communities, preparing and selecting subprojects, and participating in MC meetings to
address subproject question.
31
   The ICR notes that some MCs graduated during the original operation to manage the distribution of funds to
CAs, but later reverted to the limited role of rubber stamping CA requests.
32
   Broader poverty in 2001 was 14.3 percent in Santa Catarina compared to 54.6 percent in Ceará (Neder and
Silva 2004).
33
   This number is based on the 14.3 percent rural poverty rate estimate and the 2000 rural population census.
34
   The objective of the new project is “to increase the competitiveness of Family Agriculture Producer
Organizations while providing support for an improved framework of structural competitiveness-inducing
public services activities in the Borrower ’s territory.”
35
   This range was the ex-post estimate from comparing treated with untreated productivity increases under the
Santa Catarina Land Management II Project (known as Microbacias I).
36
   A microcatchment is a common drainage area, which typically in Santa Catarina is about 3,000 hectares and
with a population of about 120 families.
37
   These bodies deliberative bodies were to set project implementation policy and priorities, approve annual
operational plans and fund allocations, resolve conflicts between stakeholders, approve subprojects/grants,
monitor and evaluate progress and approve implementation reports (World Bank 2002, 14).
38
   The Adaptive and Social Research subcomponent, which covered research that would underpin technical and
social change among the target group, was financed through a competitive process before a committee of five
scientists and five farmer representatives. The TA on State Structural Reform subcomponent, covering
evaluation of State poverty reduction programs and policies and alternatives to reform the water and the energy
public services, was coordinated by the Governor’s Secretariat.
39
   The State Rural Development Fund was created in 1993 to provide incentives and public sector sharing of
farmers’ costs, in particular of those that brought off-farm public goods benefits.
40
   These are microregions, each formed from a group of cities linked to a pole city. Each pole city has a
Regional Development Secretariat, decentralized dependencies of the state government.

(predominantly Guarani).

  See http://www.aguas.sc.gov.br/instrumentos/planos-de-bacias-instrumentos.
43
  A case study for the Itajai River Basin provides survey evidence that decision making for watershed policy is
primarily driven by technical knowledge in the watershed committee, with less attention to lay knowledge from
communities and societal actors, who have been alienated from meaningful participation in technically the
dominated decision-making body (Copeland 2014).This suggests that the driving force for policy is the
technical establishment, with river basin plans reflecting those technical views.
44
   The standard is water that (i) can be used for human consumption following conventional treatment; (ii)
protect aquatic communities; (ii) allow recreational use; (iv) can be used for irrigation in places where people
can have direct contact; and (v) can be used for aquaculture and fishing.
45
   The source for the number of microcatchments was the project supervision Aide Memoire from October 2003
(Word Bank 2003c, 1). It reflects the updated microcatchment count done at the time.
46
   The ICR concluded 91 percent of the original target had been achieved, “extrapolating from final evaluation
survey results.” This result could not be replicated from the available data.
47
   As indicated earlier, the priority public included marginal farmers (less than one minimum wage per capita)
and transition 1 farmers (less than two minimum wages per capita), indigenous people, and rural youth.
48
   Furthermore, the ICR reports, from an unidentified source, that in a sample of 70 subprojects, net farm
incomes doubled between 2005–2006 and 2007–2008 (World Bank 2010, 15).
