Poverty Reduction Project for Brazil\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the micro-catchment has become a\n            sustainable management unit, and an effective forum for the\n            rural organization and planning essential for more complex\n            productive and environmental activities. Complex, innovative\n            projects of broad scope repeatedly demonstrate that\n            training, organization and institutional growth occupy at\n            minimum, the first half of the implementation period. Clear,\n            objective targeting parameters and strong institutional\n            commitment to compliance ensures the poverty focus of such\n            projects. The capillarity and decentralized managerial\n            structure and quality of an executive extension agency are\n            critical. Design of a demand-led investment fund with\n            discrete financing windows needs to reflect the fact that\n            poor rural families will invariably select social\n            investments over economic or environmental in the first\n            instance. Demonstration, observation, and validation units -\n            demand-led under a rural investment fund are a sound and\n            effective way to include meaningful research in a project of\n            this type."}, "docdt": "2010-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
