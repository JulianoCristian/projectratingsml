Poor farmers' families\n            incomes and livelihoods would be improved by (i) support for\n            government efforts to integrate environmental and social\n            sustainability into development and poverty reduction\n            strategies; (ii) enhanced local governance and community\n            participation in decision making; (iii) reversed land\n            degradation and better protection of the state's\n            natural resources and; (iv) improvements to\n            income-generating opportunities and living conditions for\n            the rural poor. Environmental impacts would mostly be those\n            financed by the Rural Investment Fund (RIF). Impacts of the\n            majority would be positive or neutral e.g., from improved\n            soil and water conservation, replanting of riparian forests,\n            water source protection, domestic sanitation and improved\n            handling of pig waste. Impacts of any misdirected support\n            for agricultural diversification, agro-processing,\n            aquaculture or rehabilitation of small rural roads could,\n            however, be negative. Strict environmental procedures and\n            environmental licensing mechanisms, as well as proposing\n            mitigation measures, are built in the management of the\n            Fund. Mitigation measures would be integrated into the\n            screening, evaluation, approval, and monitoring procedures\n            for sub-projects submitted to the RIF."}, "docdt": "2001-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
