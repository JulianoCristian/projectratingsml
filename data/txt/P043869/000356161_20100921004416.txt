1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 At appraisal, the State of Santa Catarina showed some 38% of all rural families living
below the poverty line including a majority of the state's indigenous population of about 7,000
people. Brazil's decision to join Mercosur ­ and consequent opening of Brazilian agriculture to
global competition - had the adverse effect of greatly increasing poverty among small-scale
farmers and intensifying the rural exodus which averaged around 4% per year in the southern
states including Santa Catarina. Decreasing farm incomes, deteriorating quality of life and
deficient drinking water, sanitation and housing conditions were driving families, and especially
young people, off the land. Meanwhile, accelerating farm intensification, use of agro-chemicals
and water pollution, and threats to forest resources and protected areas were flagged by
government as issues with serious medium and long-term implications, especially for small-scale
farmers.

1.1.2 Bank support for the sector: The Natural Resource Management and Rural Poverty
Reduction Project was the fourth in a series of pioneering Bank-financed state operations
supporting innovative technical approaches to soil conservation in southern Brazil and the second
of this type in Santa Catarina, following on from the successful Santa Catarina Land Management
II Project (LM II). The latter sought to control erosion and increase agricultural production and
productivity, concentrating activities in areas of the state with highest incidence of and
susceptibility to soil erosion. It was not specifically targeted to the rural poor. It successfully
expanded the adoption of improved land management practices over one-third of all agricultural
properties state-wide, thereby increasing the productivity of staple crops, and reducing soil loss
and water pollution. It also demonstrated the effectiveness of participatory, community-driven
approaches and the use of the micro-catchment as the basic unit for physical planning and
              1
organization.

1.1.3 State Government's Strategy and Actions: Rural poverty and internal migration to
coastal centers, uneven socioeconomic conditions, opportunities and economic growth between
the interior and coastal areas, sustainable farm management, water pollution from intensive
agricultural production, and loss of forest cover and natural habitats became major concerns of
the State Government in the 1990s. The state's new rural development policy and design of the
follow-on project reflected these concerns. Decentralized, participatory mechanisms organized
around the micro-catchment, and decentralized financing and execution of programs would
enable the state to reach the rural poor. Change would be induced through cost-shared grants and
piloting/demonstration. Needs of the poor such as sanitation, better housing, job-creation and
income generation were to be given special attention. The State demonstrated its commitment to
the strategy by introducing its main elements even before the new project was approved.
Participatory approaches introduced under LM II were mainstreamed state-wide and poverty
outreach mechanisms were piloted in 22 micro-catchments.

1.1.4 The previous project was also influential through its soil and water management
achievements in prompting government to address natural resources management more
comprehensively, dividing the state into hydrographic regions using river basins as planning and

                                                                  1
management units. New environmental laws were drafted to create the State Protected Area
System and to establish fiscal incentives for municipalities to implement environmental education
programs and create protected areas. Government also requested Global Environmental Facility
(GEF) support for a medium-sized project building on the LM II and other relevant programs
designed to support the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park in expanding its conservation programs and
                                2
conflict resolution framework. The State also implemented a structural reform program and
entered into a Debt Agreement with the Federal Government to improve its fiscal management
which had been impeding access to new Bank lending. The State proposed a review of targeting
and impact mechanisms for its social safety net programs as a complement to the project's
poverty reduction goals, and sought technical assistance to reform its public utility management
strategy in regard to water resources/supply, energy and sanitation.

1.1.4 Rationale for Bank involvement: The Bank had a long history of supporting
governments' environmental and poverty reduction efforts in Brazil, and had only recently
assisted the State of Santa Catarina to implement the successful LM II project. The new project
was consistent with the then recently-released Rural Poverty Report flagging the need for small
farm intensification, and with the Brazil Country Assistance Strategy of March 2000, which cast
poverty and inequality as continuing, critical challenges for the country. The CAS recommended
well-targeted poverty programs to build the poor's human and physical capital, decentralized
approaches, and environmental policies as the foundation of sustainable poverty reduction in rural
areas. Bank involvement also supported CAS goals for judicious fiscal management and
governance reflected in the State's willingness to undertake reform through structural adjustment.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The project development objective (PDO) was to reduce rural poverty in the State of
Santa Catarina while improving the management of natural resources. The incomes and
livelihoods of poor rural families would be improved by: (i) support for Government efforts to
integrate environmental and social sustainability into development and poverty reduction
strategies; 3(ii) improvements to income-generating opportunities and living conditions for the
rural poor; (iii) reversed land degradation and better protection of the State's natural resources;
and (iv) enhanced local governance and community participation in decision-making.

1.2.2        Key Performance Indicators (KPI) as approved, were as follows:

        ·    Reduction in the incidence of rural poverty in 70% of the 880 micro-catchments assisted;
        ·    Improvement of natural resource management practices in all assisted micro-catchments;
        ·    Improved water quality and reduced soil loss in benefited micro-catchments;
        ·    Improved family incomes and employment among the targeted group; and,
        ·    Enactment and publication of State environmental regulations and their application to the
             design and initiation of pilot ecological corridors and protected areas; and,
        ·    Effective operation of project participatory mechanisms set up at community, micro-
             catchment, municipal, regional and state levels.

1.2.3 The EPAGRI/CEPA monitoring and evaluation team, the Bank project team and an M&E
specialist from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), agreed at the time of the Mid-term
Review that the measurement of the approved Key Performance Indicators could be enhanced
and deepened by a set of "sub-indicators" which would look at each KPI from several angles
while adhering to its conceptual intent. With few exceptions, the corresponding M&E exercises
provided a rich cache of complementary data/information. For clarity, the relationship of each
approved KPI to its sub-indicators is shown in Annex 2, Appendix 1. Results are reported in the
Data Sheet and Main Text, section 3.2.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1     The PDO and Key Performance Indicators were not revised (see 1.2.3 above).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The direct target population was an estimated 105,000 small and marginal farm families
and rural laborers and about 5,000 indigenous people residing in 880 micro-catchments, about
half of the State's total. The priority target groups represented about 75% of the total expected
beneficiary families; the project encouraged participation of all members of the micro-catchment,
especially for environmental activities.4 Targeting criteria, unlike LM II, were poverty-driven
with environmental degradation as a secondary priority. See Annex 2.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1     The project comprised the following components and sub-components (details, Annex 2):

     ·    Institutional Development and Organization (US$17.9 million, 16.7% of total project
          cost) financed four sub-components: (a) training; (b) rural extension; (c) adaptive and
          social research; and (d) technical assistance supporting State structural adjustment.
     ·    Rural Investment (US$77.2 million, 72.3% of total project cost) financed a grant-based
          Rural Investment Fund with beneficiary cost-sharing, to facilitate and provide incentive
          for the adoption of the project strategy within benefited micro-catchments. The Fund
          comprised three "lines": housing improvements including piped water and sanitation;
          environmental conservation activities; and, income generation through improved
          production systems, value-added schemes or job creation.
     ·    Environmental Management (US$3.8 million, 3.5% of total project cost) financed two
          sub-components: (a) watershed management; and (b) creation of ecological corridors and
          protected areas.
     ·    Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$8.0 million, 7.5% of total project
          cost) financed three sub-components: (a) project management; (b) monitoring and
          evaluation; and (c) community organization. See table 2.1, Annex 2.

1.6 Revised Components

Components and subcomponents were not revised.

  Benefits were expected to come from improved farm profitability resulting from upgrading their land management and farming
practices, crop and livestock diversification and new employment opportunities - especially for women and youth - from post-harvest
processing and other rural enterprises.

                                                                3
1.7 Other significant changes

     ·    Closing date extended: The project closing date was extended via a third order
          restructuring (now classified as first-order) from December 31, 2008 to September 30,
          2009, to permit preparation of an Additional Financing operation. 5 (September 30, 2008)
     ·    Reallocation of resources: US$7,952,000 was reallocated from Categories 4 (Consultant
          Services and Training) and 6 (Unallocated), to Categories 1 (Works), 2 (Goods), and 3
          (Rural Subproject Grants). (July 13, 2007)
     ·    Rural Investment Fund (RIF): (a) Financing of technical assistance activities for micro-
          catchment development associations (MDA) within the RIF component was maintained
          at 100% for the life of the project, versus the declining scale (i.e., increasing beneficiary
          share) originally planned; (b) Two new financing lines were included post-MTR: for rural
          youth and for establishing pilot testing/observation units for new productive activities;
          and (c) The RIF investment financing percentage was increased from 75% to 90% to
          "compensate" the state for other expenditures where the state was contributing 100%, and
          to accelerate RIF implementation. (Date not found).
     ·    Youth participation formalized: Rural youth were formally included in the priority target
          group as recommended by the Mid-term Review (MTR, 2006). (Date not found)
     ·    Institutional change: EPAGRI (Agro-livestock Research and Rural Extension Company
          of Santa Catarina) formally absorbed CEPA (Center for Agricultural Socio-Economics
          and Planning) thereby incorporating the project evaluation function (Bank no-objection
          May 2006). Also, the Environmental Military Police Battalion (BPMA) was formally
          incorporated as executor of the Integrated Watershed Management subcomponent. (Date
          not found).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Government Commitment: The project had an unusually long gestation, with the State
seeking/receiving Federal Government approval for a follow-up as early as 1995, and formal
preparation starting in 1998. Fiscal difficulties in the late 1990s prevented the state from
contracting new external loans and put the project in abeyance until 2001 when it was reinserted
in the Bank's pipeline. During the hiatus following closing of LM II in 1999, the State conducted
pilot field exercises led by EPAGRI to adapt the LM II participatory arrangements to respond
better to environmental concerns and the needs of poor rural families, and to launch activities of a
type contemplated in the new operation. Government expressed its full support for providing the
financial and human resources for project implementation, and a favorable legal environment.

2.1.2 Soundness of the background analysis: The project heeded the lessons of LM II and
other Bank-supported projects combining natural resources management within a rural
development context, emphasizing: civil society participation and decentralized implementation
via stratified deliberative forums; data-based, objective targeting mechanisms; training and public
awareness-building; consolidation of micro-catchments as the most convenient planning unit;
and, including profit incentives in new technical messages. A Rural Investment Fund was

                                                                4
included as an incentive to change land management practices, and executing agencies
retained/utilized managers and senior technical personnel with experience from the previous
project. Preparation benefited from a participatory, consultative process involving several
thousand potential beneficiaries and private stakeholders in 22 representative micro-catchments.
These groups were involved directly in project design, and mechanisms to sustain this dialogue
were built into the project's institutional arrangements for implementation.

2.1.3 Even so, weaknesses in the analytical effort impacted on project design resulting in an
under-estimation of the complexity of key project objectives and activities, and their
timing/sequencing, and over-estimation of institutional, technical and operational capacity.
Further, the protracted gap between the two operations in Santa Catarina had consequences for
the continuity/memory of LM II's concept, mechanisms and institutions, despite the State's
commendable pilot efforts.

Assessment of project design:

2.1.4 Objectives and Indicators: The overriding PDO, specifically its poverty reduction
element, was stated in absolute terms not as a contribution to a wider state effort, and its
measurement by end-project was unlikely. The individual segments comprising the PDO were, on
balance, reasonable and achievable under suitable implementation conditions.

2.1.5 The Key Performance Indicators were conceptually satisfactory but problematic: (a) four
of the six KPI referred to a "reduction" or "improvement" dependent on expected completion of a
baseline evaluation in Year 1 (not completed until Year 4). Several were ambiguously-worded
and only one had a numerical target; (b) the Project Design Summary (PAD, Annex 1) shows
evidence of hasty preparation. Sector-related CAS Goals were confused with the statement of
PDO, and the KPI from the Main Text were designated as Sector Indicators in the Design
Summary. Employment creation was omitted, and new KPIs were added; (c) the Design
Summary also shows a re-worded PDO section only loosely-related to the PDO in the PAD Main
Text and Loan Agreement, and a new set of KPI, a mixture of outcomes and outputs; (d) no
intermediate outcome indicators were specified; and, (e) Output Indicator tables from the PAD
(Annex 2) are annexed to the Minutes of Negotiations instead of the required Key Performance
Indicators, for monitoring/evaluating achievement of PDO.

2.1.6 As discussed in 1.3.2, the respective Borrower and Bank teams agreed during the Mid-
term Review on a series of more accessible sub-indicators designed to enhance the monitoring
and measurement of the approved KPI and this worked quite successfully as shown in the Data
Sheet and section 3.2. However, the project would have benefited from indicators to demonstrate,
for example, actual bio-physical improvements from improved NRM practices in the 936 micro-
catchments (e.g., changes in loss of forest cover, soil erosion and/or downstream siltation).

2.1.7 Project scope and scale: Project design as reflected in the PAD was internally rational
and consistent but tried to do too much. The 14 separate components and sub-components
illustrate the project's broad vision: social and human capital formation, natural resources
management, organized productive activities, poverty reduction, agro-ecological mapping,
creation of ecological corridors and protected areas, policy integration, legal changes/legislation,
state structural reform, adaptive/social research, and indigenous peoples. The operational and
technical strategies were complex and sophisticated. The organizational framework was logical
but ambitious, with two complementary, stratified pillars comprising deliberative and operational
bodies and functions intended to foster decentralization and participation. Municipal government
support was crucial to this structure but not assured. Five agencies were involved but the

                                                 5
Operational Manual lacked a collaboration framework, and project design consciously excluded a
joint coordination body. The incorporation of explicit and dominant poverty goals differentiated
the project from its predecessor, increased the degree of difficulty, and implied a steep process of
learning by doing, not necessarily alleviated by experiences and lessons from similar projects.

2.1.8 Pressured appraisal may have influenced an unduly optimal vision of implementation
speed and learning. The project was revived following a protracted delay (described in Section 1)
and entered the Bank pipeline close to the end of the mandate of the State administration. The
PAD noted that "while Government commitment to the project has been sustained for many years
and is not expected to waiver, it is politically desirable to have the Loan signed while the present
administration remains in office. The Government and the Bank have therefore accelerated their
preparation efforts to the maximum to contain the threats of possible slippage".

Risk Assessment:

2.1.9 The risk assessment was generally appropriate but uneven and with some blurring of
content between the Outputs to Objectives and Components to Outputs sections. Institutional
capacity is cited, but viewed narrowly as affecting mostly the environmental management
agency/component and with NGO involvement seen as the main mitigating element. Operational
and technical complexities are not cited as risks, and nor is the introduction of explicit and
dominant poverty goals, which increased overall difficulty. Availability of the agreed number of
extension workers/facilitators was indeed a risk but sustained political commitment was only part
of the appropriate mitigation equation in this case.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The project vision was optimal but as implementation unfolded, the sense of what was
possible in the allotted time period narrowed. Implementation and disbursement were slow in the
first three years, delaying the Mid-term Review because the Borrower and Bank teams agreed,
with justification - and even while acknowledging the rationale for adhering to the true mid-point
- that there were insufficient "hard" results to merit the exercise at the time originally scheduled.
The fact that a large number of output indicators were already met or exceeded at that time belied
the real situation reflected in low disbursements. Most activities in the first half, while essential,
were preparatory - training, capacity building and organization. The conceptually sophisticated,
market-driven productive investments contemplated under the Rural Investment Fund - which
absorbed much of the Loan - exceeded the capacity of most targeted producers, EPAGRI and the
technical field teams. Other challenging activities included establishing modern State water
resources management systems (an outcome of the state structural adjustment studies, not
envisaged at appraisal), and the design, validation and initial installation of ecological corridors.

2.2.2 Even so, promising gains were made in a diverse range of small-scale, technically simple
productive activities, tens of thousands of farm families saw their productive systems/productivity
and living conditions improve, and natural resource management awareness and practices made
notable gains in large areas of the State. Two State government electoral turnovers (2002 and
2006) had the expected/customary effects on the continuity of institutional arrangements and how
the State's rural strategy played out, but overall, official/institutional commitment to the project
remained steady and strong throughout, indicative inter alia, of the extent to which the project
strategy was widely accepted by stakeholders, regardless of party politics/interests, and was
already being internalized as state public policy.



                                                  6
Factors affecting implementation and their resolution/outcome:

2.2.3 Institutional, human resource and capacity factors: As noted earlier, the Project was
immensely complex, becoming more so over time as it evolved, expanded and pushed for
results.6 Human resources were a constant issue. Subdivision of the State into a greater number
of regions without contracting additional specialists to man decentralized offices eroded local
level networks and capacity critical to a project of this type.7 EPAGRI had difficulty re-assigning
technicians more evenly among regions. Facilitators (contracted and paid by the Micro-catchment
Development Associations) were of uneven capacity and proliferated, professional
requirements/profiles were not standardized, and there was high rotation in the poorest
municipalities. Project agencies were committed but over-extended and bringing them together
regularly to discuss progress and coordination was difficult. Bank missions sought diverse
solutions, e.g., processed RIF proposals in "lots" to better-manage the flow of proposals;
leveraged support for project operations from NGOs, the municipalities and cooperatives; and
kept training programmatic and its content updated. However, the challenges remained:
partnership formation; a more strategic, deliberative (as opposed to consultative) approach at all
levels; building multi-disciplinary teams with strategic coverage of priority areas, groups and
types of investments; and, intensive focus on human resource formation, and on the quality,
relevance and coverage of training programs.8 See Annex 2.

2.2.4 Targeting framework: The Operational Manual set out a rational targeting framework for
defining eligible micro-catchments and it worked effectively with the poorest Priority cohorts
(Marginal, Transition 1, rural labourers, indigenous groups and youth) receiving a high
proportion of project benefits. Targeting was hindered in the early years however, by delays in
the Municipal Agro-livestock Census (LAC) planned for completion in Year 1 but not done until
2005. This inter alia, blocked the inclusion of new municipalities and/or initiation of planning in
micro-catchments, creating dissatisfaction with the project among stakeholders. In agreement
with the Bank, EPAGRI personnel were seconded to the census to galvanize its rapid conclusion,
but certain data issues affecting the LAC ultimately prevented its use as the primary targeting
reference. The "estrategia alternativa" which was intended to be used only to end-2003 pending
completion of the LAC, continued in place and was effective. See Annex 2.

2.2.5 Exchange rate-related financing gap: A financing gap of US$35.3 million created by
unfavourable changes in the US Dollar/Brazilian Real exchange rate in the period from mid-2005
to late 2008 - a risk not foreseeable at appraisal and beyond the control of the Borrower or project
implementing agency - led to a 28% shortfall in Project resources from the allocations under the
Loan Agreement. This coincided with the period when many beneficiary farmers/communities
were positioned to access the RIF, having completed organization and training programs and with
their individual Development Plans and Micro-catchment Investment Plans ready. Some 12,000
families among the targeted Priority cohort of 80,000 families were unable to make any form of
productive, social and/or conservation investment under the RIF. Another 68,000 Priority families

6
    The ultimate outcomes of the Water Resources Study under state structural adjustment activities are a classic example.

7
 The newly-elected State Government in 2003 created 29 State Secretariats of Regional Development with Regional Project
Executive Secretariats.

8
 Local authorities claimed inadequate resources to improve this situation which in turn affected the composition of regional teams.
EPAGRI tended to interpret this as a political decision, which periodically dampened its engagement with the project. Facilitators
were contracted by the MDAs directly from a cooperative pool of technicians. EPAGRI vetted the list of providers but lacked the
capacity/manpower or reach to oversee facilitators' performance. See Annex 2.



                                                                    7
could not access the full range of investments contemplated under their Plans, including in many
cases, the income-generating productive investments. The project closed without a resolution.9

2.2.6 Rural Investment Fund (RIF): Resources applied to the Housing Improvements
financing window under the RIF exceeded appraisal expectations. Since inadequate housing and
sanitation conditions affected much of the target population, strong demand for this line was
rational and to be expected. Demand-led rural projects Bank-wide demonstrate that social
investments virtually always have priority over productive in the first instance. However, the
critical underlying reason for lagging productive investments was inadequate technical expertise
and training among the field teams/facilitators ­ and responsible agencies ­ to support the
sophisticated productive arrangements envisaged in the PAD. Basic social infrastructure was
easier to plan and implement than the complex, time-consuming process of organizing farmers for
productive activities, and deciding what to invest in and how much (since beneficiaries'
counterpart contribution was required). The Bank repeatedly pressed the Borrower to "balance"
RIF investments between the three investment windows (as envisaged at appraisal), resulting in a
sharp increase from 2007 on, but mostly in modest investments of an individual - not group ­
nature, and with little market insertion, since the basic human resource constraint persisted.10 See
Annex 2.

 2.2.7 Quality of Bank supervision: The quality of Bank supervision is discussed in 5.1 (b) but
merits commendation here as a material factor in maintaining quality, ensuring compliance and
supporting the project's institutional, technical and operational implementation. The Bank team
engaged closely with Borrower agencies, especially EPAGRI and FATMA, providing the
analytical vision, practical solutions, knowledge and flexibility needed to generate momentum
and increase the scope and scale of project achievements incrementally as the groundwork was
laid. Notable attention was paid to safeguards, M&E, implementation of structural reform study
recommendations (especially water resources and sanitation), and difficult institutional/field
capacity issues.

2.2.8 Mid-term Review (MTR): The Mid-term Review was of good quality but delayed (end-
2006 versus August 2005), limiting the time available for second-half course corrections.11 The
MTR comprised a Bank mission with appropriate specialists (safeguards, environment, social,
financial management, procurement); an independent performance review (FEALQ/USP),
2006;12 and, strategic and operational planning seminars to review recommendations and plan
follow-up. Disbursements were about US$20.0 million with the emphasis on institutional/human
development, and housing rehabilitation investments under the RIF. Income-generating
investments were still modest. Physical results at the time showed a high proportion of targets
already met or exceeded despite modest expenditures, suggesting that costs may have been over-

9
 To resolve this financing gap, the Federal Government was willing to guarantee an Additional Financing (AF) loan of up to US$35.3
million. This had the effect of shifting unfinished activities into the AF and using the closing date extension of MB II to prepare it.
However, the Bank and State Government subsequently agreed to change course and the AF did not proceed. The new and larger
Rural Competitiveness Project includes important activities designed to complete unfinished aspects of MB II.

10
   The output indicator Annex 2, Table 2.4 shows under Component 4 (Project Management), that no Specialist Consultants were
contracted for activities under "markets" or "business administration".

11
   The Project Team maintains that delaying the MTR was justified and that the findings of the MTR performance study
(FEALQ/USP, 2006) were richer for having had more substantive activities to assess.

estimated and/or targets under-estimated at appraisal. Also, the more difficult, higher cost
activities were still pending.

2.2.9   The MTR performance study (FEALQ/USP, 2006) inter alia:

    ·   highlighted the economic, social and environmental gains already made by beneficiaries
        in over 900 micro-catchments, and their potential to reduce out-migration;
    ·   praised the project's institutional impact on reclaiming the status of technical assistance
        and rural extension services under EPAGRI;
    ·   stressed the links between local teams'/technicians' capacity to understand and explain
        the project's strategic and productive "vision" to family farmers and the efficiency and
        success of its implementation; and,
    ·   re-confirmed the relevance and adequacy of project objectives and the decentralized
        structure/instruments including facilitators and animators for human capital formation.

2.2.10 Study recommendations included:

    ·  much greater emphasis on RIF income generation and environmental investments;
    ·  improvement in the project's managerial structure at all levels, and improved training
       in technical and managerial skills, market identification and productive alternatives;
    · formal strategies for engaging rural youth and for utilizing the project's capacity to
       catalyze and concentrate supply of/demand for other public programs via the micro-
       catchments; and,
    · extension of the closing date to improve the long-term sustainability of community self-
       management, and institutionalization of the project technical strategy;

2.2.11 Project at Risk Status: The project was not at any point declared at risk.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Planned monitoring and evaluation contemplated an enhanced Management Information
System (MIS), automated and tracking physical and financial execution of the project in real
time, and impact evaluation and case studies. Socio-economic and environmental aspects would
be continuously monitored in pilot micro-catchments. The demanding program included three
evaluations: ex-ante (Baseline, Year 1), Mid-term (Year 3) and Ex-post (Year 6) and an
independent, mid-term physical progress review. Data collection for M&E would be participatory
and stress dissemination of results.

2.3.2 M&E performance: Monitoring and evaluation were internalized by EPAGRI/CEPA
from the start, received focused attention from Bank supervision missions and included seminars
and workshops on methodology/other aspects with multi-state and stakeholder participation.
Efforts were made to develop a strategic, operational approach which would institutionalize good
M&E practices in key participating agencies. EPAGRI/CEPA took the initiative on enhanced
measurement of the approved outcome indicators, evidence of strong buy-in. The MTR study
(FEALQ/USP, 2006) reported a tendency for the system to emit large amounts of data but not be
able to efficiently generate aggregate data compatible with the project's core development
indicators, but this was addressed and will be further consolidated under the follow-on project.

2.3.3 Evaluation performance was very good and all expected products were delivered, albeit
delayed, and included: an "ex-ante" study (EPAGRI/CEPA, 2005); the MTR progress report

                                                9
(FEALQ/USP, 2006); a "pre-final" evaluation, originally intended as the mid-term but delayed
(EPAGRI/CEPA, 2008); a final evaluation using control groups (EPAGRI/CEPA 2009),
complemented by micro-catchment monitoring studies; and, a Borrower Completion Report
(SEE/EPAGRI, 2009). Quality was generally very good.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards:

2.4.1 Indigenous Peoples: Project engagement with indigenous peoples (IP) was governed by
an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP), viewed as an innovative learning opportunity for project
agencies, especially EPAGRI, which had little prior experience. The Bank social safeguards
specialist supervised the IPP closely and activities implemented for indigenous groups made
significant headway: (a) five Indigenous Lands Development Plans were prepared, covering eight
lands and some 1,850 families; (b) the project worked closely with about 7,000 Guarani, Xokleng
and Kaingang people, investing R$2.6 million (RIF resources including technical assistance), and
leveraging another R$1.6 million through partnerships.13

2.4.2      Challenges facing the Indigenous Peoples Strategy throughout project execution were:

     ·     Limited number of technical assistance and other relevant professionals in EPAGRI's
           municipal offices with appropriate training/skills to work with IP, especially as five
           additional (Guarani) lands were regularized after appraisal;
     ·     Prohibition on making physical investments on un-regularized lands, or in working in
           areas subject to serious conflict, although many preparatory actions (mobilization,
           training, diagnostic plans, technical assistance) were permitted and conducted. (See
           Annex 5 for indigenous beneficiary opinion survey).

2.4.3 Environment: Positive and sustainable environmental impacts were a project objective.
Activities under the Environmental Management component explicitly promoted conservation,
protected biodiversity, reduced pollution and created/consolidated protected areas. The
Environmental Education sub-component successfully boosted public awareness of
environmental issues. Investment proposals under the RIF were routinely screened for
environmental implications and monitored for compliance based on the Operational Manual; and
the RIF included a window for Environmental Conservation. EPAGRI had environmental
specialists on staff and contracted a legal specialist to evaluate environmental investments, legal
reserves, environmental licensing, and aspects of the Serra Tabuleiro State Park. Environmental
"multipliers" were trained to assess environmental impact, and to prepare/distribute
environmental technical guides and brochures about Federal and State environmental laws.




Fiduciary:




13
   Investments/activities included community plots, small reservoirs, grains storage facilities, housing and sanitation, re-forestation,
environmental and income-generating activities.

                                                                  10
2.4.4 Financial Management: The final Financial Management supervision (FMS) in April
2009 (seven were conducted) maintained the FM rating as Satisfactory and the FM risk as Low.
The two financial management information systems (CIASC and SAFF)14 were rated Highly
Satisfactory in attending to the project's accounting and financial needs, including production of
Bank-required reports. Arrangements/systems for project accounting, financial management and
information systems were found to be providing the information necessary for project
management. Institutional arrangements were considered satisfactory with the segregation of
functions strengthening internal controls.

2.4.5 Audit: Nine audit reports were prepared and with few exceptions, were received in the
Bank by the due date. Audit opinions were generally unqualified or qualified exception with no
serious issues detected. Any issues requiring follow-up were resolved efficiently by the Borrower
in cooperation with the Bank team.

2.4.6 Disbursement: Disbursements were exceedingly slow in the first three years, reaching
barely 10% of the Loan by end-2005. This was due primarily to the delayed launching of
activities under the Rural Investment Fund (RIF) component to which about 75% of Loan funds
were allocated, and to the focus on training and organizing stakeholders in the first half. Sharp
acceleration of RIF activity starting in 2006 through closing saw some 90% of the Loan disburse
in that period.

2.4.7 Project Costs: Total project costs exceeded appraisal estimates by about 4.3%, with the
costs of Component 1 Institutional Development and Organization about 9% less than expected,
despite outputs meeting or exceeding both initial and revised (post-MTR) targets in a high
proportion of cases, suggesting lower unit costs than initially estimated. The Rural Investment
component cost about 12% more than expected, Project Management was 14.7% above its
appraisal estimate and the Environmental Management component was about 16% lower. The
Borrower's contribution to total project costs was about 110.5% of expected.

2.4.8        Legal: At Closing, the project was in compliance with all legal covenants.

2.4.9 Procurement: Project procurement was generally straightforward governed by a
Procurement Plan and based on Bank "no objections" when required. The only issue was delays
and bureaucracy associated with compliance with the Bank's requirement for international
participation/bidding for certain consultancies. This was resolved through consultation between
the Bank and Borrower.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Follow-on operation: Evidence that environmentally sound land management practices
adopted at the micro-catchment level by small farmers can boost productivity and increase
incomes has resonated with the State Government which is working with the Bank to prepare an
innovative, rural operation utilizing a SWAp element, the Santa Catarina Rural Competitiveness
Project with a proposed loan of US$90 million and total project cost of US$246 million. The
operation emphasizes small-farmer competitiveness, linking organized groups to markets,




14
     CIASC ­ State's accounting and budgeting system; and SAFF ­ planning, supervision and management controls in a single system.



                                                                 11
leveraging greater integration of public programs at the micro-catchment level, and consolidating
important elements of MB II still pending at closing.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High overall relevance

3.1.1 The PDO continues to have high overall relevance for sound land management, agro-
livestock productivity growth and rural poverty reduction in Santa Catarina. Decentralized
approaches which improve the productivity, competitiveness, and organization of vulnerable rural
populations remain a primary development tool with an established and evolving track record in
many regions. Evidence suggests that the technical and operational strategy has positive impact,
can be scaled up, can host/catalyze further innovation including a major intensification of efforts
to develop more sophisticated production models and marketing arrangements for small-scale
rural enterprises, and remains consistent with the Brazil Country Partnership Strategy, 2008-2011.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 The following findings are based on impact evaluation and case studies,
beneficiary/stakeholder opinion surveys, and the Borrower Completion Report. The use of
supplementary sub-indicators developed post-MTR to enhance measurement of the approved KPI
- and by definition the PDO - is explained in sections 1.2 and 2.1, and the framework and
linkages are shown in Annex 2, Appendix 1.

Objective 1:     Support for Government efforts to integrate environmental and social
sustainability into development and poverty reduction strategies

3.2.2 Achieved: The project invested about US$112.0 million, including a Loan of US$62.8
million, to change the way State sector institutions and 153,000 diverse rural stakeholders
integrate and plan social and environmental strategies, and to inculcate awareness of
conservation's role in raising productivity and reducing rural poverty. The project: (a) assisted
59,000 poor rural families to develop green productive practices capable of sustainably increasing
productivity and incomes on around 264,000 ha; (b) ensured that 89,000 poor families benefited
from social, environmental and income improving investments designed as an incentive to adopt
and continue conservationist practices on their main economic asset ­ land; and (c) created 936
Micro-catchment Development Associations the vast majority of which have a Development Plan
permitting more effective and sustainable local level integration of public development programs
funded under federal and state rural poverty and NRM strategies. These achievements are already
having spillover effects beyond the project micro-catchments.

3.2.3 Environmental and social sustainability was also boosted through the enactment of two
State environmental laws, and the development and validation of planning models for Ecological
Corridors in two major catchments. The Ecological ICMS (Tax on the Movement of Goods and
Services) Law was enacted and regulated and the State Protected Areas Law (SEUC) was
enacted, regulated and had systems established. Planning for the Ecological Corridors of the Rio
Chapecó and Rio Timbó River Basins was completed and innovative macro-strategies for their
socio-economic development were prepared under which the natural forest/landscape would
constitute the strategic planning unit and the micro-catchments would serve as operational


                                                12
planning units. Implementation was launched as the project closed, and will be completed under
the proposed new Rural Competitiveness Project.

3.2.4 In addition, three Strategic River Basin Plans for integrated management of water
resources were developed for the Chapecó, Timbó and Jacutinga river catchment areas,
subsequently extended to all major catchments State-wide. Further, a Census of Water Users was
completed for these three catchments (also extended state-wide), administrative premises were
established on site in each case and FATMA's institutional and human resources capacity to
conduct integrated management of water catchment areas was improved through specialized
training. Consolidation of the Rio Tabuleiro State Park made satisfactory progress through
stakeholder mobilization, installation of administrative and visitor buildings and other actions.

3.2.5 Impressive gains were made to modernize state water resources management, including
the Water Resources Information System and the System for Grants of Water Usage Rights
(outorgas) developed on the basis of the project-supported State Census of Water Users.
Recommendations of the Water Resources Management Study conducted as part of the sub-
component Technical Assistance for State Structural Adjustment had results far exceeding
appraisal expectations including creation of the Water Resources Information System (SIRHESC,
www.aguas.sc.giv.br) cited as a national reference model by the National Water Agency (ANA).
The system was already replicated by the State of Rio Grande do Sul and represents a
commendable achievement by the Secretariat of Sustainable Development (SDS) which closely
supervised the study and its follow-up.

Objective 2: Improvements to income-generating opportunities and living conditions for the
rural poor

3.2.6 Achieved: Direct investments under the Income Improvement and Housing Improvement
windows of the RIF, along with improved NRM, helped to increase the incomes and raise the
living standards of families in the Priority poorest groups. Extrapolating from final evaluation
survey results, poverty declined in 64% of the 880 micro-catchments targeted at appraisal, an
                             15
achievement of around 91%. EPAGRI/CEPA (2009) showed that the incomes of a sampled 698
Priority poor farmers (Marginal and Transition 1) representative of the 38,360 Priority farmers
who benefited from RIF Income Improvement investments, in 268 micro-catchments
representative of the 936 total project-assisted micro-catchments state-wide, increased their
incomes. Increases averaged 30.6% by 2008, compared to an increase of 16.6% for the control
group. A separate survey of 417 Priority beneficiary families showed that 86% were able to
improve their incomes between 2005/06 and 2007 (EPAGRI/CEPA, 2008). A related case study
which monitored the evolution of incomes and productivity on 70 properties over two agricultural
years (2005/06 and 2007/08) found that net farm income rose an incremental 105% in the period,
from R$6,344 to R$12,992. The employment creation element of the KPI was not studied.

3.2.7 Living conditions closely associated with rural poverty were also impacted by the
project. Some 49% of participating families had their houses improved through investments in
physical renovation, household sanitation and/or water supply. Demand for social investments
under the RIF was exceptionally strong; indices of housing conditions, sanitation and water
supply at appraisal explain such demand. Some 55,313 families in 285 municipalities and 851
micro-catchments benefited, 77.5% of which were among the Priority target groups. Sanitation

15
     Using the 936 micro-catchments actually assisted, the result is 61%, about 87% of the appraisal Key Performance Indicator target.



                                                                   13
                                                                                                            16
represented 40% and housing renovation 60% of the R$42.0 million invested. Some 91.4% of
beneficiaries surveyed (EPAGRI/CEPA 2009) said their subproject was successfully
implemented and operational. About 95% expressed a high degree of satisfaction and 92% of
these beneficiaries stated that the project had resolved their most urgent/pressing housing
problems. Benefits reported by beneficiaries included improved health, physical security,
comfort, social relations and environment.

3.2.8 The percentage of Project beneficiaries categorized as below the poverty line declined, a
striking achievement of the project. By end-project, 19.3% of surveyed beneficiaries had
exceeded the income limits for classification in the poorest Priority cohorts and had moved to a
superior level (EPAGRI/CEPA 2009). Key determinants were project investments in training,
technical assistance and rural extension which fostered organization, better productive planning,
soil and water conservation practices, and improved production systems and productivity.
Investments under the Rural Investment Fund (see Annex 2) had a direct impact on incomes and
household living conditions. Annex 3 presents the positive rates of return from economic and
financial analysis of project-financed agro-livestock and forestry activities, as well as non-
agricultural activities, further quantifying the benefits of project participation.

3.2.9 A critical factor was improved agro-livestock productivity which increased an average
24.7% on sampled farm properties via the adoption of sustainable productive practices. A
preliminary final impact evaluation (EPAGRI/CEPA, 2008) analyzed eight representative annual
crops and dairy production investments, finding that productivity had increased an average 24.7%
based on the adoption of sustainable farm systems, soil conservation and NRM practices. Bassi
(2009) found positive but more modest results for five of six crops studied. Productivity increases
ranged from 7.8% (cropped beans) to 24.3% (manioc), with increases averaging 12.7% in the
period 2003-2009.

Objective 3: Reversed land degradation and better protection of the State's natural resources

3.2.10 Moderately high achievement: The project did not measure the extent to which land
degradation was reversed but it is likely to be significant given the scope and scale of
conservation activities financed. Natural resources management practices (water, soil and/or
vegetation) were improved on all 936 project-assisted micro-catchments covering a large
proportion of the State territory. The project financed soil management and conservation
practices on about 263,693 ha, and about 29,000 farmers are now managing their natural
resources more conservatively. Some 59,000 families improved their production systems
consistent with modern environmentally sound practices. Basic sanitation equipment/systems
were financed for 21,700 families, representing 24% of total rural sanitation needs state-wide, and
with important impacts on soil and water quality. Further, 2,306 ha of Riparian Forest (mata
                                                                                  17
ciliar) were re-planted or renovated, and 31,300 water sources were protected. Another 3,500
families regularized and modernized systems for the collection and disposal of pig waste, a
critical environmental issue in Santa Catarina. The project did not scientifically study/measure
effects of project actions on soil loss.


16
   Sanitation: protection of water sources, improved wells, acquisition of water storage equipment/systems, pumps, household
distribution lines, septic tanks and effluent treatment.

17
  Another 14,000 water sources for human consumption were improved through a range of field activities under the Environmental
Education sub-component.



                                                                14
3.2.11 Water quality showed improvement, based on measurement and beneficiary perceptions,
with more intensive action recommended under future operations. Under the rubric of improved
water quality, some 68% of total demand for assistance in the seven micro-catchments
monitored/surveyed (Bassi, 2009) was absorbed by activities to increase vegetation cover,
improve soil filtration capacity, control contamination and control surface water run-off. The
impact of project actions on drinking water quality showed reduction of bacteria in five of the
seven micro-catchments but pollution was not completely eliminated. Heat tolerant bacteria were
reduced in six of the seven micro-catchments and potability improved from 15% to 20% between
2004 and 2009. Further, 34% of monitored properties made environmental improvements likely
to improve water quality; of these, 67% showed reduced concentration of heat-tolerant bacteria
and at 18% of collection points, concentrations were reduced to zero. Water turbidity (an
indicator for soil loss) showed modest improvement, but pH levels were reduced in all micro-
catchments to legal levels for household consumption.

3.2.12 Important natural resource conservation and protection benefits are also likely to emanate
from achievements described in paras. 3.2.3 to 3.2.5 in terms of the State's ability to replicate,
scale up and monitor its environmental strategy state-wide.

Objective 4:          Enhanced local governance and community participation in decision-making

3.2.13 Achieved: By end-project, planned Project participatory mechanisms were operating
effectively at all levels - community, micro-catchment, municipal, regional and State ­
stakeholders having been trained and organized in the first three years, and gaining practical
experience. The pyramid of linked, participatory, deliberative and executive bodies worked well
despite its intricate structure, and beneficiary representation at all levels was maintained at the
minimum 50% to ensure key decisions, priorities and processes were demand-led and governance
was democratic and orderly. In the case of the Micro-catchment Development Associations
(MDA) and Municipal Animation Groups (GAM), evaluation results from the project's
monitoring of 19 micro-catchments (EPAGRI/CEPA 2009) show satisfactory operational levels
with positive opinions of performance in 84% of cases. Some 95% said the decision where to
invest was participatory and democratic, 86% said the investment attended the group's needs and
77% said the investment was governed by joint usage rules.

3.2.14 Social capital was increased as a result of participatory processes, training and
organization, and the experience of selecting, implementing, operating and maintaining an
investment. At the micro-catchment level, EPAGRI/CEPA 2009 showed that family
empowerment reached satisfactory levels in 95% of cases, and social network development was
                          18
good/very good in 74%. Analysis of certain component elements of self-management, in this
case the capacity to work and invest in groups, 65% of beneficiaries surveyed said there had been
an increase in partnerships for group activities within the monitored micro-catchments, improving
inter-personal relationships, cooperation and integration. The Borrower Completion Report states
that project decentralization, and community organization/decision-making, neutralized
opportunities to use project resources as a political bargaining chip. However, the capacity of
MDAs to achieve self-management (i.e., operate autonomously) was found to be a complex and
protracted process not amenable to easy measurement on a broad enough scale or with an
acceptable level of confidence. More work is needed.
18
   The concept of empowerment in this case took into account: representation of stakeholders in the MDAs and/or GAMs; community
participation level; leadership role of youth, women and retirees in project activities; community participation in preparation of Micro-
catchment Development Plans; the project's progress/status at the municipal level; and, power of the community, the MDA and GAM,
to bring facilitators, animators and executing agencies into the project.


                                                                  15
3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 An independent economic analysis by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
shows that the Project was economically and financially viable. The ICR stresses the preliminary
nature of this analysis given the recent land management and farm systems improvements on
many farms/micro-catchments. The outlook is promising, especially under a more intensive,
strategic effort to promote value-added activities and organized group ventures and value chains.
See below and Annex 3.

3.3.2 Economic Analysis: (a) Net Present Value of all agricultural and non-agricultural
activities covered by the analysis is R$884.0 million and the project Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
is a comparatively high 45.1%. By activity, the dairy/tobacco model shows the highest IRR of
99.1%, while the beans/corn/eucalyptus is lowest at 31.6%; and (b) Sensitivity Analysis shows
minimum IRRs of 34% (10% reduction in revenues and increase in costs and NPV about R$300
million lower), 38.8% (10% increase in costs, NPV R$200 million lower)), and 40.4% (10%
reduction in producer revenues, NPV R$135 million lower). The project is considered viable
even if future conditions/scenarios deteriorate.

3.3.3 Financial Analysis: The Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) for the 12 farm
models studied averages 34%, and ranges from 25.2% (Beans, Corn and Eucalyptus) to 43.6%
(Dairy). The Net Present Value of incremental income of the 12 models averages R$22,606,
ranging from R$6,850 to R$45,328 per year. See Annex 3.

3.3.4   The table below summarizes appraisal rate of return expectations and outcomes:

        Rate of Return                   Appraisal                           Actual
 Economic (IERR)                 Range 20% - 30%                   Range 31.6% - 99.1%
 Financial (FIRR)                Range 30% - >50%                  Range 25.2% - 43.6%
 Project                         19%                               45.1%

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1   This rating is based on the following:

    ·   Project objectives were relevant to the needs of poor farmers in micro-catchment areas
        and components were consistent with the PDO, but project design was over-engineered in
        relation to available institutional and human resources capacity and the timetable;
    ·   Even so, the huge effort and commitment of executing agencies saw the project achieve
        most of its objectives and generate significant positive impacts, several of which far-
        exceeded appraisal expectations;
    ·   Promising results were obtained for income generation, poverty reduction, and NRM, and
        sustainability is rated moderate, with the caveat that certain outcomes need more formal
        study/measurement, consolidation, and/or time to mature;
    ·   Sustainability and functionality of community/micro-catchment-level governance bodies
        was satisfactory at closing but variable in some areas, and consolidation is essential;
    ·   The Loan disbursed fully, and economic and financial rates of return on farm models
        studied ­ based on actual project experiences - were positive; and,
    ·   The development priority remains relevant for small farm families in this State, with the
        emphasis now needing to shift to more intensive productive activities, competitiveness,

                                                 16
          leveraging the catalytic effects of better coordination between Federal, State and local
          programs, and close attention to human resource development and availability.

3.4.1 While project implementation was consistently satisfactory during the latter part of
project implementation, producing most of the outputs designed to feed into expected
results/impacts and reaching satisfactory levels for likely achievement of the PDO, explicit and
strict measurement of the broadly-defined Key Performance Indicators ­ as required by the ICR -
was not achieved. Thus, it is more correct procedurally, to rate the project MS rather than the S
shown in the final ISR.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty impacts: The actual/potential impact on poverty reduction is suggested by the
economic and financial results and final evaluation studies of the project's productivity, income
and poverty reduction effects. Broader poverty impacts including on family wellbeing were not
studied in depth, but over 47,000 families benefited from housing improvements. As described
below and in Annex 2, poverty targeting worked well. Further, the management and sustainability
of beneficiary farmers' productive asset - land - was improved along with the general level of
farmer organization and capacity for collective action. Many poor rural families are now better-
positioned to take advantage of more complex productive activities planned under the follow-on
project, and with their micro-catchment and farm development plans - and expected better access
to skilled technical support - have greater potential to absorb and benefit from other Federal and
State programs.

3.5.2 Gender: The Bank team and EPAGRI actively mobilized women's participation in the
MDAs and in training programs. The organizational and participatory methodology itself created
space for women's participation, and they were prominent in seminars and municipal/regional
meetings where their views sustainable development, gender inclusion, and food security were
expressed. Supervision field visits verified women's commitment and presence in project
activities. While not quantified, it is likely that women benefited from improved family income
and other investments such as water supply, sanitation and housing renovation. The project did
not track their direct inclusion as recipients of RIF grants for productive activities. Traditional
patterns tended to prevail; women did the preparation and implementation but male family
members received the RIF funds.

3.5.3    Targeting: The targeting methodology and framework were effective. Targeting
mechanisms were based on socio-economic and environmental indicators with greater weight on
poverty.19 About 78% of all RIF investment grants and 86% of total value went to the Priority
categories. See details, Annex 2.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4 Executing agencies gained valuable experience in a broad range of complex activities. It
was clear by end-project that EPAGRI in particular, had integrated the project strategy as an

19
   The Priority Target Groups were rural poor with a per capita income of less than two minimum wages including families classed as
"marginal" (periferico, with per capita net farm income of < one minimum wage), Transitional 1 (net farm income < one minimum
wage) and indigenous peoples.



                                                               17
instrument of public planning, and was already expanding its use to non-project micro-
catchments. CEPA showed strong ownership of M&E and developed a skilled team of evaluation
professionals which will serve the follow-on project well. BPMA handled its environmental
monitoring role well. However, all project agencies to varying degrees lacked adequate human
resources, field presence/teams and/or structure, which could not be rapidly corrected and needed
longer-term solutions. In the final stages of the project, there was an exodus of technical and
other personnel from these agencies, an issue now being addressed in advance of the new
operation. The project experience also underlined the need to design mechanisms to ensure inter-
institutional coordination and describe them in the Operational Manual. The project avoided the
now-discredited joint coordination body and made impressive gains in inter-agency collaboration,
but by end-project the agencies were still sorting out rational, durable relationships and networks
capable of supporting policies/programs longer-term.20

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.5    Among several unintended, positive outcomes, the following stand out:

    ·    State-wide water resources management systems based on recommendations of the
         State structural adjustment activities and studies. These included the System for Grants
         of Water Usage Rights (outorgas), the State Water Resources Information System and
         completion and institution of a State Census of Water Users.
    ·    Improvement of water for human consumption under the Environmental Education sub-
         component proved a model of community adhesion/cooperation, with 1,595 groups and
         over 19,000 families improving about 14,000 water sources through a range of activities.
    ·    Simple, effective technologies in low cost rural sanitation were developed based on
         project-financed training: eco-composters for organic household waste; rainwater capture
         in low cost steel-reinforced cement cisterns; slow filtration systems for water developed
         by the University of Santa Catarina and now applied state-wide; and, domestic waste-
         water treatment systems using bamboo, adaptable to different farm situations.
    ·    Demonstration, observation, and validation units were financed using a new/separate
         financing window under the Rural Investment Fund, with 80% of the 193 units financed
         focused on income improvement. Diffusion of results is underway, including via internet.
         This proved to be a sound and effective way to include meaningful research in a project
         of this type. The utility and effectiveness of "pre-identified" and 100% scientific research
         - not demand-driven and not demonstrated on the farmer's field - is limited.
    ·    The Alphabet Rainbow Program of the Federal Ministry of Agrarian Development -
         which sets up small community libraries with teaching/reading materials on agriculture,
         citizenship and the environment, was introduced in many micro-catchment communities.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 The project financed several evaluations and case studies, virtually all of which utilize
beneficiary surveys, as well as seminars and workshops, including with indigenous peoples. The
ICR has chosen to refer the reader to Annex 5 where the most important studies/findings are
summarized.


20
   The project was instrumental in modernizing water resources management in Santa Catarina and at closing was
promoting creation of a new water agency with comprehensive responsibilities in the sector.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1.1   This rating is based on the following:

    ·   Institutionalization of a long process of improving natural resources management, farm
        practices and more recently, planning and implementation of rural poverty reduction
        strategies around the micro-catchment management unit;
    ·   Institutional arrangements in place to continue this strategy and improved inter-agency
        collaboration;
    ·   Micro-catchment planning approach was again validated, and stakeholders believe in it;
    ·   Using a physical area (of private land), defined hydrologically as a planning and
        management unit, and continued intention to explore and develop its potential;
    ·   Large investment in quality of life improvements with good sustainability;
    ·   Large investment in small scale, technically simple and financially sustainable productive
        activities;
    ·   Soil conservation practices now inculcated under two projects with good technical
        sustainability and multiplier/spillover effects to rest of the State;
    ·   Very successful Environmental Education program in schools demonstrating
        conservationist vision and practices to young, rural people;
    ·   High proportion of beneficiary farm families increased productivity and incomes and
        have economic incentive to continue applying modern, green practices;
    ·   Efficient use of Bank funds and positive economic and financial rates of return

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.1   This rating is based on the following:
    ·   project design built on a successful micro-catchment approach and technical strategy;
    ·   sought to capitalize on government's burgeoning interest in decentralized, sustainable
        rural poverty reduction based on modern land management technologies;
    ·   reflected lessons of similar operations and the evolving political and social economy;
    ·   consultative, participatory design process including indigenous peoples; and,
    ·   included a well-designed, objective targeting framework to maximize benefits for the
        poorest cohorts consistent with the new, dominant poverty focus.

Balanced by:
   · misjudgment of technical and human resources, and time, needed to implement a project
       of such complexity and scope;
   · under-estimation of the increased difficulty represented by the poverty dimension;
   · vision of productive activity - upon which the poverty reduction strategy depended - too
       sophisticated for poor farmers and available technical resources;
   · evidence of hasty preparation under acute time constraints; and,
   · inadequate design and presentation of the PDO and project outcome indicators.


                                                 19
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2  This rating is based on the following:
    ·  frequency, pro-activity, skills composition and coverage of project supervision missions;
    ·  outstanding quality of supervision reporting, time-bound Action Plans and follow-up;
    ·  sustained attention to M&E, safeguards, problem resolution, fiduciary aspects and
       accountability/oversight (including of RIF subprojects/investments);
   · detailed, repeated analysis/reporting of performance under the Indigenous Peoples Plan;
   · excellent working relationships with project agencies;
   · impressive outcomes despite complexity, due importantly to overall supervision quality.
Balanced by:
   · delayed Mid-term Review leaving inadequate time to fully-implement recommendations
       regarding difficult activities, or to consolidate gains; 21
   · supervision missions might have been stronger catalysts in agencies' efforts to establish
       partnerships to leverage technical and other expertise;
   · unrealistic ratings in the first two years, assigning higher than merited DO value to
       mainly foundational activities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3     This rating balances the following major themes/factors:
    ·     the extent to which accelerated preparation and design flaws in an otherwise conceptually
          and strategically consistent, innovative project hampered its implementation and reduced
          its potential, especially in regard to more complex productive activities; and,
     ·    strong, far-reaching supervision effort by a team intellectually and technically committed
          to the project methodology, to building and maintaining momentum, and to supporting
          the Borrower in maximizing outcomes under difficult circumstances.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1     This rating is based on the following:
    ·     sustained commitment of the State to the project concept and strategy, despite electoral
          turnover and throughout the long interlude between LM II and MB II;
     ·    piloting of the project technical strategy well in advance of project approval;
     ·    internalization of the project strategy as an element of public policy;
     ·    steady counterpart funding performance;
     ·    cooperative, responsive relationship with the Bank team throughout.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


21
   The Bank team maintains that conducting the MTR at its true mid-point ­ around August 2005 ­ would have meant a meaningless
exercise and opened the way to a flood of RIF investment proposals without adequate capacity and organization at the micro-
catchment level to undertake them.



                                                             20
5.2.2  This rating is based on the following:
    ·  massive initial efforts to implement training, organization and mobilization activities,
       exceeding appraisal targets;
   · unusually strong commitment to effective M&E and its institutionalization;
   · flexible approach to expanding the scope/scale of project activities based on results;
   · willingness to adopt the project technical strategy for other, non-project rural activities;
   · progress in internalizing this strategy as a State public policy instrument;
   · excellent performance on targeting of project benefits to the poorest priority cohorts;
   · major unforeseen achievements in State integrated water resources management.
Balanced by:
   · persistent human resource deficiencies ­ especially technical specialists - both at
       headquarters and at decentralized levels and important structural deficits in the Project
       Management Unit (SEE) and other agencies, over time;
   · inadequate oversight by the responsible agency, of quality and performance of facilitators
       contracted by the MDAs, and hasty, superficial organization of MDAs in some regions
       post-MTR, to accelerate lagging implementation;
   · lack of pro-activity in leveraging longer-term and/or expedient partnerships and expertise
       to overcome these deficiencies, particularly affecting progress on the project's more
       complex productive goals. 22

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3     This rating is based on the following:
    ·     Borrower showed sustained support for the project even through electoral change;
    ·     project reflected the State's rural strategy but its willingness to tackle the complex set of
          activities represented by project design was not matched by its institutional capacity;
     ·    even so, the massive effort by agencies to successfully implement the project paid off in
          its many positive achievements;
     ·    Borrower showed unusually firm commitment to developing and institutionalizing strong
          M&E systems, and showed strong ownership of the micro-catchment strategy as a
          management and organizing principle for rural poverty reduction and improved natural
          resources management;
     ·    agencies were not proactive or resourceful enough however, to leverage the additional
          support and build the networks clearly needed, even though by end-project inter-agency
          collaborative arrangements had evolved well beyond initial levels.




6. Lessons Learned
(a)   The micro-catchment approach to planning and implementing natural resources
management and agricultural production goals was further validated, and its potential
22
  The ICR, while critical of this performance, believes project complexity and scope burdened project agencies at all levels, and
human resource issues could not be easily or rapidly overcome.



                                                              21
effectiveness for rural poverty reduction was demonstrated. The micro-catchment has become a
sustainable management unit, and an effective forum for the rural organization and planning
essential for more complex productive and environmental activities. Of equal importance is the
integration function of the micro-catchment plans and individual/group farm and investment
plans as catalysts for both public and private sector resource targeting for poverty reduction in
rural areas.

(b)      Complex, innovative projects of broad scope repeatedly demonstrate that training,
organization and institutional growth occupy at minimum, the first half of the implementation
period. This means calibrating expectations for the more difficult, "hard" activities to a relatively
short, second-half period, and accepting the principle that a follow-on operation will be essential
to deepen and consolidate initial gains. Project design might also intensify complexity over time
based on achievement benchmarks including successful institutional performance at all levels and
analytical evidence of capacity/team-building sufficient to launch specific types of activities.

(c)     Clear, objective targeting parameters and strong institutional commitment to
compliance ensures the poverty focus of such projects. The participatory design of project
targeting, conscious efforts throughout implementation to ensure that Priority categories were
included in all activities - most importantly the Rural Investment Fund ­ and close oversight of
applicants' qualifications for participation, resulted in very high indices of their participation in a
project not, by design, confined only to the Priority groups.

(d)      The capillarity and decentralized managerial structure and quality of an executive
extension agency are critical. Micro-catchment-based projects require a strong presence in the
countryside. They are essentially a local level capacity builder, clearing house for demand,
catalyst to more effective rural policy instruments, and a liaison for the project with local
authorities and stakeholders. Complex tasks assigned to extension workers under the micro-
catchment approach require clear professional criteria for selecting technicians and attention to
training, especially important when responsibility for such services is assigned to municipal
governments and/or community associations. Navarro (2008) recommends the formation of well-
qualified, regional, multi-disciplinary teams with appropriate skills and a strong focus on training.

(e)      Design of a demand-led investment fund with discrete financing windows needs to
reflect the fact that poor rural families will invariably select social investments over economic
or environmental in the first instance. Only when their basic needs such as water supply,
sanitation, electricity and housing are satisfied, will they turn to productive activities, and the
nature of those initial activities in many cases is likely to be consumption-based, not market-
based. Further, tying social capital formation to direct investment support entails a certain degree
of risk that the causative link erodes the pursuit of independent, autonomous development. Target
populations must be informed up front of the objectives of and limits on, project investment
assistance.

(f)      Demonstration, observation, and validation units ­ demand-led under a Rural
Investment Fund - are a sound and effective way to include meaningful research in a project
of this type. The utility and effectiveness of "pre-identified" and 100% scientific research - not
demand-driven and not demonstrated on the farmer's field - is limited, as was also learned from
the similar Sao Paulo Land Management III Project.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component 24
2.1      Drawing on project Aide Memoires and the Borrower Completion Report (Epagri/CEPA,
2009), the following summarizes experiences/highlights under individual components and sub-
components. Poverty targeting intentions are described below. Table 2.2 shows main output
targets as revised post-Mid-term Review and achievements by end-project.

Targeting:

2.2     The overall target population was an estimated 105,000 small and marginal farmers and
rural laborers, and about 5,000 indigenous peoples residing in 880 micro-catchments (an
estimated 3.6 million ha) out of Santa Catarina's 1,683 total micro-catchments. The Priority target
population from among this population consisted of: (a) rural poor with per capita net income of
less than two minimum wages including those classified as "Marginal" (periferico ­ with per
capita net farm income of less than one minimum wage), "Transitional type 1" (with per capita
net farm income of less than two minimum wages) and Indigenous Peoples (IP). Although the
target group was the poorest segment of the population in those areas (about 80,000 poor rural
families including indigenous families, i.e., 75% of families to be benefited by the project), the
project sought the participation of all members of the micro-catchment, especially for
environmental activities.

2.3     Targeting, as mentioned in Main Text 2.2.4, was hampered by delayed completion of the
Municipal Agro-livestock Census (LAC). An alternative strategy was devised, adhering to the
principles set down in the Operational Manual and using municipal data and involving local
communities in the selection and prioritization of micro-catchments. Upon completion in 2005,
the LAC was found to have certain data limitations. It was used mostly to supplement municipal
and micro-catchment diagnoses.

Component 1: Institutional Development and Organization (US$19.9 m., 16.7% of total
project cost)

2.4      Training Sub-component: This financed the preparation of implementers and
beneficiaries for behavioral changes and new practices implied by the technical strategy, e.g.
participatory rural diagnosis, group formation and operation, participatory planning and
stakeholder monitoring, complemented by practical/technical courses in sustainable land
management, production diversification and agro-processing. Some 92,000 stakeholders,
including small farmers, indigenous peoples, rural workers and private extension workers were to
be trained.

2.5     Implementation: The project trained about 153,000 stakeholders by closing, 166% of the
original target and 94.5% of the new target set post-MTR. Of these over 96,000 were farmers.
Training programs were repeatedly re-tooled and updated to maintain relevance but experienced
certain difficulties including: the uneven quality and content of training; overlap with other
organizations offering training to the same public; training needed to be more strategic in
conforming to a narrower set of critical "lines"; and it would have benefited from more

24
   Numerous changes were made to output indicators following the Mid-term Review. Original targets are in the PAD,
Annex 2 but are not shown here due to the complexity of eliminations, additions and substantive changes.


                                                       25
aggressive pursuit of partnerships with other state and federal institutions such as the Service for
Support of Small and Micro Business (SEBRAE), SENAR and the Ministry of Agrarian
Development (MDA). Even so, the sub-component met or exceeded most of its post-MTR
revised targets.

>>Final cost was US$3.24 million, 70.4% of appraisal.

2.6     Environmental Education Sub-component: This financed education programs to help
develop an environmentally conscious society and boost stakeholder awareness of the connection
between environmental problems and rural/non-rural livelihoods. The target population plus
about 14,650 leaders were to be reached. Some 1,000 environmental teaching projects were also
to be financed to allow schools within the beneficiary micro-catchment areas to comply with
Federal laws on environmental teaching.

2.7     Implementation: This was an especially successful set of activities - coordinated by
EPAGRI - which greatly exceeded many of its original and post-MTR targets, reaching 122,000
students/beneficiaries in 3,796 schools via some 1,128 educational events. It was organized under
three activity lines: (a) Rural Extension to schools and rural families in environmental sanitation
and innovative environmental technologies; (b) Community Mobilization and Art; and (c)
Environmental Law and Production of Teaching Materials.

2.8       The sub-component was notable for the following:

      ·   High levels of participation achieved and for its success in promoting innovative, low
          cost technologies for improving water quality for human consumption.
      ·   The technical strategy was well-designed and its implementation was problem-free.
          Features of the strategy included good local leadership, organized activities, collaboration
          teams and consistent participation of families, schools and technicians.
      ·   Partnerships were another key feature: networks of people, institutions and communities
          informally linked.
      ·   Flexibility with which it was executed, via expansion of activities and revision of targets.
      ·   The performance of farmers, indigenous groups and schools was well beyond initial
          expectations, as was the involvement of youth and women.

2.9      Initial slow implementation of this sub-component was caused by the Bank requirement
that all expenses even the smallest, be subject to three quotes making many activities non-viable.
The issue was overcome by the State Government assuming full responsibility for expenditures.

2.10    The main challenge was staffing and developing multi-disciplinary teams (a common
aspect of the project) to cover the wide reach of sub-component activities.

>>Total cost of the sub-component was US$1.02 million, 90.2% of appraisal.

2.11    Rural Extension Sub-component: This financed promotion of the project among the
target rural poor through information provision, support for group formation, assisting
preparation of micro-catchment and farm plans, and assembling community demands for social,
technical and financial support. Providers of technical and social assistance at the micro-
catchment, municipal and regional levels would be trained. Some 440 "facilitators" would be
contracted and paid by the Micro-catchment Development Associations (MDA) to support
demand-led participatory planning and implementation at the community level. EPAGRI

                                                  26
extension workers ("animators" at the municipal level and technicians at regional level) would
back up the facilitators, the latter responsible for helping farmers prepare 880 (changed to 936)
micro-catchment and about 70,000 individual farm plans.

2.12     Implementation: This was a complex set of activities which fully achieved the vast
majority of its post-MTR targets and reinstated the prestige and effectiveness of rural extension -
and EPAGRI's primary role - following decades of neglect. However, the breadth of sub-
component activities and geographic coverage was wide and encountered problems in the uneven
quality and composition of field teams.

2.13     The facilitators were contracted by the Micro-catchment Development Associations
(MDA) from a cooperative pool of technical professionals and were paid directly by them.
Although EPAGRI conducted oversight of the list of available professionals for this service, to
some extent its relationship was arms length: facilitators were of uneven quality, professional
qualifications were not standardized, and their numbers proliferated. Facilitators became overly
involved in the preparation of proposals for the Rural Investment Fund; attention to micro-
catchments tended not to differentiate messages between the more and less advanced; and,
technical and political problems were associated with the large number of facilitators contracted
by the micro-catchments. Even so, as additional micro-catchments opened up, manpower
shortages became acute in some areas. At end-project, facilitators were reluctant to disband.
While surveys reveal that the communities had become quite dependent on them to convey
demands and resolve problems, their associations were not willing to pay for their services. The
situation has become somewhat politicized since closing. The new project in Santa Catarina will
not finance facilitators.

2.14    The MTR made a set of technical and organizational recommendations including re-
aligning ATER activities to focus on prominent lines of action more oriented to production, to
fostering the project's integration with other programs and sources of financing, and that the
quality and content of Individual Farm Plans be greatly improved. The extent to which this was
implemented is not known.

>>Total cost of the sub-component was US$5.70 million, 95.5% of appraisal.

2.15    Adaptive and Social Research Sub-component: This financed a planned 340 technical
and socio-economic adaptive research projects through a competitive process administered by a
State Research Committee, with 50% membership of beneficiary representatives and 50% of
partners/stakeholders such as NGOs, academic institutions, the scientific community, the
Brazilian Agro-livestock Research Company (EMBRAPA), and EPAGRI, as peer reviewers. This
committee managed research already identified but not yet underway. A Regional Research
Committee performed a similar function at a decentralized level. It would also finance the
municipal agro-livestock census (LAC) designed as the basis for municipal diagnoses, and the
maps needed for the micro-catchment development plans.

2.16     Implementation: This was a successful sub-component with important products: the
completed Santa Catarina Agro-livestock Census; mapping of all 936 involved micro-catchments;
and a large number of research activities completed. Most of the studies were conducted by
EPAGRI and the State University of Santa Catarina, with partners. So-called unidentified
studies, i.e. newly-initiated as opposed to already underway, were based on the Micro-catchment
Development Plans and were conducted by universities, EPAGRI, NGOs, and with community



                                                27
participation. Post-MTR, financing of agro-livestock demonstration plots was transferred to the
Rural Investment Fund, generating important lessons (see Section 6).

>>Total cost of the sub-component was US$2.71 million, 59% of appraisal.

2.17    Technical Assistance Sub-component supporting State Structural Adjustment: This
financed special studies and consultant services to support State structural adjustment efforts and
to be executed by the Governor's office. Studies planned are described in table below. 25 Studies
were to be submitted to the Bank one year after effectiveness to discuss findings and a
dissemination strategy

2.18    Implementation: This sub-component was very successful and had unexpectedly far-
reaching implications. Financed were a Water Resources Management Study, Water and
Drainage Sector Study, and the Electricity Sector Restructuring Study.

2.19     Recommendations of the Water Resources Management Study led to the creation of the
Water Resources Information System (SIRHESC, www.aguas.sc.giv.br) cited as a national
reference model by the National Water Agency (ANA). The system has been replicated by the
State of Rio Grande do Sul and represents a major achievement by the Secretariat of Sustainable
Development (SDS) which closely supervised the study and follow-up. This study also resulted in
the system for Grants of Water Usage Rights (outorgas), and the State Census of Water Users.

2.20    The Water and Sanitation Study was presented at a seminar and was seen as the basis for
a complete restructuring of the sector, which was at the time threatening to affect the State's
competitiveness in tourism and agro-industry. This study, along with passage of Laws 13.517
and 13.557 (Sanitation Policy and Solid Waste, respectively), was intended to constitute the legal
structure for sector modernization. Study recommendations were incorporated in state policies
and structures for water and sanitation.

2.21    Finally, at closing, discussions were underway to further expand the influence of these
studies to the creation of a dominant water resources management institution and to a major
expansion of human resources in the water sector which was seriously prejudiced by inadequate
technical and operational manpower.

>>Total cost of the sub-component was US$1.59 million, 103.2% of appraisal

Component 2: Rural Investment (US$77.2 million, 72.3% of total project cost)

2.22    The Rural Investment Fund (RIF) was designed to promote adoption of the project
strategy within the benefited micro-catchment with cost ceilings per type of beneficiary, micro-
catchment and type of activity being promoted.26 The RIF initially financed three categories of
demand-led grants: (i) home improvements (sanitation, piped water, waste disposal and minor
structural improvements (available only to the poorest of the targeted cohorts); (ii) conservation
and environmental purposes (re-forestation, protection of water sources, or schemes to increase
bio-diversity, available to all farmers but with preference to poorer); and (iii) income generation
(improved production systems, value-added schemes, or job creation (available to poorer farmers
and landless laborers, and to other farmers only when in association with at least 66% of the
target population but with a lower-cost share of grant contribution). The RIF was the
responsibility of the State executive Secretariat through its Rural Investment Management Unt.

2.23     Following the Mid-term Review, two other lines were added: investments to benefit
youth, and to establish demonstration, validation and observation plots to test productive
alternatives. Use of grants was to be demand-led, and linked to micro-catchment development
plans, individual plans and indigenous plans. Grants could also be used to repair critical stretches
of rural roads, and to finance technical assistance for preparation and implementation of the
above plans.

2.24    Implementation: Investments under this fund were based on Micro-catchment
Development Plans and individual agro-livestock properties. Technical proposals were prepared
using funds for payment of technical assistance financed by the RIF, and included an
environmental impact assessment. Overall, investments were 102.6% of the Loan allocation
(US$55.82 million) and close to 89% of the total Loan. Beneficiaries invested from own funds an
additional R$43.95 million (31.3%). The RIF served 129,539 farm families among the three main
lines and supported 936 associations to implement key parts of their Micro-catchment
Development Plans.

    ·    Total value estimated at appraisal for the income generation line of investments was
         US$17.3 million. Actual investments were some 15% higher. Individual, group and
         community proposals were registered totaling 34,540.
    ·    Some 89% of all beneficiaries of this line were part of the project's priority, targeted
         cohorts: 50% were in the Transition 1 group, another 35% were in the Peripheral group
         and 2% were indigenous peoples.
    ·    Some 83% of all proposals were individual, reaching 29,493 beneficiaries. Groups
         constituted 16% of total proposals but reached 43,453 beneficiaries (about 8 persons per
         group), and community proposals were about 1%.
    ·    Sampling exercises by fiduciary oversight teams verified that 99% of proposals were
         correctly financed without issues concerning the application of funds.

26
   The project Rural Investment Fund (RIF) functioned as a special program under the existing State Rural
Development Fund, which in turn operated under the incentive legislation enacted under the previous project.


                                                    29
2.25     Certain changes were made: (a) The allowable limit of R$500 per individual beneficiary
for water supply investments was replaced in 2004 by group/community proposals with a limit of
R$40,000 and 80% financing by the RIF; (b) to promote re-planting of Riparian Forest and
conservation re-forestation, in 2005, up to R$2,000 per hectare/per producer could be financed;
(c) as a drought mitigation measure, construction of cisterns started in 2006, to a limit of R$1,500
per family with the RIF financing 80%; (d) rural youth became part of the priority public for RIF
investments; and, (e) financing of agro-livestock demonstration plots was moved from the
Research and Studies sub-component to the RIF.

2.26    As noted in the Main Text, the technical demands of the Income Improvement line of
investments exceeded the capacity of both headquarters and field teams, and even when
investments under this window accelerated around the time of the MTR, they were mostly small-
scale and individual, not group, with little market insertion or sophistication ­ certainly not the
types of activities and arrangements contemplated by the PAD. Table 2.4 below shows under
Component 4 (Project Management), that no Specialist Consultants were contracted for activities
under "markets" or "business administration". Further, as noted by the Borrower Completion
Report, initial implementation delays and slow disbursement exerted pressure on stakeholders to
accelerate project activities, especially the RIF. This had negative results in some regions, causing
the essential diagnostic, planning and social capital formation stages to be short-circuited in the
organization of many MDAs, in certain regions and at that time, so that the facilitators could be
contracted and RIF proposals increased.

  Values in end-project Reais (US$1.00 to R$1.7698); at appraisal rates of US$1.00 to R$2.43, amounts would be
respectively, R$18.47 million (Housing Improvement), R$48.84 million (Natural Resources), R$73.87 million (Income
Improvement), and R$46.41 million (Technical Assistance). Total is R$187.59 million.

Component 3: Environmental Management (US$3.8 million, 3.5% of total project
cost)

2.27    Watershed Management Sub-component financed expansion of the State's efforts to
integrate environmental and river basin management policies and laws, and the preparation and
implementation of three river-basin sub-catchment plans with selection criteria established for the
watersheds and sub-catchments. Two selected watersheds had significant biodiversity value and
hence would be the basis for identification of ecological corridors.

2.28     Implementation: Implementation was fully satisfactory. Three Strategic River Basin
Plans for Integrated Management of Water Resources were developed for the Chapeco, Timbo
and Jacutinga river catchment areas, and subsequently for all major catchments state-wide. A
Census of Water Users was completed for each catchment (also extended to the rest of the state),
administrative premises were established on site in each case and FATMA's institutional and
human resources capacity to conduct integrated management of water catchment areas was
improved through specialized training. Further, the Water Resources Information System
(SIRHESC) and System for Grants for Water Usage Rights, stemming from the project's
structural adjustment activities/studies, further boosted the State's capacity to integrate
environmental and social sustainability into development and poverty reduction strategies, and to
institutionalize river basin management policies and laws.

>>Total cost of the sub-component was US$1.62 million, 71% of appraisal

2.29    Ecological Corridors and Protected Areas Sub-component financed creation of
ecological corridors and protected areas, and would oversee regulation and
dissemination/application of the newly-enacted State Protected Areas (PA) System law and the
Ecological ICMS Law (expected to be enacted). One existing state park would be consolidated.
New public and private PAs would be promoted and two ecological corridors would be
consolidated. Component implementation would be coordinated by FATMA and SDM which
would work with EPAGRI, NGOs, municipalities, stakeholder associations and other entities, and
implementation would be overseen by an environmental specialist.

2.30    Implementation: This challenging sub-component was fully implemented based on post-
MTR review of what could be achieved. Planning models for Ecological Corridors and integrated
water catchment management were developed and validated for the Ecological Corridors of the
Chapeco and Timbo River Basins, and innovative macro-strategies for their socio-economic
development were designed under which the natural forest/landscape would constitute strategic
planning units and the micro-catchments, operational planning units. FATMA technicians were
trained on themes related to corridor maintenance and management. Full implementation of the
two corridors is expected under the planned new rural competitiveness operation.

2.31   Consolidation of the Rio Tabuleiro State Park made satisfactory progress. Stakeholders
were mobilized, a headquarters/visitors building was installed, a thematic center was built,
personnel were contracted and teaching materials produced.

2.32    The Ecological ICMS (Tax on the Circulation of Markets and Services) Law was enacted
and the State Protected Areas Law (SEUC) was regulated and systems established.

>>Total cost of the sub-component was US$1.14 million, 78% of appraisal


                                                32
Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$8.0 million,
7.5% total project cost)

2.33    Project Management Sub-component financed establishment and operation of the
Project Management Unit (PMU) at state level and 14 subsidiary units at regional levels.
Regional units were executive arms for stakeholder bodies responsible for participatory planning,
decision-making and oversight of implementation at all levels.

2.34     Implementation: This sub-component was fully-implemented as evidenced by the large
body of significant social, economic and environmental results available at closing and scale of
community organization. The micro-catchment planning and training period, i.e., the preparatory
phase, took far longer than estimated at appraisal due to the overall level of difficulty and number
of activities moving forward simultaneously. Project management encountered difficulties - as
revealed by the MTR - due to the State Executive Secretariat (SEE) not being structured as per
the Operational Manual, and a deterioration of the decentralized coordination units which
impacted on the quality of managerial oversight and supervision of the project's activities in the
year preceding the 2006 elections. In the project's final stages, there was an erosion of the
project's management team in SEE, and in the Regional and Municipal Secretariats. Technical
and other staff in key project agencies, anticipating potential changes following closing and/or
under a new project left the project. The issue of SEE's structure persisted through to closing.
Preparation of the new SWAp operation is addressing these weaknesses.

>>Total cost of the sub-component was US$4.16 million, 144.4% of appraisal

2.35     Monitoring and Evaluation Sub-component financed project monitoring, evaluation
and distribution of project results and impacts. An automated, comprehensive Management
Information System (MIS) was to be based on the system already established under the previous
project. Monitoring of the Rural Investment component was to be generally more intensive given
that it constituted the bulk of project expenditures. This sub-component would also support
continuous monitoring of socio-economic and environmental aspects in pilot micro-catchments.
Project impact evaluations would also be financed ­ ex ante (Year 1), mid-term (Year 3) and ex-
post (Year 6).

2.36    Implementation: The project delivered all required evaluation reports and case studies
but timeliness was an issue and this may also have been related to the ambitiousness of the
program which inter alia, included three full evaluations. The baseline planned for end-Year 1
was not completed until 2005. The Mid-term Review was expected to produce an evaluation and
performance progress review but the former was seriously delayed and became a preliminary
final evaluation (EPAGRI/CEPA 2008). The actual final evaluation (EPAGRI/CEPA 2009) was
not fully compiled at closing - although all data and information had been collected - and was
released in its component parts, some as summaries of planned future content. Quality was
variable. See Annex 9.

2.37    As described in the Main Text, concerns within EPAGRI/CEPA and on the part of an
FAO monitoring and evaluation specialist, that the original project indicators were inadequate in
type and quality, led to changes in the Key Performance Indicators and the addition of many new
output indicators. The Operational Manual was not revised to record/formalize these changes.
The quality and measurability of the revised indicators was improved but not optimal and linkage
to the PDO was unclear in some cases.


                                                33
2.38    Due to initial flaws in the formulation and presentation of the appraisal Design Summary
(Marco Logico) which were never corrected, project reports/evaluations show some confusion as
to what was meant to be monitored and between project outcomes (the Key Performance
Indicators) and outputs.

2.39    The project established a very good quality Management Information System (MIS)
which evolved over time and effectively monitored the project's physical and financial progress.
Analysis of the MIS by the MTR led to its further improvement and the system was judged fully
capable of monitoring the planned new project.

>> The final cost of the sub-component was US$1.55 million, 59% of appraisal.

2.40     Community Organization Sub-component financed separate resources for the creation
and operation of all stakeholder bodies, supporting day to day operations and meetings of a
planned 880 MDAs, 293 municipal-level deliberative bodies, 14 regional deliberative bodies and
a state-level deliberative committee.

2.41    Implementation: All planned deliberative bodies were established and trained. The
number of regional secretariats rose to 20 following government changeover in 2003 and a re-
configuration of the project's decentralized structure in the regions. The number of micro-
catchments covered by the project also expanded to 936 as did the number of MDAs and GAMs.
Evaluation analysis found that the deliberative framework needed strengthening, having become a
more consultative approach over time.

>>Total cost of the sub-component was US$2.33 million, 91.4% of appraisal

Project Mid-term Review

2.42    The Mid-term Review was of high quality and influential but its late scheduling (end-
2006 versus the actual mid-point, April 2005) limited the time available for important second-half
course corrections.28 However, the MTR also coincided with an electoral turnover giving the
Bank team the opportunity to explain the project and secure direct assurances of commitment
from the incoming governor and senior authorities on budget, maintenance of experienced
technical staff and other issues. The MTR comprised a Bank mission with appropriate specialists
including safeguards, environment, financial management and procurement; an independent
performance review (FEALQ/USP, 2006)29 utilizing interviews with 10 diverse focal groups of
stakeholders; a strategic planning seminar with members of these groups and, an operational
planning seminar with principal project executors.

2.43     At the time, disbursements were about US$20 million with the emphasis on
institutional/human development and on housing rehabilitation. Income-generating investments
under the RIF were still modest. Physical results at the time showed a high proportion of targets
already met or exceeded despite modest expenditures, indicating the possibility that costs may
have been over-estimated and/or targets under-estimated at appraisal, as well as the fact that the

   As noted elsewhere, a timely MTR in April 2005 would have left 32 months to the planned closing date, to complete and
consolidate pending activities/situations.

more sophisticated, higher cost and difficult activities were still to come, i.e., productive
investments under the Income Improvement window of the RIF.

2.44       The performance study (FEALQ/USP, 2006):

       ·    highlighted the economic, social and environmental gains already made by beneficiaries
            in over 900 micro-catchments, and their potential to reduce out-migration;
       ·    praised the project's institutional impact on reclaiming the status of technical assistance
            and rural extension services - via the improved technical structure of EPAGRI;
       ·    stressed the links between local teams'/technicians' capacity to understand and explain
            the project's strategic and productive "vision" to family farmers and the efficiency and
            success of its implementation;30
       ·    re-confirmed the relevance and adequacy of project objectives and the decentralized
            structure/instruments including facilitators and animators for human capital formation;
       ·    noted the tendency of extension technicians to over-emphasize the group development
            ethic over the individual/family, at the expense of training beneficiaries in better
            farm/commercial management and fostering their competitiveness as an individual
            business enterprise;31 and,
       ·    was sceptical of the project's goal of having poor beneficiaries pay - even partially - for
            extension services, when wealthier farmers were receiving this service free, and of
            extension messages rejected by ageing producers for promoting intensive agriculture in a
            countryside steadily losing (young) labour; and,
       ·   criticised a tendency for extension technicians and facilitators to promote organic and
            agro-ecological agriculture as a technological panacea for guaranteeing sustainable
            production on most small farms, without regard for the sophisticated requirements for
            producing and marketing such products, their higher costs of production compared to
            conventional agriculture, and their labour requirements in a countryside steadily losing
            young workers; and,
       ·    called for focused efforts to include rural youth in project activities.

2.45       Recommendations:

       ·    extension of the closing date to improve the long-term sustainability of community self-
            management, and institutionalization of the project technical strategy;
       ·    formal strategies for engaging rural youth and for utilizing the project's capacity to
            concentrate demand for and access to other public programs;
       ·    much greater emphasis on income generation and environmental investments; and
       ·    improvement in the managerial structure at all levels, and improved training focusing on
            professional and managerial skills, market identification and productive alternatives.




30
   The study also mentions a tendency for extension technicians and facilitators to promote organic and agro-ecological agriculture as
a technological panacea for guaranteeing sustainable production on most small farms without regard to the sophisticated requirements
for producing and marketing such products, their higher costs of production compared to conventional agriculture, and their labor
requirements in a countryside steadily losing young workers.

31
  Ironically, by end-project, a high proportion of productive investments were individual not group, but not because of the MTR's
recommendations but rather that it was easier to work with individuals than try to build viable group activities.

   This table reflects the project's monitoring of output indicators/targets in PAD Annex 1 Project Design Summary,
PAD Annex 2, Appendix 2 Implementation Performance Indicators, and a series of new targets added post-MTR
because they were already being monitored by the project. The PAD contained some 42 output indicators, increased
post-MTR to 126. Due to the sheer volume of changes made, the ICR has not attempted to show the appraisal originals
vis a vis adjusted/added indicators.

  The Study of Instruments for the Management of Water Resources, concluded in 2006, enabled the implementation
of the Water Resources Information System, System for the Grant of Water Usage Rights, and the Census of Water
Users. The three studies supported by the Bank: (i) Planning for the Water and Sanitation/Drainage Sector; (ii) Support
Program for the Sanitation and Supply System; (iii) Structure for the Provision of Services for Water Supply and
Sanitation/Drainage were concluded in the first quarter of 2007. Through these studies, legislative proposals were
prepared for Water and Drainage, and Solid Waste, which were approved by the State Legislature and became Laws 13
517/05 and 13 557/05 respectively.

Appendix 1: Key Performance Indicators, Enhanced Measurement Framework and Achievement at End-project

As stated in the Main Text, Section 1.2, the EPAGRI/CEPA monitoring and evaluation team, the Bank project team and an M&E specialist from
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), agreed that the clarity and measurement of the approved Key Performance Indicators (KPI) could
be improved and deepened by a set of "sub-indicators" which would look at each KPI from several angles. With few exceptions, the corresponding
M&E exercises provided a rich cache of complementary data/information. The framework is shown below. Results are reported in the Data Sheet
and the Main Text, section 3.2.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Introduction

3.1     The purpose of this exercise is an economic analysis focusing on project investments and,
as a complement, to evaluate the economic viability of agro-livestock and forestry production
models and the value-added (non-agricultural) represented by the productive activities of project
beneficiaries.

Methodology

3.2     There are a series of instruments and methodologies for economic analysis as a support to
decision-making, but due to limited data and time, it was decided to use as analytical instruments
four widely-accepted concepts: gross margin for the activity; net present value, internal rate of
return and simulation of scenarios. Gross margin means the gross returns over sales, indicating
the surplus over sales after payment of operational expenses.

3.3      The net present value or NPV seeks to evaluate the viability of an investment project by
calculating the real value of all its cash flows, a frequently-used indicator in studies analyzing the
economic viability of projects. The internal rate of return or TIR represents the profitability
generated by a certain investment (also frequently-used as one of the key indicators in studies
analyzing project viability), that is, it represents a rate of interest which, if the capital invested
had been placed at this rate, exactly the same final rate of profitability would have been obtained.
In other words, it represents a rate which is utilized as a discount rate, making the NPV equal to
zero.

3.4      In constructing the cash flow, receipts are considered the entry point, representing the
sum of the quantities produced times the average market price of the products, while the exit
point is the value of the variable cost which represents a sum of the value of disbursements with
inputs, plus the estimated value of labor, because project beneficiaries are characterized by their
labor being - typically - family-based. While the value of the investment was considered as the
project support for each beneficiary, that is, the average value of Rural Investment Fund support,
eventual additional support needed in the form of investments in the activity, were not taken into
account.

3.5      In the case of simulation of parameters, likely, simply-prepared scenarios were proposed.
For this, prices were taken as a critical variable ­ products and inputs ­ represented by the value
of the cost of production. In assembling the scenarios, pessimistic and optimistic situations were
defined. In the pessimistic case, receipts were reduced 10% or costs increased 10%; in the
optimistic case receipts increased 10% or costs decreased by the same amount. It is important o
note that this is a very simple simulation, changing just one or two variables each time.

3.6     The economic analysis was conducted considering three levels of evaluation: (a) each
individual activity, and evaluating the profitability of the crop, that is, how much it contributed to
the farmer's income per unit of production, in this case per hectare; (b) in the second case,
production models were analyzed representing a group of agricultural activities comprising each
productive system within a region, and non-agricultural, income-generating activities most
representative of the group of beneficiaries supported by the project; and, (c) finally, the project


                                                 42
as a whole was analyzed, that is, the full cohort of models of properties and activities, agricultural
or otherwise, taking into consideration the public to be benefited and actual project investments.

Material utilized

3.7     All information utilized in this analysis was provided by technicians involved in the
coordination or execution of the project, through documents or interviews. Data about
investments were considered as total project values, both Bank contribution and State counterpart
resources.

3.8      Total project investments were expected to be US$67.5 million or R$162.0 million,
converted at the time of project appraisal using a dollar equivalent to two Reais and 40 centavos
(US$1.00 = R$2.40), and taking into account physical and price contingencies. In the financing
timetable for implementation, the following distribution was projected: 31% in Year 1, 33% Year
2, and 37% in the final year.35 Of the total projected financing, 77% was destined for direct
financial support to beneficiaries, with a portion invested in the social area, for housing
improvement. For support to productive, income-generating activities, whether agro-livestock,
forestry or agro-industry, a total investment of R$110.0 m. was envisaged. Taking into account
that the project foresaw attending some 40,000 beneficiaries with financing, the average financing
per beneficiary was to be R$2,750. Notably, it was assumed that the beneficiaries would bring
other resources to the investment activities ­ agro-livestock and forestry - either their own or
borrowed (e.g., PRONAF) and equivalent in value to the grant received from the project.

3.9     On the other hand, project receipts or profits were used as estimates for what was
received by beneficiaries from agricultural and non-agricultural activities resulting from support
for income improvements. It is known that there were returns on social and indirect investments,
but what was difficult to measure was quantifying only the returns on productive activities.

3.10     Specifically, data and information on activities for the analysis of models of typical
properties or production systems of project beneficiaries were obtained based on farm property
monitoring conducted by EPAGRI. From a sample of 250 observations only those activities with
greater representativeness were selected.

3.11     The choice of nine productive activities most commonly selected by beneficiaries and
representing over 85% of all activities, was based on socio-economic monitoring of the project,
and in this way they were most representative of the productive systems of potential beneficiaries,
as shown in the following table. Livestock raising for dairy production, grains represented by
corn and beans, tobacco (shed and hot-house), onions (horticulture), banana (fruticulture),
manioc, palm and eucalyptus (most representative of forestry activities).

3.12    Property models were also selected based on models prepared for the economic analysis
of the project in 2003, only excluding two models from the west of the state. Twelve property
models were identified representing agro-livestock and forestry productive systems of project
beneficiaries, comprising three for the Western region, four for the Plateau, and five representing
the coastal plains, as described below.

3.13    The definition of what income-generating activities would be part of this study was
decided during a meeting with the Management and Markets team in April 2009, in the
Municipality of Concordia. Data and information demanded for the analysis of models (systems)
of income-generating activities were obtained from EPAGRI specialists in this area. The study
team opted to present the surveys of agro-industries in the regions of Joinville and Concordia,
since there was no detailed survey for the entire State.

3.14    Agro-industries were selected which had received technical assistance from EPAGRI and
represented around 50% of total observations: (a) derivatives of sugar cane; (b) honey processing;
(c) bakery; (d) minimally-processed vegetables, as per tables attached.



                                                               44
3.15    The number of beneficiaries attended by the project was estimated taking into account the
following parameters: the timetable for project support and the production models proposed
according to regions of action.

3.16     As previously stated, the Project also supported non-agricultural income-generating
activities, and the criteria for distribution of beneficiaries attended were the same as agricultural
and forestry productive activities, the project financial timetable, and activities to be supported. It
merits observation that the number of beneficiaries attended with these activities is with
repetition, that is, those to be included in the 40,000 project beneficiaries are from the same
public attended.

Analysis

3.17    Before examining the results of the economic analysis it should be clarified that this
analysis is incremental, due to the characteristics of the project, because it proposed to make
interventions involving farmers who were already established whether in productive and
environmental activities or in social. However, the objective here is to measure the additional
gains due to project investments. In this way, all analyses take into account incremental values,
whether costs or earnings, in the activities analyzed.



                                                  45
3.18     It should be noted that it is not an objective of this evaluation to analyze the
characteristics and circumstances which brought these crops and activities to have greater or
lesser returns, such as market risk, complexity of the productive process, among others, but only
to indicate that the greater the value of the margin of the activity, the greater will be the positive
contribution of the crop in the evaluation indicators (internal rate of return and net present value)
of the project.

Activities

3.19    Comparing the gross margin, in absolute terms, between the activities, three bands of
value can be seen: (a) those with margins exceeding R$1,000 per unit (ha) and time (year),
notably onions, tobacco (both types), and palmito (Palm Hearts). In an intermediate band,
between R$1,000 and R$600 are located dairy production and banana. Finally, below R$600 are
corn, manioc, eucalyptus and beans. In regard to margins in relative terms, which represent the
profitability of the activity, due to the greater risk of losses, two major groups are observed: one
with indices above 50% and those below this value. The most notable in the top group is Palm
Hearts at 76%, while beans show the smallest relative margin of just 30%.

3.20    From the analysis of non-agricultural income-generating activities, a very similar pattern
can be seen, both at the absolute and relative margins, with values of around R$ 45,000 per year.
Only in agro-industry for processed vegetables does one see a return above R$60,000 per year,
representing a margin of about one-third more than the other agro-industries. In relative terms
also, one observes two groups of those situated around 20% and one with a relative margin of
about 11% - honey processing ­ and more subject to risks.

3.21 Looking at 12 production models of typical beneficiary properties, taking the full range
of agricultural, livestock and forestry activities into account for each of the project regions, one
can analyze: the marginal outcome of the property as a whole, net present value and the
economic and financial internal rate of return, the latter taking into account - in net cash flow
terms - the value of financing of production of these activities.

Production models

3.22    Analyzing the gross margins of these models one can observe a great variation in values,
as shown in the following table, averaging around R$5,000 per year, with the smallest value of
R$2,052/year in Model 1 in the West and Plateau regions (the same model), and the greatest
value being the property 4 model in Plateau region with a margin of R$9,599/year. In the other
models which are above the average there is a margin of around R$6,500/year, while those below
the average have a gross margin of around R$3,000/year.

3.23     Values for the internal rate of return are quite high, with the average being 59.5%, but
varying 40 points above this and about 30 points below. What could partly explain this high
return is the low value appropriated from the investments in the activities and properties, such
that the amount considered as the investment was the average value of project support, and the
optimistic/positive estimates of revenues and expenditures.

3.24   The net present value of the models also shows great variation, with a difference of about
R$48,000 during the useful life of the project of 20 years. As there is a direct relationship
between the internal rate of return and the net present value, the high values could be justified by
the same explanations used earlier.

3.25   In regard to the IRR and NPV of the financial analysis, as stated earlier, it takes into
account the value of the financing of productive activities. It is easy to perceive that when the
IRR and NPV decline, the greater the need for financing of that activity.

3.26     Looking at the indicators of results from the analysis of investments in income-generating
activities, one can also see big differences within the project of an activity with a rate of return of
66.3% (vegetable processing), which is around double the verified rate for the production of cane
derivatives (33.2%). Even so, it is worth mentioning that even so this is very attractive due to the
opportunity cost of 12%.

3.27    In the financial analysis of these activities, those considered the flow of financing, it can
be seen that all show a significant fall in the results, most notably for the honey processing
subproject which becomes non-viable with an IRR less than the opportunity cost.

3.28    A parameter used frequently for decision-making about investments is the "pay back"
which is nothing more than the time which the net cash flow takes to recover the capital invested.
Looking at this parameter, the processed vegetables subproject is the most interesting, while the
cane derivatives subproject is less attractive.

The Project

3.29    In calculating project return, all revenues and expenditures were considered for
agricultural and non-agricultural activities, taking into account the models of typical properties in
the region, as well as direct investments in production systems and productive units. Besides this,
the values to be disbursed by the project were also taken into account, such as investments in
components and subcomponents, in those activities which will have indirect benefits for farmers
such as training, extension services, management and other.

3.30     Considering these conditions, the resulting IRR of the project was 45.1% with an NPV of
R$884.0 million, showing the project to be quite attractive compared to the opportunity cost. But,
it is worth noting that, in general, agro-livestock and forestry projects have elevated rates of
attractiveness due to their productive characteristics, but being subject to adverse climatic
conditions they generate great uncertainty, and coefficients normally have high variability.

3.31     More pessimistic scenarios were developed, considering that the results obtained were
quite attractive. Three possible situations were prepared: the first simulates a reduction of 10% in
product prices, signifying reduced revenues by producers; the second increases by 10% the prices
of inputs and labor, that is, an increase in costs of production for the activities; and finally, a
combination of the two scenarios, trying to show a more pessimistic situation and how results are
affected.

Source: Data from the analysis based on project information


3.32     Analyzing the scenario with a reduction of 10% in farmer revenues, the IRR declines
about five percentage points and the NPV is reduced by about R$135 million; on the other hand,
with an increase of 10% in cost of production the IRR falls from 45.1% to 38.8% and the NPV is
reduced by R$200 million. Combining these two scenarios, the reduction in revenues and
increase in costs, the IRR is 34% and the NPV about R$300 million lower than the original
situation, but even so it is quite an attractive rate if compared to the opportunity cost of 12% and
the situation of actual market rates of interest. Therefore, these data are a good indicator that the
project is viable even if future scenarios deteriorate

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
5.1     The following summarizes results of beneficiary surveys conducted for the Final
Evaluation, as final products of micro-catchment monitoring over the course of project
implementation, during Regional Seminars in 2008, and during a series of workshops with
beneficiary indigenous groups in 2008. A brief summary of Navarro (2008) is also included:

    A. Final Evaluation (2009):

5.2      The project financed a Final Evaluation, Relatório Socioeconômico Microbacias 2 ­
Final (versão preliminar) (EPAGRI/CEPA 2009), preliminary results of which are available for
most segments. The following captures the principal (preliminary) results emerging from the
report's chapter on income generation.

5.3      Methodology: The intention was to compare the final with the ex-ante (2004) results, but
the former had important limitations: (i) field surveys of income covered 291 rural producers in
19 monitored micro-catchments, thereby spatially concentrating the survey; and (ii) at project
outset, it was not possible to gauge which of the 291 producers would ultimately be benefited by
the demand-led investment line (under the Rural Investment Fund component) "Income
Improvement". Upon returning to the field in 2009, the survey team found that of the original 291
producers, 160 could not have their incomes counted in the calculation of final income because
34% belonged to higher-income categories not included as priority targets, and 66% were not
actual beneficiaries of the project or could not be located. Among the 131 usable questionnaires,
about 68% had benefited from the Income Improvement Line and were thus included in income
computations. Before-project incomes of sample beneficiaries were based on the Agro-livestock
Census (LAC) using 2003 prices for comparison of both initial and final incomes, to isolate the
effect of this variable. The final survey cohort was 698 Priority (Marginal and Transition 1)
beneficiaries representing 38,360 Priority beneficiaries of the Income Improvement Line (about
89% of all beneficiaries of this window were Priority), in 268 micro-catchments out of the 936
assisted by the project, in 152 municipalities, about half of all municipalities State-wide.

5.4     A control sample was used comprising rural producers with socio-economic
characteristics similar to the project's priority population and resident in micro-catchments not
involved in the project. The same methodology as the beneficiary sample was used - including
the LAC - to determine initial income in 2003.

Results:

5.5      The project sought, using enhanced sub-indicators, a "reduction in project beneficiaries
classified as Marginal and Transition 1" (see Annex 2 for definition). These were selected
because information/data was available on their pre-project income. To determine the prior
situation of the sampled beneficiaries, the income categorization established at the time of
preparation of Farm Development Plans was used. As noted in the study, a majority of these plans
were not registered in the project MIS and only data identifying producers and the
poverty/income category to which they were assigned was noted, not their incomes. Field surveys
in 2009 calculated the actual income of these same producers/beneficiaries and thus, their actual
category, utilizing the same methodology used before they received project benefits. Results
show:

                                               52
    ·    About 19.3% of beneficiaries surveyed exceeded the income limits for classification in
         the lowest income cohorts (Peripheral and Transition 1) and had moved to higher-income
         categories.

5.6     The project also sought an "increase in the incomes of families in the priority public".
Using the methodology described in 5.3-5.4 above, results show:

    ·    Incomes of the beneficiary sample (698 establishments) increased an average 30.6% in
         the period compared to 16.5% for the control group. Beneficiary incomes ranged from
         9.7% to 18.5% superior to the control.36

    ·    Some 65% of producers surveyed declared that their investments in agro-livestock
         activities increased their family income, on average, by 18.9%. Further, 17% stated that
         they expected their income to keep increasing long-term, 24% medium-term and 49%
         short-term. Some 86% stated that their investment had strengthened their agro-livestock
         activities significantly (59%) to very significantly (27%). Over two-thirds of respondents
         said they would not have made the investment without the project.37

Other Results/Impacts:

Annual crops:

    ·    Annual cropping, while still generating a high proportion of agro-livestock income, was
         shown to be declining and diversifying, while dairying was rising markedly, along with
         perennial cropping, oilseeds, and rustic (home-made) products.

    ·    Productivity of important annual crops increased markedly in the period including
         various types of corn and tobacco.

    ·    Annual crops showed relatively high percentages being marketed, e.g., pumpkin,
         irrigated rice, onions, tobacco, green corn, soybean, sorghum, tomato and wheat. Of some
         concern, there was a slight reduction in farmers selling annual crops through formal
         channels and an increased tendency to sell via middlemen.

Perennial Crops:

    ·    Numbers of beneficiary farmers in the sample group planting perennial crops had
         increased in the period from 43 to 73 and area planted to perennial crops increased 57%.
         Whereas in 2003, oranges and banana were 69% of total income from perennial crops, by
         2008 they were 27%, indicative of diversification and the introduction of new products.

36
   Even if increases are over-estimated due to actual (2009) data being more complete than the LAC, both cohorts are
affected to the same extent.
37
   Average income generated solely from agro-livestock activities was R$861.95 and adding other sources of income,
the average increased to R$1,263.66.




                                                        53
   ·   Among the control group, the situation was different. Numbers of farmers planting
       perennial crops had increased, but area planted had decreased by 30%, value of such
       crops by 11%, and share of total agro-livestock income had also declined.

   ·   In general, high proportions of perennial crops ­ ranging from 60% for grapes to 92% for
       oranges and 100% for caqui, limes, apples and passion fruit - were being marketed, with
       high percentages destined for agro-industry, intermediaries, and directly to consumers,
       and less destined for cooperatives.

Rustic (home-made) products:

   ·   In regard to rustic/home-made agro-livestock products, income had jumped sharply
       among sampled producers, from just R$16,340 in 2003 to R$165,420 in 2008, an
       incremental increase of 912%. Some 49% of the total value was generated by project-
       financed value-added activities. Milk-derivative products constituted 72% of income
       generated from this type of activity however, vegetable products, sweets and related
       products had increased sharply. The number of producers of such products had almost
       trebled.

   ·   The study notes however, that despite evident growth, the numbers of producers involved
       in value-added activities remained very small.

   ·   Among the control group, there was less growth in producers of rustic products, although
       the activity had an important role in income generation.

   ·   A very high proportion of the most traditional of the "home-made" products (dairy-,
       sugar-cane- and manioc-based) are marketed but the share marketed through super-
       markets and agro-industries is falling and direct sales to consumers are rising, indicating
       loss of competitiveness and increasing informality.

Dairy production:

   ·   Dairy production has grown faster in Santa Catarina than any other agro-livestock
       industry in recent years, some 64% overall in the period studied, and 99.4% among
       surveyed beneficiary producers. Some 83% of the total beneficiary sample produces milk
       and it represents 25% of all agro-livestock income. Of 579 milk producers, 44% market
       raw milk to dairy plants and only 171 produce milk derivatives through agro-processing
       activity.

   ·   Average productivity of beneficiary dairy establishments with more than five cows was
       1,804 liters in 2003 and 2,227 liters by 2008, a growth of 23%.

   ·   The Project has played an important role in the overall growth of the industry in Santa
       Catarina, as a disseminator of technology and principally for providing financial
       incentives to adopt new technologies.




                                              54
   ·   The effectiveness of project investments ­ in genetic improvements of herds, in pasture
       planting and maintenance, animal sanitary practices, and the acquisition of machinery
       and equipment - has had a positive influence on the expansion of dairying.

Pig production:

   ·   Income from beneficiaries' production of pigs, as a percentage of total agro-livestock
       income, grew in the period. Income generated rose from R$78,516 in 2003 to R$143,583
       in 2008, an increase of 83%, while numbers of sampled farmers with pigs rose from 255
       producers in 2003 to 519 in 2008. Numbers of animals herded rose 92% and numbers
       sold/slaughtered rose 32%.

   ·   Most small-scale producers surveyed however, are producing pigs for home subsistence
       and/or occasional sale.

Other sources of financing:

   ·   About 42% of surveyed beneficiaries used no external sources of financing for their most
       recent harvest. Of those who did, 74% got PRONAF credit, 10% obtained it from
       equipment/other suppliers, and 16% obtained credit from official banks and cooperatives.

   ·   The control group experience showed 51% not using any "external" credit while of the
       balance, 79% received financing from PRONAF, and the remainder from diverse sources.

Satisfaction with project income improvement investments:

    · Satisfaction levels registered high levels of "good" or "very good" for the value of
      resources loaned, technical guidance and the adopted practice per se, but less than good
      for the bureaucracy involved in gaining access to project resources.

Training:

    · The study found that some 43% of beneficiaries surveyed had not participated in any
      form of training related to their investment. Even so, 53% of this particular group said
      that they felt capable of pursuing the activity financed, while 42% said they felt
      somewhat trained.

         Opinion surveys were conducted at the village level then results were presented at a State
Evaluation Seminar. The survey presented five questions, two of which are summarized in the
matrix below: (a) "What good, positive things has the Micro-catchment II Project done for
families in your village or indigenous land?" and (b) "What are the main problems you
encountered in executing the Micro-catchment II Project in your village or indigenous land". The
full presentation is annexed to supervision Aide Memoire of June 16, 2008 (IRIS4).

    D. Conclusions and Recommendations of the Navarro Study(2008)
    The Navarro study is an important qualitative analysis of two similar projects implemented in
the States of Santa Catarina (Micro-Bacias II) and Sao Paulo in recent years. The methodology
entailed numerous visits to regions of each state, conducting interviews with beneficiaries,
technicians, local authorities and private stakeholders, field visits, some data collection, and desk
reviews of existing studies. No formal surveys per se were applied, there were no sample or
control groups and no data is presented in the report. The intention was to create a road map for
future projects ­ based on a wide-ranging consultative process ­ not to try and measure responses
to particular questions. This summary focuses on the State of Santa Catarina. While the Santa
Catarina project has left a significant body of evaluation including case studies, Navarro's
reputation as an acknowledged authority on rural development underscores the value of his
analysis and recommendations.

Conclusions:
   · The MB II project, being more clearly focused on socio-economic as well as
       environmental activities, and on farmer organization, and with an incentive fund of wider
       scope - including housing improvement - was able to engage much stronger interest
       from farmers, than its predecessor.

    · Agronomic and environmental elements lost some priority and in the process, so did the
      concept and practice of "systematic" approaches, fostered by the focus on a distinct eco-
      geographic area - the micro-catchment.

    · Examples are given of several very poor regions characterized by their sharply
      differentiated reaction to the project and its specific features:

        (a)     Social incentives: In the Lages region, attraction to MB II's social incentives in
        the form of housing improvements and rural electrification, and its participatory
        approach and mechanisms which gave families greater choice including the ability to
        contract facilitators. Navarro's concern is that this approach edges closer to a classic
        "assistencialist" operation, weakening its potential future sustainability;

        (b)      Economic activities: In Piratuba, the attraction of MB II was its shift to economic
        activities but without losing its environmental focus since farmers tacitly understood the
        productivity benefits of sustainable resource management and facilitators were able to
        spread the NRM messages more easily due to the better organizational level of
        beneficiaries. Navarro cites the difficulty in identifying rural leaders and active farmers
        to assume leadership of organizational activities, instead of relying on external interests.

        (c)      Organizational features: In Seará, MB II's organizational features and farmers'
        ability to choose their own priorities has motivated them to shift production to fruit and
        dairy. Support from EPAGRI and the mayor's office has elevated self-esteem and
        encouraged open discussion with local authorities about the needs of the area. Residents
        have since also obtained PRONAF credit and installed telephones. Again, this case
        demonstrated the importance of local leaders willing to take on organizational activities.

        In the Tunápolis region, the project's organizational features prompted creation of a
        cooperative to take advantage of the project's income generation incentives. Social
        cohesion has remained strong, attributed to the project's participatory methodology, and
        the sense of an economic future.

                                                 58
        In Descanso, an area in sharp decline with strong out-migration and widespread poverty
        and illiteracy, the organizational path is clearly complex and long-term. Women are
        proving the primary organizational force but the situation is fragile. Housing
        improvements, protection of water sources, and vegetable plots have been the project's
        main benefits. EPAGRI receives strong praise. Association members are now doing
        group purchasing in the local cooperative "on an equal footing".

    · Navarro describes the organizational achievements of the project as "extraordinary" and
      asserts that the project in Santa Catarina has not lost its productive, environmental and
      agronomic focus, and its components were launched in a consistent manner.

    · Navarro's main concern is formal economic activity given the characteristics of regional
      markets and the ability of the many poor farmers to develop viable income-generating
      activities.

Challenges:

Navarro reviews a series of challenges facing such projects and which his study asserts are
largely avoidable:
    ·   Importance of flexibility in technical and operational design, reflecting rural realities;
    ·   Complex tasks assigned to extension workers mandate care and attention to training;
    ·   Such projects needs to generate the knowledge needed for their success and research
        services need to be contracted out to keep their local, "on the ground", features/value;
    ·   Project preparation needs to reduce the potential for "surprises" by foreseeing diverse
        technical, social and institutional scenarios;
    ·   Project incentives must be appropriate, well chosen and represent real social demands;
    ·   Need to ensure that the environmental focus remains a core project thrust designed to
        change productive systems and promote sustainability.

Pillars of Success:

Navarro sees the following as key to project success:

    ·   Clear understanding of the project on the part of its principal operators starting at the top
        with the state secretariats of agriculture and environment;
    ·   Importance of multi-disciplinary teams well-versed technically, and knowledgeable about
        how government works, for supervising and managing micro-catchments as a totality;
    ·   Municipal mayors and local government authorities are crucial players, a challenging and
        complex issue for these projects; and,
    ·   Projects involving farmer organizations with a tradition of associative action are likely to
        do better, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient to secure the mobilization of farm
        families involved in a micro-catchment. The quality of extension services is critical.

on Draft ICR
       (a) Executive Summary of Borrower ICR 38                (Unofficial Translation)

7.1     Despite advances made as a result of policies and activities developed by the State and
Bank, through the previous LM II project, much remained to be done to better integrate soil use
with water management, conservation of natural resources, improved incomes and greater social
inclusion of small farmers.

7.2     Agreeing that problems existed in the rural space and still needed to be addressed, the
Government of Santa Catarina approved in 1995, along with the Federal Committee for External
Financing (COFIEX) of the Ministry of Planning, Budgeting and Finance, a Carta Consulta
valued at US$107 million. In 1996, the State Secretary of Agriculture mobilized a working group
to prepare a proposal for a new project, with the participation of state institutions, municipalities,
universities, civil society and farmers. In this period, the working group conducted regional
seminars with the participation of 2,000 of these actors, to gauge ideas for the construction of the
proposed project.

7.3      The World Bank sent project preparation missions in September 2001 and January 2002,
which worked closely with the state's working group, with executing institutions and with state
authorities including the State Secretary of Agriculture and the Governor. The name of the
project was "Projeto de Recuperação Ambiental e de Apoio ao Pequeno Produtor Rural
(PRAPEM/Microbacias 2)". The contract was signed in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, through
the Loan Agreement for 4660-BR, between the State and the Bank, on May 10, 2002 for the value
of US$62.8 million with a State counterpart contribution of US$44.7 million for a project totaling
US$107.5 million to be applied over a period of six years (2002-2008).

7.4     Project Objective: Promote rural poverty alleviation through integrated activities which
envisage economic, environmental and social development in rural areas of the state, in a
sustainable manner and with the participation of involved actors through: (a) recuperation and
conservation of natural resources, (b) increased incomes of rural families; (c) improved social,
family and community infrastructure; (d) increase the participation of communities in decision-
making. These objectives were not changed during the project.

7.5     Project execution was coordinated by SAR through the State Executive Secretariat (SEE),
supported by an executive structure and a deliberative structure at the state, regional, municipal
and micro-catchment levels, as show below. Coordinating committees, at all levels, comprised
50% membership of executing agencies and 50% beneficiaries.

7.6   To become operational, the project was organized into four components with respective
subcomponents (Table 2).

Results: Evaluation ­ Mid-term Review (MTR).

7.8     With guidance from the Bank, in 2006 a Mid-term Review was conducted during which
(the opinions of) all actors involved in the project were heard. The MTR report showed that the
project was promoting very positive economic, social and environmental results in the state's
rural areas. Farmers, including indigenous, were organizing themselves into Micro-catchment
Development Associations, and succeeding in improving their economic conditions, housing and


                                                       62
in particular environmental conditions through the use of new practices in sanitation, better water
quality, and conservation of soils and bio-diversity.

7.9     The project was involved in 936 micro-catchments and had already attended 139,844
rural families. Of these families, 129,539 were supported through the Rural Investment Fund with
R$96 million and another R$ 44 million in counterpart resources from the beneficiary families
themselves.

7.10    The study "Evaluation of Productive Investments ­ Line of Support: Income
Improvement" (EPAGRI/CEPA, 2008) showed that up to the time of the study 95% of resources
applied by the Investment Fund, in the area of income-generation, were directed to the project's
target population. The same study concluded that 86% of farmers supported declared that they
had increased their income due to the investments realized. Of the total resources applied by the
Fund, 85.8% were destined for the target population and of the total families supported, 78.3%
were also from the project's priority target population.

7.11    The monitoring conducted in seven micro-catchments, at the start of the work, indicated
high levels of fecal coliformes in the water and a significant reduction by project closing. This
result was due to the implementation of sanitation systems, water protection systems and proper
storage/disposal of animal waste, practices which while not measured, had an important effect on
improving people's health.

7.12    As stated by beneficiaries, (Regional Seminars, 2008), housing improvement, planting of
Riparian Forest (mata ciliar), cleaning of rivers and improvement of community infrastructure
had a strong influence on improving quality of life, self-esteem and satisfaction, of the target
population.

7.13    The study "Instruments for Management of Water Resources", financed by the project,
proposed that the State, through its Secretary of State for Sustainable Economic Development
(SDS), incorporate as a public policy the implementation of the Information System for State
Water Resources, the System for Water Rights Grants, and the Water Users Mapping System. As
an example of the three Integrated Catchment Management Plans supported by the project, the
State assumed the carrying out of the Management Plans of the other state Hydro-graphic
catchment areas. The two studies for Ecological Corridor Plans, along with the Micro-catchment
Management Plans, motivated the state to conduct a seminar "Policies for Payment for
Environmental Services", to find assistance to implement these policies.

7.14     With project support, a Thematic Water Center and a Thematic Center for Land were
created to execute many of activities involved in environmental education. Also, through project
activities with rural families, schools, students and teachers advanced substantially in awareness
and attitude in relation to the environment.

7.15     The results of the project are recognized and have generated positive feedback from
authorities, from state, regional and municipal leaders, and from general society.

7.16     In regard to results of physical targets, these were achieved virtually in totality.
However, evaluations reveal that gaps still exist and that the State, through its institutions, should
continue activities with rural families with a view to consolidating and ensuring the sustainability
of project objectives. Within these activities, we should reiterate the need to expand the training
program to improve the management and planning of rural properties, including young people, to
insert them in productive processes and in the administration of properties.

                                                 63
7.17    There have been advances in community organizing but, for the maturation of the entire
process of community autonomous management, which is very complex, a continuous plan for
training and mobilization is needed. Society, as a whole, showed advances in its awareness of
being committed to natural resources, but these activities cannot be abandoned.

7.18    Based on project actions Epagri adopted in its activities in rural extension, technical
assistance and research, the strategy and methodology utilized by the project with the focus on
sustainable development. The State even assumed as a public policy, the implementation of the
Water Resources Information System, the Water Rights Grants System and the Water Users
Census System. The example of three Integrated Micro-catchment Management Plans supported
by the project, the State assumed carrying out the Management Plans of the other State Water
Catchments. In two water catchments, activities recommended by studies for the Ecological
Corridor Plans, are being implemented.

7.19     With the objective of continuity and greater synergy in activities developed by the
project, the State is negotiating support from the World Bank through a new, US$90 million
financing, with a State counterpart of US$90 million, totaling US$180 million for a period of six
years (2010 - 2016).

Main Lessons Learned

7.20     The MB II project was an innovative experience, with complex implementation due to its
"reach" within the concept of sustainable development, integrating economic, social and
environmental activities to improve the quality of life of the rural population, especially the
poorest.

7.21    During its execution, many lessons, from successes and failures/errors, were learned and
ought to be considered in the development of new projects and the implementation of public
policy in rural areas. Without obeying any order of priority, since all are considered important,
below are the lessons learned from MB II.

    ·   During the proposal preparation phase there needs to be a full discussion of project
        objectives and targets including the directorates of all executing agencies to equalize
        understanding and seek commitment to its execution.

    ·   The central management structure of the project, the State Executive Secretary (SEE),
        should be structured with technical staff according to the needs and design of the project.
        SEE ought to have political support and be linked directly to the State Secretariat of
        Agriculture. Constitution of a Technical Committee, with participation of SEE,
        components and sub-components, is very important for discussion and decision-making
        in project-related themes, besides promoting inter-institutional integration.

    ·   Executing institutions need to have available, at all levels, technicians with the profile
        suitable for the managerial structure and execution of the project. In institutions where
        the executing teams were incomplete, the result of subcomponents under their
        responsibility was compromised.




                                               64
   ·   Before initiating implementation with the involved public, technicians of the executive
       agencies, the Micro-catchment Development Associations (MDAs), mayors and other
       partner institutions should be trained and committed to the project.

   ·   The project strengthened the Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (ATER) Service
       in Santa Catarina.

   ·   Project promotion has to be well-executed and include authorities and state leaders (state
       secretaries, deputies and others) to avoid erroneous interpretations of the project. In
       municipalities where promotion, with leaders and authorities, was well-conducted and
       established a solid set of partnerships, this proved a determining factor in the project's
       advance.

   ·   The project's decision-making structures at the micro-catchment, municipal, regional and
       state levels should have their functions better-defined and their members better-trained.

   ·   Organization of communities in MDAs provoked the emergence of new community
       leaders and enriched the development of human and social capital. The organization of
       residents of micro-catchments in Micro-catchment Development Associations (MDA)
       merits greater attention from municipal mayors to attend to rural sectors. Community
       self-governance (auto-gestao) however, is a very slow process and requires a huge effort
       including training of technicians, directorates of MDAs and the communities.

   ·   Community participation in preparing the Micro-catchment Development Plan (PDMH)
       is a basic condition for attending to project objectives through the efficient/effective
       application of resources.

   ·   Rural youth should be considered as a priority public of the project and specific strategies
       and methodologies should be adopted for this public.

   ·   The project's technical and methodological strategy was well-defined. The project's
       activities advanced perceptibly when the project's strategies were fully-observed.

   ·   Financial support for investments, passed to beneficiaries, is very important to improve
       the activity being supported.

   ·   The requirement to make an evaluation of environmental impact for each proposal under
       the Rural Investment component, helped build awareness about the importance of natural
       resources conservation.

   ·   The study of Instruments for Water Resources Management was effective for the State to
       program policies for management of this sector.
