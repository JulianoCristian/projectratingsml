PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - AKDRNIZ FOREST UTILIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 957-TU)
PREFACE
Loan 957-TU for the Antalya Forest Utilization Project was signed
on January 28, 1974, but because of a change in site and subsequent
reappraisal, was resubmitted to the Board in March 1976 and only became
effective on Msy 26, 1976.  The loan was closed on June 30, 1982, with
US$30,000 rema,ning undisbursed.
The main objective of the loan was to finance the construction of
an integrated industrial complex comprising a sawmill, a pulp mill, and a
papermill, including all the necessary ancillary installations and
pollution abatement facilities. In addition a portion of the loan was to
cover forestry improvements in order to ensure adequate wood supply to the
industrial part.
This Project Completica Report has been prepared by the Industry
Department using data prepared by the Borrower and reviewed by a Bank
mission in May 1984. Preparation -if the report was delayed beyond closing
date of the loan until the project was completed (using EIB funds) and went
into commercial operation about two years later. The Borrower's comments have
been taken into account in finalizing the report and are reproduced in Annex 7-1.
This Project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - AKDENIZ FOREST UTILIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 957-TU)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        This project was originally known as the Antalya Forest Utilization
Project and was sited in Antalya Province.  Because of perceived threats to
the environment and tourism, the project was moved to a more industrialized
area in adjacent Icel Province. The change in site caused a two-year delay
and required a reappraisal (para. 3.02).  The relocated project suffered from
a protracted implementation period due to general economic difficulties in
Turkey during which the country experienced severe shortages of materials as
well as substantial shortages in local and foreign funds which caused delays
in shipment of equipment and slowing of construction work at the site.
Repeated failures during the testing of the locally supplied recovery boiler
necessitated major repairs and caused serious delays. From the start of
physical implementation at the new site, the project took 92 months to com-
plete and experienced a 35% cost overrun, a major portion of which was for
interest during construction (paras. 3.08, 3.14, 3.15).
2.        The sawmill portion of the project was commissioned in 1981, and
ran briefly at design capacity. However, since that time, capacity utiliza-
tion has been less than 3% due to the lack of market in a period of depressed
construction activity in Turkey (para. 4.01). The pulp and paper mill went
into commercial operation in January 1984 and experienced a very successful
operation with capacity utilization reaching 80% of design in only 4 months,
far in excess of the appraisal estimate which anticipated only 50% in the
first full year, a level normally expected in industrialised countries.
Paper quality has been good and the product is in high demand. M"-.ufacturing
costs are higher than appraisal estimates primarily due to increased costs of
chemicals, fuel, and electric power (para. 5.05).
3.        The financial and economic rates of return are both lower than
estimated at appraisal, 5.1% compared with 7.9X for FRR, and 8.1% compared
with 14.0% for ERR. The major reasons these rates are lower are the higher
capital cost, the shortage of local and foreign funds, and the extended im-
plementation period with the result that capital expenditures were made well
in advance of any benefits being received (para. 5.07).
4.        The Bank was involved in this project since the early days of proj-
ect identification and preparation and played an important role in assisting
SEKA and the Government. Lessons learned from this project are (paras.
7.01-7.05):
(a) The potential difficulties in coordinating activities between vari-
ous public sector entities should not be underestimated, particu-
larly if this involves change in well-established procedures.



(b) In spite of tne significant cost increase resulting from the site
change, neither the Bank nor EIB loan was increased and the
additional funds were expected co be provided by the Government.
However, the Government was unable to provide such funds in a
timely manner with the result that the project was delayed
further and cests again increased. Additional sources of foreign
exchange had to be located late in the implementation period. A
firm and realistic financing plan would have helped significantly
to minimize delays and cost overrun.
(c) If local manufacture of technically complex equipment is to be
encouraged, adequate technical assistance is essential to
minimize any adverse impact on timely project implementation and
operation.
(d) If consultants are hired to assist with project management, it is
important to establish for them clear lines of authority and
responsibility in order to avoid confusion during project
implementation which might cause delays and other problems.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - AKDENIZ FOREST UTILIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 957-TU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Turkish forest resources are the fourth most extensive in Europe,
but are low-yielding and underutilized. Since the early 1960s, with
financial assistance from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
and technical assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO,, Turkey has been planning and implementing a program
of rationalization ard expansion aimed at improving the efficiency of its
forest industries and the utilization of this resource.
1.02      The first major investment project planned within this program
was the Antalya Forest Utilization Project which was appraised by the Bank
in 1973 and for which a loan was approved in 1974. Because of local
opposition to the Antalya site, the project did not proceed, but was
reformulated at a new site as tl. Akdeniz Forest Utilization Project, which
was appraised in 1975, and is the subject of this Project Completion
Report.
1.03      Meanwhile, in 1974, a second project in the forest industries
subsector, the Balikesir Newsprint Project (Loan 1257-TU), was identified
and prepared in 1974 and appraised in 1975. A third project, which
involves rehabilitation of three of the larger paper mills in the country
and a program of technical assistance, was approved in May 1985.
1.04      The Akdeniz Forest Utilization Project was thus the beginning of
a major and continuing program of support to Turkey's forest industries.
This program is assisting the country to improve the effectiveness of
utilization of its valuable and renewable forest resources, to supply the
growing domestic demand for industrial forest products.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal and Loan Approval
2.01      Bank involvement in Turkey's forest industries began in 1969 when
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program first developed project proposals for
utilizing the forest resources of southern Turkey. In 1972, the Bank was
appointed Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed study of the project and
Canadian consultants were appointed to carry out the feasibility
investigations. A counterpart team was formed in Turkey, including
representatives of the Ministry of Forestry and Seluloz ve Kagit
Fabrikalari (SEKA) - the state-owned pulp and paper company. This joint



effort was the first time that integrated regional forestry development had
been attempted in Turkey.
2.02      Detailed feasibility studies for the Antalya project were
completed early in 1973 and, on the basis of these studies, the project was
appraised in June 1973. A key issue raised during the appraisal was the
question of the site and the possible conflict between industrial
development and the tourist potential of the Antalya coast. It was noted
that the choice of site was made only after a careful review of a number of
alternative possibilities by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by the
State Planning Organization. The site choice was made after consideration
of nine alternatives, with a view to minimizing adverse effects on regional
touristic and agricultural development, even though this had led to modest
increases in cost. Further, it was agreed that the mill would be equipped
with all of the proven facilities to reduce the discharge of odor and
particulates to a minimum level and with liquid treatment facilities
appropriate to a seacoast location. Total project cost was estimated to be
US$170.0 million, with a foreign exchange cost of US$68 million, of which
the Bank was asked to finance US$40 million and the European Investment
Bank (EIB) US$25.5 million, with the Government providing the balance of
US$2.5 million. On this basis, a loan of US$40 million was approved by the
Bank's Executive Directors on December 17, 1973 (Loan 957-TU). The loan
was at an interest rate of 7.25% p.a. and for 16 years, including 5 years
of grace. onlending to the project was to be through DYB at an interest
rate of 9% p.a. and to be covered by a subsidiary loan agreement.
2.03      SEKA moved to acquire the selected site in Antalya Province, but
met with intense local opposition, primarily because of a perceived
conflict with tourism. A second site in Antalya Province was identified
but acquisition was again opposed. Province-wide opposition to the project
became widespread and the project attracted national attention.
Ultimately, the Government of Turkey decided that the project should not be
built in Antalya at all and SEKA was instructed to find a suitable site
outside the province.
2.04      The search then concent:ated in the adjacent province of Icel, to
the east of Antalya, where the narrGv coastal plain was already heavily
industrialized and where there is litt'le t4urist potential. A suitable
location was identified at Tasucu, near Silifke in Icel province, and in
mid-1975, SEKA instructed the consulting engineers to update the original
feasibility study based on the new site, taking into account changes
related to the relocation of the project and increases in costs resulting
from the two-year delay in project implementation. Because the original
cost estimates had been completed early in 1973, before the rapid price
escalation of the mid-1970s had commenced, these increases were
considerable. The name of the project was changed to Akdeniz (the Turkish
name for the Mediterranean Sea). The new study was completed in September
1975.
2.05      The revised project was appraised in November 1975 on the basis
of the new site and the updated cost estimates. Meanwhile, SEKA had



proceeded with engineering designs and equipment procurement and
expenditures of about US$7.5 million had been made for which reimbursement
would be sought. Total project cost had increased to US$279.5 million,
including US$89.4 million in foreign exchange. The project was resubmitted
to the Bank's Executive Directors in March 1976. It was proposed that the
grace period of the Bank loan be extended by 1-1/2 years to help counter
the effects of the delay, but no other changes to the amount, terms or
conditions of the Bank loan were proposed. The Executive Directors
approved the revisions and the loan was declared effective on May 26, 1976.
B. ProJect Description and Objectives I/
2.06      The project's primary objective was to make more intensive use of
Turkey's forest resources to supply the growing need for kraft packaging
paper and board and for sawnwood. To ensure an integrated approach, the
project included a forestry component as well as an industrial component
consisting of a sawmill as well as a pulp and paper mill. A studies
component was also included to finance further studies within tne sector.
Specifically, the project comprised:
(a) A Forestry Component, consisting primarily of road-building and
transport equipment to help ensure the deliveries of the
813,000 m3 of pulplogs and sawlogs required by the project;
(b) An Industrial Component, consisting of a sawmill with a
production capacity of 170,000 m3/y of construction grade
sawnwood, a pulp and paper mill with a capacity to produce either
155,000 tpy of kraft linerboard or 90,000 tpy of sackkraft paper,
or any combination of the two, and a technical assistance
component covering operation and training; and
(c) A Studies Component to finance studies for the future development
of the forest industries subsector.
2.07      The Akdeniz Project was the first in Turkey to seek the
advantages of integrating a sawmill with a pulp and papermill on the same
site and under a single management. The objectives of such integration
are:
(a) larger diameter and better quality logs can be delivered to the
sawmill to be converted to higher value products and the sawmill
waste wood such as trimmings and rejects, which are fully
acceptable for pulping, passed on to the pulpmill to supplement
smaller and lower quality logs from the forest;
1/   Descriptive and other material relates to the revised Project, the
Akdeniz Forest Utilization Project. Reference is made to the original
Antalya project only when this is necessary for a clear understanding
of particular aspects.

(b) utilities such as steam and electric power can be economically
supplied to the sawmill from the pulp mill's generating
facilities and;
(c) economies can be achieved in administrative, management and
maintenance costs by sharing between the two production units.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The principal objective of the project, to reduce imports through
increased production, has been achieved, with the pulp and paper mill
producing approximately 70% of its design production In its first year of
operation. This production, amounting to 68,000 tons, at the estimated
long-term CIF price, represents a foreign exchange saving of approximately
US$35 million. The broader objectives of more efficient use of the main
raw material, wood, through integration of sawmill and pulpmill, plus the
significant energy savings resulting from delivering wood with bark intact
so that it can be removed in the mill and used as fuel, have not been
achieved. Failure to achieve this was also experienced, at least
initially, in the Balikesir Project,2/ and is due to a continuation of
forestry practices which provide for hand-barking in the forest,3/ and an
apparent disregard for allocating logs for their best use. However, in
1984, considerable progress has been achieved at the Balikesir mill which
now receives about 80% of its wood with bark intact. It is expected that
similar progress can be made at the Akdeniz mill, and is to be followed up
as part of the Pulp and Paper Rehabilitation Project (para 1.03). The
sawmill component of the project, although successfully started up and
operated at design capacity for short periods, has been largely unutilized,
due to a severely depressed market in a period of low construction activity
in Turkey. Prior to the implementation of the Balikesir Project, MOF was
the sole operator of sawmills in the public sector and was reluctant to see
their role diminished somewhat by the construction of a large modern
sawmill at Balikesir, only to be repeated at Akdeniz.4/ The result was a
strained relationship between SEKA and MOF, and SEKA has not always been
able to obtain wood in appropriate volumes and quality. Furthermore,
although the project was originally conceived to optimize the utilization
of coniferous wood from the Antalya forest, because the site was changed, a
significant portion of the wood supply will come from other regions, so the
optimum use of Antalya wood has not been achieved. Finally, project
completion took almost eight years instead of three years.
2/   See PCR for Balikesir Newsprint Project (Loan 1258-TU) dated June
1984.
3/   The MOF has indicated that this procedure is required to prevent
insect infestations under the bark. However, with proper scheduling
for prompt delivery from forest to mill, this problen can be
circumvented.
4/   Although construction of the Akdeniz sawmill came first, Balikesir
started operating sooner.

B. Project Scope Changes
3.02      The change in site location from Antalya to Tasucu represented a
substantial deviation from the original project and required the
construction of a fleet of tugs and barges to move most of the Antalya wood
by sea, plus suitable log storage and harbor facilities at Antalya and
Tasucu. However, since reappraisal of the project at the new location
there have been no changes in project scope.
C. Project Management
3.03      The project was implemented by the Akdeniz Muessesesi, i.e., the
Akdeniz Establishment, a legally established subsidiary of SEKA. It was
recognized that the Akdeniz establishment was not sufficiently experienced
to undertake total project management so the Canadian consulting firm which
did the original Antalya feasibility studies and the updated study after
the site change, was retained by SEKA for detailed design and project
management, including all aspects of procurement and suDervision of
erection for both the plant machinery and the civil works. However, clear
lines of responsibility were not established, and there was insufficient
management autonomy at the project level to deal adequately with major
financial and physical implementation problems that arose.
D. Employment and Training
3.04      Akdeniz currently employs 973 nationals, which is about 13%
higher than the 857 total estimated at the time of appraisal but about 3%
less than the 1,000 estimated in the Consultant's feasibility study.
Management and some key operating staff were transferred from other SEKA
mills. However, the larger portion of operating and maintenance personnel
was recruited locally from a worker population based almost entirely on
agriculture. Unlike the Balikesir mill which experienced many changes in
top management before it began operating, the Akdeniz project has
experienced a stable management team, due in part to the desirable location
of the plant on the Mediterranean coast and a well established township.
The current mill manager is only the third, the first two having been
promoted to senior positions at SEKA headquarters. The Technical Assistant
Mill Manager has been in that position since the start of project
implementation, and was part of SEKA's team during project preparation.
3.05      The consultants who did the project management were retained by
SEKA for operational assistance and training. They conducted training at
the mill site through classroom instruction avi hands-on experience during
Implementation and start-up. Some key personnel were also trained in the
consultants' headquarters and in operating mills in North America. It is
significant that the majority of operating and maintenance personnel, even
some in key positions, were drawn from the local agricultural labor force,
people who had no experience in industrial operations. The successful
start-up of the mill (para 4.02) and its continued excellent operation,
even after the departure of the expatriate operating team, attests to a
successful training program.

E. Use and Performance of Consultants
3.06      The main consultant for this project was involved in project
preparation, implementation, training, and start-up. Prior to this
project, SEKA had undertaken mostly turnkey projects and the engineering
approach used for Akdeniz was new and unfamiliar to SEKA. Throughout
implementation there were many delays, and at times SEKA expressed
dissatisfaction with some of the consultant's employees whose performance
could only be judged after they had worked at the site. SEKA's
dissatisfaction at times with the consultant was due in part to unclear
lines of responsibility for project management between SEKA and the
consultants and the lack of experience of the Akdeniz Establishment in
management of such a large project. However, overall, the consultants'
performance is judged generally satisfactory by SEKA and the Bank, and in
the area of training, their contribution provided excellent results.
F. Procurement
3.07      The major equipment financed by the Bank was procured under
international competitive bidding, and was distributed among 13 countries
of which the major ones were Finland (342), UK (27%), and the FRG (112).
Details are in Annex 3-1. EIB-financed equipment was procured under EIB
rules and limited to European supply. There was one major procurement
dispute which contributed to implementation delay. This involved the
chemical recovery boiler which was originally tendered through ICB. The
lowest evaluated bid was from a Japanese supplier, but subsequent to the
evaluation SEKA decided the boiler should be supplied locally. Bank
financing for the package was withdrawn 5/ and the Turkish Government
agreed to make up the foreign exchange requirement for the package. A
further complication arose when SEKA's consultants refused to accept the
local supplier's technical capability to build this specialized boiler, and
insisted that suitable licensing and technical assistance arrangements be
established with one of the few well known manufacturers of this
specialized equipment. After several months' delay, such an arraigement
was finalized, but this did not prevent major problems arising later
(para 3.10). Although it was difficult to establish beforehand that the
local contractor could not perform satisfactori.y, on hindsight this was
a case where more forceful Bank intervention could have prevented a major
problem.
G. Implementation Schedule
3.08      A comparison of the Implementation schedule for the revised
project at the time of reappraisal with the actual experience Is given in
Annex 3-2. At reappraisal, start-up was expected in the fourth quarter of
1978, but in fact production did not begin until the end of 1983, a delay
of about 5 years.
3.09      Moving the project outside of Antalya Province to the final site
at Tasucu caused a major delay in project implementation from the original
5/   However, no misprocurement was established and no loan funds were
cancelled.



-7-
schedule. During this period SEKA continued certain project activities,
including basic engineering, and all the major items of equipment were
ordered using foreign exchange provided by the Government for
downpayments. However, before acquisition of the new site was finalized
and civil works commenced, almost two years had passed. Moreover, from
this point in early 1976, almost 20% of the available financing had already
been spent, and still project completion took five years longer than
visualized at the time of reappraisal. Although the Bank and EIB loans had
been signed prior to the site change, the loans did not become effective
until after reappraisal and amendment of the legal documents. The delay,
and the site change, resulted in significant Increases in capital cost and,
from the outset, the project suffered from severe shortages of both local
and foreign funds. Also during this period, locally produced construction
materials were scarce in Turkey, and in some cases the project had to
utilize foreign exchange to import materials which would normally have come
from local sources. Progress payments were seriously delayed to suppliers
of equipment which had been ordered prior to loan effectiveness, and in
several cases contracts expired and equipment was sold to others. When
SEKA reordered, the ma-aufacturing process had to start again, resulting in
further delays. Erection contractors also slowed their activitiss when
payments were not made on time.
3.10      A major impediment to commissioning the mill was the chemical
recovery boiler, for which ICB was suspended by SEKA and the contract
awarded to a local supplier (para 3.07). Hydrostatic testing of the
pressure parts failed at zero pressure and inspectors of the licensing
company discovered that substandard material had been used and that
workmanship was inferior. Repairs were made but in subsequent testing
additional points of failure were uncovered and again found to be caused by
poor workmanship and incorrect or inferior materials. Ultimately, suitable
replacements and repairs were successfully completed and the boiler was
fired with spent pulping liquor in December 1983, after a total erection
time of five years, compared with a normal period of not more than two
years. These problems confirm the original judgement of the consultants
against the local supplier. Also the Bank must share some of the
responsibility for the delay since it did not make a strong enough protest
against buying this critical equipment from an inexperienced supplier.
This unit is vital to the operation of the plant and the delay in its
completion prevented the entire plant from operating.
H. Ecology
3.11      Kraft pulp mills, which employ a chemical pulping process,
utilize large volumes of fresh water which subsequently must be discharged
as effluent. This liquid effluent contains dissolved organic and inorganic
materials, suspended solids, and is darkly colored. It can be toxic to
aquatic life and consume oxygen in the receiving water. Moreover, it can
cause darkening in the receiving water and generate unsightly foam. In the
case of the Akdeniz mill, all of these potential problems have been fully
addressed. Plant design provided for maximum recirculation of water,
including the installation of a water-cooling tower, to minimize the volume



- 8 -
of effluent. A primary effluent clarifier followed by settling basins was
provided to eliminate suspended solids and to reduce partly biochemical
oxygen demand and toxicity, and foam-breaking towers were installed on the
effluent pipeline. Rather than discharging effluent to Tasucu Bay near the
mll site, a 10 km buried pipeline was installed to carry effluent and
discharge it through a submerged multi-port diffuser 600 meters offshore
from a remote point of land where deep water and strong currents are
available to dilute fully and disperse the treated effluent.
3.12      Kraft pulp mills may also potentially discharge particulate
matter and odorous gases to the atmosphere. The Akdeniz mill has been
equipped with a high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator to remove
particles from flue gas and with a modern "low-odor" boiler.  Miscellaneous
small discharges of odorous gases are collected and destroyed by burning in
a kiln.
3.13      All of these systems have worked as designed and no adverse
effects on the environment have been noted.
I. Capital Costs, Financing and Loan Disbursement
3.14      The actual total financing required for the project was
US$377.5 million equivalent of which US$155.4 million (42%) was for direct
and indirect foreign exchange, compared with the appraisal estimate of
US$279.5 million, of which US$89.4 million (32%) was foreign exchange. The
35% increase in required financing, amounting to US$98 million equivalent,
is mainly attributed to the long delays in project implementation,
resulting in higher interest charges (US$54.5 million or 56%) and price
escalation on machinery, equipment, and civil works (US$43.5 million or
44%). However, in spite of this, the installed cost of the plant was only
21% higher than the appraisal estimate, which tuder the circumstances is
reasonable. Capital cost estimates are given in Arnex 3-3 and are
summarized below:

-9-
3.15      The major source of cost overrun is interest accrued on the
foreign loans during the construction period, which increased almost
eig1.t-fold over the appraisal estimate. Most of the foreign loans were
committed early in the implementation period when major foreign equipment
items were purchased and have been accumulating interest charges over much
of the extended implementation period. Moreover, the project was
implemented during a period of high domestic and international inflation
which affected costs of a wide variety of miscellaneous materials such as
pipe and wiring which were purchased throughout the construction period.
Also the appraisal estimates were based on prices of equipment that in some
cases was subsequently sold to others (para 3.09) and had to be reordered
at higher cost.
3.16      In order to meet the total project costs EIB agreed to a second
loan which became effective in 1979, and DYB provided foreign 4unds from an
IBRD line of credit (Loan No. 1379-TU). The Government provided foreign
exchange from its own sources in addition to all of the local currency
requirements. However, all of these were slow in coming and this
contributed to project delay. The financing plan is shown below:

IV. OPERATINC PERFORMANCE
A. Production Build-up
4.01      The sawmill component of this integrated project was commissioned
in November 1981, about two years earlier than the rest of the mill. After
a successful commissioning and performance trials which demonstrated the
sawmill's capability of operating at design capacity, the mill has been
operated only intermittently, producing a mere 5,545 m3 of sawnwood from
start-up until March 1983, and nothing since then. This represented, up to
March 1983, less than 3% utilization of design capacity.  This dismal
performance is no reflection on the physical plant or SEKA's ability to
operate it, but is due to the lack of market for construction grade lumber
during a period of economic depression in Turkey. What little demand there
is for sawnwood can easily be met by the existing public and private sector
mills. Furthermore, SEKA has been unsuccessful in exporting sawnwood,
partly because of a general and serious worldwide surplus of sawmilling
capacity and partly because of SEKA's lack of marketing experience. The
possibility of leasing these facilities is under serious consideration.
4.02      The pulp and paper mill production record on the other hand has
been remarkable. In the fourth month of operation, April 1984, the mill
produced at a rate of 80% the plant's design capacity. For the whole of
the first year, production was at about 70% of design capacity, compared
with an estimated 50% in the appraisal report. The following table shows
the actual production by months and the percentage of design capacity
reached.

a/  Capacity depends on grade mix and is rated at 90,000 tpy
on sackkraft and 155,000 tpy on linerboard. The figures
shown in this table are calculated on a weighted average
capacity depending on actual grade mix.
4.03      Quality of the Akdeniz sackkraft has been good since start-up and
customers are eager to buy from Akdeniz rather than SEKA's other sackkraft
mill at Caycuma. This is an unexpected situation, as the main determinant
of quality is the wood raw material which, according to laboratory tests,
is inferior at Akdeniz. The fact that the quality ranking is the reverse
of what is expected demonstrates that excellent process control is
being achieved at Akdeniz.
B. Market Developments
4.04      At the time of reappraisal, it was estimated that the existing
domestic demand for sackkraft and linerboard would grow at an average rate
of about 8% per year up to 1990, and for the actual start-up year, 1984,
the domestic demand would be 115,000 tpy for sackkraft and 56,000 tpy for
linerboard.  The actual demands were slightly below this level for
sackkraft at approximately 95,000 tpy and higher for linerboard at
64,000 tpy.
4.05      On the basis of historical consumption of paper and paperboard
(Annex 4-1), elasticity of demand against per capita GNP is calculated at
1.2. At an estimated GNP growth of 5.0%/yr, and population growth of
2%/yr, it is projected that domestic demand for sackkraft and linerboard
demand will be as follows:

1990                       151,000              102,000
The above figures are within 15% of the estimates made at the time of
appraisal. When the Akdeniz mill reaches its full capacity in 1987,
production is projected to be 55,000 tons of sackkraft and 75,000 tons of
linerboard. As Akdeniz will be the sole domestic producer of linerboa-id,
there will be no difficult) selling all its production. In the case of
sackkraft, SEKA's Caycuma mill produces about 55,000 tpy, so in 1987, when
the domestic demand is estimated at 120,000 tons, the combined tonnage of
Caycuma and Akdeniz, 110,000 tons, will still be below domestic
requirements. In sunmary, the market for Akdeniz production of sackkraft
and linerboard appears to be secure. Akdeniz has been designed to produce
either grade and its production program can be altered as necessary to
serve the market most efficiently and to make fullest use of the installed
facilities.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Basis of Projections
5.01      The assumptions used for the financial analysis of the project
are discussed in the following paragraphs. The basic projections have been
prepared at first quarter 1984 price levels and converted to US dollars at
an exchange rate of TL 325 per US$1.00.
B. Value of Sales and Production Cost
5.02      Volumes.  The mill started operations in January 1984.  The
following table shows actual production and the forecast for annual
production buildup till the mill reaches its designed capacity in 1988.

5.03      Prices.  The historical development of domestic sackkraft and
linerboard prices is shown in Annex 5-1.  The ex-factory list price, in
first quarter 1984, for sackkraft paper is TL 182,000 (US$560) per ton and
for linerboard is TL 173,000 (US$532) per ton, representing a 3% real price
increase for sackkraft paper and about 14% real price dearease for
linerboard compared to prices at the time of appraisal. These absolute and
relative price changes for sackkraft paper and linerboard are in the right
directions since historically SEKA's prices for sackkraft paper have been
lower than those for linerboard, while the international price of sackkraft
is generally 5-15% higher than that of linerboard because of higher cost of
production.
5.04      The ex-factory price for sawnwood in the first quarter of 1984 is
TL 35,750 (US$110) per m3 which is about 10% higher, in real terms, than at
the time of appraisal.
5.05      The estimated average production cost for the project product
mix, excluding depreciation and financial charges, in 1984 terms is about
TL 130,000 per ton as against TL 113,500 per ton at the time of appraisal
(Annex 5-2), representing a 15% real increase in manufacturing costs. The
cost per ton for pulplogs decreased by about 10% while the cost of fuel oil
and chemicals has increased by 139% and 196%, respectively. The increase
in fuel oil and chemical costs is mainly due to higher real prices and
partly to higher specific consumption than estimated at the time of
appraisal.
5.06      Projected financial results for two major cases have been
prepared and are shown in Annex 5-3. These projections are for the paper
mill with sawmill operating and the case of sawmill not operating. For the
case of sawmill operating, the project is expected to show its first profit
in 1986, the third year of operation. For the case of sawmill not
operating, the profitability will be delayed to 1988, the fifth year of
plant operation.
5.07      The internal financial rate of return (FRR) before taxes for the
paper mill with the sawmill operating is 5.1% (Annex 5-4) compared to 9.7%
estimated at the time of appraisal. The lower rate of return is mainly due
to 4-1/2 years longer implementation period (para 3.08); higher capital
cost (para 3.14); and higher operating cost (para 5.05). The sensitivity
analysis indicates that with the sawmill not operating the FRR will be
reduced from 5.1% to 2.9% (Annex 5-4). The sensitivity analysis indicates
that 10% reduction in operating cost or 10% increase in ex-factory prices



- 14 -
would enhance the FRR from 5.1% to 6.2% and 6.8%, respectively. If the
delay in start-up caused by the recovery boiler and other problems could
have been avoided and the production started two years sooner, the FRR
would have been 6.7%. (Furthermore, about US$25 million of interest during
constructio. and US$30 million of price escalation could have been
avoided.)
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
6.01      The assumptions concerning adjustments made to financial costs
and beneftts to obtain economic values are detailed in Annex 6-1.
Tradeable items are valued at their CIF border price, expressed in US
dollars. For calculating economic benefits, it is assumed that prices
would remain constant in real terms during the life of the project. The
financial cost of electricity has been multiplied by a factor of 1.6 to
approximate its economic cost. The economic cost of pulpwood has been
estimated on the basis of its opportunity cost. Labor cost has been valued
at a shadow wage rate of 60% of its financial costs.
6*02      Economic cost and benefit streams and the economic rate of return
(ERR) is shown in Annex 6-2. The ERR for the paper mill with sawmill
operating is 7.9% compared to 14.0% estimated at the time of appraisal.
The lower ERR is mainly due to the completion delay ant higher operating
costs than forecast at appraisal. The sensitivity analysis indicates that
with the sawmill not operating the ERR will be reduced from 7.9% to 5.6%
(Annex 6-3). If start-up could have been achieved two years earlier the
ERR would have improved to 10%.
VII.  BANK ROLE AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      A fundamental objective of the Akdeniz Project which was not
fully realized was to introduce to Turkey the concept of an integrated
forest products industry which would allow optimum utilization of the
forest. One major reason this objective was not achieved is that it
requires a major change in procedures in forest harvesting and marketing of
the logs. Furthermore, introduction of sawmilling by SEKA reduced the role
of the Ministry of Forests in that manufacturing subsector, and tended to
worsen the working relationship between Ministry of Forests and SEKA. The
lesson to be learned is that traditional practices are not easily changed
even though such change may make eminent technical and economic sense. The
Bank should attempt such changes more slowly and only after a commitment
has been received from all parties to try to make i': work.
7.02      As vith the Balikesir Newsprint Project (para 1.03), and many
other projects in various parts of the world, the Bank was too optimistic
on implementation and disbursement schedule. Most of the delay was due to
a general deterioration of Turkey's economy during the period, lack of



- 15 -
local and foreign funds, and slowdown by suppliers and contractors due to
nonpayment. Some of the delay could have been avoided by providing for
more conservative contingencies in the cost estlmates and a correspondingly
more realistic financing plan. With such problems, it is difficult to
assess the effectiveness of the project management of SEKA and the Akdeniz
Establlshment, but it appears to have been weak, The Bank's appraisal
should have concentrated more on developing a more effective project
management system.
7.03      A Bank participation in this project of US$40 million was agreed
when the original Antalya project was appraised. The change in site and
the subsequent reappraisal (paras 2.02-2.05) took two years and during this
period the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project increased from
US$68.0 million to US$89.4 million, but neither the Bank loan nor the EIB
loan was increased and It was expected that the additional foreign exchange
of US$21.4 million would be provided by the Government. In fact the
Government was unable to provide such funds in a timely manner and
consequently the project was delayed and costs increased even more to a
total foreign exchange requirement of US$155.4 million. These funds were
eventually provided through additicnal Governmment allocation, an
additional EIB loan, and from a portion of the IBRD line of credit to DYB.
To rely solely on the Government to provide the additional foreign exchange
in a timely manner was clearly unwise and the Bank should have adopted a
more realistic approach and insisted on a more firm financing plan.
7.04      One major item of equipment, the chemical recovery boiler, was
chiefly responsible for about two years' delay in project completion. This
stemmed from the fact that the equipment was produced locally for the first
time. While Bank projects should certainly encourage local manufacturing
of equipment where appropriate, in a case such as this, involving fairly
sophisticated technology, it is important to ensure adequate technical
assistance is provided, including a strong collaboration agreement with
less local content the first time it is attempted and a more comprehensive
back-up supply system from the foreign licensor. In the case of a major
shift in procurement source mid-way through a project, the Bank should be
prepared to take speedy corrective action to prevent such mistakes before
they happen.
7.05      The Akdeniz Establishment was primarily responsible for
implementation of the project, but because of their lack of experience in
such a major assignment, consultants were hired to assist them with project
management. The SEKA personnel, being unfamiliar with the role of a
consulting engineer, were unsuccessful in fully delegating authority to the
degree necessary to make such an arrangement work. Furthermore, this was
the consultants' first major engineering assignment in Turkey and they were
not fully aware of Turkish systems. As a result it was not always clear
what the line relationships were (among the owner, the consultant, and the
contractors) and situations arose where SEKA held the consultants
accountable without giving them sufficient authority. The Bank should have
recognized this potential problem and insisted that the relationships be
clearly deflned and agreed upon. However, as work progressed, mutual
cooperation was improved.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - AKDENIZ FOREST UTILIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 957-TU)
Assumptions Used in Economic Analysis
A. Economic Rate of Return
1.        Only four adjustments have been made to the financial projections
in order to generate cost and benefit streams to calculate economic rates
of return for the project.
(a) Import parity prices have been used rather than domestic prices.
(b) For the economic analysis, electrical energy has been priced at
the long-run marginal cost of production. The present financial
price is only about 62% of this value.
(c) Labor has been valued at a shadow wage rate of 60% of its
financial costs.
(d) The economic cost of pulpwood fiber in Turkey has been estimated
at US$19 per cubic meter based on its potential opportunity
cost. This estimate is based on the following analysis:
(i) Based on Exporting Wood
2.        The major market is Japan which currently imports from North
America and Southeast Asia. Japanese importers buy FOB and transport chips
in special bulk carriers. For this analysis it is assumed price FOB Turkey
would be the same as FOB North America. Currently this is US$80/Bone Dry
Unit (BDU), which is equivalent to US$30/m3.
3.        Turkish roundwood would have to be converted to chips and loaded
to the Japanese bulk carrier. Total volume of pulpwood consumed by Akdeniz
is about 500,000 m3/y at full capacity (depends on grade mix). Conversion
costs are estimated at follows:
Capital cost for 500,000 m3/year plant, including civil works,
chipping equipment, pneumatic handling and loading, and all
engineering, overhead, and escalation, US$30.0 million. Assuming
10-year life and no return on the investment this amounts to (30
x 106) - (10 x 500,000) = US$6/m3.

Capital             6.00
Operating           3.00
Contingency (22%)  2.00
Total              11.00
Export parity price   30.00 - 11.00 - US$19/m3
(ii) Based on equivalent fuel value.
For pine chips, net heat from a boiler - 13 MJ/BDKg
lm3 - 400 BDKg
1m3 net heat from boiler - (400)(13) - 5,200 MJ/m3
Net heating value of fuel oil = 35,000 MJ/ton
1m3 wood - 5.200 - 0.149 ton fuel oil
35,000
At a fuel oil price of US$200/ton, chip value as fuel
200 (0.149) = 29.8, say US$30/m3.
less conversion cost from logs to chips, as above, US$11/m3,
therefore:
Price on the basis of fuel equivalent = 30.00 - 11.00 -
US$19/m3
which is the same as calculated on wood export basis.
Therefore the economic price is taken as US$19/m3.

Our telex Sdr. No. 3359 Plan ve Org./551

Dear Mr. Watanabe,
The comments of our Establishment only, on the Project Com-
pletion Report, which is referred to above, are stuted ds
follows:
1) Paze 3. B - (a)
n...... 733,000 m3 of pulplogs And sawlogs required by
the project;"
Our Comment: Our wood requirement at full c4pacity is
specified to be 451,000 m3/y of pulplogs and 362,000 m3/y
of sawlogs, i.e. raw-material of 813,000 m)/y in total,
as will be seen in our consulting engineers' Feasibility
Report No. X3754/2 dated 15 September 1975, appendix 2,
Page 1.
Text Corrected
The figure of 733,000 m3/y in the Report is given in
Sandwell's Feasibility Report, Section 1 (Main Text),
Page 29, as a comperative figure for &ntalya vs ,kdeniz
for the year of 1988, the time which akdeniz has noz
yet reached for linerboard production at full capacity.

"Akdeniz currently employs 973 nation4ls, which is about
13% higher than the 857 total estimated at the time of
appraisal, largely due to additional unskilled workers."
Our Comment: That figure is specified to be 1,000 in
9awI!Ts Feasibility Report No. X3754/2 dated  15
September 1975, Appendix 2, Page 7.
Text Edited
When Sandwell's figure of 1,000 is considered, it is
clearly seen that the number of workers mentioned in
your report is 2.7% less than their figure.

Our Comment: Throughout implementation there were many
dIays, nd at times SEKA expressed dissatisfaction with
some of consultants' employees who were sent to the site
and whose performance was found to be inadequate by SEKA
only after those individuals had actually worked at
Akdeaiz .

".... This involved the chemical recovery boiler which was
originally tendered through ICB. The lowest evaluated bid
was from a Japdnese supplier, but subsequeat to the evalu-
ation SEKA decided the boiler should be supplied locally."

of your report, it is stated that both the local supplier
was insufficient, and a two-year delay and loss of time
were caused, which the financial burden imposed by them
effected the project adversely.
Our Comments Installation of imported equipments of the
proJi3 i completed at the end of 1982 and the project
was started-up, as a whole, at the end of 1983. So, as
a result of those, it can be considered that the delay
was for only one year after completion of installation
and the majority of that one year was spent for the
chemical recovery boiler. Also, as the problems with
some of the imported equipments were also resolved with-
in that one-year-term, we are of the opinion that the
recovery boiler delayed the start-up of the project by
less than one year.
We would appreciate if you would please review once aga4n
the contexts pertaining to the chemical recovery boiler
in your report.

"The SKLA personnel, being unfamiliar with the role of a
consulting engineer, were unwilling to delegate authority
fully to the degree aecessary to make such an arrangement
work."
Our Comment: Although the SEKA personnel, being unfamiliar
~ith~the~role of a consulting engineer, were willing to
Text Edited     delegate authority fully to the degree necessary to make
such an arrangement work, it could not be realized as the
consulting engineer was not acquainted with the conditions
in Turkey initially.
However, as the work progressed, mutual co-operation was
improved.
You are kiadly requested to be advised on above, and to furnish us
with a copy of the final report.
