Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The objective of the Project is to assist the Government in controlling the spread of the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic through: (a) the scaling up of programs for the prevention of HIV/AIDS, targeting in particular 
both HIV/AIDS high-risk groups and the general population; (b) the scaling up of programs for the 
treatment and care of people living with HIV/AIDS; (c) the reduction of the degree of stigma and 
discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS; and (d) the strengthening of the institutional capacity of the 
Ministry of Health and Environment (MOHE), other related Government agencies and civil society 
organizations to ensure the effectiveness and the sustainability of the project.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES 
 
HIV/AIDS PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROJECT 
P076799 
LOAN 72510 /CREDIT 39460 /IDA H1110 
 
Restructuring Paper 
 
1.  The Closing date for the
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines HIV/AIDS Prevention and 
Control Project, 
Loan 7251-VC, Credit 3946--VC, IDA H111-VC,
 
will be partially 
extended
 
from December 31, 2010 to April 30, 2011.  
2. Overall Project implementation and progress towards achievement of the 
development objectives are moderately satisfactory and satisfactory, respectively.  
The Credit and Grant have been fully drawn down and as of December 16, 2010, 
US$1.846 million has been disbursed from the loan account and US$1.301 is already 
committed, representing 90% of the total loan amount.  The key activities under 
Component 1 and 2, Scaling-up HIV/AIDS response by Civil Society Organizations 
(CSOs) and Line Ministries (LMs), respectively, have been achieved, providing direct 
support to fourteen CSOs and nine LMs
 to strengthen the country’s multi-sectoral 
response.  Substantial progress has been made under Component 3, Strengthening the 
Health Sector Response to HIV/AIDS, with highlights being the project’s 
contribution to reducing the number of new reported cases of HIV/AIDS by more 
than half since project inception and exceeding the end project target of 75% of adults 
and children still alive 12 months after initiation of ART even as early as 2009 (at 
85.7%).  Civil works under this component have been completed. The project has 
made tremendous strides in Component 4, Strengthening Institutional Capacity for 
Program Management and Monitoring and Evaluation, with the Health Management 
Information System (HMIS) being close to extending its network to all 39 health 
centers in the country’s nine health districts and being recognized by the Government 
as one of the most significant contributions of the HIV/AIDS project to strengthen the 
country’s health system. 
3. 
The new Closing Date of April 30, 2011 is being requested due to delays resulting 
from the aftermath of Hurricane Tomas and the national elections.  The extension 
would allow Bank funds to support the Project instead of Government funds which 
have been strained as a result of having to address the damage caused by the 
hurricane.  Specifically, the extension will ensure that the Government of St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines is able to receive the final set of equipment needed for the 
operation of the Stubbs Polyclinic, the supplies for biomedical waste management, 
and the hardware equipment for the HMIS.  For the Stubbs Polyclinic, a final set of 
medical equipment, including items such as physiotherapy and ophthalmology 
equipment, dentist chairs and medical beds is pending and will be delivered within 
the proposed extension period.  For biomedical waste management, contracts are 
expected to be signed during the month of December 2010 and delivery of the goods

will be completed within the proposed extension period.  For the HMIS, the contract 
for the remaining hardware equipment is awaiting approval from the Central Tenders 
Board (CTB) whose meeting was delayed due to national elections.  The CTB is 
expected to meet prior to January 31, 2011 and if approval of the HMIS contract is 
granted, the HMIS contract will be issued by no later than January 31, 2011 thereby 
ensuring the equipment will be delivered within the proposed extension period.  In 
accordance with the Aide Memoire dated December 6-10, 2010, the task team has 
discussed with the government and established December 31, 2010, as the date by 
which all contracts will need to be signed with the exception of the HMIS contract 
which is being proposed to be awarded no later than January 31, 2011 per the 
Government’s request because it requires approval from Central Tenders Board 
whose meeting was delayed due to the national elections.  Contracts not signed by the 
December 31, 2010 deadline, and in the case of the HMIS, by the January 31, 2011 
deadline, will not be eligible under the Project.  The Government and Bank task team 
have discussed the timeline and the follow-up action plan ensuring deliveries will be 
made within the agreed extension period.
 
4.  This will be the second extension of the Closing Date.  The Closing Date was first 
extended by a period of 18 months from June 30, 2009 to December 31, 2010.  This 
proposed second extension would extend the closing date to April 30, 2011, bringing 
the total cumulative extension to 22 months.
