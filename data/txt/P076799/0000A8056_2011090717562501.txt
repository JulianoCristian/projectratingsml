                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Government in controlling the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic through: (a) the scaling up of programs for the
                         prevention of HIV/AIDS, targeting in particular both HIV/AIDS high-risk groups and the general population; (b) the scaling up of programs for the treatment and
                         care of people living with HIV/AIDS; (c) the reduction of the degree of stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS; and (d) the strengthening of the
                         institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health and Environment (MOHE), other related Government agencies and civil society organizations to ensure the
                         effectiveness and the sustainability of the project.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The main objectives of this ISR are to provide an update with regard to the final set of activities for which the project received a four month extension to its closing date (from

                         December 31, 2010 to April 30, 2011) and to assess the overall performance of the Project based on its project development indicators.

                         With regard to the Project's remaining activities which included completing the procurement processes for the delivery of the final set of equipment for the Stubbs Polyclinic and the
                         Health Information System (HIS), as well as supplies for biomedical waste management, all equipment and supplies were delivered prior to the closing date of the Project, except for
                         the two electrocardiogram (ECG) machines which arrived on May 9, 2011 and which were paid for using counterpart funds.

                         In terms of results, the Project made good progress in meeting several of its development outcome indicators and intermediate outcome indicators, even surpassing a number of
                         them. HIV prevalence is estimated to be less than one percent in the general population and averages about one percent in pregnant women. The number of reported new HIV cases
                         and new AIDS cases have declined by 41 percent and 56 percent, respectively, since Project inception; all pregnant women who come for prenatal checkups are tested for HIV/
                         AIDS; and all babies born from HIV positive mothers are treated. The number of people tested for HIV/AIDS since the start of the Project, the number of condoms distributed island-
                         wide and number of facilities rehabilitated through the Project have exceeded their end of Project targets. As a whole, good progress was made in scaling up preventive and
                         treatment programs, as well as strengthening the institutional capacity of the MOHE and other government and civil society organizations. There is a general consensus that the
                         National HIV/AIDS Program with the support of the Project has increased awareness regarding HIV of the general population although reducing stigma and discrimination remains a
                         significant challenge.
