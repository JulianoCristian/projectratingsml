                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Government in controlling the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic through: (a) the scaling up of programs for the
                         prevention of HIV/AIDS, targeting in particular both HIV/AIDS high-risk groups and the general population; (b) the scaling up of programs for the treatment and
                         care of people living with HIV/AIDS; (c) the reduction of the degree of stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS; and (d) the strengthening of the
                         institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health and Environment (MOHE), other related Government agencies and civil society organizations to ensure the
                         effectiveness and the sustainability of the project.

                         general population and averages about one percent in pregnant women. It has achieved this result in spite of stigma and discrimination remaining a challenge. All pregnant women
                         are tested for HIV, babies born from positive mothers are treated, the number of reported new HIV/AIDS cases has been reduced by almost 60% since the inception of the project, all
                         health centers offer Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) services, condoms are widely available in the public and private sectors and all blood donated samples are tested for the
                         virus. Data collection at the points of service for M&E has improved and will continue to improve with the ongoing implementation of the Health Information System (HIS) modules and
                         the collection of person-specific data.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project closing date has been extended from end December 2010 to end April 2011 based on the Government's request to allow for selected procurement processes to be
                         completed.

                         The Government has already integrated most functions of the National AIDS Secretariat (NAS) into the Ministry of Health and Environment (MOHE) structure in order to ensure
                         program sustainability.
