assess their potential\n            contribution to meeting national energy needs; (ii) carry\n            out the preparatory studies necessary to identify the\n            policies, investment, institutional arrangements and\n            modifications to Morocco's overall energy strategy,\n            necessary for eventual development and marketing of gas and\n            condensates; (iii) evaluate and promote additional petroleum\n            prospects among foreign oil companies, in order to attract\n            further foreign investment for petroleum exploration; and\n            (iv) strengthen ONAREP's technical and managerial\n            capacity so that it can plan and carry out its functions as\n            cost-effectively as possible. The project comprises: (a)\n            drilling, testing and completion of up to 9\n            appraisal/exploratory wells; (b) geophysical studies; (c)\n            technical studies (reservoir engineering, gas utilization,\n            detailed design of pipeline and surface facilities); (d)\n            gathering, analysis and presentation of data for exploration\n            promotion; and (e) technical assistance and training for ONAREP."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
