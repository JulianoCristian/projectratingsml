          for Niger were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: design of the budget supports needs to be\n            adapted to the institutional environment. In a weak\n            institutional environment such as Niger, it is better to\n            avoid a long list of prior actions, and focus instead on a\n            short list of key actions and their cross-sectoral linkages\n            and synergies. It is important to provide a medium-term\n            perspective, particularly when addressing policy constraints\n            in sectors, where results are not achieved in the\n            short-term. In that respect, the decision to discontinue the\n            series of three rural and social policy reform operations\n            and move to other sectors before gains in the initial\n            sectors are fully consolidated is perplexing. This decision\n            may give the Government the wrong signal that pursuing the\n            reforms in the human development area is no longer needed.\n            The Development Policy Lending (DPL) series demonstrated\n            that satisfactory outcomes can be achieved with strong\n            commitment on the part of government and with Bank support\n            designed to develop the needed capacity for implementation.\n            This is particularly evident in the education, health, and\n            to a lesser extent in agriculture sectors, where authorities\n            are committed to improve capacities and increase efficiency\n            of service delivery."}, "docdt": "2008-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
