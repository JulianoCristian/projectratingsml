of Niger in implementing\n            its program to promote growth and achieve a sustainable\n            reduction of poverty. The RSRC-2 is part of a series of\n            development policy lending operations and follows the first\n            rural and social policy reform credit approved in June 13,\n            2006. The RSRC-2 focuses on overcoming policy constraints\n            and institutional bottlenecks in public sector management,\n            agricultural and rural development, and human development\n            (including demographic growth and gender issues). The\n            specific results that the RSRC series (1 and 2) are trying\n            to achieve are to: (i) accelerate the implementation of\n            reforms in public expenditure management and related\n            fiduciary systems, essential for the success of Niger's\n            broader reform agenda; (ii) promote rural growth through\n            implementing rural medium-term expenditure framework,\n            supporting the decentralization of land administration,\n            increasing the contribution of irrigation to agricultural\n            GDP, and improving the efficiency of existing food security\n            policies; and (iii) improve the efficiency of spending and\n            human resource management, and effectiveness of service\n            delivery in basic education and health sectors, while also\n            tackling the challenge of rapid population growth and\n            women's rights. The first tranche of RSRC-2, was\n            disbursed in August 2007. The conditions of release of the\n            second tranche as listed in the financing agreement that\n            have been met are as follows: (i) the progress achieved by\n            the recipient in carrying out the program is satisfactory;\n            (ii) the macroeconomic framework of the recipient is\n            appropriate; and (iii) eleven prior actions have been\n            carried out in material respects."}, "docdt": "2008-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
