The project consists of\n            four components. The first component will streamline\n            economic management through macroeconomic analysis and data\n            management, public resource management, and public\n            administration. The second component will reform public\n            enterprises by supporting the Government's program for\n            divesting public enterprises, designing an adequate\n            regulatory framework and improving the performance\n            monitoring of state-owned enterprises retained in public\n            ownership. The third component will strengthen industrial\n            competitiveness of the private sector by improving the\n            industrial sector knowledge base, upgrading industrial\n            technology and facilitating trade. The fourth component\n            focuses on project coordination and implementation by\n            strengthening institutional capacity."}, "docdt": "1998-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
