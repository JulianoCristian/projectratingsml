A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
This project aims to provide technical assistance to improve the capacity of the Royal
Thai Government for effective management of Thailand's economy, which has been adversely
affected by the recent currency and banking crisis. The project supports measures to: (i) upgrade
macroeconomic management and public administration; t(ii) reform public enterprises; and
(iii) strengthen the competitiveness of Thailand's industrial sector. The project is expected to
contribute to a revival of economic growth and renewed export performance by bolstering the
effectiveness of the public sector and the competitiveness of private industry.
This project would be part of a broader effort supporting Thailand's stabilization and
structural adjustment program to restore sustainable high rates of economic growth. It would
complement the standby facility provided by the IMF and[ the emergency financing package from
bilateral and multilateral sources. The project is the second of two TA loans to buttress this
assistance. A Financial Sector Implementation Assistance Loan was approved by the Board on
September 11, 1997, underpinning several consecutive fast-disbursing policy-based loans
designed to implement the macroeconomic program. A Finance Companies Restructuring Loan
was presented to the Board on December 23, 1997 which focuses on resolving the suspended
finance companies. An Economic and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan would follow to ensure
the soundniess of the financial sector, support the privatization agenda, enhance the framework
for corporate governance; and a Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) would cover broader
structural measures to restore the conditions for rapid economic growth. A Public Expenditure
Reform Loan to improve revenue and expenditure management is under consideration.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 13458-TH Date of latest CAS discussion: August 9, 1994
Thailand's most recent Country Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Board in 1994.
Given the country's changed circumstances a new CAS is expected to ready by May 1998.
The project emphasizes improving economic management and competitiveness which
supports the first two of the three goals at the center of the Bank's future strategy: (1) Building
good governance for economic revival. Improved economic performance relies on streamlined
public administration, including privatization, plus increased transparency and efficiency in
providing Government services. (2) Renewing competitiveness andfostering productive
investment help the private sector to rekindle growth, revive export and provide jobs. Financial
sector reform, an enabling environment and real energy and infrastructure sector interventions
will encourage financial sector stability and enhance competitiveness. (3) Sharing growth and
ensuring quality of life for everyone reaches local communities. Investments in environmental
protection, social safety nets and human development include the poor, especially in rural areas,
in the development process.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy.
The new Thai Government is fully committed to irmplement the stabilization program
agreed with the IMF following the financial and currency crisis of July 1997. The Government's
immediate priority is to maintain macroeconomic stability and restore investor confidence by
resolving the suspended finance companies and improving the soundness of the financial sector.



7
Meanwhile Government must also revive economic growth which has slowed
considerably since the economic crisis. This will require reversing the weaknesses of economic
policy making and declining export performance, largely overlooked during the economic boom
of the last decade. To upgrade the resilience and competitiveness of the Thai economy, policy
over the medium term must restore institutional capacity for a sound macroeconomic strategy,
and create a sound environment for renewed private sector exports.
First, Government must ensure coherence of macroeconomic policy making and strategy,
especially for public finance. Given the need for fiscal retrenchment and improving the
effectiveness of the public sector, the Government has to prioritize public expenditures,
streamline budget implementation, improve tax collection and modernize the civil service. To
focus government interventions on priority areas and increase overall efficiency, there is also a
need to divest state-owned enterprises to the private sector, establish the regulatory framework
for the competitive provision of services in sectors such as energy, transport and communications
and to enhance the performance monitoring of those key SOEs remaining in public ownership.
Second, with a recession looming, the Government needs to strengthen the ability of the
private sector to compete in the global economy by laying the long-term foundations for
increasing governance, facilitating the absorption of technology, upgrading the skills of the labor
force and removing obstacles to renewed export growth. Due to Thailand's favorable business
environment over the past decade the private sector became the main engine for growth, albeit
with a lax regulatory environment.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Given the urgency of the financial crisis, the companion project to this operation aimed
to lhelp resolve the suspended financial companies and safeguard the soundness of the financial
sector. This Economic Management Assistance Loan is designed to bolster the Government's
capacity for implementing broader medium term structural reforms. It aims to strengthen
economic management in economic analysis, public finance and public administration; support
the reform of state enterprises and public administration; dismantle structural obstacles to
investment efficiency and sharpen Thailand's international competitiveness by strengthening the
enabling environment for private sector operations.
To meet these objectives, the Government would require assistance:
1. to formulate a coherent macroeconomic and fiscal strategy through
macroeconomic analysis and data management, public resource management, and
public administration;
2. to reform state-owned enterprises by supporting the Government's program for
divesting public enterprises, designing an adequate regulatory framework and
improving the performance monitoring of SOEs retained in public ownership;
3. to sharpen industrial competitiveness of the private sector by improving the
industrial sector knowledge base, upgrading industrial technology and facilitating
trade;
4. to improve project coordination and implementation by strengthening institutional
capacity.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The proposed project would support key reforms in: (i) the Government's capacity to design and
implement a coherent macroeconomic and fiscal strategy; (ii) consistent, efficient and more equitable
public resource allocations; (iii) a comprehensive policy framework for divestiture of public ownership
and oversight of state enterprises; (iv) concession arrangements for private sector entry into infrastructure
provision and development of competitive markets; and (v) the removal of bottlenecks to industrial
competitiveness and corporate transparency in the areas of trade, skills development and technology
absorption.
Institution building is integral to these efforts:(i) to improve data management and set up a fiscal
policy research institute that would provide policy makers with up-to-date reliable information and
quality analysis; (ii) to implement intensive programs for bolstering the effectiveness of public
expenditure planning, budget management, budgetary disbursement and tax collection; (iii) to develop an
effective monitoring system of state enterprise performance and regulation of privatized enterprises, and
(iv) to enhlanice the public framework for strengthened private sector competitiveness.
3. Benefits and target population:
The project is a strategic follow-up to Bank assistance to the Government following the recent
financial and foreign exchange crisis. This project aims to strengthen the Government's institutional
capabilities and to prepare some key structural changes required to resume high rates of sustained
economic growth. It will help to strengthen the analytical and technical basis for economic policy
making, budget management and resource allocation, improvements in public administration and
structural changes in the public enterprise sector; it will also help strengthen the enabling environment for
the private sector by providing infrastructure services.
This assistance to reinvigorate Thailand's competitive position in the global market place will
benefit the Thai population at large by helping the country regain its growth momentum. By
strengthening the government's financial position, reducing the direct infrastructure service it provides
and streamlining public administration, the project would also help refocus the public sector on lower
income groups which are bound to bear the brunt of the costs of short-term economic adjustment.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The implementation period of the Loan would cover a period of approximately two and a half
years to complement the proposed structural adjustment lending to be provided by the Bank. The
executing agency under the project would be the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will support the Ministry of Finapce in managing the
project, and in coordinating and following-up activities under the different project components to ensure
successful implementation. The PIU will be attached to the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) within the
Ministry of Finance. It will be directed ex officio by the Director General of FPO. A senior staff from
FPO would act on a part-time basis as Deputy Director with powers to hire and request disbursements
from the Bank. A Project Manager appointed by the government in agreement with the World Bank will
be in charge of day-to-day project implementation. A Project Implementation Advisor would assist the
Project Manager in preparing consultant contracts and in monitoring the work under the various project
components to ensure technical quality. Specialized expertise would be financed for the PIU to handle the
administrative, procurement auditing and accounting needs of project execution. The PIU for this project,
the Deputy Director and any PIU staff would not normally be involved in the project coordination of the
Bank-supported Financial Sector Implementation Assistance Loan.



10
Under the coordination of the Fiscal Policy Office, several implementation agencies would be
the focus of the project activities, including various departments of the Ministry of Finance (FPO,
Comptroller General, Revenue Department, Excise Department, Customs Department), the Bureau of the
Budget, the Civil Service Commission, the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB),
and the Ministry of Industry. Each implementing agency would assign a counterpart for the project. A
Project Steering Committee comprising these department representatives would convene regularly under
the chairmanship of the Director General of FPO to give ove.rall policy guidance and to monitor progress
of project implementation. The Project Steering Committee would normally have a different membership
than the Steering Committee of the World Bank-supported Flinancial Sector Implementation Assistance
Loan. On the World Bank's side, supervision would be carried out by the Country Management Unit
based in Bangkok in coordination with more specialized staff in units at headquarters.
Under the Prime Minister Office's Regulation on State Enterprise Policy Management
Monitoring of December 19, 1997, responsibility for state enterprise improvement and the privatization
program rests with the State Enterprise Policy Commission (SEPC). The SEPC is chaired by the Deputy
Prime Minister and includes ministers and heads of the concerned agencies, including the Finance
Minister, the Secretary General of NESDB, the Secretary General of the Budget Bureau, the Auditor
General, the Permanent Secretary for Finance, the Comptroller General and six experts from the private
sector. The Permanent Secretary for Finance serves as the secretary to the SEPC and the day-to-day
implementation of commission decisions rests with the Office of the Secretary to the SEPC. Effective and
competent staff support to this secretariat office is a key factor the success in implementing the
Government's privatization program. This responsibility has been assigned to the Office of the State
Enterprise and Government Portfolio at the Comptroller General's Department, and the Office of the
NESDB.
The various components of the proposed project must be carried out according to terms and
reference acceptable to the Bank; these would generally provide the basis for time-bound action plans
which will be furnished for approval by the Bank. Recommendations for action plans would be agreed
with the Bank prior to implementation. Any training under this project would be carried out according to
programs and timetables acceptable to the Bank. Terms of reference for the key project phases were
agreed upon during negotiations. Detailed implementation plans for each component would be regularly
updated and submitted to the Bank for approval during project implementation.
Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing. Project records and accounts would be maintained by the
FPO to reflect the operations, resources and expenditures for each project activity, in accordance with
sound accounting practices. The accounts will be consolidated annually into financial statements for the
whole project. Supporting documentation will be made availalble to the Bank's Country Management
Unit and independent auditors as required. For expenditures incurred on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures, all records providing evidence for such expenditures will be retained by the PIU until at
least one year after the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal
from the Loan Account or payment out of the Special Account is made, whichever is later. The control
environment of implementing agencies will be assessed, and appropriate accounting and reporting
systems would be developed according to the requirements of OP/OB 10.02 through separate technical
assistance. The accounting and reporting system will be ready for implementation by the time of project
effectiveness. Project records and accounts, including the Special Account and Statements of
Expenditures, will be audited annually by the Auditor-General- s Office in accordance with appropriate
auditing principles that are consistently applied by auditors acceptable to the Bank, with terms of
reference for auditors and reports approved by the Bank. The 13ank's Financial Accounting, Reporting,
and Auditing Handbook (FARAH) published in January 1995, as well as other financial manuals would



11
be used by the auditors according to the Bank's auditing guidelines. Audit reports will be furnished to the
Bank within four months after the close of the Government's fiscal year.
Monitoring of project execution will be undertaken by the PIU which will submit to the Bank
for its approval semi-annual project reports not later than May 1 and November I of each year, starting
1998, including (a) a retrospective assessment in meeting agreed outputs, and (b) working plans for the
following six months. Annual reviews of the project will be carried out not later than December 15 of
each year, starting in 1998, to assess progress in project implementation, review government follow-up to
agreed policy recommendations and to adjust the scope of the project as necessary.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The new Government has demonstrated its commitment to take the measures needed to stabilize
the economy and to strengthen the financial sector. At the same time, the Government wants to take
strategic advantage of the present economic crisis to remedy medium-term institutional and structural
weaknesses. The proposed project aims to assist the Government in this endeavor. As a result, it reflects
specific Government requests in key areas which have a direct impact on economic performance. The
guiding principle in designing the Loan was to respond quickly and constructively to the various
immediate needs of the Government, rather than prepare comprehensive proposals in depth with a more
limited coverage. This approach has successfully forged a collaborative partnership which will be
essential to undertake the process of institutional and competitive strengthening. The proposed assistance
would enhance the technical capability of the Government for sound economic management; advance the
reforn and privatization of state enterprises; and buttress industrial competitiveness. Wlhile the range of
assistance is broad, individual components have been chosen carefully by the Government for operational
relevance and results.
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Technical assistance loans need strong political and stakeholder commitment to be successful.
Moreover, in situations of economic stress, preparation must be expeditious and the design flexible.
These lessons have been taken into account in preparing the proposed Loan. A high degree of



12
Government ownership has been ensured by close consultations at all levels. The Loan has been
structured to specify separate lead counterparts and terms of reference for each subcomponent, reflecting
the priorities of each key agency. Assistance under the propo;sed project is focused on operational
relevance which will initiate action programs in all areas covered by the Loan. While some of the
programs will be completed by loan closing and others are long-term.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Royal Thai Government has urged the Bank at the highest levels to initiate the proposed
project within a very short time frame. The Government has a strong commitment to the existing IMF
program. The objectives of this Loan also support the IMF program. The Government clearly recognizes
that prompt action through structural adjustment is required to limit wider adverse repercussions of the
financial crisis and return Thailand to sustainable growth. Government commitment is evidenced by the
appointment of respected economic technocrats to high-level positions and recent efforts to formulate a
coherent agenda of policy reforms. Moreover, the Government is committing substantial local resources
to all components of the project.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project.
The Bank can add value by (i) helping to restore international confidence in the government's
economic policies and in its program of support to financial sector restructuring; (ii) contributing its wide
international experience in design of economic reforms, public expenditure management, state enterprise
reform and in supporting strategies for enhanced private sector competitiveness; (iii) contributing its
experience in combining macrostabilization and structural adjustment programs; and (iv) sourcing
international consultants with expertise in the project component areas.
E: Summary Project Analysis
1. Economic:
Although the project does not lend itself to standard cost-benefit analysis, it will improve the
efficiency of resource allocation and hence returns on investment generally. Specifically, improved public
resource management, better performance of state enterprises and enhanced private sector export
competitiveness are expected to improve investment criteria and implementation capacity.
2. Financial:
The project is expected to yield significant returns by augmenting the Royal Thai
Government's institutional capacity for (i) achieving macrostabilization of the economy; (ii) formulating
a coherent macroeconomic and fiscal strategy; (iii) improving the mobilization, planning, allocation and
disbursement of public resources; (iii) improving the performance of SOEs and focusing public sector
involvement on essential areas; (iv) strengthening the framework for a more efficient allocation of
investment resources; and (v) promoting the resiliency and international competitiveness of Thailand's
industrial sector.
Fiscal impact:
The project is expected to assist in minimizing the fiscal impact and increasing the fiscal revenue
base by (i) improving data management and fiscal projections; (ii) raising fiscal revenues through
improved collection of taxes and customs duties; (iii) augmenting available fiscal resources by offering
enterprises for sale, containing budgetary support for public enterprises and streamlining the pricing
policy of utilities; and (iv) increasing transparency of the Thai industry.



13
3. Technical:
The project will ensure that the Royal Thai Government obtains access to high quality expertise
and intemational best practice available from external consultants.
4. Institutional:
a. Implementing agencies:
The project aims to improve the capability of key economic agencies (Ministry of Finance,
Office of the Civil Service Commission, State Enterprise Policy Commission, Bureau of the Budget,
Ministry of Industry and NESDB) to formulate and implement policies to deal with the economic crisis,
strengthen the regulatory environment for fiscal management and state enterprises and to face the
challenges posed by the exposure of Thailand to increasing globalization.
b. Project management:
The project will be coordinated by an inter-agency Project Steering Committee. Project
implementation, procurement and disbursement will be managed by the Project Implementation Unit
attached to FPO, which would act as the government's main counterpart for the project. Consulting
expertise will provide support to the PIU to draw up invitations for proposals, evaluate bids, procurement
and auditing.
5. Social:

6. Environmental assessment:  Environmental Category    []A   []B    [x] C
7. Participatory approach:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
Extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives
from government agencies, financial institutions, corporations, industrialists and bankers. In addition, the
project has been designed to build consensus with other stakeholders (e.g. private market participants) in
the process of implementing the contemplated tasks.
b. Other key stakeholders:
The project will benefit the Thai population at large by supporting measures that should ease the present
fiscal pressure and assist with a more coordinated macroeconomic policy. More efficient tax collection,
more equitable expenditure planning and improved governance would ensure that the burden of economic
adjustment is shared more evenly and the fiscal restraint can be alleviated. Improved export performance
of the private sector would contribute to reviving growth, shortening the period of adjustment and
providing jobs.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability.
Sustainability is an intrinsic element of the project development objective, in that the technical
assistance loan aims to improve macroeconomic management leading to sustainable high growth of the
Thai economy. The various outputs of the proposed project are expected to lead to broad ranging policy
reforms that would improve governance and strengthen competitiveness, such as streamlining the budget
system and privatization. It is anticipated that subsequent structural adjustment operations will provide
financial support, as needed, in implementing these reforms.

Economic Management Assistance Project
Project Description
Objectives
The project would provide technical assistance, training, and capacity building support to
assist the Royal Thai Government in successfully initiating a structural adjustment program aimed at
restoring high sustainable growth levels as soon as possible. The project complements the Financial
Implementation Assistance Loan approved by the Board of the World Bank on September 11, 1997
which strengthens the management of the financial sector and provides technical assistance to the
Government to resolve problems relating to suspended financial companies. The Bank is also closely
coordinating its assistance program with other multilateral lenders, including the International
Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank.
This Economic Management Assistance Loan is designed to strengthen the institutional
underpinning of economic management to provide the fundamentals for resuming sustained growth.
It seeks to remove structural obstacles by increasing the Government's capacity to implement a
coherent macroeconomic adjustment program; rationalizing public expenditures, enhancing the
efficiency of public administration and state-owned enterprises; and promoting Thailand's industrial
competitiveness. To meet these objectives, four distinct components for implementation assistance
have been identified:
1.  to build Government's capacity for economic management to formulate a coherent
macroeconomic and fiscal strategy through macroeconomic analysis and data management
public resource management and renewal of public administration;
2. to reform state-owned enterprises by supporting the Government's program of privatization
and performance improvement of public enterprises, plus developing effective regulatory
oversight for providing infrastructure services;
3.  to sharpen industrial competitiveness of the private sector by improving the knowledge base
of the problems faced by enterprises through regular surveys; developing skills and upgrading
the technology; improving the public policy framework for competitiveness, and facilitating
international trade;
4.  to improve project coordination and implementation by strengthening institutional capacity.
Project Component 1. Streamlining Economic Management - US$5.0 million
Thailand's economic crisis has highlighted the importance of sound economic management.
Investors and policy makers alike have been surprised at the depth of Thailand's balance of
payments crisis, the resulting stress on the financial sector and the subsequent contraction in
economic growth. The new Govertiment can use the present crisis as an opportunity to make the
public sector more resilient and effective in leading Thailand's economic recovery. The key lesson
from the past is not to ignore weaknesses of economic policy even though they may be obscured by
high growth performance.



Annex 2
Page 2 of 16
This component would help strengthen the Government's capacity for macroeconomic
analysis and improved fiscal management. It would provide technical assistance to guide policy
making in three critical areas: (i) the macroeconomic framework, (ii) public resource management;
and (iii) the renewal of public administration. It will support a comprehensive effort to improve the
effectiveness of economic management, resource mobilization, expenditure prioritization, and
enhanced public sector transparency during fiscal retrenchment.
1.1 Macroeconomic Analysis
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$2.0 million
After years of uninterrupted high growth, Thailand is now being confronted with the need for
macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment. To ensure confidence in its economic management, the
Government will need to contain adverse repercussions of the financial sector crisis on the rest of the
economy, maintain stringent fiscal and monetary policies and ensure sustained growth. Meeting these
challenges will require a strong capacity for independent and high quality macroeconomic analysis to
guide economic policy decisions and realistic budget preparation during a difficult time of economic
adjustment. Technical assistance would focus on institution building in the Fiscal Policy Office
(FPO) within the Ministry of Finance, the NESDB, the Bureau of the Budget and the Bank of
Thailand in the following areas:
(i) Macroeconomic assessment outlook. During the operation, a detailed analysis of Thailand's
medium-term macroeconomic outlook would be prepared on a semi-annual basis. These policy notes
would review recent economic developments, and contain realistilc forecasts of key economic
indicators. The objective would be to highlight fundamental problems that have led to the current
economic crisis, recommend policy options to revive growth while maintaining stability and guide
policy makers in drawing lessons for successful economic policy in the future. The semi-annual notes
would provide the macroeconomic underpinning of the five-year Development plan and three-year
rolling plan for public borrowing to ensure consistency of expenditure and deficit targets with public
revenue forecasts. This exercise would be a collaborative effort involving the FPO, NESDB, the
Bureau of the Budget and the Bank of Thailand.
Project timing: 04/1998-04/2000 (twenty-four months)
(ii) Data Management Under the IMF program, the Government has agreed to improve the quality
of economic data. Under a decision of August 19, 1997, the Cabinet appointed the Budget Bureau in
the Ministry of Finance and the NESDB to consolidate an economic information system to report,
monitor and publicly disseminate economic data at the macro and micro level. This would involve
establishing a centralized information system as an early warning device. For this purpose, the
Cabinet requested technical assistance to strengthen data managernent in the economic core agencies
(NESDB, the Ministry of Finance, the Bureau of the Budget, the Bank of Thailand and other
agencies), which would improve the quality of economic statistics for decision making. Technical
assistance under this component would include:
a) prepare an Economic Information System to analyze the present system of data management,
recommend improvements, develop recommended formats of data presentation, and provide a
work and financial plan to be implemented over the following six months;



Annex 2
Page 3 of 16
b) propose a suitable institution and information network for the Economic Information System,
plus design improved timely reporting procedures for policy makers on key economic and
financial indicators and their policy implications;
c) train personnel to manage economic statistics, develop forecasting tools and alternative
scenarios;
d) provide assistance to develop regular updates on detailed medium-term projections of the
government's revenue outlook, including alternative realistic scenarios based on assumptions
for growth and other key parameters.
Project timing: 04/1998-12/1999 (twenty months)
(iii) Fiscal and Monetary Research. Thailand's stabilization program has greatly increased the
pressure on public finances and highlighted the need for skilled personnel to provide a credible fiscal
policy. Government staff responsible for areas such as exchange rate projections and project
appraisal need to adapt their analytical skills to deal with a floating exchange rate regime. The project
would cover three activities to strengthen the capacity for fiscal and monetary research:
(a) Training. Training in macroeconomic policy analysis and short-term macroeconomic
assessment, including fiscal and monetary policy under a floating exchange rate regime,
would consist of seminars and courses for key government personnel in core agencies,
including the FPO, NESDB and the Bureau of the Budget.
(b) Fiscal Projections. Assistance would be provided to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of
Finance for regularly updating detailed medium-term projections of the government's
revenue outlook, including alternative realistic scenarios based on various assumptions for
growth and other key parameters.
(c) Research and Monitoring Unit. Training and consulting advice would be provided to set up
and staff a ministerial think tank within the Ministry of Finance. Modeled on the International
Finance Bureau in Japan, the government is seeking to establish separate unit for economic
surveillance or a Fiscal Policy Research Institute. This special unit would monitor economic
developments and give analytical guidance for macroeconomic policy making. This
subcomponent would evaluate the scope for improving fiscal and monetary policy research
within the Ministry of Finance, define the functions and provide assistance to establish an
institutional framework in the form of a separate unit. To provide adequate staffing and
access to best practice for the Ministry of Finance, financing would be provided for the
recruitment of several international experts in fiscal and monetary policy.
Project timing: 04/1998-12/1999 (twenty months)
(iv) Debt Monitoring. The banking crisis and the ensuing speculative attacks on the Thai currency have
shown that the Government's information about Thailand's external debt position, and particularly
private debt has been insufficient. Improved monitoring of private and public debt flows could have
provided early warning signals. The Government therefore wants to set up a debt management unit to
support the Debt Policy Committee and improve the monitoring of private and public debt. Technical
assistance would be sought to upgrade the existing debt monitoring system, ensure an accurate
reporting of private and public debt and coordinate the flow of debt information between the Fiscal
Policy Office and the Central Bank.
Project timing: 04/1998-09/1998

1.2 Public Resource Management
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component. US$1.5 million
The objective of this sub-component is to increase the efficiency and equity of the management
of public resources through more rational budget allocations, streamlined budget systems, more
transparent government payment systems and improved tax administration. The assistance for budget
reform aims to establish a sound and transparent medium-term public expenditure framework and
streamline administrative procedures for expenditure planning and budget execution. Technical
assistance is designed to support the Masterplan of the Bureau of the Budget, which covers the areas of
reorienting the role of the Bureau, budget policy, a result-oriented budgeting system, and budget
process re-engineering. Comprehensive studies, expert advice, information technology and training
would be provided to support institution-building in the following areas:
(i) Public expenditure and investment review. This subcomponent aims to strengthen the capacity of
the Bureau of the Budget for regular expenditure reviews. On the basis of a thorough analysis of past,
present and planned budget expenditure items, a comprehensive review of Thailand's public
expenditure and investment program would identify areas where the efficiency and equity in the
functional and economic composition of public expenditures could be improved. Given the tight fiscal
situation, the Government should not be involved in the provision of goods and services which could
otherwise be provided by the private sector, but should instead focus on areas which are likely to be
underprovided, e.g. public goods, social programs and poverty alleviation. In view of the social costs of
the economic adjustment, public expenditures motivated on grounds of poverty alleviation should be
used to benefit the very poorest. Given the lack of progressivity of Thailand's tax structure, the review
should also make concrete proposals on the mechanisms that should be built to ensure that public
expenditures tend to benefit the very poor. The public expenditure review would therefore make
recommendations to:
a) prioritize expenditures in key sectors within the available resource envelope over the medium
term;
b) ensure adequate operations and maintenance expenditures;
c) establish an appropriate proportion of capital to current expenditures;
d) identify potential public expenditure programs of lower priority and investment projects with low
returns;
e) suggest appropriate pricing policies, potential for cost recovery and the scope for private sector
delivery of services in health, education, transport and other key sectors;
f) highlight potential areas for budgetary savings while recommending expenditure shift to
safeguard social sectors and alleviate poverty by focusing on the urban and rural poor.
Project timing: 03/1998-09/1998
(ii) Modernizing budget management. Thailand's present fiscal stress highlights the need to review the
outcome and impact of expenditures. A priority of the Bureau of the Budget's Masterplan is to
strengthen public expenditure planning to allocate resources more efficiently and more consistently
with the development plan. Over the next few years, the Bureau of the Budget is undertaking a step-by-
step approach towards its long-term objective to formulate and implement an effective medium-term



Annex 2
Page 5 of 16
program and performance budgeting framework that is consistent with realistic macroeconomic
forecasts. This subcomponent support the Masterplan in developing a result-oriented budgeting system
and advancing budget decentralization, technical assistance will be provided in two phases, a short
review followed by implementation.
Phase 1:
a) Review budget system. This would involve a critical review of the process, organization and
function of the existing planning and budgeting processes for current and capital public
expenditures and requirements in terms of human resources, data and organizational structure
of the Bureau of the Budget. The analysis should lead to clear recommendations on options to
strengthen the implementation of the Masterplan, reinforced by international best practice. The
analysis would also include an plan to implement the Masterplan in Phase 2 of the project: It
would identify key milestones, task descriptions and mechanisms for monitoring performance
under the reformulated process.
Project timing: 03/1998-07/1998 (four months)
Phase 2
b) Retool Budgeting System. Technical assistance would be provided to implement the
recommendations of phase I of the project. It would center on an effective introduction of
performance-based budgeting, including improved budget classification, enhanced links
between annual plans and budgets, as well as rationalized and comprehensive accounts of the
consolidated government, including central, provincial, municipal, and extra-budgetary
accounts. This assistance would involve international expert advice, workshops and training.
Project timing: 08/1998-2/2000 (eighteen months)
c) Fiscal Decentralization. Under the 8th National Economic and Social Development Plan, the
Government is committed to further decentralize the budget execution process. Expert advice
on fiscal decentralization would be provided in three steps to make further progress towards a
more flexible and equitable decentralized budget execution by empowering central
departments, provincial administrative organizations and local authorities. First, building on the
broad range of existing work and involving public consultations in seminars, consulting advice
would provide a diagnostic review of the fiscal burden-sharing, determine the scope for
budgetary decentralization measures, and develop recommendations for an effective strategy.
This would include an evaluation of the scope and proposals for strengthening the capacity of
local governments to deal with fiscal management and revenue matters more effectively.
Second, based on the recommended options, this would be followed by assistance to formulate
appropriate decentralization measures which would be proposed to the Cabinet for approval.
Third, once the political approval is obtained, a systematic road map for medium-term
decentralization would be developed, including the appropriate revisions of related laws and
regulations.
Project timing: 08/1998-08/2000 (twenty-four months)
d)   Budget Expenditure Modeling. Comparatively limited technical assistance would be provided
to build an econometric model for estimating annual and medium-term budget expenditures.
This would provide technical tools for more systematic, accurate and timely budget planning
and facilitate program budgeting. Based on international best practice, the model would enable
a more fine-tuned budget policy formulation in line with economic policy changes and the



Annex 2
Page 6 of 16
fiscal situation. Technical expertise under this project would be sought to (i) analyze and
identify the relevant variables of the model, compile the necessary data, analyze data
consistency, develop the database system; (ii) develop, test, modify and finalize model
specifications; (iii) train technical personnel in the use of the model; and (iv) use the model in
the formulation of the budget plan.
Project timing: 01/1999-12/1999 (twelve months)
(iii) Government Payments Systems. Budgetary control is an essential tool for administering
expenditures consistent with established programs and policies. The Comptroller General's
Department is in charge of monitoring disbursement functions and improving the budgetary
funds disbursement system, thus performing the functions of the treasury throughout the country.
There has been a successful program of enhancing the procedures of disbursement function and
methods of payment in general by introducing a computerized disbursement system, a one-day
process of verification and approval of projects, and discontinuing attached documents to
petition. To build an effective disbursement system, further structural changes are needed. A re-
engineering plan for budgetary-fund disbursement system is underway to ensure data integrity
through (i) decentralization of disbursement duties to governmental agencies; (ii) encouraging
private sector participation (banks and finance institutions) in government operations; (iii)
introducing advanced technology to increase operation efficiency; and shift the Controller-
General Department's role from controlling to monitoring.
A new disbursement system incorporating these concepts would classify expenditures into three
groups according to methods of payment; covering payments for regular expenditures, for
significant capital expenditures and for minor expenditures. This would be complemented by an
upgraded computerized management information system to provide timely fiscal data. The
component would finance technical advice and training to support three tasks:
a) Evaluation of Budget Execution System. Assistance would be provided for a comprehensive
study of the existing government payment system and recommendations for improvements,
including a review of the control structure, account classification and reporting
requirements;
b) Upgrade Fiscal Information System. This would provide an analysis of the present
management information system and provide a detailed plan for a new customized fiscal
information system, which would be designed to prese:nt accurate and responsive
information in an efficient and timely manner; and
c) Information Technology. To specify the procurement needs for information technology, a
detailed strategy for improving the Comptroller's electronic data processing system
development would provide a master plan for computer system development.
Project timing: 03/1998-05/1998 (two months for activities a, b); 06/1998-02/1999 (eight
months for activity c).
(iv) Tax Administration. Years of abundant tax revenues providecl little incentive to improve the
efficiency and equity of tax collection. For example, only 5 million people out of a population of more
than 60 million pay personal income tax. Similarly, a tax computerization project supported by the
World Bank has had disappointing results due to lack of transparency and Government commitment
(ICR No.16745). The economic crisis has put pressure on the collection departments in the Ministry of



Annex 2
Page 7 of 16
Finance (Revenue Department, Excise Department and Customs Department) to reverse the sharp drop
in fiscal revenues. Since the scope for raising taxes is clearly limited by social concerns and new taxes
can only be introduced after extensive political consultations, a large part of the adjustment must come
from increased efficiency and transparency of the tax administration. Given the fiscal shortfall, there is
no real alternative to a thorough overhaul of the system of revenue collection.
This sub-component would aim to contribute to revenue generation through a comprehensive
analysis of the present tax system (Phase I), and a detailed blueprint for organizational restructuring,
information technology, and training (Phase II).
Phase I
a) Review taxation procedures. Assess and improve practices relating to promptness and
accuracy of service, taxpayer compliance and identification, formulation of tax legislation and
administrative regulations, preparation of administrative and analytical statistics and revenue
forecasts, tax assessment, audit programming, tax collection accounting, arrears follow-up and
control procedures to check on reliability of income declarations. Streamlined taxation
procedures would aim to substantially raise taxpayer compliance, particularly collecting large
arrears.
Project timing: 02/1998-07/1998 (five months)
Phase II
b) Improve organizational structure. Strengthen management functions and operational
capabilities in headquarters and local offices.
c) Strengthen personnel and assess staff needs. Identify skill shortages and training needs;
formulate a medium-term personnel strategy to recruit, develop, and shed staff.
d) Formulate information technology blueprint. Assess existing information technology and
provide improved computerization and management information systems.
Project timing: 08/1998-12/1998 (four months)
1.3 Administrative Renewal
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$1.5 million
Thailand's economic difficulties have put a premium on effective administrative performance
to restore the credibility of the Government's economic management. At a time when budgets are
being strictly cut, the challenge for Thailand's public administration will be to improve the quality of
its service delivery while streamlining the size of the civil service and improving governance. The
Office of the Civil Service Commission (OCSC) has begun to prepare a comprehensive strategy for
modernizing Thailand's public administration:
* increase the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of public personnel and government
agencies;
*  reduce operating costs by right-sizing the civil service;
*  improving the quality of personnel; and
*  increase transparency and political neutrality of the civil service.



Annex 2
Page 8 of 16
Unambiguous objectives and measurable targets are intencded to refocus the public sector on its
core functions. The OCSC's proposed strategies include a broad range of measures, ranging from
revising outdated regulations and reappraising all public functions to empowering front-line
managers and fighting corruption. It aims to reduce the civil service by at least 20 percent within the
next four years through privatization, transfer to local authorities, early retirement, part-time
employment and contracting. Pursuing improved public sector performance would be backed up by
performance-based budgeting by the Bureau of the Budget.
These efforts for administrative renewal are supported by the project in three key areas-both
analytical work and assistance. The work would be carried in two steps for each component to be
flexibly implemented over two years: First, analysis, recommendations and an agreed action plan;
and second, implementation assistance.
a) Improve Efficiency of Public Administration. To focus government agencies on effective
delivery of results, international best practice would guide technical assistance to the Civil
Service Commission in establishing clear mission statements, job descriptions, as well as key
performance indicators. Once established, such indicators would effectively help the OCSC
create a performance-based public administration. Redefiniing operational functions would
include the redesign of organizational structures to establish a modern administrative process.
The main goal of the exercise would be to design a workable blueprint for streamlining
government agencies and reorienting operating processes to ensure the efficient delivery of
core government functions. Enhanced transparency of the public sector would also require a
review of government procurement processes and procedures. This would be accompanied by
seminars, workshops and training for staff and key policy makers in best practice for civil
service reform. Moreover, the project would support the drafting of the necessary legislation to
put the administrative renewal into action. It would also develop public relations programs
which aim both at the staff in government agencies and the public at large.
Project timing: 02/1998-08/1998 (six months)
b) Develop Civil Service Personnel Management System. Cornprehensive personnel policy should
include a development framework, a training program and an incentive system linked to
performance. To ensure that highly qualified professionals are recruited and retained in the
civil service, technical advice would suggest steps to introduce performance-based evaluation,
compensation and recruitment systems. Moreover, the Government has requested advice on
creating a senior management corps, to facilitate Government efficiency and Thailand's
international competitiveness. These recommendations would provide the basis for a realistic
personnel management action plan which the Civil Service Commission can put into practice.
Project timing: 08/1998-12/1998 (four months)
c)   Rightsize Public Administration. Thailand's public administration has come under pressure to
simplify its administrative norms, focus on delivering quality services to clients and withdraw from
functions best left to the private sector. Reduced operating costs, minimizing duplication of efforts
and streamlining the bureaucratic apparatus are the objectives of expert advice which would assess
the scope for outsourcing non-core functions to the private sector and developing public-private
partnerships for the effective delivery of services. This would also include support for the OCSC's
plan to establish two organizations: a Transition Center responsib'le for preparing skills of public
personnel needed for transferring to the private sector; and a Job Placement Center which will be
responsible for matching skills of public personnel with jobs available in the private sector.
Project timing: 01/1999-05/1999 (four months)

Project Component 2. Public Enterprise Reform - US$6.8 million
The recent economic crisis and the subsequent IMF financing package has provided the
impetus for moving ahead with a comprehensive program of public enterprise reform. To regain
investor confidence, the new Government is committed to increase enterprise efficiency and
economic performance through a comprehensive privatization program. It is currently preparing a
Master Plan for reformning and divesting public enterprises at an accelerated pace over the next few
years. The exact details of this SOE reform program are still under discussion, but it is likely to use at
least three options of divestiture: liquidation; joint ventures, and partial or full privatization (i.e. sale
of more than 50% of public sector shares).
No final decisions have been taken regarding the scope and timing of privatization, but
the latest schedule of privatization drawn up by the Secretariat to the State Policy Commission
envisages the divestiture of the public sector share in several major SOEs and the liquidation of
several others. If the respective public sector shares were to be sold in public offerings at average
historic prices, this could yield an estimated income of Btl,581 million in 1997, Bt257,117 million in
1998 and Bt8O,819 million in 1999. According to the agreement with the IMF, proceeds from
privatization are to be set aside as a contingency fund for the potential costs of financial sector
restructuring. At the same time, the Government is aware that a substantial sale of state holdings in
the present depressed market may yield an inferior result to strategic placements, a more gradual
approach or other options and is therefore interested to be guided by international best practice.
Assistance under this component would help the Secretariat of the State Enterprise Policy
Commission (SEPC) implement the government program of reform and privatization of state-owned
enterprises. It would include support for diagnostic studies, strategy formulation and implementation,
institutional strengthening, consultation with the investment community and key interest groups, and
evaluation of results. The main objective of the new program is to increase the competitiveness and
efficiency of SOEs and, more generally, the provision of infrastructure services, while maximizing
the resources to the government from divestiture and minimizing contributions to the SOEs. For
pursuing this program, the government will be guided by the following principles:
*  select efficient solutions over the quick generation of cash;
*  maximize the scope for competitive forces and minimize the need for economic regulations;
* conduct the process of Government divestiture and private sector participation in a transparent
and equitable fashion with due consideration for the legitimate concerns of all parties; and
*  avoid conflict of interests and interference through clear demarcation of authority and
responsibility of policy, regulatory and operational functions.
2.1 Framework Development for SOE Restructuring and Privatization
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$1.5 million
Activities to ensure a coordinated and consistent approach across sectors include analytical
support, which would be provided in two phases:



Annex 2
Page 10 of 16

a) finalize and fine-tune the Government's Master Plan for state enterprise restructuring and
privatization;
b) prepare the legal foundation and required changes in the legal framework for corporatization
and privatization;
c) establish key parameters for privatization (including labor retrenchment, liability management,
treatment of environmental costs);
d) develop strategic options for market structure development in telecommunications, energy,
transport and water;
Project timing: 02/1998-06/1998 (activity a; four months); 02/1998-10/1998 (activity b, ten months);
02/1998-07/1998 (activities c, d; five months)
Phase II
e) design a blue print outlining rules and options governing the award, amendment, oversight and
revocation of concessions, including conflict resolution;
f) outline options for granting government guarantees and financing for SOEs; and
g) establish mechanisms and procedures for subsidy transfers to private providers of infrastructure
with social services obligations.
Project timing: 08/1998-04/1999 (eight months)
2.2 Institutional Development
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$1.5 million
This sub-component aims to define the longer-term relationships between the state, operators,
investors and consumers. Its objective is to institutionalize the distinct functions of the Government
as policy maker, regulator and operator and to rationalize and strengthen Government implementation
management and regulatory oversight. Expert advice would be provided, in conjunction with or as a
follow-on to the corresponding activities under subcomponent 2.1 and 2.2:
a) clarify the authority, responsibility and accountability of pertinent government agencies for the
restructuring and privatization process;
b) recommend organizational and process arrangements for effective coordination across
institutional levels;
c) design and establish a suitable institutional framework for effective economic regulations of
non-tradable and largely monopolistic services in telecommrunications, energy, transport and
water;
d) strengthen technical capabilities of the Secretariat Office to the State Enterprise Policy
Commission and pertinent staff in related agencies through a program of training, workshops,
twinning and study visits,
e) outline different institutional options, including the creation of a new institution, to act as a
guarantor or financier for privatized enterprises, and to provide financing to SOEs operating in
competitive markets on a transparent arms-length basis; and



Annex 2
Page 11 of 16
f) undertake a public information and sensitization program to support privatization, based on the
identification of critical concerns of key stakebolders such as SOE employees, unions, and
users as well as the public at large.
Project timing: 03/1998-07/1998 (activity a, four months); 07/1998-06/1999 (activity b; eleven
months); 07/1998-2/2000 (activity c; nineteen months); 04/1998-04/2000 (activity d; twenty-four
months); 07/1998-01/1999 (activity e; six months); 08/1998-12/1999 (activity f; sixteen months)
2.3 Privatization Preparation
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$2.3 million
Assistance under this sub-component is aimed at identifying structural options for privatization
and related sector reform and at possible weaknesses in existing pertinent studies and feasibility
reports. The objective is to assist the Secretariat to the State Enterprise Policy Commission to
complete all the necessary preparatory work for the privatization process, so that the Cabinet can take
the final SOE divestiture decisions on the basis of sound technical advice. Specifically, the following
activities would be undertaken in two distinct yet partially overlapping phases:
Phase I:
a) outline a blue print of steps and sequence for corporatization and privatization of SOEs to be
divested;
b) assess privatization options for key state enterprises and provide recommendations.
Project timing: 02/1998-06/1998 (four months)
Phase II:
c) audit ongoing preparatory work on SOE restructuring, liquidation and privatization submitted
by the SOEs to the SEPC for soundness and completeness, including a review and verification
of accounts, analysis of the viability of operations, investment requirements, asset valuation,
and the scope for outsourcing, strategic positioning, tariff setting; and, if appropriate
recommend improved options. This exercise will cover the analysis of about twelve SOE
privatization plans in the sectors of energy, telecommunications, transportation, and other
utilities.
d) prioritize the list of SOEs proposed for privatization and select the method of divestiture based
on costs and benefits. The key outputs of this exercise will be specific recommendations on
divestiture plans for individual companies, including the assessment of alternative options for
liquidations, joint ventures, private placements or public offering of public shareholdings.
Project timing: 02/1998-06/1998 (four months)
2.4 Performance Monitoring
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$1.5 million
In line with the gradual approach the Government is taking in privatizing state enterprises-to
ensure effective preparation for maximum efficiency gain and sales revenue-and in order to achieve
low-cost high quality service provision and effective use of Government resources, this component



Annex 2
Page 12 of 16
will support the introduction of mission statements and modification of corporate charters, as
appropriate, and of compliance monitoring. Specifically, assistance would be provided in three
partially overlapping phases to:
Phase I:
a) review existing performance monitoring system including data quality, target setting, reporting
process, result evaluation and feedback; this would provide the basis for establishing precise
guidelines to upgrade the process of SOE performance monitoring, result evaluation and
feedback;
Project timing: 06/1998-10/1998 (four months)
Phase Il:
b) assess compliance with, and relevance of existing performance targets and prepare an action
plan for performance contracts with SOEs.
Project timing. 10/1998-12/1999 (fourteen months)
Phase III:
c) assess the scope for strengthening the representation of the central government on the Board of
key SOEs to enhance professionalism and improve governance and design a blueprint for the
corporate charter of key SOEs;
d) establish standards for good corporate governance for privatized SOEs, and recommendations
for the corporate charter and management of privatized state enterprises, including suggestions
for retaining a "golden" minority share for the Government.
Project timing: 10/1998-02/1999 (fourteen months)
Project Component 3. Industrial Competitiveness Strategy - US$2.7 million
Concerns over Thailand's competitiveness have been at the root of the present economic crisis,
as markets reacted adversely when slowing export performance revealed fundamental weaknesses in
the country's industrial structure. Revitalizing export growth will be the key to overcome the sharp
drop in domestic output and to accelerate the country's economic recovery. This component is
designed to enhance the long-term competitiveness of Thai industrial exports by regularly updating
the information base of the problems Thai enterprises face, and ad(iressing the key bottleneck of
customs procedures and evaluating public policy options for upgrading enterprises' access to skills
and technology.
3.1 Industry Survey
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$1. 0 million
The information base regarding enterprises and their behavior in Thailand is limited. To
increase productivity and competitiveness, there is a need for reliable data regarding the constraints



Annex 2
Page 13 of 16
faced by Thai enterprises. Now authorities are unable to compare developments in different regions
or industries, listen to the concerns of a representative spectrum of small, medium-size and large
enterprises, identify important impediments to enhanced competitiveness or develop adequate policy
responses.
Detailed questionnaires and face-to-face interviews provide the most effective means of gathering
information regarding the challenges facing enterprises. enterprises To best measure the impact of
policies and reform measures, the same enterprises should be revisited over a number of years.
Conducting regular surveys gives the most complete understanding of enterprise responsiveness. The
creation of such a panel database would provide invaluable insights both into short run and long run
trends in the competitiveness of Thai industry. A first large-scale survey is currently underway with
the assistance of the World Bank; it will be followed by regular firm interviews and data analyzed in
six months intervals to give policy makers an accurate picture of problems faced by Thai enterprises.
This sub-component would support capacity building for conducting surveys and strategic policy
analysis in three areas:
(i) Industry Surveys. An ongoing task of the project would be to support institutional capacity in the
Ministry of Industry, Office of Industrial Economics to regularly survey a representative sample of
enterprises and analyze their behavior:
a) to advise on the survey design enterprises and enterprise selection;
b) assist with the collection, compilations cross tabulation and analysis of data;
c) help disseminate the information through publications and a public forum, bringing together
government officials, members of industry and the media to encourage public debate.
Project timing: 05/1998-05/2000 (twenty-four months)
(ii) Skills Development. To be able to compete in the future, Thailand will need to upgrade its skills
base and absorb advanced technology. The labor and skills mix in Thailand has become a major
impediment to productivity growth and technology upgrading. Thailand is faced with the threat of
losing its comparative advantage to new entrants in the low-tech, labor-intensive industries as real
wages have risen. Moreover, the country lacks qualified labor and turnover is very high. As a
consequence, there is a need for skills upgrading, particularly of new entrants into the labor force. A
clear priority in the government's reform program is to narrow the skills gap in the workforce by
expanding enrollment in secondary education, and by protecting vital health and education
expenditures in the central government budget.
This long-term issue is best dealt with in the development of the overall educational and training
system. At the same time, some short-term interventions can be considered, including offering tax
incentives for on-the-job training programs; inviting enterprises to cooperate in developing industry-
wide or regional training programs; and developing nation-wide university public-private programs
for engineers and managers. A comprehensive review will evaluate these short-term options with
respect to their efficient use of public resources, their implications for reforming existing institutions
and their ability to help establish new public-private partnerships.
Project timing: 04/1998-12/1998 (eight months)
(iii) Absorption of Technology. Thailand is heavily dependent on labor-intensive operations in many
industrial sectors, for instance assembly-operations. As Thailand's labor costs rise and global



Annex 2
Page 14 of 16
competition further intensifies, it needs to upgrade its technology base to maintain competitiveness.
By providing institutional support, government programs could do more to assist enterprises in
improving their technology base. There is scope for improving an aftercare program designed to
identify and solve problems facing enterprises; providing institutional support for technology-transfer
geared to SMEs; raising awareness of vendor-development programs; and supporting product and
process development support initiatives.
TA would be provided in these areas to support the development of a public-private framework
that supports technology development and diffusion. Informed by initial survey results, a study
would make recommendations to enhance the existing regime for technology transfers and diffusion,
covering the BUILD-program, the matchmaking services already being provided, and the role of
BOI. It would consider the merits of new program initiatives, including an effective aftercare service
and more assistance to foreign enterprises to enhance product development and to forge closer links
with teaching institutes in Thailand.
Project timing: 04/1998-12/1998 (eight months)
3.2 Public Policy Framework
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$0.6 million
This sub-component will support a thorough review of the constraints that have hindered the
necessary modernization of the industrial base. It would provide a strategic vision to build a public
policy framework to help Thailand's industry compete globally. 'In close collaboration with ongoing
research efforts at the NESDB, the strategy program for improving competitiveness would be based
on analysis in three key areas:
(i) Cost Structure. The competitive advantage of major industries has drastically changed as a result
of the depreciation of the Thai baht following the switch to a floating exchange rate regime. A
thorough review of the cost structure of major industries will be undertaken to refine policy
recommendations for improving competitiveness in this new phase of Thailand's economic
development. This would also serve to inform research staff at NESB and other pertinent agencies of
the domestic cost structures relative to other countries.
(ii) Unit Cost of Infrastructure Services. The high unit costs of providing key infrastructure services
(ports, roads, communications etc.) in Thailand has been identified as an important factor
undermining the country's competitiveness. The project would support a detailed assessment of the
precise cost and key obstacles in the provision of infrastructure services such as transportation of
goods from the factory to their market destination. This analysis would provide a strong setting for
formulating a targeted competitiveness policy for industrial area development and the relocation of
export industries.
(iii) Governance Constraints to competitiveness. Competitiveness is determined by a complex web
of governance constraints at the macro (tax regime), meso (industry) and micro (firm) levels. A clear
framework for public policy options and a programmatic strategy to address these constraints will be
provided as part of this project, based on ongoing research work at NESDB and other institutions, as
well as the survey work of the MOI. This analysis will also cover the role of various key contributors
to the competitiveness debate, including public and private research institutes, industry lobbies,
technology institutions, universities and government agencies. A better understanding of the rationale
and scope of their present activities and an assessment of their accountability would contribute to the
objective of improving the governance structure for competitiveness in Thailand.
Project timing: 04/1998-12/1998 (eight months)

3.3 Customs Modernization
Foreign Cost of Sub-Component: US$1.1 million
Economic recovery in Thailand over the medium term will largely depend on exports, which
places a heavy premium on an open and efficient trade regime. Recent revisions in the tariff structure
have made Thailand's trade regime more open. Further trade liberalization measures are planned to
comply with Thailand's commitment to AFTA, but this should be complemented by strengthening the
administration of imports and exports. To enhance the competitiveness of Thai exports in the world
market system, trade should be facilitated by modernizing customs administration through enhanced
transparency and reduced room for discretion. The government is drawing on world-wide
experiences with customs reform and advances in available technology to design policy and
institutional changes in customs and customs procedures and modernizing customs services.
The customs department bears the key responsibility of facilitating imports and exports by
increasing the efficiency and transparency of customs administration. At the same time, it also needs td
contribute to the effort of raising government revenues to address the fiscal shortfall, by reducing fraud
without raising tariffs. While other, less developed countries have resorted to private services for pre-
shipment inspection and sampling of cargoes as a solution, Thailand's Customs Department has
decided against handing control over customs administration to private services. To achieve the
objectives of efficiency and revenue collection, there is a thus a need for broad institution building
efforts in several areas: improving and simplifying current customs procedures in use; extending the
coverage of computerized systems; streamlining the tariff framework for imports and improving the
duty drawback scheme. Under the leadership of the Director General of Customs, the Customs
Department has initiated a Corporate Plan which focuses on these tasks over the next few years.
This sub-component will assist the Customs Department in its effort to modernize customs
administration. Technical assistance would finance expert advice in two specific areas:
(i) Monitoring and Evaluation System. International best practice would guide expert advice in
designing and establishing a detailed performnance measurement system which allows to monitor
and evaluate the progress in implementing the different action programs of the Custom
Department's Corporate Plan. This would involve client surveys for feedback on the quality of
service delivery and detailed time-bound performance targets, e.g. for reducing the average turn-
around time in customs.
Project timing: 04/1998-10/1998 (six months)
(ii) Import Valuations. The Customs Department is frequently confronted with the difficulty of
establishing an accurate value for imports. Since importers regularly underinvoice the price of
certain commodities, e.g. automobiles, the Customs Department collects insufficient tariff revenue
if it cannot establish an accurate reference value. The project would help to finance the services 'of
a private agency specialized in providing updated detailed valuation tables based on international
comparisons of production, wholesale and retail costs of specific key import items. These valuation
lists would also be made available to the Excise Department which is increasing its efforts to collect
duties on specific goods.
Project timing: 04/1998-12/1999 (twenty months)

Project Component 4. Project Coordination and Implementation - US$0.5 million
A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will support the Ministry of Finance to manage, coordinate
and follow-up on the project components to ensure successful implementation (see C.4). The PIU will
be attached to the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) within the Ministry of Finance. It will be directed ex
officio by the Director General of FPO. A senior staff from FPO would act as Deputy Director with
powers to hire and request disbursements from the Bank. A project manager would be recruited to
administer the project. A Project Steering Committee comprising the different implementing
departments would convene regularly under the chairmanship of the Director General of FPO to
monitor progress of project implementation.
The PIU for this project, the Deputy Director and any PIU sitaff would not normally be involved
in the project coordination of the World Bank-supported Financial Sector Implementation Assistance
Loan. Similarly, the Project Coordination Committee would normally have a different membership than
the Steering Committee of the World Bank-supported Financial Sector Implementation Assistance
Loan.
This component would provide sufficient resources for project coordination and implementation
by the PIU, and include provision for project management, expertise from consultants and some
equipment.
(i) Specialized Consulting Services ($400,000). An international expert would help finalize requests
for proposals and consultant contracts and provide technical quality assurance. Specialized
expertise would be financed for the PIU to handle the administrative, procurement legal and
accounting needs of project execution.
(ii) Equipment ($ 100,000) This funds would provide office equipment such as photocopiers, faxes,
translations and miscellaneous expenses.

overall project cost (US$20 million). However, if government finances continue to be seriously strained, and if a
reassessment of the Bank's lending priorities warrants, a lower Borrower contribution would be discussed during the first
annual project implementation review.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Goods shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of Section I of the "Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in January 1995
and revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997 (the Guidelines) and the
following provisions of Section I of this Schedule.
Procurement of consultants would be done according to the provisions of the "Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997) and of equipment
according to the provisions of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans" (January
1995, revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997). All consultant assignments
will follow the Bank's Standard Request for proposals dated July 1997.
Quality- and Cost-based Selection
Except as otherwise provided below, consultants' services shall be procured under contracts
awarded in accordance with the provisions of Section II of the Consultant Guidelines,
paragraph 3 of Appendix 1 thereto, Appendix 2 thereto, and the provisions of paragraph 3.13
throuh 3.18 thereof applicable to quality- and cost-based selection of consultants.
Other Procedures for the Selection of Consultants
1.   Single Source Selection
This project has been prepared in response to an economic crisis and rapid selection of
consultants will be essential in a number of components. Services under components 1, 2
and 4 of the Project may, with the Bank's prior agreement, be procured in accordance with
the provisions of paragraphs 3.8 through 3.11 of the Consultant Guidelines. All consultant
contracts not procured through single source selection, and exceeding $200,000 would be
advertised in Development Business.
2.   Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications
Services estimated to cost less than $ 100,000 equivalent per contract, may be procured
under contracts awarded in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.7 of the
Consultant Guidelines.
3.  Individual Consultants
Tasks that meet the requirements set forth in paragraph 5.01 of the Consultant
Guidelines shall be procured under contracts awarded to individual consultants in accordance
with the provisions of paragraphs 5.1 through 5.3 of the Consultant Guidelines.



Annex 6
Page 2 of 5
Table A of this Section shows the project costs by procurement arrangements. Since the total
expenditure on equipment is limited to US$100,000, there will be no international
competitive bidding (ICB) in the project. Equipment estimated may be procured using
national shopping, up to an aggregate amount of US$125,000. At least three quotations from
qualified suppliers must be obtained.
Requirements of prior review of other contracts for consulting services and equipment are
summarized in Table B.
Disbursement
Expenditures for individual contracts of equipment and services, for which prior review by
the Bank is not required, will be disbursed against Statement of Expenditures. For
expenditures incurred on the basis of Statements of Expenditures all records evidencing such
information must be retained by the project entity until at least one year after the Bank has
received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the loan
account is made. Full documentation for all contracts requiring the Bank's prior review will
be submitted. Disbursements, representing mainly expenditures under short term
implementation assistance, will be made over a period of two and a half years. Since the
Government wishes to advance rapidly, with respect to the resolution of suspended finance
companies, retroactive financing, not to exceed US$1.50 million (10% of the Loan amount),
would be applied to finance eligible expenditure made after February 1, 1998.
A special account in US dollars will be established at the 130T with an authorized allocation
of $1.5 million. The amount of this initial deposit, however, would be limited to US$750,000
million, until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan plus outstanding special
comnmitments will equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$3.0 million to correspond to
anticipated expenditures in the first months of project execution. The special account will be
replenished monthly to assure liquidity of funds, and all replenishment applications would be
accompanied by reconciled bank statements from the depository bank showing all
transactions in the special account.
The allocation of Loan proceeds is provided in Table C of this Section.
