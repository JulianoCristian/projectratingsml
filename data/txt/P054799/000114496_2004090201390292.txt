letters No. 0206/9260 dated May 28, 2001, and No. 0317/piu/329 dated June 15, 2001, 
from the Ministry of Finance, requesting certain amendments to the Loan Agreement and 
extension of the Closing Date.
We are pleased to inform you that, after due consideration, the Bank has agreed 
to your request and, therefore, the Loan Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

2.
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended as follows: 
(a)
Sub-paragraph (b) is amended by deleting the word "and" after the 
semi-colon and sub-paragraph (c) is amended by substituting a semi-colon for the 
period at the end and adding the word "and"; and 
(b)
a new sub-paragraph (d) is added to read as follows:
"(d)
the term "Incremental Operating Costs" means reasonable 
expenditures directly related to the administration of the Project, 
incurred by the Borrower (which expenditures would not have been incurred 
absent the Project), including expenditures for the advertisement of 
consulting assignments and of the procurement of goods
related to the 
Project, and for office supplies and communication, but excluding 
salaries."
3.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement, withdrawals

in an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent of $7,000 may be made on account 
of payments made for expenditures under Category (4), before the effectiveness of this 
letter of amendment but after December 1, 2000.
4.
Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:

$100,000 equivalent each; (c) consultants’ services procured under 
contracts with individuals costing less than $50,000 equivalent each; (d) 
training; and (e) incremental operating costs; all under such terms and 
conditions as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower."
5.
A new Part B is added to Section I of Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement to read 
as follows and, therefore, Part B and Part C of said Section I are renamed as "Part C" 
and "Part D", respectively: 
"Part B:

procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the provisions of Section

with the provisions of paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines."
7.
A new sub-paragraph (a) is added to paragraph 2 of Part D of Section I of 
Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement and, therefore, sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of said 
paragraph 2 are renamed as sub-paragraphs "(b)" and "(c)", respectively:
"(a)
With respect to each contract for goods estimated to cost the 
equivalent of $200,000 or more, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 
of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply."
We are also pleased to inform you that the Bank has established August 31, 2002
