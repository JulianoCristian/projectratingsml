                         Implementation Status Overview
                         One year after effectiveness, PNPM Rural IV continues to make good progress nationwide. The project’s model of giving communities direct control of decision making and resources
                         is helping to improve socio-economic conditions and strengthen governance and accountability at the local level. Several improvements in Government's program management and
                         governance had a positive impact. In 2012, improved pre-service training was provided to the new facilitators which should result in better facilitation support to the communities. New

                         Regional Management Consulting (RMC) firms have been mobilized, which should lead to improved oversight of project implementation. Interim results of the ongoing technical
                         evaluation in 9 of 32 provinces showed that 96% of the 1,128 inspected sub-projects are of good quality while 89% of sub-projects are well-functioned and being utilized by the
                         communities. The 2011 Impact Evaluation of PNPM showed 9% (instead of 2% as targeted) increase of poor household consumption rate in PNPM areas compared to the control
                         households. These good results are expected to be maintained and improved during the next phase of the program, PNPM 2012-2014.

                         PNPM Rural 2012-2014 was successfully appraised in August 2012 and negotiations are planned for November. The preparation was highly collaborative and included the main
                         stakeholders of Pokja Pengendali (PNPM’s oversight body) and PMD (PNPM Implementing Agency). The preparation focused once again on strengthening management and
                         governance arrangements because the challenges of operating with national coverage still have to be mastered. The actions include an updated Better Governance Action Plan
                         (BGAP), issuance of new fiduciary guidelines for Revolving Loan Funds (RLF) to reduce risks, an improved Results Framework that now includes Core Sector Indicators for CDD
                         projects, and strengthening of community procurement arrangements. The Implementation Guidelines for Social and Environmental Safeguards (IGSES) were also updated. A
                         revised remuneration and incentive scale for facilitators in remote areas was endorsed by PNPM Pokja Pengendali which should improve retention and job satisfaction.

                         The Government is finalizing a broad-based consultation process for the PNPM Roadmap that defines the policy basis and priority actions up to the end of the current administration
                         in 2014 and beyond. The Roadmap aims to integrate the operating principles of PNPM into regular government operations thus strengthening downward accountability and
                         transparency. It includes actions for: (a) effective integration of PNPM programs at the local level; (b) strengthening the roles and capacity of PNPM facilitators, including their
                         linkages with line ministries; (c) strengthening the capacity of local level institutions and clarification of their legal framework; (d) adoption of core PNPM principles for the functioning
                         of local government, including integration development planning and budgeting; and (e) good governance and downward accountability.
