 Empowerment (PNPM) Mandiri program is the key component of\n            the Indonesian Government's cluster two poverty\n            alleviation program. The work of the PNPM Support Facility\n            (PSF) goes beyond coordination. The PSF provides technical\n            assistance in the continuous effort to build capacities of\n            communities, governments at the local, provincial and\n            national level, and civil society. It assists the\n            development of a very robust monitoring and evaluation\n            framework which supports continuous improvements to the\n            program. It makes sure that donor funds are used\n            appropriately. The PSF also facilitates the implementation\n            of analytical work that forms the foundation for the\n            planning, management, and improvement of government\n            poverty-reduction programs. A key element of the PSF\n            approach is innovation: it provides space for explorations\n            and experimentation. PSF's pilot initiatives are highly\n            innovative and carry the potential for high rewards. The PSF\n            has various comparative advantages. By tapping into the\n            World Bank's global knowledge base, it can facilitate\n            access to international best practices across a range of\n            development areas. The success of the PSF has not gone\n            unnoticed. In recent years, PNPM has served as a model for\n            the development of similar community-driven development\n            programs, such as in Afghanistan. The PSF plays a direct\n            role in this. Knowledge sharing continues to expand between\n            the PSF and parties interested in emulating the success of PNPM."}, "docdt": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
