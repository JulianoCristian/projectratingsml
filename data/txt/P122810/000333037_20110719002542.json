While Directors noted the increasing governance\n            risks of such a large scale project, they expressed\n            satisfaction with the mitigation measures put in place. They\n            urged continued attention to strengthening the\n            program's governance and management framework. In this\n            connection, Directors welcomed the effort to enhance\n            awareness and attention to transparency and information\n            dissemination through web-based communications and\n            monitoring tools.
