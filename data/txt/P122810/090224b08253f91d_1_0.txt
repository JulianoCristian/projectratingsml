                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made very good progress in achieving end of project target values and has significantly exceeded projected targets for 2 of 3 outcome indicators. They include a 9.1
                         percent (%) increase (compared with a 2% target) in the consumption rate of poor households in project areas compared with control households; and the Economic Internal Rates of
                         Return (EIRR) for main rural infrastructure categories include: 85.2% for water and sanitation, 120% for roads and bridges and 108% for irrigation compared with an average target of

                         30%. Although the project has just fallen short of its projected target of 80% with a satisfaction rate of 78.69% expressed by beneficiaries regarding improved services and local level
                         governance, the result is considered to be statistically significant and well within the satisfactory range.

                         In addition, the project has either met or exceeded 11 of 16 its core and key intermediary end-line targets. A milestone was also reached when the Law 6/2014 on Villages was

                         approved by the Government of Indonesia (GoI). Drafted by PMD, the Village Law will aim to mainstream core PNPM principles, including participatory village planning, community
                         implementation of village projects, inter-village collaboration and improved accountability mechanisms. The Law foreshadows that by 2016, PNPM block grants might be replaced by
                         regular village allocations financed by GoI.

                         However, there have also been some shortcomings in the project’s ability to achieve improvements in governance conditions. According to the 2012 Impact Evaluation, while the
                         project has had impacts on measures of social dynamics and governance (in terms of promoting participation, transparency and accountability for processes), these impacts have
                         had limited "spill-over" effects into the broader village decision-making processes as the capacity of communities to impact elite control of decision-making was limited. One of the
                         main contributing factors identified was the routine approach to program implementation. Furthermore, the project has had limited effects on transforming local government
                         institutions to adopt the same downward social accountability and transparency principles supported by the PNPM. Therefore, while the project itself has been successful in
                         introducing and instituting good governance practices in the rural space, further research to investigate barriers to the adoption of "PNPM principles" in the wider governance space is
                         required.

                         In addition, the following core and key intermediary results indicators have not been achieved. They include: the total number of beneficiaries (only 45 million benefited from the
                         infrastructure financed by the project compared with the target of 49 million); only 41% of women and the poorest community members participated in planning and decision-making
                         meetings compared with the target of 50%; and only 85% of Regional Management Consultants and facilitators have been paid on time compared with the target of 100%. In addition,
                         the project has just fallen shy of meeting the 20% targets for district-level audits at 18.57%; and establishment of 393 project management units compared with a target of 400.
                         However, these results still demonstrate an improvement from previous results and are considered well within range of project targets.
