                         This project supports the Government of Indonesia's National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM) which was launched in 2007 and has delivered tangible results nationwide.
                         The project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2014 and has already almost fully disbursed. The status of achievement of project outcome indicators is as follows: improved household
                         expenditure rates and improved access to economic and social services in 4,978 sub-districts in 2011 (target 4,800 sub-districts); economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRRs) of 35%

                         Achievements of direct project beneficiaries is 30.4 million (target: 49 million) and 15.4 million women benefited from the project (target 24 million). The discrepancy is most likely due

                         to data unreliability because the project has reached full geographic coverage and women's participation has been high.

                         The majority of the targets for Intermediate Indicators have also been achieved. Those not yet fully achieved include: participation rate of women (47% achieved versus a target of
                         50%) and external audit sample size (16% achieved versus a target of 20%). External audits were performed in 23% of districts but reports from 7% of districts were received late
                         and not included in BPKP’s final report.
