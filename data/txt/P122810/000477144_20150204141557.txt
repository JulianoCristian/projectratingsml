1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
From the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, Indonesia experienced a sustained and uninterrupted
reduction in poverty. The share of the population below the national poverty line dropped from
over 40% in 1976 to less than 12% in 1996. However, the Asian financial crisis, which started
in July 1997, wiped out much of these gains. By 1998, the poverty rate had doubled to over
24%, and the number of Indonesians living below the poverty line increased to almost 50
million. The financial crisis did not only cause economic hardship but also led to greater
demand for public participation in government affairs, both by individual citizens and by sub-
national governments. In 1999, the National Parliament passed two new decentralization laws,
partially in response to the effect of the crisis on Indonesia's political landscape. These laws
shifted many responsibilities for government affairs from the centre to the provincial and
district (kota and kabupaten) governments, and also provided these sub-national governments
with the financing needed to implement their new responsibilities.
Against this background, the Government of Indonesia (GoI) created a national development
program (Program Pembangunan Nasional or PROPENAS) for 2000-2004 aimed at increased
public participation, improved governance, and economic recovery. The economic recovery
program prioritized poverty alleviation and the development of a community-based economic
system. PROPENAS 2000-2004 emphasized the need to establish partnerships between
government, communities and the private sector, and to increase efforts to overcome poverty
and social instabilities. To help achieve these objectives, the Bank assisted GoI with the
implementation of a series of poverty reduction projects, initially consisting of the Kecamatan
Development Project (KDP) series in rural areas, and the Urban Poverty Project (UPP) series
in urban areas. Implementation of the first KDP and UPP commenced in 1998.
In 2006, GoI launched the National Program for Community Empowerment, which is better
known by its Indonesian acronym PNPM (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat).
PNPM was established as the operational umbrella for all community-based development
(CDD) programs in the country, including the KDP and UPP series. An inter-ministerial
working group (Kelompok Kerja Pengendali PNPM Mandiri or “Tim Pengendali”) provides
oversight of PNPM at the national level. The group is chaired by the Coordinating Minister for
People’s Welfare and its members include representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs,
the National Development and Planning Board (BAPPENAS), the Ministry of Finance, and
relevant line ministries. Coinciding with the creation of PNPM, GoI also established the PNPM
Support Facility (PSF) to harmonize and coordinate development partner efforts, including the
planning and targeting of financial assistance, as well as monitoring and evaluation of the
program’s operations and impact. The PSF is managed by a Joint Management Committee
(JMC) with representatives from GoI agencies and development partners contributing at least
US$1 million to PNPM projects. The Bank has been co-chair of the JMC since its inception.
In 2011, the Bank had financed––or was financing––PNPM in rural areas through a series of
three (sector investment) projects, which formed the basis of a sector wide programmatic
approach: PNPM-Rural I, II, and III (the Bank originally planned to co-finance PNPM Rural
for the period 2007-2012, but the financing requirement for a five-year program would exceed
Indonesia’s Single Borrower Limit). The focus of this ICR is PNPM-Rural IV (“the project”),
which was mainly a continuation of PNPM-Rural III, to help consolidate PNPM as a national
program. The PNPM IV marked a key turning point in the program, not just in terms of its



                                               1
sheer size and scale––as the world’s largest community driven development program––but
demonstrating GoI’s full commitment to poverty reduction and community empowerment.

The project would cover 4,978 sub-districts (kecamatan) in 32 provinces, 4,791 of which were
already covered by its predecessor projects (Table 1). PNPM-Rural IV did not only address
GoI’s development objectives, but was also fully consistent with the Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2009-2012, which emphasizes engagements with government
counterparts and other stakeholders who are committed to addressing critical governance and
institutional challenges. At the time of appraisal (June 2011), the total cost of PNPM-Rural IV
was estimated at approximately US$1,284 million. The project would be financed from the
proceeds of an IBRD Loan (about US$531m), grants from other development partners (about
US$26m), and resources from the Borrower (about US$753m, including community
contributions of approximately US$35m). The expected effectiveness date of the IBRD Loan
was September 1, 2011, and the expected loan closing date was June 30, 2014. Grants from
other development partners would be channeled through a multi-donor trust fund in PSF.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective and Key Performance Indicators
Project Development Objective
The PAD stated that the project development objective (PDO) is “for villagers in PNPM rural
locations to benefit from improved socio-economic and local governance conditions”.

Key Indicators1
Outcome indicators
1. Improved household expenditure rates and improved access to economic and social
   services in a minimum of 4,800 sub-districts in 2011 (impacts taken from representative
   sample) 2



1
    These indicators were taken from the PAD. The Loan Agreement itself did not list performance indicators.
2
    The PAD mentions a minimum of 4,978 sub-districts in the main text, and a minimum of 4,800 in Annex
    1. Aide-memoires and ISRs measured progress of this outcome indicator against a target of 4,800.


                                                      2
2. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) > 30 % for major types of rural infrastructure.
3. > 80% satisfaction levels from beneficiaries regarding improved services and local level
   governance (impacts taken from representative sample)
Intermediate results indicators
The PAD identified 15 results indicators, aimed at measuring intermediate results in the four
components described in Section 1.5 (indicators are in brackets):
1. Villagers participate in a process to plan, select and manage basic social and economic
   infrastructure provided through block grants (participation rate of women and poorest
   community members in planning and decision-making meetings, percentage of agreed
   work plans completed each year, percentage of infrastructure work evaluated as of high
   quality, percentage of infrastructure works for which O&M arrangements are in place
   and/or functioning, number of sub-districts with completed infrastructure subprojects,
   improvements in priority health and education indicators).
2. Consultants at the national, provincial and district levels are providing assistance to
   communities and local governments to implement PNPM (percentage of local government
   councils that provide funds and/or oversee PNPM, percentage of planned facilitator
   positions filled, percentage of facilitators receiving agreed number of pre-service and in-
   service training days).
3. Project stakeholders use results of M&E activities and studies to improve project
   performance (percentage of planned consultant positions filled, percentage of PNPM-Rural
   sub-districts in audit sample size and audit results are made public, percentage of sampled
   villages that receive socialization material packages for PNPM from 2011 onwards).
4. Project management teams established in a timely manner and functioning (number of units
   established by March every year, oversight consultants and facilitators paid on time and in
   full every month, kecamatan grants disbursed and accounted for).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators
The PDO and key indicators remained unchanged during project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The intended primary beneficiaries of the project consisted of some 49 million persons living
in 4,978 target kecamatan located in 32 of Indonesia’s 33 provinces (the Special Capital
District of Jakarta does not contain rural sub-districts and therefore did not form part of the
project). The population of these kecamatan would benefit both directly and indirectly from
improved community infrastructure and services, grant assistance for poorest and most
vulnerable groups (such as scholarships and training courses), and improved access to
microcredit––all planned and implemented through a community-driven development (CDD)
process. Secondary beneficiaries would be: (i) Directorate of General for Community and
Village Empowerment in the Ministry of Home Affairs (the executing agency), which would
benefit from increased capacity; (ii) village level facilitators and partner agencies providing
implementation support; (iii) kabupaten governments in which the 4,978 target kecamatan
were located, who would benefit from training, field studies, and institutional strengthening
aimed at improving their planning capabilities; and (iv) village representative councils (Badan
Perwakilan Desa or BPD), which would benefit from technical assistance and advisory



                                              3
services in the process of establishing and strengthening their role in channeling CDD funds to
appropriate community activities and investments.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1: Kecamatan Grants. Project Cost: US$1,097.6 million (36% Bank financing)
This component would provide block grants to participating kecamatan to finance activities
identified in village plans, including: (i) specific high-priority infrastructure investments; (ii)
microcredit loans for women’s groups; (iii) social safety programs for the benefit of the poorest
and most vulnerable groups or individuals; and (iv) investments aimed at addressing disasters,
emergencies or catastrophic events. Kecamatan grants would not finance activities on the
project’s negative list, such as weapons, religious buildings or government offices. Each
participating kecamatan would receive a one-time block grant of IDR 750 million to IDR 3
billion to finance investments in one or more of the above categories, in accordance with their
community development plans (with a maximum allocation of 25% to revolving funds for
women’s savings and loan groups).3 The block grant amount would depend on the population,
poverty incidence and location (Java/Bali or elsewhere) of the kecamatan. In addition to the
core sub-district planning and block grant scheme, PNPM-Rural IV would also provide block
grants for four special programs:
1.       PNPM-Generasi (US$375 million). The incentivized block grant scheme, which
         commenced in 2007 is co-financed by GoI and donors to support the achievement of
         Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to health and education. From 2011
         to 2012, US$94.3 million was allocated to the pilot project. Generasi was subsequently
         delinked in 2012 once the proof-of-concept stage was successfully completed. It
         attracted substantial donor funding as well as GoI support to warrant its own identity
         as a standalone project. An additional grant financing operation in the amount of
         US$151.7 million was approved in 2014.4

2.       PNPM-Green (US$34 million). This pilot program, which commenced in 2008 funded
         block grants and technical assistance to promote community investments in natural
         resource management and renewable energy. An additional grant financing operation
         in the amount of US$18 million was approved in 2012 to finance additional block
         grants and technical support for eight target provinces. The pilot project closed in 2013.
         Of the total amount allocated, US$30.68 million was disbursed.

     3. PNPM-BPKG (US$100 million). This is a regional block grant scheme initiated in
        2009 and financed by the Government of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (“Aceh”)
        through the Special Autonomy fund granted to Aceh as part of the 2005 peace
        agreement. While the block grants are not co-financed by the Bank, the program
        improved the community welfare by providing financial assistance through a
        provincial allocation for each (village) but using the project’s facilitators and operating


3
  Except sub-districts that were classified as “less poor” or “near poor” that had received block grants for
  more than three cycles under PNPM-Rural. These would receive block grants of IDR 450 million and IDR
  650 million, respectively.
4
  The PAD mentions a minimum of 4,978 sub-districts in the main text, and a minimum of 4,800 in Annex
  1. Aide-memoires and ISRs measured progress of this outcome indicator against a target of 4,800.



                                                     4
           systems. In the period of 2007– 2012, BKPG disbursed over IDR1.5 trillion (around
           $120 million USD) for a wide variety of activities, with a focus on village infrastructure
           improvements, savings and loans activities for women’s groups, education and health
           programs, and the strengthening of village government. In 2013, IDR70 million were
           allocated for each of 6,464 villages in the province. Unlike the national version of
           PNPM, BKPG provides the same financial allocation for each village in Aceh. The
           program is still ongoing.

4.         PNPM-RESPEK. This is also a similar regional block grant scheme, initiated in 2008.
           It covers the provinces of Papua and West Papua, and is funded by the governments of
           these provinces. A provincial top up to the block grant in the amount of IDR100 million
           was provided to each village. PNPM-RESPEK finances activities in the fields of: (i)
           nutrition and food security, (ii) education, (iii) primary health care, (iv) village
           infrastructure, and (v) economic livelihoods. The program is still ongoing.

In May 2009, GoI had signed a financing agreement with the International Fund for Agricul-
tural Development (IFAD) in an amount of about SDR42.3 million, of which SDR42.0 million
was provided as a loan and the remainder as a grant.5 The IFAD grant was used to finance
block grants, facilitation support and implementation support and technical assistance in
parallel with funds provided by the project and was therefore not formally linked to the project.

Component 2: Facilitation Support. Project Cost: US$110.8 million (89% Bank financing)
This component would strengthen the capacity of district and sub-district government
institutions and communities in development planning and investment through sub-district
(kecamatan) and district (kabupaten) social and technical facilitators.
Component 3: Implementation Support and Technical Assistance. Project Cost: US$36.8
million (84% Bank financing)
The project would be managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU) in the Directorate-
General of Village Community Empowerment (DJ-PMD or simply “PMD”) in the Ministry of
Home Affairs. The PMU would hire consultants to assist with project implementation;
facilitators would be hired by the participating provincial governments. Technical assistance
would be provided through National Management Consultants (NMC) at the central level, and
Regional Management Consultant (RMC) teams at the province level, with RMC offices in the
participating district governments, and facilitators and community cadres at the kecamatan
level. In addition, this component would finance strategic development of PNPM, the project’s
monitoring and evaluation program, and an enhanced audit program that expands sampling,
and provides capacity development support for district government auditors. This component
would also finance most project training other than community-level training.
Component 4: Project Management Support. Project Cost: US$38.5m (2% Bank financing)
This component would provide technical advisory services and other material support to
strengthen PMD and support the management of PNPM’s special programs, including pilot
projects, government add-ons, and crisis-response activities (such as natural disasters and




5
     At the time the agreement was signed, the combined amount was equivalent to about USD 65.2 million.


                                                     5
financial crises). Most of these operational costs would be covered by the Government from
central and local government budgets.

1.6 Revised Components
The components remained unchanged during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes
Delinking of PNPM-Generasi and PNPM-Green. At appraisal, it was envisaged that part of
the proceeds of the US$531 million loan would be allocated to co-finance PNPM-Generasi.
For managerial purposes, the Bank decided to delink this pilot project from PNPM-Rural III in
December 2012, and the project was not linked to PNPM-Rural IV. PNPM-Green was not
linked to either project, and continued to be implemented on a stand-alone basis.
Acceleration of disbursement. The PAD envisaged that 87.8% of the loan would have been
disbursed by July 2013. In actual fact, 98.8% of the loan proceeds were disbursed by the end
of December 2012, reportedly because GoI wished to free up fiscal space for other programs.
The unexpected acceleration of disbursement accelerated the preparation of a successor loan
(National Program for Community Empowerment in Rural Areas 2012-2015, informally
known as “PNPM-Rural V”), which was signed in November 2012.

2.   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of background analysis and lessons learned from previous projects. The design
of PNPM-Rural IV was based on PNPM-Rural III, which was being implemented at the time
of appraisal, but with several modifications to reflect lessons learned from the implementation
of its predecessor projects. The most important of these lessons were the following: (i) need to
grow institutional and managerial capacities of the implementing agency along with the
program; (ii) need to develop a robust and integrated management information system; (iii)
need to strengthen governance and community level accountability systems (especially an
improved complaints handling system); (iv) need to strengthen the quality of facilitation since
facilitators are the backbone of PNPM; and (v) need for additional implementation assistance
from the Bank through a portfolio approach (PAD, pp 6-7).
Assessment of project design. As indicated above, project design followed the successful
models of other CDD projects, which had been verified through previous studies and also
incorporated lessons learned from previous PNPM-Rural projects. However, the project design
also anticipated implementation challenges due to the immense size of the project by among
others: (i) acknowledging the need for an improved MIS and leveraging additional donor
funding to support its redesign; (ii) introducing a “portfolio approach” to supervision (i.e.,
combining supervision missions of two or more projects) as part of the project design to allow
the Bank to help GoI harmonize and supervise projects more cost-effectively while the project
grew in size; and (iii) supporting GoI with some of the operational responsibility for monitoring
and evaluation of key performance indicators through PSF and other diagnostic studies, which
would be used to help inform operations. The RF PDO level indicators were designed to bring
out the achievement of the PDOs and the team, given the loss of the control groups, decided to
compensate by augmenting the 2011 impact evaluation results with 2 additional technical
surveys: technical evaluation of infrastructure and beneficiary satisfaction survey.


                                               6
Government commitment, stakeholder involvement, and participatory processes. The
Government of Indonesia played a central role in helping to prepare the project in accordance
with a roadmap for the development of a nationwide PNPM until 2015. This roadmap was
prepared with the involvement of stakeholders at the central and sub-national level, including
NGOs and community-based organizations.
Risks and risk mitigation measures. The overall project risk was rated “Medium” (low
likelihood-high impact), and this rating was deemed appropriate. The key identified risks
include: (i) institutional and managerial capacity of PMD, (ii) formal and informal fiduciary
and governance controls, and (iii) availability of qualified facilitators. Although the project risk
analysis in the PAD did not mention the systemic delays in budget approvals by GoI as a risk
factor, the Bank and GoI sought to mitigate this problem by setting up the block grant
reimbursement mechanism as a way to limit the extent of the delays and extending the project
cycle from 12 to 18 months. Furthermore, notwithstanding the delays in the release of the
budget, the vast majority of sub-projects were still completed on time.

2.2   Implementation
Factors outside the control of the government or the implementation agency

Not applicable.

Factors subject to the control of the government or the implementation agency
Supporting factors
     Strong political commitment. The project was able to secure support at the highest levels
      of government. Virtually all participating district governments co-financed part of the
      project cost from their own resources, and a substantial minority provided funds over and
      above the minimum required amount.
     Effective anti-corruption strategy. Individuals and independent organizations in bene-
      ficiary communities used channels of communication established by the project (such as
      the complaints handling unit or individual facilitators) to report incidences of suspected
      corruption. Follow-up actions, including local government coordination and withholding
      of funds distribution, proved effective in combating corruption. Corruption largely
      consisted of isolated cases.
Challenging factors
     Centralized program management. In spite of strong political support, the implementing
      agency’s capacity to take corrective and timely actions was hampered by its centralized
      management structure, which sometimes did not allow for the timely escalation and
      redress of the problems of a project with such a wide national coverage. Limitations in
      coordinating with other PMD Directorates at times also resulted in inconsistencies in the
      application of HR and other operational policies across various PNPM projects managed
      by PMD.
     Delays in the recruitment of facilitators. Given the scale and size of the project (i.e. the
      need to retain more than 12,000 facilitators a year), some delays in procurement of
      facilitators occurred, especially in remote areas such as Papua and West Papua where
      provincial governments were often unable to recruit facilitators with the required



                                                 7
      experience and academic background at the salary level offered. To address the shortfall,
      GoI increased facilitators’ salary in mid-2013 and made exceptions to the recruitment of
      technical facilitators in the two provinces under the Barefoot Engineering program, which
      was designed to provide on-the-job training.6
Mid-term review. At the end of 2012 a mid-term review was conducted, three months ahead
of the original schedule (March 2013). The review resulted in two sets of recommendations.
     Improve the performance of PNPM-Rural in remote areas. It was recommended to
      modify the implementation approach of PNPM Rural in remote areas (especially in the
      provinces of Papua and West Papua) by, inter alia, adjustment of the project cycle from
      12 to 18 months to ensure that sub-projects could complete; strengthen fiduciary
      safeguards applied to the RLFs, which in effect, help to control and stem disbursements;
      and improve the remuneration, benefits and travel allowance for facilitators.
     Improve program management by PMD. The Bank urged PMD to strengthen program
      oversight and management by accelerating the redesign of the management information
      system (MIS), improving the operations manual (Petunjuk Teknis Operasional or PTO),
      establishing a joint secretary for PNPN-Rural and related programs, and by temporarily
      excluding kecamatan with problems related to fraud and corruption or with one or more
      facilitator positions that had been vacant for at least four months.
Because 98.8% of the loan funds had been disbursed at the time the mid-term review was
conducted, the recommendations were aimed at improving the performance of PNPM-Rural in
general. At the loan closing date, PMD had implemented most recommendations on program
management, except those on improving performance in remote areas. These were delayed
because of operational difficulties and would be addressed during the implementation of the
successor project PNPM Rural 2012-2015
Effectiveness of risk mitigation. Mitigation of project risks was generally good. Specific risks
related to pro-poor targeting and fiduciary controls were mitigated effectively during
implementation; and the risks to project management and the recruitment of faciliators was
partially effective. For instance, the revision of the PTO in March was a significant milestone
in the project as the PTO had not been revised for 5 years; and according to the reports on
facilitation, the national vacancy rate for facilitators was relatively low (3% at District level
and 5% at the Sub-District level by early 2014. However, technical facilitator vacancy rates
tend to be higher in remote areas (8%). Risks related to the sustainability and performance of
RLFs may have been mitigated less effectively, although the shortcomings did not
fundamentally undermine achievement of the project outcomes.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization



6
  The Barefoot Engineers project trains local high school graduates to become PNPM technical facilitators
in the remote and undeveloped Indonesian provinces of Papua and Papua Barat, and provides them with
mentoring and refresher training over the course of their work. 624 technical facilitators have graduated from
the program and have been recruited by PNPM since 2003; the latest class of 290 (of which 29% were
women) graduated in March 2013, and at the time of writing, 246 remain employed with the program.




                                                      8
The project measured progress against key performance indicators (KPIs) using a management
information system, augmented by a series of qualitative and quantitative surveys and the
results of regular supervision missions.
(a)     M&E design. At the time of appraisal, a management information system was in place
        to monitor and evaluate PNPM-Rural III. The same system would be used to monitor and
        evaluate the implementation of PNPM-Rural IV. In addition, the PAD listed a series of
        surveys and studies that would be undertaken during project implementation to
        complement the data to be collected by the MIS. And as mentioned above in Section 2.1,
        the loss of the control groups had prompted the team to add 2 technical surveys to
        augment the 2011 impact evaluation results in order to assess PDO indicators
        performance.
(b) M&E implementation. All surveys and studies defined in Annex 1 of the PAD were
    completed before the project closing date.7 Both the Government and the Bank conducted
    monitoring and supervision as planned and findings from surveys/studies, monitoring and
    supervision were all used to improve project performance. As anticipated, the project
    continued to encounter problems with the MIS. MIS data was published on the project
    website (http://www.pnpm-perdesaan.co.id) and updated on a monthly basis until
    December 2011, i.e. shortly after loan effectiveness in September 2011.Throughout the
    project implementation period, reporting was delayed due to difficulties in transmitting
    vast volumes of project data from village level up to national level. At the suggestion of
    the Bank, PMD had requested Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
    (DFAT) to recruit a firm to redesign the MIS. However, this activity was delayed (one
    year behind the original schedule, partly because the design specifications were not
    finalized). At the loan closing date, the new MIS was not yet operational.
(c)     M&E utilization. The utilization of the MIS was compromised by the fact that the system
        was unable to generate timely information until most of the PNPM-Rural IV loan funds
        were already disbursed. To compensate for this shortcoming, both GoI and the Bank
        relied more heavily than expected on the findings of supervision missions and the planned
        surveys and studies to monitor, reconcile, verify and evaluate project implementation.
        Data collected from these sources helped the project to (i) identify and remedy quality
        problems and to incorporate better controls as the project progressed, (ii) improve control
        of fund flows and accountability for sub-grants, and (iii) escalate issues to PMD
        management, as appropriate.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
PNPM Rural IV was a Category B project. The Implementation Guidelines for Social and
Environmental Safeguards (IGSES) was satisfactorily prepared and disclosed in 2013, and was
re-disclosed in March 2014 as part of the revised PTO. Although some project activities
triggered safeguards related to environmental assessment (OD/BP 4.01) and indigenous
peoples (OD/BP 4.10), none of these activities caused significant adverse impacts. The project
did not finance land acquisition, but did receive voluntary land donations. Given the small size
the subprojects financed by the project (the cost of which often did not exceed US$20,000



7
    The beneficiary survey was conducted in 2012 but the report was completed in October 2014. See Annex
    5 for summary of the survey results.


                                                    9
equivalent), it was a priori expected that any adverse social and environmental impacts of such
subprojects would be small or negligible. Indeed, the project generated substantial social and
environmental benefits, especially through investments in drainage, water supply and sani -
tation. Some aspects of the design and monitoring of mitigation measures of potential social
and environmental impacts remained poor, especially with regards to voluntary land donations,
and required significant improvement in the final stages of project implementation. In addition,
in some provinces the participation of indigenous peoples was initially substandard and a
review mission was carried out in mid-2014 aimed at improving compliance with OP/BP 4.10
to mitigate the potential adverse impacts of social exclusion.
As to fiduciary compliance, the project received an unqualified opinion from an external
auditor in 2012 and 2013, and according to the ISR of June 2013 (when most loan funds were
disbursed), the project’s financial management was generally acceptable.8 PMD ensured that
local governments addressed the findings of the external auditor, although the recording of this
process in the MIS was often incomplete or late. Both in 2012 and 2013, audit coverage was
slightly below the target of 20% (17.6% and 18.6%, respectively). This, however, was mainly
because the calculation of audit coverage only considered reports submitted on or before 30
June. If reports received after this date was to be included, coverage is substantially higher than
20%.
The project did encounter some problems with financial management of the revolving funds
component throughout implementation, especially those related to the accounting of the RLFs
and implementing pro-active management strategies to deal with loan loss reserves. In addition,
some provinces experienced difficulties in finding qualified financial facilitators. Despite these,
the repayment rate of RLF groups in general are still high (>90%). Nonetheless, to address
these problems, PMD raised facilitator salaries in 2014 to attract more qualified candidates,
took action to improve the RLF reporting system, and mandated a moratorium on block grants
for RLFs with high levels of non-performing loans and idle funds.
Procurement at the closing of the project was rated as moderately satisfactory as significant
improvements were noted in the simplification of community procurement procedures which
were also aimed to promote further transparency; and the transition to applying the improved
procurement procedures under the revised PTO is underway. Furthermore, no significant issues
were noted during ex-post reviews that were conducted by the Bank twice a year.

    The audit report published in 2014 (and covering the calendar year of 2013) is not relevant in this
    context because 98.8% of the IBRD loan funds for the project were disbursed by 31 December 2012.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(a)   Transition arrangements. Presidential elections were held in July 2014, shortly after the
      loan closing date. At the time of writing, GoI and the Parliament are still discussing how
      the PNPM program would need to be modified to operate in conjunction with the
      Government’s new Village Law Program, which was approved by the outgoing President
      in January 2014.
(b) Operations and Maintenance. Typically, the responsibility for operation and maintenance
     (O&M) has been assumed by the community through the establishment of O&M teams
     during the accountability meetings. These teams are responsible for collecting fees for
     operating as well as for the provision of regular infrastructure maintenance. This
     arrangement has worked well for infrastructure where the community can levy standard
     fees such as irrigation, clean water supply systems, and early childhood education centers
     but less so for public infrastructure such roads and drains where maintenance is provided
     on an ad-hoc basis. However, in some villages, the village government helps to provide
     additional funds for the maintenance of roads.
(c)   Follow-up projects. In addition to the Additional Financing operations that were
      processed for PNPM Generasi and Green, in the first half of 2012, GoI requested the
      Bank to co-finance the National Program for Community Empowerment in Rural Areas
      2012-2015. An agreement for US$650 million IBRD loan was signed in November 2012.
(d) Future impact evaluation. A new program evaluation is being designed and will be
    implemented in the first quarter of 2015 prior to the completion of PNPM Rural 2012-
    2015.


3.    Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objective, Design and Implementation
Rating for Relevance of Objective: Substantial
The project complemented the Government’s efforts to improve socio-economic development
and empower local communities, especially in rural areas. The President recently confirmed
his commitment to community-driven development and empowerment projects, and in
accordance with this vision, the new Village Law Program further decentralizes fiscal and
decision making responsibilities to Village Governments. The CDD approach is also a key
component of the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for 2013-2015, which emphasizes
engagements with government counterparts and other stakeholders who are committed to
addressing critical governance and institutional challenges. The CPS identifies six thematic
areas that are expected to form the core of the Bank’s engagement in Indonesia, three of which
are directly relevant to PNPM-Rural IV: (i) Promoting Communities, Protecting the Vulnerable
and Improving Health Outcomes, (ii) Ensuring Sustainable Development and Improving
Disaster Resilience, and (iii) Gender and Governance. Therefore, at completion the project was
still highly relevant to the objectives of both the Bank and the GoI.




                                              11
Rating for Relevance of Design and Implementation: Substantial
The design of PNPM Rural IV remained relevant as it was built upon the previous PNPM Rural
projects with some corrective actions to strengthen the MIS (hiring of consultant by DFAT to
improve design of the MIS and to make the system online/web-based); and improve RLF
reporting and tracking (through the RLF MIS under the RLF pilot project). In addition,
implementation arrangements were enhanced through the Bank- and Recipient-executed Trust
Fund projects such as the Barefoot Engineer III project, which aimed to improve the
availability of technical facilitators in Papua and West Papua); RESPEK Trust Fund, which
aimed to strengthen the overall program management and coordination of community
empowerment activities among development partners in the remote areas of Papua and West
Papua; and the RLF pilot, which supported the capacity building, restructuring and
institutionalization of the PNPM RLF scheme; and to help strengthen linkages between the
PNPM RLFs and the commercial microfinance sector so as to help ensure growth and
sustainability in the provision of financial services to the poor.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective
Rating: Substantial
Overview. Over the course of the project (2011–2013), PNPM-Rural IV has built, inter alia,
over 50,000 km of roads, more than 12,000 irrigation systems, and nearly 62,000 clean water
facilities. The project also generated temporary employment for around 1.5 to 2 million persons
annually, of which more than 80% were classified as poor, and provided revolving loan funds
for around 47,000 women’s groups annually (see Annex 2 for details on outputs). These
achievements are significant. Based on an analysis of the logical chain and potential changes
attributed to the project’s outputs, the investments in rural infrastructure have, among other
things, improved basic socio-economic conditions for communities through the provision of
access to transportation, access to basic services (such as health and clean water), and new
economic opportunities for villagers in the project areas. Access to transportation and basic
services have helped households to reduce their transportation costs while new economic
opportunities, along with temporary employment provided by the project and access to the
revolving loan fund, contributed to project outcome of increased household expenditure and
improved access to economic and social services. 9
Participation in the project remained strong–which resulted in high satisfaction rates and a
perception that the project is more transparent than other projects at village level. 10 The
efficacy of the project with respect to improvements in local governance conditions can also
be verified by the following achievements: (i) the project’s external audits, undertaken by
GOI’s auditing entity BPKP, achieved its audit target of 20 percent of the sub-districts
benefiting from the project and continued to enjoy unqualified ratings for the entire project
period.11 In addition, the practice of sensitizing communities at the sub-district and district

   While at project closing, the actual audit sample is reported as 18.57 percent, the task team confirms that
the audit sample was achieved if reports received after June 30 were included.

levels to audit findings (also known as “audit expose”) continued to be promoted through the
project; (ii) annual audit reports, including all district audit reports were published on the
PNPM website on an annual basis thereby meeting a loan convent requirement; (iii) relevant
heads of districts and sub-districts in each project location disclosed reports on the results of
project implementation and accounted for funds used on an annual basis thereby meeting a
loan convent requirement; (iv) 100 percent of villages received socialization material packages
for the project, compared with an end-line target of 70 percent; (v) community procurement
issues, which were previously identified as somewhat problematic in the ICR for PNPM Rural
III (largely due to a lack of simplicity and clarity in procedures) were subsequently resolved
by the closing of PNPM Rural IV and formally adopted through the revision of the PTO; (vi)
additional measures to improve RLF management and transparency, including term limits for
UPK staff and the recruitment of additional RLF facilitators were also adopted in the new PTO;
and (vii) by project closing, the IT-based Complaints Handling System showed improvements
in the management of fraud and corruption cases, including a decrease in “potentially
problematic locations” and increase in the overall case recovery rate. This can be attributed to
the fact that the implementing agency took appropriate actions to apply sanctions and suspend
disbursements in select areas where corruption had been identified and where no appropriate
action was assessed to have been taken. In addition, PMD together with TNP2K and
Menkokesra took important steps to continue to promote good governance measures through
the implementation of GoI’s Better Governance Action Plan (BGAP). This helped to send a
strong message to the public and communities that corruption will not be tolerated.
Outcome indicators. As indicated above, the project’s achievements are underscored by the
following outcome indicators:
       Improved household expenditure rates and improved access to economic and social
        services in a minimum of 4,800 sub-districts in 2011. Since PNPM-Rural became a
        national program in 2010, the task team was no longer able to conduct an impact
        evaluation to compare treatment and control areas as a way to measure outcomes.
        However, supplementary data was used to verify the project’s findings by comparing
        them to national trends. according to the National Socio-Economic Survey (Survei Sosial
        dan Ekonomi Nasional, Susenas), which is conducted annually in Indonesia, per capita
        expenditure has shown an increasing trend from 2008 (when the PNPM commenced its
        national scale up) to 2013 while poverty rate was declining for the same period (Table 2).
        However, two rounds of impact evaluations (completed in 2011 and 2008) for both
        PNPM-Rural and Kecamatan Development Program (KDP, predecessor of PNPM-Rural)
        showed that consumption rate of poor households in project locations was higher than
        that of the poor households in non-project locations (9.1% and 11% higher, respectively).
        In terms of access to services, the impact evaluation showed that households in PNPM
        Rural areas saw a 5.1% increase in outpatient care access compare to non-PNPM Rural
        areas.12 In addition, the 2012 beneficiary survey, which was designed to augment the 2011
        impact evaluation findings, further verified the original findings and showed that 66% of
        households reported better access to transportation as benefit from PNPM Rural sub-
        projects.13

       Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRRs) >30 % for major rural infrastructure types.
        A study undertaken in 2012 found that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of a
        sample of 48 small-scale infrastructure projects financed by predecessor projects during
        2007-2011 ranged from 35% to 50%, which was higher than that the targeted EIRR of
        30%.15 This rate is consistent with previous EIRR assessment of similar sub-projects built
        using similar approach in Indonesia (KDP), which showed EIRR rate of between 38.62%
        to 67.64%, and a recent EIRR assessment of similar infrastructure projects built under
        PNPM-Rural Post Disaster Management Support (DMS) project, which concluded an
        average EIRR of 60%.16 However, as explained in detail in Annex 3, the 2012 study may
        have used some over confident assumptions. (For example, the assumption that benefits
        generated by a sub-project remained constant over time until end of its service life).
        Despite this, and adjusting for such assumptions, it is assessed that the average EIRR of
        most sub-projects will remain comfortably above the 12% economic opportunity cost of
        capital, but not necessarily above the project target of 30%.
       >80% satisfaction levels from beneficiaries regarding improved services and local level
        governance. A study undertaken in 2012 estimated that 92.4% of project beneficiaries
        benefited from project investments, and that more than 80% beneficiaries claimed that
        project investments met their needs.17 According to a technical evaluation, which was
        also conducted in 2012, 89% of PNPM-financed subprojects that were implemented
        during 2007-2011 are functional and are adequately utilized by communities.18 A recent
        technical evaluation of PNPM DMS also showed that of 29 sub-projects evaluated (built
        in 2012-2013), 27 (93%) has functional community O&M team.19 These findings serve
        as proxy for satisfaction levels: communities do not merely state that they are satisfied,
        but benefited from and actively use and maintain the subprojects for the intended purpose.

In 2012 and 2013, the project reached 29.9 million and 28.0 million beneficiaries, respectively.

This was substantially lower than the target of 49 million. Part of the shortfall may be explained
by a reduction in the average block grant amount per kecamatan, which decreased by about
25% from 2010 to 2013. It is also worth noting that the target was roughly estimated based on
the population size of each village. An assumption was made that every village under each
kecamatan would be covered. At that time, a village poverty mapping was not done before the
project was started and the project did not have the methodological tools to make more accurate
statistical approximations either ex-ante or ex-post. The program over time (at least from 2008-
2014) has only covered 60,000 out of the 73,000 villages in Indonesia 20. In addition to that, if
indirect beneficiaries are included, the number of beneficiaries for 2012 and 2013 became 62.2
million and 58.2 million respectively (half of which are women and the poor).

Intermediate results indicators. During 2011-2012, the project financed more than 225,000
proposals, more than 50% of which were formulated by women’s groups. (see Annex 2 for
details).
The targets of most of the intermediate results indicators were also achieved, the exceptions
being:
     Min. 50% participation rate of women and poorest community members in planning and
      decision-making meetings. At loan closing, overall women’s participation was 45%,
      while participation of the poorest was 51%.
     > 90% of planned facilitator positions are filled by 2012. By the end of 2012, 87% of
      planned positions were filled, mainly because of poor performance of the relatively
      isolated provinces of Papua and West Papua. PMD improved facilitator conditions in the
      course of 2013 and 2014, which decreased the vacancy rate to 9% in 2013.

3.3   Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
Efficiency of infrastructure subprojects. Efficiency was gauged by the economic rate of
return, and unit rate norms of subprojects financed by the predecessor projects of PNPM-Rural
IV. As mentioned in Section 3.2, a study undertaken in 2012 found that EIRRs of subprojects
financed by predecessor projects ranged from 35% to 50%, higher than the targeted EIRR of
30% (these figures do not include EIRRs for subprojects in Central Java, which were unusually
high and were therefore considered outliers; see Annex 3 for details). It is reasonable to assume
that the EIRRs of subprojects financed by PNPM-Rural IV could be lower than EIRRs of
subprojects presented in the study because the study: (i) does not include subprojects that were
no longer functional (estimated at 11% of the total according to the PSF study mentioned in
footnote 9), (ii) assumes a low shadow wage rate factor for unskilled labor, and (iii) assumes
that benefits generated by a subproject remains constant over time until the end of its service
life, even though benefits will in practice gradually decline because of maintenance. However,
even if more conservative assumptions are used, the EIRR of most subprojects will, in all

  The highest beneficiaries figure was reached in 2010 with about 47 millions – that was when the project
reached national coverage with the highest block grant amount per kecamatan.




                                                   15
likelihood, remain above the economic opportunity cost of capital, (which the Bank estimates
at 12% for developing member countries), but may fall below the target of 30% for some of
the project-financed subprojects (see Annex 3 for details). It is also worth noting that EIRRs of
subprojects financed by kecamatan grants are expected to decrease over time, as most
kecamatan in the country have by now received several rounds of block grants, and may well
have used the first rounds to finance the most economically viable subprojects.
Unit rate norms are highly favorable for community-executed infrastructure projects. An
independent evaluation of KDP-financed subprojects found that the cost of small-scale
infrastructure built by villagers was on average 56% lower than equivalent works built through
government contracts. The cost savings were mainly attributed to the high level of voluntary
labor contributed by residents in community-driven development projects. These findings were
confirmed by an analysis of 48 subprojects financed by PNPM-Rural. According to this
analysis, the total cost of the subproject was 36% lower than if they would have been under-
taken by local government contractors. In 2012, PSF commissioned a technical evaluation of
1,128 subprojects financed by PNPM-Rural. 21 According to this study, PNPM-sponsored
infrastructure projects are typically 15 to 25% less costly to construct than similar projects
undertaken by line ministries. Cost savings are substantially higher (sometimes exceeding 50%
of line ministry costs) for works that involve large amounts of unskilled labor.
Efficiency of RLF subprojects. About 20% of kecamatan block grants were eligible for
reimbursement under block grants for RLFs and training. In 2012 and 2013, percentages
reimbursed amounted to 11% and 6% respectively. The efficiency of investments in these
components was not captured in the project’s results framework although PMD collects regular
data on RLFs performance, especially on non-performing loans, groups’ repayment rates and
maturity (defined as groups that are ready to be channeled to other/regular sources of financing
such as bank and cooperatives) as can be seen in Table A.2.3 in Annex 2. In addition, the Bank’s
RLF pilot project was designed to address some of the specific shortcomings of the RLF,
provide performance data, promote good financial practices, and test a set of financial practices,
procedures, as well as tools, which are expected to help improve RLF performance. An
evaluation of the pilot project will be conducted in the first quarter of 2015.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Relevance. The PDOs and design remained relevant throughout the implementation period and
was rated as “substantial.” PNPM-Rural IV was not only central in efforts to alleviate poverty
in villages covered by the project, but was also designed to consolidate and improve the
Government’s nationwide CDD program. In addition, the project explicitly addressed the
Government’s roadmap for further development of PNPM, especially by the successful
incorporation of related poverty alleviation projects.
Achievement of PDO. As described in Section 3.2, the project has achieved its development
objective as measured by its three outcome indicators. While limitations were noted in the
project’s analysis of improvements in socio-economic and governance conditions, as the
analysis was mostly derived from surveys undertaken a year prior to the project’s
implementation, the underlying assumptions made by the task team regarding limited changes


21
     Ibid.


                                               16
to the project context and circumstances from one year to the next are considered to be
reasonable given the loss of the control group. Furthermore, to further verify its PDO findings,
the Bank team expanded its methodology through the implementation of two additional
studies; undertook an analysis of the project’s intermediary results indicators; and extrapolated
data from other external sources, which were used to depict national level trends at the
household level. Intermediate results indicators and complementary in-depth perception
surveys which are used to substantiate the findings also suggest that the major share of the
project’s beneficiaries are satisfied and use project-financed infrastructure for its intended
purposes.
Efficiency. As described above, the cost of CDD projects tends to be significantly lower than
similar programs financed by government contractors. It should be noted, however, that these
cost savings could be influenced by: (i) limited capabilities for O&M for some types of
infrastructure, especially roads), and (ii) heavy reliance on facilitators, which results in
relatively high project implementation costs (project management costs of CDD projects are
usually in the order of 15-20% of total costs, against less than 10% for most other types of
projects). As mentioned in Section 3.3, there is also reason to believe that EIRRs of subprojects
financed by PNPN-Rural IV are lower than EIRRs estimated by PSF-commissioned studies.
Despite some of the shortcomings noted in the project’s monitoring and evaluation, the project
found other ways to augment the verification means and confirm the project’s outcomes, which
were substantiated through the 2012 technical evaluation and beneficiary surveys; even in the
absence of an impact evaluation or updated economic analysis. T he overall outcome of the
project is therefore rated “moderately satisfactory”.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
After more than a decade of implementation of community-driven development (CDD)
projects in Indonesia, lessons learned from various evaluations/studies have shown that CDD
projects – including this project and its predecessors – have had positive impacts on poverty
reduction. Both PNPM Rural and KDP helped increase household consumption, move
household out of poverty, and improve access to economic and social services. Evaluations
also showed that PNPM Rural and KDP are more effective in reaching poor households and
households in poor sub-districts.22 The project continues to see strong women participation in
project’s planning meetings as well as high percentage of women’s proposals being funded
each year (more than half).

By and large, PNPM Rural remains one of the most well-known development projects at the
community level – typically around 60% of respondents in PNPM-related surveys would said
that they have heard of or know the name of the project.23 A study on local level institutions in
Indonesia indicates that, in addition to being well-known, the project is also associated with
good transparency and in general has higher satisfaction rate compare to other development
projects at the local level. 24 All these positive achievements have contributed to the GoI

empowerment and accountability into the Village Law as mentioned in Section 3.1.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary surveys. PSF undertook evaluations of the project’s impact on household expen-
diture, and reviewed the technical and economic performance of the subprojects used by project
beneficiaries. The key findings of these studies are summarized in Section 3.2 and will not be
repeated here (see Annex 5 for details on the beneficiary survey).
Stakeholder workshop. On 22 September 2014, PSF invited key stakeholders to a workshop
in Jakarta to comment on the initial findings of the project evaluation presented in this ICR.
The majority of the participants agreed that PNPM has brought major benefits to the country
and should be continued beyond 2014. To further improve PNPM-Rural, it was deemed neces-
sary to encourage innovation, strengthen the role of local governments in the implementation
of the program, and improve the monitoring and evaluation framework (see Annex 6).


4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The “Risk to Development Outcome” is defined as the risk that the (expected) development
outcomes of the project—at the time of this assessment—will not be maintained or realized.
As described in Section 3.4, the project’s development outcomes remain highly relevant. By
achieving these outcomes, the project has contributed to establishing effective, participatory
and representative community committees that can mobilize funds through the preparation of
community development plans, thereby enabling villagers in project locations to benefit from
improved socio-economic and local governance conditions. Some risks related to the
development outcome are described below:

The political risk is considered to be low. While it is true that PNPM Rural’s achievements
would not be sustainable in the event of a withdrawal of local and national governmental
support for community-driven development, such a withdrawal is considered highly unlikely.
Both the central and local governments have indicated a strong and long-term commitment to
the financing of community-based poverty alleviation programs; and the new Village Law is a
strong testament to the success of PNPM.

The technical risk is rated “moderate.” While O&M village level committees have been
established under the project in order to inculcate a sense of ownership, certain weaknesses in
identified aspects of the operation and maintenance (O&M) for village infrastructure remains
a concern. The 2012 technical evaluation of PNPM investments demonstrates that O&M is
problematic for infrastructure projects that do not provide direct personal benefits (especially
roads and drains).

The social risk is rated as “moderate.” While local governance remains relatively strong as can
be seen in high number of households benefited from the project and high number of
infrastructure still being used by community after a number of years, the solidity of community
ownership of the project could be undermined if some issues, particularly related to transfer of
project assets to the community, are not addressed in advance. The Bank and the Government
are well aware of these potential issues and have started to discuss arrangements that are needed


                                               18
to ensure smooth transfer of assets to the community.

Based on the above, the overall “risk to development outcome” is rated “moderate”.
5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a)   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
     As mentioned above, the design of the project was based on the design of PNPM-Rural
      III and its predecessors, which were considered at the time of appraisal to be successful
      but with some corrective actions to reflect lessons learned from these projects (notably
      the need for additional support to the implementing agency and the need for a robust and
      integrated MIS), but otherwise using the same implementation arrangements. The Bank
      kept design changes to a minimum in order to consolidate PNPM-Rural as a full-fledged
      nationwide program and served as a successful incubator for pilot programs. To introduce
      substantial design changes during the scaling up process was not considered prudent.
There are however some weaknesses in the project’s results framework, the most important of
which are the following:
    Outcomes of investments in RLF are not reflected in the results framework. About 10%
     of the PNPM-Rural IV block grants were allocated for RLFs and training. The results
     framework measured overall outcomes of project investment (including infrastructure,
     RLF) on households’ consumption level but did not contain any indicators to measure the
     discrete impact of these investments on the socio-economic conditions of the recipients,
     nor did the Bank or PSF conduct studies to measure the outcomes of these two sub-
     components. However, as mentioned earlier, PMD did track and measure RLF outputs
     and the RLF Pilot will be commencing its program evaluation in 2015.
    Formulation of selected intermediate result indicators. The following IRIs attempted to
     measure more than one achievement (emphasis added): “minimum 50% participation rate
     of women and poorest community members in planning and decision-making meetings”,
     “O&M arrangements are in place and/or functioning for >85% of infrastructure works”,
     “>90% of local government councils provide funds and/or oversee PNPM by 2011”, “all
     oversight consultants and facilitators paid on time, [and] in full every month”, “audit
     sample size increases to minimum of 20% of all PNPM-Rural sub-districts and audit
     results are made public”. The indicator “by 2011 4,500 sub-districts with completed
     subprojects” was of limited relevance, because most loan funds would be disbursed after
     2011. Moreover, the number of completed subprojects is presumably more relevant than
     the number of kecamatan in which subprojects are completed.
In addition to that, as mentioned in Section 2.1, 2.3 and 3.2, the team used data from 2011
impact evaluation for one of the main PDO indicators due to loss of control groups and cost-
benefit analysis of repeating the impact evaluation. However, in view of the fact that the team
compensated for this by adopting other studies and analyses to augment its findings, the Bank’s
quality at entry is rated as “moderately satisfactory.”
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory



                                              19
The Bank mobilized a multi-disciplinary supervision team with substantial experience in
supervising previous Bank-financed CDD projects in Indonesia. The team was able to identify
and proactively address key issues adversely affecting achievement of the PDO in an early
stage, notably problems with data accuracy and quality, budget execution and revision,
consultant staff performance, recording of potentially adverse environmental impacts,
community procurement, facilitator recruitment, and the performance of revolving loan funds.
Furthermore, the Bank was able to leverage significant trust funds to provide enhanced
implementation support, ensure timely support to GoI and develop a strong evaluation program.
Bank supervision missions resulted in a series of important recommendations, many of which
were adopted by PMD and helped improve performance in the abovementioned-areas.
At the Bank’s suggestion, PMD, inter alia, suspended block grants to RLFs with high levels of
non-performing loans or idle funds (accounting for at least 10% and 15% of total assets,
respectively), introduced more competitive bidding for project management services through
the use of Administrative Service Firms (ASFs), improved conditions for facilitators, and
helped introduce Implementation Guidelines for Social and Environmental Safeguards
(IGSES) to help improve recording of potential social and environmental impacts by
communities. Bank supervision also sought to address the shortcomings in the Results
Framework by helping to design the RLF Pilot Evaluation to assess RLF outputs and processes
as well as provide insights into women loan and saving (SPP) group characteristics. With
respect to the bunching of IRIs, given the recommended limits on KPIs in the Results
Framework, there is always a tendency to combine indicators. However, PMD was nevertheless
able to monitor and track results as the indicators were broken down into specifically
measurable pieces. It was therefore decided that no modifications would be made to the IRIs.
As such, the Bank’s quality of supervision was therefore rated as “satisfactory.”
(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
In light of the “satisfactory” rating of the quality of supervision, the “moderately satisfactory”
rating of the overall outcome of the project, and the “moderately satisfactory” rating of the
Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry, the Bank’s overall performance is rated
“moderately satisfactory.”

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Performance of the Government
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Throughout project implementation, the project continued to enjoy the strong support of the
Government. The Government still provided majority of the project costs and has been
successful at ensuring that funds were provided in timely manner to the community – in fact,
98.8% of the funds were already disbursed by December 2012. At the same time, the quality
of policy guidance and oversight from the Government has slightly declined, resulting in less
pro-active approach that influenced timely resolution of implementation issues. The inter-
ministerial working group for PNPM (Tim Pengendali) and BAPPENAS often reacted to
suggestions for corrective action from PSF or the Bank instead of actively providing oversight,
partly because it was unable to collect and review the M&E data in a timely manner. Despite
this, the Government is still able to ensure quality of preparation and relatively smooth




                                               20
implementation as well as compliance with Loan Agreement. Thus the performance of the
Government was consequently rated “moderately satisfactory”.
(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As the Implementing Agency, the PMD played an important role throughout the life of PNPM
Rural in the implementation of a large number of sub-projects. It was able to manage the
unprecedented scale-up of PNPM Rural from around 2,800 kecamatan in 2007 to nearly 5,000
in PNPM Rural IV (2012). PMD continued to play an essential role in ensuring that the project
was implemented on time and consistently met its fiduciary obligations. And despite the
difficulties inherent in the management of a project of the scale and complexity of PNPM-
Rural, PMD was open to ways of improving the program. During project implementation, the
agency made a series of strategic decisions that improved the quality of the outcomes and the
overall performance of the project, including the revision of the PTO, which also included
improvements to, and an overall simplification of, community procurement procedures; an
increase in the facilitators’ salary, housing and benefits allowances; and a moratorium of RLF
activities in areas which were assessed to be performing poorly.
However, some of these decisions were delayed (such as the issuance of IGSES, revision of
the PTO and increase of facilitator salaries) and were only implemented after strong insistence
from both the Bank and the Tim Pengendali. The performance of PMD was therefore rated
“moderately satisfactory”.
(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Because the performance of both the Government and the Implementing Agency was rated
“moderately satisfactory”, the overall performance of the Borrower was also rated “moderately
satisfactory.”


6.    Lessons Learned
     A clear and robust results framework is essential for a nationwide CDD program. An
      adequate results framework will set clearly articulated targets for outcomes that the
      project intends to achieve over time, and periodically measure to what extent the targets
      have been achieved (instead of measuring these on an ad hoc basis or after the project has
      been completed). For a project such as PNPM-Rural, relevant targets include the
      outcomes of infrastructure block grants (which was already measured in the existing
      results framework), the outcome of RLF investments on the formation of micro-
      enterprises, the outcome of investments in training on employment of the recipient, and
      well as impacts on local governments as perceived by participating communities.
     Platform for support innovation. The project’s basic operating system and facilitation
      platform has proven to be sufficiently robust to support the incubation of pilot programs
      and to test new and innovative ideas. However, some of the experiences gained from the
      implementation of pilot programs, such as RESPEK in Papua, may suggest that the project
      may not be an effective platform for targeting specific groups or for customizing responses
      without specialized facilitation and additional resources to ensure the achievement of pilot
      outcomes. A good example where these additional resources have been successfully brought
      to bear is PNPM Generasi. At the same time, from the outset, a robust institutional capacity


                                               21
      assessment and transition plans need to be well established and agreed upon by the different
      implementing entities to ensure sufficient integration and reporting across the various pilot
      programs as well as their sustainability.
     Facilitators require incentives to promote innovation. To date, kecamatan block grants
      have been allocated to a narrow range of subproject types (even though PNPM-Rural
      offers an “open menu”). This discourages CDD planning (because every year, the same
      narrow range of subprojects are being discussed), and adversely affects economic benefits
      (as subprojects outside the familiar range of subproject types are not considered). To
      encourage innovation, facilitators need to be given financial and organizational incentives
      to help communities consider a broader range of subproject types.
     Investments in facilitator training should be based on timely evaluations and
      accompanied by competitive salaries as well as adequate resources for supervision. The
      quality of facilitators is the main driver of success for community-based project
      implementation. For this reason, it is not only essential that facilitators receive adequate
      training before they are deployed but that they also receive continued refresher training
      and mentoring to ensure that they are well oriented to revisions that are made to the
      project’s Standard Operating Procedures and other technical guidance. It is also essential
      that facilitators receive competitive salaries (including appropriate allowances), which
      are regularly increased in accordance with prevailing market conditions. This will help
      to ensure that the program can attract good candidates, has continuity and that the quality
      of supervision remains high.
     Procurement of Administrative Service Firms (ASFs) is cost-effective. Through this
      procurement method, the implementing agency was able to provide oversight to the
      program at a substantial lower cost than through traditional oversight consultants (mainly
      because overheads on specialist staff are no longer included in the cost price).
The above lessons have general applicability for similar operations in Indonesia and
comparable countries.

                              Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Kecamatan Grants.
Overview. This component provided block grants to kecamatan to finance competitive grant
proposals selected according to priorities identified in community development plans for
investments in: (i) physical infrastructure, (ii) social programs, and (iii) revolving loan funds
(RLFs). From 2011-2012, the project financed more than 150,000 proposals in over 5,000
kecamatan throughout Indonesia. More than 50 percent of these proposals were developed by
women’s groups (Table A2.1). Block grant amounts ranged from IDR 750 million
(US$ 80,000) to IDR 3 billion (US$320,000) per kecamatan per year, depending on population,
poverty incidence and location (except non-poor and near-poor kecamatan that already
received block grants for more than three cycles; these would receive IDR 450m and IDR 650m,
respectively). Communities were allowed to allocate a maximum of 25% of the total kecamatan
block grant amount to revolving loan funds (provided that the recipient RLF had a repayment
rate of at least 80%).

Most block grants for infrastructure and social programs were allocated to village roads, water
supply facilities and communal sanitation, followed by investments in new education and
health facilities (Table A2.1). Infrastructure financed from the kecamatan block grants
generated temporary employment for around 1.5 - 2 million persons annually, of which more
than 80% were classified as poor.

Block grant allocations to revolving loan funds benefited around 47,000 women’s groups on
average annually (each group consisted of 10 – 15 members). Overall the performance of RLFs
improved from 2011 to 2013, as evidenced by an increase in loan repayment rates. However,
the apparent improvement in performance was partially offset by a substantial increase in the
total amount of idle funds, which was almost IDR 2.3 trillion (about US$190 million) in
December 2013 (A2.2).

The project’s investment in rural infrastructure mentioned above has, among other things, provided
access to transportation, access to basic services (such as health and clean water), and new
economic opportunities for villagers in the project areas. Access to transportation and basic services
help households reduce their transportation costs while new economic opportunities, along with
temporary employment provided by the project and revolving loan fund, contributed to higher
income and consumption rate.

Sustainability. According to PSF’s technical evaluation of 2012, 90% of infrastructure projects
built by the program are still functional 1- 5 years after construction. This showed that sub-
projects built by the program are well maintained and used by the community. Improvements
in local governance is likely caused by the project’s transparent processes and procedures,

which require community’s active participation in the project’s decision-making forum
throughout the planning, implementation and maintenance stages.

Although poor operations and maintenance (O&M) remains a major concern for village
infrastructure throughout Indonesia in general, the project has tried to mitigate this by requiring
the establishment of an O&M committee at the village level, as a means to instill a sense of
ownership for the infrastructure financed by the project. This requirement is especially useful
to maintain sub-projects with direct personal benefits such as kindergarten buildings, clean
water facilities and irrigations. This is less useful however for infrastructure types without
direct personal benefits (notably roads and drains). Some villages have taken measures to
support maintenance of such infrastructure by including a regular maintenance fund in the
village budget. This effort would likely be strengthened in the future with the implementation
of the Village Law that will see significant increase in funds allocated to villages for
development purposes.

Component 2: Facilitation Support.
This component financed 13,000 facilitators in 2012 and more than 13,400 facilitators in 2013
(25% of which are women) to support the development of community capacities for planning
and project management through support for subdistrict (kecamatan) technical, financial and
social facilitators and district (kabupaten) facilitators. Facilitators also helped strengthen inter-
village organizations and forums, and local government coordination and oversight. The
primary outcome of this component was facilitation of over 225,000 grant proposals in
accordance with PNPM-Rural guidelines. In some provinces – especially remote ones such as
Papua and West Papua, the number of facilitators was often lower than the planned number of
facilitators, partly because of delays in recruitment but also because provincial governments
were often unable to recruit facilitators with the required experience and academic background
at the salary level stipulated by PMD (this problem especially hampered the recruitment of
technical facilitators, even after lowering entry requirements). PMD has tried to address this
by increasing the salary of facilitators in 2013 and by conducting special recruitment for
technical facilitators in remote areas through the Barefoot Engineers programs. In addition, to
improve the quality of facilitators, PMD has increased the training period for new facilitators
from 11 days to the previous duration of 21 days.

Component 3: Implementation Support and Technical Assistance.
This activity was managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU) in PMD, with technical
assistance provided through a National Management Consultant (NMC) at the central level,
and Regional Management Consultants (RMCs) at the central and provincial level. This
component financed consultants to assist in various aspects of project implementation. The
outcome was the provision of the technical assistance needed to properly manage the project
and the monitor and coordinate the extensive field presence of facilitators at the local level that
is required to successfully implement this type of community-driven development project.
Component 3 also financed several studies and evaluations to support the Government with the
evaluation of PNPM-Rural, including a large-scale beneficiary survey (see Annex 5 for details).

Component 4: Project Management Support.
At the time of appraisal, it was envisaged that this component would provide support to
PNPM’s special programs, including pilot projects (notably PNPM-Generasi and PNPM-
Green) and crisis-response activities. As described above, PNPM-Generasi was delinked from
the project, whereas PNPM-Green never formed part of the project. PNPM-Respek and PNPM-
BKPG grants were directly added onto regular block grants for PNPM-Rural IV, and their
implementation did not require dedicated project management support. As a result, there were
few Bank-financed outputs recorded under this component.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction. In 2012, PSF commenced a study to analyze the economic benefits of small-
scale infrastructure financed by PNPM-Rural. This annex summarizes the final report of the
consultant, which contains an analysis of a sample of 48 small-scale infrastructure projects
equally spread out over three sectors that have thus far absorbed most the Government’s
investment in PNPM-Rural: water supply, roads and bridges, and irrigation.25 The sample was
taken in 39 villages in four provinces (East Nusa Tenggara, West Sulawesi, West Kalimantan
and Central Java), and covered projects constructed between 2007 and 2011. The report
presented the results of three types of economic and financial analysis: (i) economic internal
rate of return, (ii) general income multiplier, and (iii) cost-efficiency. The study used followed
the methodology that was developed for a similar study conducted in 2005.26
Economic internal rate of return. The World Bank’s Handbook on Economic Analysis of
Investment Operations requires the real economic rate of return (EIRR) of Bank-financed
subprojects to be equal or higher than the opportunity cost of capital of the country (which the
Bank estimates at 12% per annum for developing country members, including Indonesia). The
average unweighted economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the 48 projects analyzed by the
consultant was approximately 97%, far above the minimum required rate, and also far above
the target for the project itself (30%). Average unweighted EIRRs were highest for irrigation
projects (112%), followed by roads and bridges (94%) and water supply (87%). For reasons
not explained in the report, the average unweighted EIRR for projects in Central Java (239%)
was far higher than in the three other provinces, where average EIRRs were in the order of
35%-50% (this ICR considers EIRRs for subprojects in Central Java as outliers). The median
EIRR was approximately 40%. List of EIRRs by sub-projects and by province can be seen in
the following table.

The average EIRR of subprojects financed by PNPM-Rural IV are considered likely to be lower
than EIRRs presented in the study, the most important being:
       The study did not take into account subprojects that were no longer functional, which
        consist of about 11% of all subprojects financed by PNPM-Rural during 2007-2011.27 If
        benefits are reduced by 11%, the EIRR of a subproject with an EIRR of 40% will drop to
        37% (40% was used because this is the median EIRR of the 48 subprojects in the sample.)
        28

       The study assumes that benefits generated by a subproject remains constant over time
        until the end of its service life, even though benefits will in practice gradually decline
        because of inadequate maintenance. Assuming that benefits decrease by 5% per year, the
        EIRR drops from 37% to 33%.
       The study assumes an unusually low shadow wage rate factor for unskilled labor (0.13,
        whereas other WB-financed projects in Indonesia and other developing countries assume
        a factor of 0.6 to 0.8). Assuming a more realistic conversion factor of 0.7 and average
        labor content of 25%, the EIRR drops further, to 28%.
After these adjustments, it is likely that the average EIRR of most project-financed subprojects
will remain comfortably above the 12% economic opportunity cost of capital, but not
necessarily above the project target of 30%. It is also worth noting that EIRRs of subprojects
financed by kecamatan grants are a priori expected to decrease over time, as most kecamatan
in the country have by now received several rounds of block grants, and may have used the
first rounds to finance the most economically viable subprojects.
General income multiplier. The second part of the consultant’s report presents estimates of
the income multiplier of infrastructure projects financed by PNPM-Rural IV. Page 22 of the
report defines the term income multiplier as “the circulation of money in a village caused by
the utilization of funds for the development of PNPM infrastructure projects”. It was assumed
that “the circulation of money” referred to “the increase in circulation of money in the year the
infrastructure project was constructed”, although the report does not explicitly say so. The
highest weighted multipliers were observed in the irrigation sector (1.34), followed by water
supply (1.28) and roads (1.18).
Cost efficiency. The cost of the 48 projects was compared to theoretical cost of the same
projects, but assuming that they would have been undertaken by local government contractors.
The results of the analysis are comparable to the findings of similar studies on cost savings of
community-driven development projects, especially when undertaken by the communities
themselves (swadaya) instead of using community contracting. Cost savings were highest for
projects in the roads and bridges sector (22%-33%), followed by water supply (19%-28%), and
irrigation (20%-25%).

                              Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Introduction. In 2012, PSF commissioned a study to assess the incidence of benefits of
PNPM-Rural. The annex first describes the background, purpose and objectives and
methodology of the study. It then summarizes the main findings.
Background. The approach of PNPM-Rural to delivery of public infrastructure and access to
credit have placed communities in control of a development process attempts to ensure a more
participatory, transparent and accountable decision-making process for the use of community-
level development funds. Recent research on the impact of PNPM-Rural has demonstrated
positive impacts on key household welfare indicators such as consumption per capita, transition
out of poverty and access to health and education services. 29 While these findings indicate an
average overall positive benefit among households residing in kecamatan which receive PNPM,
they are not able to detail how these benefits are distributed at the kecamatan and village level.
Although the potential for elite capture at the local level is present for any approach to project
implementation, there has long been a concern in the CDD literature that village level control
of the development process could lead to systematic distribution of benefits toward elites and
those connected to them.
Additional qualitative research on PNPM has discussed the perception of benefit from the
program with respect to prevailing supply of basic infrastructure and poverty status. In areas
where infrastructure gaps exist, the needs/interests of the poor with respect to PNPM
infrastructure projects are aligned with communal interests to address gaps. However, in
villages where sufficient infrastructure exists, needs/interests of the poor tend to be less aligned
with communal proposals opting for skill and capacity building for employment or
health/education service delivery instead of standard roads/bridges/irrigation which occupy
70% of all project block grant funds under PNPM. Moreover, the findings also showed that
PNPM was frequently not perceived as a poverty reduction program by community members
in general and among the poor. Rather, the project is perceived as for the community, in some
cases in direct counterbalance to household-based poverty programs.30
The findings above have significant potential with respect to the future impacts and targeting
of PNPM to locations where it has the greatest benefit for the poor and the community as a
whole. If the project is perceived as working more effectively in certain contexts such as in
poor kecamatan and areas with low levels of existing infrastructure, it suggests options for
potential targeting of the program more heavily to these areas. However, while these questions
have been looked at using well-developed qualitative research methods, the overall sample size
was limited to the nature of the exercise. The Incidence of Benefit Study attempts to further
investigate these findings by looking at patterns of perception of benefit and targeting of PNPM
using a large sample quantitative approach with the goal of determining the validity of the
qualitative results as well as providing a more detailed understanding of the issues presented.
Purpose and objectives. The primary objective of the Incidence of Benefit study is to
determine the of (1) distribution of perceived benefits and (2) the perception of PNPM as a

poverty reduction program and (3) change in consumption per capita, across a set of defined
sub-groups based on the following factors:
•   Gender
•   Poverty
•   Education of adults
•   Relationships to Village Government/Tokoh Masyarakat
•   Household-based poverty aid (RASKIN, BLT etc.)
Methodology. The survey was fielded in 600 villages across 3 provinces: Lampung, South
Sumatera, and Central Java. Ten households were selected randomly in each village during the
survey. Power calculations suggested that the number of clusters (villages) is more than
sufficient to create valid inferences with respect to sample distributions of indicators.
Main findings. Table A5.1 summarizes the main findings of the beneficiary survey by income
level, as measured by monthly per capita expenditure. In general, the majority of respondents
state that PNPM-financed infrastructure meets community needs and over 60% believe that the
infrastructure helps to improve access, followed by cleaner living environment (32%) and
protection against floods or landslides (25%). Most respondents also state that PNPM-financed
economic activities (i.e. revolving funds) meet community needs. However, a relatively small
number of respondents believe that revolving funds increase business capital (25%) or improve
business (13%). There is little variation in opinions about PNPM’s perceived benefits across
income groups, although respondents in higher income quintiles tend to be more favorable
about the program’s benefits than those in lower quintiles.

On September 22, 2014 PSF organized to a workshop in Jakarta to collect comments on the
initial findings of the project evaluation presented in this ICR. Attendees consisted of repre-
sentatives of the implementing agency, as well as consultants and facilitators involved in the
implementation of PNPM-Rural IV. To further improve PNPM-Rural, it was deemed necessary
to encourage innovation, strengthen the role of local governments in the implementation of the
program, and improve the monitoring and evaluation framework. Other key observations on
the Bank’s initial findings and lessons learned can be summarized as follows.
Observations about the Bank’s initial findings.
      The project has been successfully implemented and has achieved most of its target
       indicators. It also remains one of the most popular programs at the community level
       which community still wants to see continuing to help fulfill their basic needs. PMD
       agrees that this has been the case despite shortcomings in program implementation.
      Although most of the targets have been achieved, the results framework does not
       adequately capture capacity building elements which are the core business of PMD.
       There is anecdotal evidence that PNPM has empowered people, made them more
       independent, capable of collective action, and has developed behavior and mindsets to
       be involved in solving their development problems compared to before. However,
       these achievements have not been captured in the results framework. Existing
       indicators place too much emphasis on infrastructure outputs, although achievements
       in infrastructure could illustrate the increased capacity of communities to build and
       maintain PNPM-financed infrastructure. The ultimate goal for PMD is not the number
       of infrastructure subprojects that were constructed, but a more empowered community.
       It is recommended that the ICR provide lessons onprocess-related performance
       indicators to capture the empowerment aspects of the program and identify indicators
       that need to be changed or added to measure the impacts of community empowerment
       and sustainability of the project at the community level for PNPM Rural 2012 - 2015.
      PMD has implemented several pilot projects to help improve PNPM Rural
       performance. However, the ICR report only covers the agreed framework in PNPM-
       Rural IV loan agreement. PMD will utilize the Government’s Project Completion
       Report to cover other relevant issues, such as implementation of PNPM Integrasi pilot
       project (which aims to link PNPM Rural planning processes to the regular village
       development planning process), which has now transitioned to a regular program; and
       the pilot project to support better RLF implementation and reporting.
      Some indicators in the results framework measured more than one achievement. The
       intermediate results indicator “participation rate of women and poorest community
       members in planning and decision-making meetings” for example, is confusing – does
       the project want to measure participation of women or poor? It is thus recommended
       that separate data––participation of women and the participation of poor – are reported
       in the ICR.




                                              38
Observations about lessons learned.
      Monitoring and evaluation requires improvement. PMD, NMC and RMCs have
       different views about targets, the objectives of measurement, and how to report the
       measurement results. There is also a lack of clarity about responsibilities for
       monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the MIS is still not functioning and has
       influenced PMD’s capability to monitor and redress problems in a timely manner.
       PMD will work with AusAid to ensure that the new MIS will be operational soon to
       allow more timely and regular data collection for monitoring and evaluation purposes.
      More relevant indicators are needed to adequately capture program sustainability.
       Information on outputs may be used to illustrate the sustainability of PMPM-Rural but
       it will be better to have indicators that can capture the process of empowerment as well.
      Regional government and local institutions play an important role in supporting the
       implementation of PNPM-Rural IV. Hence, the program needs to continue working
       closely with the regional governments and build the capacity of local institutions to
       strengthen program performance even further.
      A special approach is needed for the implementation of PNPM Rural in remote areas.
       Although this has been discussed for a while, PMD needs to take immediate action to
       start operationalizing the special arrangements for remote areas.
      A new approach is needed to produce more diverse types of activities in the field.
       Because most facilitators have a technical background, activities in the field have
       focused on building infrastructure. A new approach is needed to address the lack of
       variety, such as MP3KI (the Master Plan for Accelerating and Expanding Poverty
       Reduction in Indonesia) and P2B (the Livelihood program).

    National Rural Community Empowerment Program (PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan)
             Directorate General of Community and Village Empowerment
                                  Ministry of Home Affairs
                            Executive Summary (Brief Version)


GENERAL

PNPM Mandiri is a national community empowerment-based poverty reduction program
implemented through system harmonization and development, as well as program mechanism
and procedure, provision of facilitation and stimulus funds to encourage community initiative
and innovation for sustainable poverty reduction efforts.

PNPM Mandiri Rural mission is to: 1) increase community capacity and its institutions, 2)
institutionalization of participatory development system, 3) enhance the effectiveness of local
government roles and capacity, 4) increase the quality and quantity of basic social
infrastructure and facilities and communities’ economy, and 5) develop partnership networks
in development.

FOCUS AND SCOPE OF PROGRAM ACTIVITY

PNPM Rural key activities are those that pertain to fulfillment of community basic needs,
including: infrastructure development, economy, education and health. Activities that are
prohibited in the program include those that relate to ethnic, racial and religious issues (e.g.
building of religious facilities), environmental destruction, narcotics use, personal and group
interest, and so forth. This list of items is called the “Negative List” in the program.

PNPM Mandiri Rural FY 2011, 2012 and 2013 (PNPM IV) has been implemented in 32
provinces with target locations that include all sub-districts in Indonesia that is implemented
in stages and does not include sub-districts under the “problematic” category. Target groups in
PNPM Mandiri Rural include: a) poor rural communities, b) rural community institutions, and
c) local community institutions. PNPM-Penguatan (supplement programs to strengthen the
core PNPM programs) and other supporting programs include sector-based community
empowerment programs or replications to support poverty reduction.

The implementation of these programs at the community level refers to PNPM Mandiri Rural
policy framework. Aside from core planning at the sub-district level and the block grant
scheme, PNPM Mandiri Rural IV also provided grants to four specific programs:




                                              40
a. PNPM-Generasi, an incentive grant scheme to support the achievement of Millenium
   Development Goals that relate to health and education;
b. PNPM-Green, a pilot program that funds grants and technical facilitation to promote
   community investments in natural resource management and renewable energy;
c. PNPM-BPKG, a regional block grant scheme funded by the Government of Nanggroe
   Aceh Darussalam specifically aimed to sub-districts in that province;
d. PNPM-RESPEK, also a regional block grant scheme that includes Papua and West Papua
   Provinces and funded by the Provincial Governments. PNPM-RESPEK activities fund
   projects in sectors including: (i) nutrition and food security, (ii) education, (iii) primary
   health services, (iv) rural infrastructure, and (v) economic livelihoods.

LOCATION AND BUDGET ALLOCATION

PNPM Mandiri Rural Regular FY 2011 included 32 provinces, 393 districts and 4,979 sub-
districts. The total block grant allocation was IDR 8.28 trillion. The total block grant allocation
for this activity was supported by National Budget financing in the amount of IDR 6.56 trillion,
comprising of allocations for Operational Activity Funds for Planning (DOK Perencanaan) in
the amount of IDR 276 billion, and Operational Activity Funds for Training (DOK Pelatihan)
in the amount of IDR 360 billion. PNPM Mandiri Rural Regular FY 2012 included 32
provinces, 393 districts and 5,094 sub-districts. The total block grant allocation was IDR 8.14

BUDGET DISBURSEMENT PROGRESS

The national recap of block grant disbursement for PNPM Mandiri Rural Regular FY 2011-
2013 both from National and Regional Budgets reached IDR 23.93 trillion, equivalent to
97.97% of the total activity block grant ceiling of IDR 24.42 trillion. The total PNPM Mandiri
Rural block grant funds disbursed for regular FY 2011 to FY 2013 was IDR 23.76 trillion or
99.30% of the total disbursed funds. The national recap of DOK PNPM Mandiri Rural
disbursement for Regular FY 2011 – FY 2013 was IDR 1.71 trillion. The total DOK
disbursement was IDR 1.56 trillion, or an equivalent of 92.13% of the total disbursed funds.

INFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVITIES

Infrastructure activities in FY 2011 – 2013 are almost all completed. However, there are some
infrastructure development activities that continue to see technical obstacles and management
issues, although not many. Based on the data input from Protan (the management information


                                                41
system), the infrastructure built during FY 2011 included 44,695 proposals with budget of IDR
6.48 trillion and almost IDR 194 billion of community contributions. In FY 2012, there were
47,054 total proposals with a budget of IDR 6.84 trillion and IDR 193 billion of community
contributions. In FY 2013, there was a decrease in the number of infrastructure activities to
45,379 proposals, absorbing block grants of IDR 6.75 billion and IDR 205 billion of
community contributions.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF REVOLVING LOAN FUND

During PNPM IV implementation, the Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) activities have been
running for 14 years since 1998. With time, there have been some improvements in the
technical operational implementation and implementation policy made. In terms of community
institutions, the RLF activity has been protected by establishing community as the owners
through the Inter-Village Communication Body (BKAD) institution (Law 32 of 2004,
Government Regulation 72 of 2005 and Minister of Home Affairs Circular of 2006). Currently,
the RLF activity has developed well and strongly. Some of the results are as follows.

In terms of activity management, the total RLF funds managed by communities through UPK
currently has exceeded IDR 8.5 trillion (block grants and capital seeding) with a total
repayment above 91% (Productive Economy Activities ( UEP) and RLF), almost 7% higher
than in the previous year. This data was taken from 4,672 sub-districts that reported.

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AUDIT

Results of the internal audit of PNPM Mandiri Rural FY 2011 implementation up to the fourth
quarter of 2012 are as follow:

a. Regional Management Consultant (RMC) level, included 50 districts from 79 target district
   locations (64%) and 91 sub-districts from 252 target sub-district locations (36%) with a
   sample of 151 villages.
b. Provincial level, included 338 districts from 393 target districts (86%) and 1,287 sub-
   districts from 1,324 target sub-districts (97%) with a sample of 2,331 villages.
c. District level, included 3,752 sub-districts from 5.037 target sub-district locations (74.49%)
   and a sample of 10,427 villages

The audit findings are mainly dominated by incompliance to applicable rules (PTO and PTO
Elaboration), such as incompliance to principles and procedures of goods and services
procurement, incompliance to the principle of priority-based-on-need in the planning process,
incompliance provisions and mechanisms of revolving fund management, and so forth.

External Audit. PKP conducted annual audits and control reviews of program financial
management. The audit procedure was complicated by the rather large contribution from
regional government funds (DDUB) that is audited by inspectorates. The audited sample of
sub-districts was around 20 percent of the total PNPM Mandiri Rural locations and the joint
audit results at the district level was posted at the PNPM Mandiri Rural website, in the media
and by NGOs. PNPM Mandiri implementation is actively monitored by NGOs and the media
(national and local newspapers, community radios, social media and several local TV stations).
PNPM is involved with media, and publishes reports of fraud and corruption and actions taken



                                               42
to resolve these cases, where special advertorial funds are made available in every province to
publish the outcomes and processes of case handling.

Complaint and Problem Handling. PNPM Mandiri Rural has redesigned the complaint and
problem handling mechanism that is enshrined in the Complaint Handling System SOP. The
goal is to resolve, as much as possible, the complaints in the locations where they are reported.
Beneficiaries, or anyone concerned about this program, may easily file a complaint, through
facilitators by sending an SMS, email, letter, and so forth. Grievances can be reported through
SMS (phone number 085710301234 and 082112109495), e-mail (pengaduan@ppk.or.id) or a
form available on www.pnpm-perdesaan.or.id.

There has been an increase in the number of cases solved between 2011 until 2013, but there
has been a decrease in the number of new cases reported. 2,684 new cases were reported in
2011, 1,803 in 2012, and 1,578 in 2013 (even though the total amount of funds misused and
the number of abuse cases remained constant). On average 40.53% cases were resolved. In
2011, 42.65% of cases were resolved, in 2012 33.45% and in 2013 45.49% cases.

Sanctions. Sanctions for abuse/corruption have been integrated in the PNPM Mandiri Rural
cycle and, most importantly, socialized widely. PNPM facilitators, consultants, UPK or TPK
and other actors risk to be terminated or prosecuted if they commit corruption. In unresolved
corruption cases, the disbursement and payment of funds to villages can be suspended until
proper measures are taken. This has proven to be an effective mechanism to prevent and a good
way to promote the resolution of corruption cases at the village level. If there is no proper
resolution, a sub-district can be declared “potentially problematic location”. Sanctions will also
apply if program funds are used for political or political party activities. However, every
potentially problematic sub-district is still provided with facilitators to help resolve the problem
and facilitated the planning process, even though the funds are suspended until the problem is
resolved.

LEARNING

Some of the experiences gained throughout the implementation of PNPM Mandiri Rural,
especially for 2011 until 2013, have provided a lot of practical experience for all parties and
actors, both those who are involved directly and indirectly in the implementation. These
experiences has the positive potential to be used as material for study, reflection, as well as
development, or to enrich the knowledge to be contributed or replicate in other programs or
activities regarding poverty reduction and community empowerment in rural areas. Some of
the lessons learned in the implementation of PNPM IV include:

a. Providing an Administrative Service Firm (ASF) can save cost. Through this service
   provision method, the implementing institution can provide program supervision with much
   lower cost compared to using a traditional supervising consultant (especially due to the
   overhead of specialist staff that are no longer included in the financing).

b. The Social and Environmental Safeguard Policy is an effective way to help promote public
   awareness to social and environmental impact potential. Additional technical training in
   project safeguards implementation need to be included in the pre-deployment and on-the-
   job training for facilitators.



                                                43
c. A clear and robust outcome framework is very necessary for a national CDD program. An
   adequate outcome framework will set clear targets, highly articulated to elaborate the
   outcomes that the project intends to achieve from time to time, and periodically measure the
   extent to which the targets have been achieved (rather that measure them in an ad hoc
   manner or only after the project is completed). For projects such as PNPM Mandiri Rural,
   the relevant target include outcomes from infrastructure grants (that have been measured in
   the existing outcome framework), RLF investment outcomes in establishment of micro
   enterprises, outcomes from job training investment beneficiaries, as well as impacts on the
   local government as perceived by the participating communities.
