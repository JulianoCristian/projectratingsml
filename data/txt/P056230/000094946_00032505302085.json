performance of\n            the project were satisfactory. Nonetheless, sustainability\n            is uncertain, and remains fragile, as the risks of the\n            reform program are still significant. Among the lessons\n            learned, macroeconomic stability stands out as the essential\n            factor to attain structural reform; even under difficult\n            political uncertainties, commitment to reform should be\n            pursued at the highest levels of government, particularly,\n            as opportunities for reform abound during a period of\n            crisis, a fact demonstrated by the achievement of broad\n            reforms, which might not have otherwise been possible, due\n            to the strong opposition from specific interest groups. In\n            addition, recovery operations require close coordination\n            among the multilateral institutions, to be able to agree on\n            the appropriateness of actions, and responsibilities to be\n            undertaken, as conveyed by the teamwork effectiveness\n            between bilateral donors, and the international financial\n            institutions, whose coordination contributed to a successful operation."}, "docdt": "2000-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
