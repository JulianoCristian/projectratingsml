{"cdata!": "In a country with deeply rooted and\n            widespread governance issues, where the authorities are not\n            committed to deep reforms, the Bank needs to have realistic\n            expectations about the outcome of its interventions. The\n            dilemma of supporting a country in crisis is highlighted by\n            Policy Reform Support Loan - PRSL I and, more especially, by\n            PRSL II. The Bank needs to provide the Board with a frank\n            rationale for its intervention. The experience in Indonesia\n            highlights the importance of avoiding delays in banking\n            crisis: unless resolved quickly and decisively, the fiscal\n            costs mount and vested interests further impede resolution.\n            In a major crisis, Bank management and top technical\n            specialists should give priority to resolving issues that\n            arise in the context of Bank assistance addressing the\n            crisis, even if the vehicle for the assistance is in the\n            form of a relatively modest technical assistance loan.\n            Coordination among donor agencies is essential in countries\n            in crisis and needs to be made explicit. In Indonesia,\n            coordination was successful only after an initial period of\n            uncertainty, mainly because the IMF was able to take the\n            lead. The Bank's' consultant fee structure and\n            procurement rules caused delays and impeded a rapid response\n            to Indonesia's banking crisis, and excluded or\n            discouraged the few service providers with appropriate\n            technical expertise. The Bank's central unit Special\n            Financial Operations (SFO) enabled the Bank to respond to\n            Indonesia's need for technical expertise, but the unit\n            was not well integrated into the Bank's organization\n            and was unfamiliar with its operational procedures, causing\n            bureaucratic and practical problems. The Bank's\n            performance for PRSL I is rated as satisfactory, while under\n            Banking Reform Assistance Project (BRAP,) and PRSL 11 is\n            rated unsatisfactory, in part because quality at entry for\n            these two loans was not good. The Bank lacked a strategy for\n            dealing with the crisis and timely support from senior Bank\n            management was inadequate."}, "docdt": "2003-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
