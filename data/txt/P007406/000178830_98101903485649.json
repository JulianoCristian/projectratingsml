{"cdata!": "The project is composed of four\n            complementary parts: (1) the construction of 50 junior\n            secondary schools to provide 33,000 places at a cost of\n            US$15.0 million. By the academic year 1970/71 enrollment in\n            secondary schools would comprise 45 percent of the students\n            aged 12 to 14 instead of the present 10 percent; (2) the\n            expansion of four teacher training colleges at a cost of\n            US$1.1 million, which would increase the enrollment by 50\n            percent; (3) the expansion of the Jamaica School of\n            Agriculture which produces agricultural experts through\n            three years of training, at a cost of US$2.0 million.\n            Student place would be trebled to meet the demand of the\n            public services and the private sector; and (4) the\n            expansion of the College of Arts, Science and Technology\n            which produces senior-level technical personnel in\n            engineering, science, pharmacy, commerce and institutional\n            management. The cost would be US$1.3 million. There is great\n            demand for personnel of this type and the project would\n            increase enrollment in the school by 110 percent."}, "docdt": "1966-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
