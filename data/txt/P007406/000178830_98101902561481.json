By the academic year 1970/71 enrollment in\n            secondary schools would comprise 45 percent of the students\n            aged 12 to 14 instead of the present 10 percent; (2) the\n            expansion of four teacher training colleges at a cost of\n            US$1.1 million, which would increase the enrollment by 50\n            percent; (3) the expansion of the Jamaica School of\n            Agriculture which produces agricultural experts through\n            three years of training, at a cost of US$2.0 million.\n            Student place would be trebled to meet the demand of the\n            public services and the private sector; and (4) the\n            expansion of the College of Arts, Science and Technology\n            which produces senior-level technical personnel in\n            engineering, science, pharmacy, commerce and institutional\n            management.
