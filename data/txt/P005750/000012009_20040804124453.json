The project\n            consists of five components: 1) This component will support\n            capacity building for producers organizations (both local\n            and national) and inter-professional organizations to\n            improve market access and provide, manage, and finance\n            services to their members. 2) This component will support\n            public, cooperative, and private services that deliver\n            producer services focused on increasing quality, value\n            added, and market access. 3) This component will support\n            public, cooperative, and private services that deliver\n            producer services to livestock producers, with particular\n            focus on improving quality of services and their\n            sustainability through progressive transfer and cost\n            recovery. 4) This component will aim at protecting Tunisian\n            produce from plant diseases and predators, and at protecting\n            consumers from pesticide residues, and thereby increasing\n            the value and market access of produce. 5) This component\n            will maximize the coverage, reliability, and availability of\n            statistics and information for all parties making choices\n            affecting the sector.
