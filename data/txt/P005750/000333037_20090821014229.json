"versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7063", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Agricultural Support\n            Services Project for Tunisia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory.  Some lessons learned included: the project\n            concentrated too much on cooperatives as a vehicle to help\n            farmers. It neglected private marketing intermediaries,\n            which were already providing some of the desired services\n            (advice and help on variety selection, inputs, cultivation,\n            harvest, post harvest handling, help on marketing, pest\n            control, and in some cases credit). An analysis should have\n            been done to identify several value chains for each product.\n            Then each sector should have received assistance, beginning\n            at the farm level, by looking to the end market and finding\n            out exactly what buyers would pay for. Farm level actions\n            could have been subsidized in part at the outset for newly\n            created value chains, moving toward cost recovery after a\n            transition period for the private sector value chains as\n            they became well established. Competitiveness of Tunisian\n            products is a matter of both quality and price. Quality\n            standards are now better controlled thanks to several\n            activities of the project through partnerships between\n            importers and Tunisians processors, improved regulations,\n            better laboratory infrastructure, and information\n            management. The remaining challenge is to maintain a price\n            that is competitive for both the increasingly demanding\n            local market and the export market. However, the marketing\n            of agricultural produce is currently characterized by\n            controls of some food prices at the wholesale level,\n            administrative controls of marketing margins and\n            insufficient clarity in wholesale market transactions. This\n            environment does not provide the right incentives for\n            producers to address quality issues, as quality is often\n            associated with higher costs that they might not be able to\n            recuperate. Unless the current marketing practices do not\n            change, improvements in quality as a result of better\n            service delivery will not materialize."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
