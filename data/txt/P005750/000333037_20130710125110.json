        Services Project for Tunisia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the benefits of a comprehensive\n            project design can be outweighed by complexity, difficulty\n            in implementation, and resources being spread too thin, even\n            in a middle-income country like Tunisia. The effectiveness\n            of complex projects implemented by multiple actors can be\n            undermined unless the project management unit (or its parent\n            agency) has sufficient authority to proactively coordinate\n            key implementation agencies. Attempts to move from public to\n            private provision of services can be undermined if there is\n            not sufficient attention to beneficiary, needs, perceptions,\n            and incentives, both for producers and service providers.\n            Lack of ownership of producer associations by farmers limits\n            their utility in providing farmers with inputs, access to\n            services and inserting their interests into agricultural policy."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
