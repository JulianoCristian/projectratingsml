Management Project for Albania were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            original scope of the project was too diverse and ambitious\n            and it was therefore very problematic to manage all\n            components effectively across so many different sectoral\n            areas. Component A alone will have been a significantly\n            challenging project to manage in the context of Albania\u0092s\n            development cycle. Project restructuring and a dedicated\n            team leader for component A were helpful in resolving these\n            issues. The majority of the significant delays in project\n            components were directly related to procurement activities.\n            A key weakness in all the procurement approaches was the\n            corresponding project governance arrangements and the\n            voluntary attitude to membership of evaluation committees.\n            Many procurements involved multiple ministries and\n            authorities and there was no single responsible officer\n            (SRO) appointed to take sole charge of the procurement\n            process. This led to delays in forming and sustaining\n            evaluation committees, interference and significant delays\n            in the decision making process."}, "docdt": "2014-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
