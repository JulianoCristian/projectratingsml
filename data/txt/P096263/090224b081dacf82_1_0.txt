                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the latest implementation progress following the recent project restructuring (level 2) to: (i) extend the project by 1 year, until June 30, 2014, (ii) cancel and reallocate
                         of funds between categories, and (iii) revise the dates of achieving targets in selected indicators. The restructuring responded to the Borrower's requests of March 2013 and April
                         2013 for different project components, and does not involve any changes to the PDO, the indicators, or targets of the results Framework. There is no change in Safeguards.

                         The one year extension for Components A and D only, will enable the project to reach its target of 400,000 first time registrations and deliver the two remaining drainage pumping
                         stations in flooded areas. Considering the turnaround over the past 2 years, disbursement have reached 25% and 33.4% in FY 12 and FY 13, respectively, and there is a strong
                         likelihood of achieving the PDO under the extended Closing Date of June 30, 2014. Component B closed in March 2011, and Component C will be closed in June 30, 2013, having

                         successfully implemented and achieved its targets.

                         Other key achievements to date include:
                         (i)      improvements and reduction of property registration from 47 to 10 days (the target is 5 days)
                         (ii)     Customer satisfaction has increased from poor to good (target is very good);
                         (iii)    127,839 properties (target is 400,000) have been registered
                         (iv)     Five immovable property offices (out of the target 10) have new IT systems rolled out and staff trained;
                         (v)      All territorial plans for 8 Albanian cities have been completed and the new address system has been implemented in 13 planned cities;
                         (vi)     100,000 beneficiaries in Shkoder city have benefited from restored assets and essential services, i.e.: the new storm water collector constructed and two reconstructed water
                         supply stations completed.

                         Based on progress to date and the extension of the closing date, the team is upgrading both PDO and IP ratings to moderately satisfactory.
