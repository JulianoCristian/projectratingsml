                         There has been little progress with project activities since the recent elections and change of government. Component B (Urban Land Management) and C (Municipal Investments)
                         have been completed satisfactorily. Component A (Security of Tenure and Registration of Immovable Property Rights) continues with the program of automation of offices. 5 out of

                         improve now that a new Chief Registrar has been appointed. Component D (Emergency Response) for rehabilitation of flood affected areas in Shkodar and Lezhe regions has had
                         mixed results. Five of the nine contracts have been completed, but there has been delay in delivering new pumps to the Cas Drainage pumping station and works at the Trush Water
                         Supply station have been held up while consultation with land owners continues.
