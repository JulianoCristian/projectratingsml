                         Despite extensive efforts over the past six months by project implementation agencies, the Project still remains behind schedule and implementation has been stalled during some
                         periods by factors beyond the control of the project. Disbursements have been suspended over a few months due to fiscal tightening and expenditure limits placed on internationally-

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Under Component D, the PIU was advised to work closely with the two non-performing contractors to identify alternative pump suppliers and to submit a proposed amendment to
                         contract noting the rationale for pump replacement and confirming the alternatives meet the original specifications. A critical consideration will be the time required to ensure delivery
                         and installation, which may have a bearing on the current Project closing date.
