The key lessons learned\n            include: Alignment of project and government political, and\n            continuity in reform objectives are critical for project\n            success. Confidence and communication among agencies and the\n            Bank are critical. The administrative principle of unit\n            operation works better than the functional principle.\n            Adequate and consistent policy on selection, training, and\n            motivation of unit's staff is important for unit\n            efficiency. The involvement of the regional structures of\n            Bulgarian Medical Association, Regional Health Insurance\n            Fund, and Regional Health Center and in decision-making\n            relating to the selection of practices under primary health\n            care subject to repair and equipment contributed to the fair\n            and smooth process of allocating the offers. The investments\n            made in the emergency medical system influenced\n            significantly the mortality rate in emergency cases. The\n            restructuring of blood transfusion system is part of the\n            overall restructuring of the health sector and in-patient\n            care in particular. People's motivation to donate blood\n            is in direct relationship to the economic state of the\n            country and to the development of civil society. Accurate\n            preparation of the construction works tender documentation\n            is very important."}, "docdt": "2002-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
