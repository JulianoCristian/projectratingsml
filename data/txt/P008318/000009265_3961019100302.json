         the health status of the population, while at the same time\n            improving the efficiency of the health care delivery system.\n            The project comprises four main components: (i) policy\n            analysis and management which will primarily assist the\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) in building up a capacity for\n            policy analysis and evaluation and will finance a limited\n            number of key studies such as a burden of disease analysis\n            and cost-effectiveness studies; (ii) primary health care\n            which will improve the quality and scope of primary health\n            care in selected municipalities; (iii) emergency medical\n            services which will support ongoing efforts by MOH to\n            restructure emergency medical services and improve the\n            effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery; and (iv)\n            blood transfusion which will assist current efforts to\n            improve the supply and quality of blood and blood products\n            by restructuring and rehabilitating the network of blood\n            transfusion centers by introducing safer and more up to
