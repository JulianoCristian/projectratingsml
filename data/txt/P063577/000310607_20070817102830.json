performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) the project has demonstrated that cultural\n            assets can function as a positive magnet for community\n            mobilization; 2) of all multilateral actors, the Bank\n            possesses the best tools to effectively represent cultural\n            heritage and therefore to increase the developmental impact\n            of cultural heritage projects; 3) comprehensive approaches\n            to heritage assets management should not disregard financial\n            planning lest long term sustainability be put at risk; and\n            4) signage components are more complex than they appear and\n            are more likely to be better implemented by roads and\n            transportation projects."}, "docdt": "2007-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
