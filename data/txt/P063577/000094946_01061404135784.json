     limited number of communities possessing sites and other\n            assets of cultural importance. There are two project\n            components. The first component seeks to develop sets of of\n            cultural industries and actions in several pilot sites\n            through priority investments, conservation measures, and\n            local level capacity building. Selected communities will\n            receive assistance in developing site management plans and\n            managerial skills. Sub-project activities will be of three\n            main types: handicrafts, community-based tourism, and site\n            improvements and conservation measures, among them, improved\n            site access and parking facilities, circulation systems,\n            presentation and interpretation, visitor facilities,\n            conservation and protective works, and training. Capacity\n            building activities include: 1) promoting and supporting new\n            or existing community-based organizations (CBOs) and local\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to carry out local\n            management of culture-related activities; 2) training local\n            governments in local planning and management of cultural\n            sites; 3) promoting partnerships between local-level\n            communities and among associations, the private sector, and\n            NGOs; and 4) developing market strategies. The second\n            component provides needed information, facilitates the\n            marketing of cultural assets, and coordinates project information."}, "docdt": "2001-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
