security,\n            creating jobs, and increasing private participation.\n            Although the overall project impact is anticipated to be\n            environmentally positive, various hazards on the physical\n            environment could be exacerbated and contribute further to\n            reduced vegetative cover, which in turn leads to increased\n            run-off, soil erosion, formation of gullies and\n            \"dongas,\" land degradation, and loss of\n            biodiversity. Activities could also compound the devastating\n            effects of periodic droughts and desertification on\n            agricultural production. Hence, mitigation measures must be\n            inter-related: Soil erosion will be controlled by planting\n            vegetation and using mechanical measures to intercept runoff\n            (on a catchment basis). Land conservation will restrict\n            cultivation to suitable sites, control livestock on communal\n            grazing land, and introduce mandatory dipping and\n            de-worming. Forming and empowering range management\n            associations, improving livestock quality, and\n            infrastructure and inputs are needed. The customary\n            provision discouraging long fallow encourages desultory\n            land-use practices, inimical to conservation, points to the\n            need to engage nongovernmental organizations in awareness\n            building, education, and protection. Agricultural chemicals\n            should be limited and small-scale irrigation preferred to\n            large-scale systems."}, "docdt": "1998-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
