APPRAISAL OF A HIGIVAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has requested the Bank's
assistance in financing a highway project for improving various sections of hig'
ways comprising the route between Port-of-Spain and San Fernando and consistir
of:
(a) the construction of a 4-lane expressway about 17
miles long from Chaguanas to San Fernando, includ-
ing all consulting services related thereto, and
(b) consulting services for (i) feasibility studies for
several sections of the route between Port-of-Spain
and the Southern Highway at Chaguanas and for the
extension of the Southern Highway for about 3 miles
south of the northern access to San Fernando; and
(ii) the detailed engineering of the highway sections
to be studied under (i) above, subject to confirmation
of the technical and economic justification from the
feasibility studies.
ii.       The total cost of the project is about US$ 19.7 million equivalent,
and a loan of US$ 8.6 million is proposed to cover the presently estimated
foreign exchange costs of consulting services from January 1, 1966, and of
construction costs from January 1, 1967. This would be the first Bank Loan to
Trinidad and Tobago for highways. The executing agency would be the Ministry
of Works through its Highways Division.
iii.      The number of motor vehicles in Trinidad and Tobago has almost
tripled between 1955 and 1966, representing a growth rate of about 10 percent
per annum. In view of the small size of the country and the rolling terrain,
highways will increasingly provide the major means of transporting both passen-
gers and goods. The Southern Main Road from Chaguanas to San Fernando consti-
tutes an important part of the north-south route connecting the two most popu-
lated and economically important areas in the country - Port-of-Spain and San
Fernando and environs - but is inadequate to handle even present traffic. In
view of the difficulties involved in widening and improving the present road
which goes through several urban areas and has many narrow curves and sharp
turns, the Government has decided to construct a new highway on a new alignment
with improved design features.
iv.       The road works included in the project are technically sound and
economically justified in terms of reductions in vehicle operating costs which
yield a return of about 11 percent. In addition, the project will result in
savings in travel time, reduce road accidents and help in the agricultural and
industrial development of the areas bordering the highway.
v.        Construction contracts for the proposed road works will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding. Construction is expected
to be completed in about 4 years., by mid-1971.
vi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 8.6 million equivalent;
an appropriate term would be 25 years including a 4h-year period of grace.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGMEIJY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has requested the Bank's
assistance in financing a part of its highway program. The proposed project
is the next step in the Government's plans to improve the route between
Port-of-Spain, the capital, and San Fernando, the second largest city. It
includes the construction of 17 miles of a 4-lane expressway and the services
of consulting engineers in connection therewith and for further engineering
and economic studies for improving related parts of the highway system. The
total cost of the project is about US$ 19.7 million equivalent, and a loan
of US$ 8.6 million equivalent is proposed to cover the presently estimated
foreign exchange cost of consulting services from January 1, 1966, and of
construction costs from January 1, 1967.
1.2       This will be the first Bank loan to Trinidad and Tobago for highways.
The agency responsible for the execution of the project would be the Ministry
of WTorks through its Highways Division.
1.3       The project has been prepared by the Government, assisted by the
consulting firm, Brown Engineers of Trinidad Ltd., a subsidiary of the US firm
Brown Engineers, New York.
1.4       This appraisal report is based on the findings of Bank missions
which visited Trinidad in May 1965, April 1966 and April 1967 and on studies
prepared by the Government and its consultants. This report was prepared by
M4essrs. Kaden and Parthasarathi, members of the Bank missions.
2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.1       Trinidad and Tobago is located just off the coast of Venezuela.   The
island of Trinidad, with an area of 1,86h square miles (about the size of
Luxembourg), is separated from the mainland by less than 10 miles. Tobago
lies 20 miles to the northeast of Trinidad and is 116 square miles in area.
The country became an independent member of the British Commonwealth in
August 1962.
2.2       The population of Trinidad and Tobago is just under 1 million, of
which 35,000 live in Tobago. Some 250,000 people live in the capital city
of Port-of-Spain, and another 50,000 in San Fernando, the next largest city.
Port-of-Spain is the seat of Government and the center for administrative,
commercial, banking and import-export activities.
2.3       In the last ten years, the population grew 2.9 percent a year and
it is expected to grow at about the same rate in the next few years. Gross
domestic product at market prices (in 1960 values) is estimated to have



-2-
increased from TT$ 655 million (US$ 380 million) in 1956 to TT$ 1,270 million
(US$ 740 million) in 1966, or a rise of about 6.5 percent a year. During
this period per capita income rose 3.5 percent a year, to about TT$ 900
(US$ 525) in 1966.
2.4       The relatively high per capita income is based mainly on petroleum,
which constitutes the most important sector of the economy of Trinidad and
Tobago (accounting for 28 percent of the GDP and employing 5 percent of the
labor force) followed by agriculture (10 percent of GDP and 21 percent of labor
force), sugarcane being by far the most important crop. In 1964, the Governmei.
launched a Second Five-Year Plan (1964-68), involving a total outlay of about
TT$ 300 million (US$ 175 million), which would broaden the economic base
and strengthen sectors other than petroleum.
B. Transportation
2.5       Road transport has been the principal mode of transportation in
Trinidad for many years. This has become even more so since the termination
in September 1965 of railway services between Port-of-Spain and the south
of the island of Trinidad. In terms of traffic volume, coastal shipping is
insignificant, except for inter-island traffic.
2.6       A steady decline in freight traffic and revenues, and increasing cx-
penditures and operating losses, resulted   in the abandonment in 1965 of the
railway between the capital and San Fernando, uhich served the oilfields and th
sugar belt in the center of the island. It was based on the advice of a Swiss
transport consultant who recommended the gradual replacement of the railway
by road transport. Railway service between Port-of-Spain and Arima in the
east, a distance of 14 miles, has been continued for the movement of about 8,000
passengers daily or some 2.5 million persons a year in each direction. The
National Transportation Study (discussed below) will recommend a coordinated
program for improving the road system and road transport and abandoning all raij
services.
2.7       aTo of the larger sugar companies have their own railway lines to mo-,'c
part of their sugarcane to the factories. In addition, since September 1965,
they are being permitted to use the government railway lines to transport part
of their sugarcane. Ultimately road transport is expected to replace rail
movement for hauling the entire sugarcane crop.
2.8       Except for a few main arteries in the north, the roads are mostly
winding and narrow, serving local needs fairly satisfactorily but inadequately
through traffic. There were altogether about 4,200 miles of highways in 1966,
of which about 2,500 miles were paved roads. Passenger bus transport is now
run by the Government-owned Public Transport Service Corporation which was set
up in June 1965.
2.9       Inter-island air services (between Trinidad and Tobago) are operated
by the British West Indian Airways, in which the Government has a majority
interest. Ferry services to Tobago are operated by the Port Authority.



-3-
C. National Transportation Study
2.10      The Canadian consulting firm C. C. Parker and Parsons, Brinckerhoff,
Ltd., was requested by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in February 1966
to carry out a national transportation study for the two islands. The cost
of this study is being financed by a soft loan from the Canadian Government.
The study is expected to be completed by August 1967.
2.11      The scope of the study covers all transportation modes and includes
a comprehensive survey of existing facilities. The consultants have concluded
that the most important facet of the transportation problem is the improvemnent
of the national highwray system, and are proceeding on this basis.
2.12      The major objective of the study will be the preparation of a com-
prehensive road improvement program for a twenty-year period, including more
detailed programs for the last two years of the current Five-Year Plan (1964-68
and for the subsequent five-year period, based on economic criteria. The
interim findings of the consultants confirm that the project proposed for Bank
financing has a very high priority in Trinidad's transportation program.
2.13       The Bank is in general agreement with the terms of reference for
the study, which should produce valuable information and might result in
further projects suitable for future Bank lending.
3. HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. Highwayr Administration
3.1       The Highways Division of the Ministry of lWorks (see Chart) is re-
sponsible for about 1,300 miles of highways which are under the jurisdiction
of the Central Government. This division is headed by a Director and has
three branches - Planning, Construction and M4aintenance, and Bridges; each
branch is under the direction of a Chief Engineer. The Division also employs
foreign and/or local technical Advisors on soils and materials and on drainage
matters.
3.2       The Planning Branch is responsible for the planning and design of
roads and for the supervision of their construction when carried out on a
contract basis. The Construction and Maintenance Branch is responsible for
general road maintenance including pavement markings and signs, the operation
of quarries and the central asphalt mixing plant, and road improvements which
are carried out by departmental labor forces. For the operations of this branch,
the island of Trinidad is divided into eight administrative districts. Finall-,
the Bridges Branch is responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance
of bridges and designated culverts.
3.3       The Highways Division functions satisfactorily, and highway mainten-
ance is adequate. The Division employs consultants for undertaking design and
supervision of construction of major projects for which it does not have enough
staff.



3.4       The City Council of Port-of-Spain and the Borough Councils of San
Fernando and Arima are responsible for all roads within the city or borough
limits, with the exception of those roads wihich are under the jurisdiction of
the Highways Division and which terminate within the town limits. The rest of
the system is administered by the County Councils with the exception of roads
in Tobago and some private roads. The main roads in Tobago are under the juris-
diction of the Ministry of Tobago Affairs and the remainder are administered
by the Tobago County Council.
3.5       The function of traffic management is  the responsibility of the
Transport Division of the Ministry of Works under the direction of the Trans-
port Commissioner. This includes the development of traffic control measures
and the licensing of motor vehicles and drivers.
B. Highway Network and Growth of Vehicle Fleet
3.6       At the end of 1966, the highway network in Trinidad (Map 1)
totalle about 4,200 miles or 6,700 kIm, fairly adequate for a country of this
size. _   As can be seen from Table 1, the total mileage of roads has not
growrn significantly in the last 10 years, although its characteristics as
reflected in the proportion of paved roads have been slowly improving. In
1955, less than 50 percent of the roads were paved; by the end of 1966, this
proportion had risen to 60 percent.
3.7       The most important highways in the network lie on the west-east
route from Port-of-Spain to Arima, the third largest town on the island, and
the route to San Fernando in the south which branches off from the west-east
route (N5ap 2). The major west-east highways are Beetham Highway and Churchill-
Roosevelt Highway, with access to Port-of-Spain being provided by Eastern Mlain
Road and Lady Young Road also. The major highways to the south are the
Princess Margaret Highway and the Southern Main Road up to Chaguanas and only
the latter beyond Chaguanas.

-5-
3.8       The past decade has witnessed a rapid growth in the number of motor
vehicles operating in the country, recording a tripling in numbers between
1955 and 1966 (Table 2). The number of passenger cars and taxis grew 10.5 perce,
a year, slightly faster than the number of trucks and buses which grew 8.5
percent a year, while the total vehicle fleet increased 10 percent a year.
During this period gross domestic product has been rising 7 percent and per
capita income 4 percent a year. The total number of motor vehicles reached
about 76,000 in 1966, of which about 78 percent were cars and taxis and 22
percent trucks and buses. The vehicle density is one vehicle for every 13
persons in the country; this is a very high figure for a country in Trinidad's
stage of development, and is somewhat similar to the vehicle density of Italy.
C. Traffic Volumes and Traffic Counts
3.9       Since 1955 random traffic counts were made on one or two days in
each year on the Southern Main Road, indicating a traffic growth of about 11
percent a year on that particular road. Systematic counts were begun only
in 1965 in connection with the proposed project, when daily counts were made
manually at several points on the route between Port-of-Spain and San Fernando
during one week in June and one week in August. These counts showed that
traffic volumes on the major east-west and north-south highways (see para 3.7)
ranged from 10,000 - 20,000 vehicles a day on the Southern Main Road south of
Chaguanas to 25,000 - 30,000 vehicles a day on the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway.
The data are considered typical of traffic flows throughout the year.  More
exhaustive counts with mechanical counting equipment and origin-destination
studies are expected to be made as part of the Yational Transportation Study.
The equipment will be left behind at the conclusion of the Study so that
traffic counts can continue to be made on a systematic basis.
3.10      The Government has agreed to make arrangements for collecting,
recording, and evaluating, on a continuing basis, data relating to traffic
on the main road system and in particular on the Southern Main Road and the
Southern Highway, including average daily traffic volumes by type of vehicle,
vehicle operating costs and volumes of freight and passenger traffic. Such
arrangements are to be initiated within six months of receipt of the National
Transportation Study on the basis of the Study's findings.
D. Highway Financing and User Charges
3.11      During the past few years, the Government has been gradually in-
creasing the amounts spent on highways, both for maintenance and for new
construction and improvement. Appropriations come out of the general budget
of the Government, and there is no earmarking of the proceeds of specific
taxes for financing highways. However, it is of interest to note that receipts
from fuel taxes, import duties, purchases taxes and license fees paid by road
users more than covered the highway expenditures (Table 3). In view of the
fact that railway services are expected to be phased out (see para 2.6), there
are no significant problems of transport coordination.



-6-
E. Highway Transport Industry
3.12      The Public Transport Service Act was passed in 1965, setting up a
semi-autonomous public corporation to operate bus and rail services in the
country and thus establishing coordination in operational matters between road
and rail passenger services. The Corporation had a five-year program to retire
all outdated buses and expand its bus fleet from 264 at the end of 1965, with
an average seating capacity of 34 to a bus, to 400 buses with a larger average
seating capacity.
3.13      In addition to buses, taxis are a major mode of passenger transpor-
tation in Trinidad, especially taxis operating on specific routes charging a
flat rate per passenger. In 1966, there were about 8,000 taxis.
3.14      Movement of goods within the country is almost exclusively by trucks
and pick-ups, the majority of them operated by owner-drivers. There is no
Government regulation of trucking rates or of entry into the trucking business,
except for the licensing fee.
4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.1       As mentioned in paragraph 3.7 the existing route between
Port-of-Spain and San Fernando covers the following highways (see Map 2):
Beetham IHighway (with Lady Young Road and Eastern Main Road as alternatives);
Churchill-Roosevelt Highway; Princess MIargaret Highway; and the Southern Main
Road. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago plans to construct or improve
the route in stages appropriate to traffic requirements, and the proposed
project marks the first stage. The project consists of:
(a) the construction of a 4-lane expressway (Southern
Highway), 17 miles long from Chaguanas to San
Fernando, including the half-mile-long connection
to San Fernando, and all consulting services
relating thereto; and



-7-
(b) consulting services for (i) feasibility studies for
several sections of the route between Port-of-Spain
and the Southern Highway at Chaguanas and for the
extension of the Southern Highway for about 3 miles
south of the northern access to San Fernando, and
(ii) the detailed engineering of the highway sections
in (i) above, subject to confirmation of the technical
and economic justification from the feasibility studies.
4.2       The status of project preparation is indicated in Table 5. The de-
tailed engineering is complete and all bidding documents for the length of
highway included for construction in this project are under preparation. The
preliminary engineering is 95 'percent complete for those highway sections whic
are included in the project for feasibility studies and possible detailed
engineering.
B. The Project Highway (Southern Highway)
4.3       The existing Southern Main Road (Chaguanas to San Fernando via
Couva), is a two-lane paved road varying in width from about 18 feet to
22 feet. Despite the growth of traffic, this road has experienced few
changes from its original condition, At present it has a tortuous align-
ment with frequent sharp curves. Unlimited access to the road, and pedes-
trian traffic in the numerous communities it traverses, hinder the
continuous flow of motorized traffic. All intersections and crossings,
of which there are many, are at grade. The number of satisfactory passing
zones is small. There are no shoulders for almost its entire length. The
road provides a low level of traffic service and its capacity is exceeded
for several hours every working day; volume counts made at various locations
on the road in August 1965 indicated well over 1,000 vehicles an hour
during the peak hours and 10,000 - 20,000 vehicles a day,
4.4       The existing San Fernando Bypass Road is in effect a continuation
of the Southern Main Road in the vicinity of San Fernando. The Southern
Main Road continues into San Fernando proper while the Bypass Road was
constructed to circle San Fernando and re-connect with the Southern Main
Road south of San Fernando. Since construction of the Bypass, in the late
1950's, the development of San Fernando has extended to and beyond it.
The Bypass is a paved, 24-foot-wide road which carries about 8C0 vehicles
an hour for several hours during the working day and has several at-grade
street intersections.
4.5       Izi view of the poor alignment of the Southern Main Road and
the difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way on this already heavily
urbanized route, a new expressway (the Southern Highway) is being planned
for construction to the east and is the subject of the proposed loan. The
alignment has been chosen after taking into consideration regional plan-
ning requirements, topography and soil conditions. The length of the
expressway is 16.6 miles and the connecting road between the San Fernando
Bypass Road and the expressway interchange is 0.6 miles long. ThO new



-8-
route will be about 2.7 miles shorter than the existing route via the
Southern Main Road. The northern half of the Southern Highway is located
in flat land and the southern half in rolling terrain. As far as the
geological factors are concerned, no unusual circumstances or difficulties
are foreseen.
4.6       The full control of access, the grade-separated interchanges
and the paved shoulders will allow a continuous flow of traffic. A study
of future traffic indicates that it is economical to build four lanes under
this project, rather than only two lanes now with phased construction of
the additional two lanes later. Even with conservative assumptions
of traffic growth, the volume would amount to about 20,000 vehicles a
day five years after the completion of the new expressway.
4.7       The general design standards for expressways in Trinidad are
indicated in Table 4 and are satisfactory. They were used for the
Southern Highway, the detailed engineering for which has been completed.
The Consultants now employed on the National Transportation Study agree
with the basic design standards employed.
4.8       As indicated in Table 5, the construction of the Southern
Highway has been divided into four sections. A contract has already been award-
ed for 2.7 miles, including a 1.4-mile section (called the "Government Section')
on which the Government had undertaken some construction work on a more-
or-less experimental basis, without providing any interconnections to
the existing highway system. Earthwork for 4 lanes and pavement for
2 lanes had been completed on the 104-mile section without the provision
of major drainage facilities or structures.   The work was started in
1964 and completed in 1965, and cost about TT$ 1.0 million. Contracts
were awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding.
4.9       Subsequently, as part of the engineering studies for the
Southern Highway, the Government asked the consultants to undertake
detailed engineering of the 2.7-mile section as a 4-lane expressway; which
included completion of the 1.4-mile Government section. Bidding on these
works was open to international competition. The construction contract was
awarded in December 1965 toa large local construction fm, which is qualified
for this type and size of work. The work is expected to be completed
in June 1967, with design and supervision of construction by Bank-
approved consultants. The contract amounts to TT$ 2.8 million (US$ 1.6
million) of which expenditures of about TT$ 0.6 million (US$ 0.35 million)
will be occurring in 1967.
4.10      The balance of the construction work, estimated to cost about
TT$ 21 million (US$ 12 million) till. be divided into four contracts as follows
in order to permit both local and foreign contractors to compete: The
construction of the expressway, including the paving of only one 2-lane
carriagefay, would be opened to bid in three contracts and bidding would be
permitted either for each individual contract or any combination thereof.
WXith this arrangement the expressway could be open to 2-lane traffic somne
21-, years after commencement of constructioni work. The fourth contract com-
prises the paving of the second 2-lane carriageway and will be advertised
shortly before completion of the other contracts, thus providing for
4-lane operation after about one year. The contracts are suitable for inter-
national competitive bidding; invitations will be sent to prequalified contrac-
tors in accordance with the Bank's procedures. The cost estimate

of the construction work is based on the experience gained on the recently
constructed expressway section at Chaguanas and other recent works executed
by contract, and is considered to be satisfactory.
C. Consulting Services
(i) For the Project Highway
4.11      The Government was assisted by Brown Engineers of Trinidad Ltd. in
the preparation of this part of the project. The contract for preliminary
and detailed engineering of the Southern Highway was signed in April 1965,
and the preparation of bidding documents is now nearing completion.  The
consultants were asked by the Government at the Banes suggestion to undertake
traffic surveys over the whole route, Port-of-Spain to San Fernando, in June
and August 1965 and the work was completed in October 1965. The Governmient
intends to request the same consultants to supervise the construction work.
They are acceptable to the Bank.
(ii) For Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering
4.12      Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for other highway
sections of the route between Port-of-Spain and San Fernando and
beyond (in north to south sequence) are included as part of the project
as follows (see Table 5):
(a) reconstruction of Beetham Highway;
(b) construction of an interchange at points of con-
vergence of Churchill-Roosevelt Highway, Eastern
Main Road and Lady Young Road;
(c) expansion of Churchill-Roosevelt Highway between
Beetham Highway and Princess Margaret Highway;
(d) expansion of Princess Margaret Highway; and
(e) extension of the Southern Highway beyond the northern
access to San Fernando by about three miles to the
San Fernando-Siparia-Erin Road, a southern connection
to San Fernando, and the construction of connections
from the main roads from the south to such extensione
The preliminary engineering of the sections of the route between Port-of-Spain
and Chaguanas was begun by the above consultants in June 1965 and has been
completed. Some detailed engineering has been commenced for the Churchill-
Roosevelt Highway and the southern extension of the Southern Highway on
the basis of acceptable preliminary engineering; the technical and economic
Justification for improvement of these sections is apparent.



-10-
h.13      Arrangements for these engineering services have been confirmed
during loan negotiations and assurances obtained that further detailed engineer-
ing will be undertaken only after confirmation of the technical and economic
justification from the feasibility studies. The existing condition of the
various road sections and the future steps required are described in the Annex.
Construction of most of the road sections should be undertaken shortly after
the detailed engineering has been completed and further external financing may
be required for this purpose.
D. Cost Estimates and Foreign Component
4.14     Cost estimates for construction works included in the project are
based on the unit prices of the contract already under execution (para 4.9),
and on detailed engineering recently completed by the consultants for the
balance. The costs for engineering services and studies are based on contracts
already awarded or estimates prepared by the consultants.
4.15      All cost estimates were confirmed by the Government and reviewed
by the Bank staff. The estimates given in para 4.18 below include for financing
under the Bank loan about US$ 0.43 million for the foreign exchange component
of expenditures totalling about US$ 0.66 million equivalent incurred or to be
incurred from January 1966 through June 1967 under contracts for engineering
services entered into between the Government and its consultants since April
1965 as described in para 4.11. Retroactive financing of this amount is proposed
because the items of work performed constitute an essential part of the project
and were undertaken at the Bank's request to meet its requirements. On the
construction side (including the consultants' supervision) financing from the
proposed Bank loan of about US$ 0.2 million to cover the foreign exchange cost
of expenditures totalling about US$ 0.4 million equivalent incurred or to be
incurred from January 1, to June 30, 1967, is included.  This retroactive
financing is proposed because of the delay that occurred in completing the
negotiations held in 1966, pending clarification of the Government's fiscal
policy and of the prospects of assuring local financing for the project. The
total cost of the project comprises all construction wiork on the Southern
Highway which commenced with the "Government Section" (para 4.8) in 1964.
4.16      A 10 percent contingency allowance has been provided for possible
increases in estimated physical quantities during construction and for unforeseen
requirements of engineering work. A price escalation contingency of 8 percent
is deemed adequate over the expected four-year duration of the construction
work of the project, considering the stability of living and construction costs
in Trinidad and Tobago over the past few years.
4.17      The foreign currency component of the highway construction cost has
been estimated by the Bank mission at 50 percent on the basis of discussions
in Trinidad with Government officials and the consultants and an analysis sub-
sequently submitted by the Government. The foreign currency component of
engineering services is estimated by the consultants at 65 percent on the basis
of past experience of such work in the country and appears reasonable.

E. Project Execution and Financing
4.19      The construction of the Southern Highway is scheduled for completion
in four years, including six months for international competitive bidding
and award of contracts.  A contract was awarded in December 1965 (para 4.9)
and preparation of bidding documents for the remainder is being completed.
The feasibility studies and engineering work included in the project can be
finished well within the same time period. The Government intends to award
most of the remaining consulting services to the consultants who assisted
in preparing the project, and the Bank concurs with this arrangement. The
annual scheduling of expenditures is expected to be as follows:
US $ million equivalent
Before
1967   1967  1968  1969 1970 1971    Total
Estimated loan disbursements        -      0.8   2.1   2.6   2.5   o.6   8,6
Estimated Goverrment expenditure   2.9     0.4   2.2   2.6   2.4   0.6  11.1
Total-        2.9     1.2   4.3   5.2   4.9   102  19.7
4.20      Disbursements from the proposed loan for consultants' services and
construction contracts will be based on percentages related to the presently
estimated foreign exchange ccmponents (para 4.17). In case of an increase
in the project cost these percentages may be reduced to spread disbursementv
over the entire period of execution of the project. Any balance of the loan
remaining undisbursed after completion of the project should be cancelled.
4.21      The Southern Highway is already included in the Second Five-Year
Plan of Trinidad and Tobago (1964-68). Assurances have been obtained from
the Government that adequate funds will be provided in its annual budgets
to meet the local currency component of project costs.
4.22      The acquisition of right-of-way is not expected to present any
problems. Most of the land required for the proposed Southern Highway is
already Government-owned, and a start has already been made on the acqui-
sition of the rest of the required land. Arrangements have also been made
for the relocation of utilities with the companies or public authorities
involved as the case may be. Assurances have been obtained during loan
negotiations that contractors will have timely access to the work sites
and that utilities will be relocated according to a time-table satisfactory
to the Bank.
5. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. General
5.1       The rapid growth of Trinidad and Tobago's economy and vehicle fleet
between 1955 and 1966 has already been described in paragraphs 2.3 and 3.8
The Government's Development Plan (1964-68) assumes an average annual growth



-13-
df 5 percent in the gross domestic product, against an average growth of 7
percent a year in the past ten years. In view of this and of the slowdown
in vehicle growth in the past 2-3 years, the growth of the vehicle fleet is
expected to be 5-6 percent a year in the future, compared to an average
growth of 10 percent a year in 1955-66. As mentioned in paragraph 3.9, traffic
growJth on the Southern Main Road has been over 11 percent annually and has
continued at that level despite the aforementioned slowdown in the growth of
the total vehicle fleet. Taking this into account, it has been conservatively
assumed that traffic on the route between Port-of-Spain and San Fernando will
grow at 8 percent a year up to 1970, and will then begin to decline to 5 percent
a year beyond 1980,
5.2       The Southern Main Road is at present the only route between Port-of-
Spain and the south. This highway is seriously congested and would soon
become an impediment to the steady economic development of the country. The
present route lies through heavily built-up urban areas, with poor alignment;
any effort to widen it will be both expensive and time-consuming because of
difficulties in acquiring right-of-way. Hence the decision of the Trinidad
Government to seek a new route avoiding administrative and legal problems and
making it possible to construct a highway with optimum design features.
5.3       In connection with the project, the Government of Trinidad engaged
consultants to undertake the following traffic studies on the existing route
betw,een Port-of-Spain and San Fernando; (i) 24-hour volume counts over a
period of seven consecutive days in both June and August 1965 at various
points; and (ii) two 16-hour origin and destination studies during June 1965
and two 16-hour origin and destination studies during August 1965. Traffic
forecasts for the proposed Southern Highway are based on the results of these
studies, supplemented by the Highway Division's own studies as well as earlier
traffic counts over several years.
5.4       On completion, the Southern Highway will constitute a major improve-
ment on the route betwJeen Port-of-Spain, Trinidad's capital city and commercial
po:^t, and San Fernando, the second city of the island, and other industrial
and farming areas around it. On the basis of origin-destination and time-and-
distance analyses, it is estimated that about 50 percent of the traffic between
Port-of-Spain and points south of Chaguanas will initially use the new highway.
But the existing road will again reach a high degree of congestion around 1975,
after which the entire additional traffic volume is expected to divert to the
new road.
5.5       The most important quantifiable economic benefits arising from the
highwray construction included in the project will be savings in vehicle opera-
ting costs an%," time savings applicable to travel between Chaguanas and San
Fernando. There will also be some savings resulting from reduction in the
incidence of accidents and the consequent damage to life and property. These
are discussed in detail below.
B. Vehicle Operating Costs
5.6       Savings on vehicle operating costs arise from reduction in distance
to be travelled, from the elimination of situations requiring slaoing down or
stopping, and from permitting vehicles to maintain steadier and higher speeds.



-14-
On the average, it is estimated that the reduction in distance to be travelled
will be about one mile per passenger car trip and about two miles per trip for
truc}s and buses which use the proposed road instead of the existing road,
a reduction of around 10 percent, resulting in savings of 15 TT cents per
car trip and 60 TT cents per truck trip. It is also estimated that on the
average, the new road will eliminate two stops for each vehicle, resulting
in a saving of 4.5 TT cents per vehicle unit in operating costs. In addition,
several situations where traffic has to slow down on the existing route on
account of traffic congestion will be eliminated; this is estimated to result
in a further 1,5 - 2.0 percent savings in vehicle operating costs. There will
also be some benefits to traffic using the existing road on account of decon-
gestion, in the form of reduction in operating costs; this is estimated con-
servatively at 1 percent. Together these savings would amount to about TT$ 265
million in 1971, rising to TT$ 7.5 million by 1991, and would yield an economic
return of about 11 percent on the investment over an estimated useful economic
life of 25 years.
C. Time Savings
5.7       The only time savings taken into account are those of truck, bus
and taxi drivers . These have been conservatively valued at the Govern-
ment wage rate of approximately TT$ 1 per hour applicable to vehicle
drivers. Average time saved per trip wiTll be about 10 minutes. Time
savings on the existing route have been ignored since these will be
marginal. The value of these savings is estimated at TT$ 620,000 in
1971, rising to TT$ 1.8 million in 1991. These savings will raise the
economic return on the project to 13.5 percent.
D. Reduction in Road Accidents
5.8       An estimate of road accidents during 1965 on the sections of the
Southern PHain Road which will be supplemented by the proposed highway, shows
that there were altogether 983 accidents, of which there were fatalities in
28, injuries to persons in 216, and damage only to property in 739. The
property loss is estimated at approximately TT$ 900,000. It is expected that
the proposed road, which will be a divided highway with limited access, will
reduce the overall incidence of accidents by more than 25 percent fran what it
would otherAise be, resulting in a saving of around TT$ 340,000 for 197, and
rising to over TT$ 1.0 million by 1991 in accordance with the anticipated
traffic growth. If these savings are added to the other benefits resulting
from the project, the economic return on the proposed investment would be
nearly 15 percent.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECO0W    EMATIONS
6.1       The proposed project comprising the engineering and const action of
an expressway and consultants' services for subsequent improvements to the
related highway system, will help relieve the increasing traffic congestion



on the route between the two most important urban centers in Trinidad,
Port-of-Spain arid San Fernando. The project is technically sound and eco-
no,iically justified. The cost estimate is realistic.
6.2       The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$ 8.6 million equivalent. An appropriate term would be 25 years,
including a )0-year period of grace.

DETAILS OF EXISTING CONDITION OF ROAD SECTION FROM
PORT-OF-SPAIN TO CHAGUAMAS AND SOUTH OF SAI FERNANDO
AITD TFUTURE STEPS REQUIRED
1.        Road access to Port-of-Spain is provided by the Beetham Highway,
Eastern Taian Road and Lady Young Road, the first of which is meant to carry
of the trucks to the center of the city and in particular to the port.
However, the existing Beetham Highway consisting of two 23-foot roadways,
separated by an 8-foot median, is restricted to vehicles of not more than
5 tons weight because of unfavorable soil conditions and faulty construction.
It carries about 2,000 vehicles an hour in one direction during peak hours.
The Government intended originally to resurface this 1.9-mile-long highway,
which was constructed in 1959. On the Bank's recommendation, consultants
were retained by the Government to investigate the causes of the uneven road
surface and to estimate future traffic requirements. The consultants, BrowTn
Engineers of Trinidad, a subsidiary of the U.S. firm Brown Engineers of
New York, in consultation with a U.S. soil expert, Mr. L. Casagrande from
Harvard University, came to the conclusion that the upper part of the embank-
ment and the entire pavement should be reconstructed. Reconstruction of the
existing four lanes and an interchange at the city line of Port-of-Spain,
should follow shortly after completion of the engineering design.
2.        The National Transportation Study now under way (paragraph 2.10),
will establish a coordinated program for improving the road system and road
transport and for abandoning the railroad which closely parallels the Eastern
Main Road. The Government will decide, in consultation with the Bank, on the
phased abandonment of the railroad not later than six months after receiving
the result of the study, and before the consultants commence the detailed
design of the interchange.
3.        The Beetham Highway is connected to the main arterial to the east
and the south, the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway, by a roundabout which is
congested for several hours every working day. About 3,000 vehicles an hour
were counted on the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway, which is 2-lane, near that
intersection during peak hours in August, 1965. The Churchill-Roosevelt
Highway was constructed by U.S. military forces in 1944-45. The section from
the Beetham Highway roundabout to Princess Mlargaret Highway is about 3.0 miles
in length and consists of a 23-foot-wide asphalt pavement with gravel shoulders.
Major utility services have been constructed within the 200-foot-wide right-of-
way. Traffic figures indicate that the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway will requl-re
three lanes in each direction within 10 to 15 years. As the existing roadway
is in good condition, it should be retained for one direction of travel. Inter-
changes are proposed to be provided for this expressway at the Beetham Highway,
Princess Margaret Highway and between them both. Construction should be
undertaken as soon as the engineering is completed.
4.        The existing Princess Margaret Hi gway from the Churchill-Roosevelt
Highway to Chaguanas is77.5 miles in length. A portion of this highway was
constructed by U.S. military forces in 19h5; the remainder was constructed
locally several years later.   It consists of a two-lane, 23-foot-wide asphalt

pavement with gravel shoulders.   The existing roadway is in good condition
and should be retained as part of a four-lane expressway which would be
needed in about five to ten years.  Tto grade-separated crossings would be
provided at approximately mile 1.5 and mile 3.5. Frontage roads will be
provided for the numerous existing connections to Princess Margaret Highway
to control the access. The traffic counted in August 1965 amounted to 11,000
vehicles a day with about 20 percent of trucks and buses.
5.        An extension of the new expressway from the northern access to San
Fernancdo to connect with the main roads south of the town, narmely, South Trunk
Road and San Fernando-Siparia-Erin Road, would provide an outer, second bypass.
The 1minimum distance of about half-a-mile from the existing, inner bypass would
be sufficient to allow for the anticipated further development of Sana Fernando
in this direction. The expressway would be extended by about three miles.
Construction of the expressway, including the necessary interchange, should
begin as soon as the engineering has been completed.
6.        In order to locate properly the southern extension of the proposed
Southern THighway, the future continuation has been investigated by a reconnais-
sance study, which was completed in November, 1965.  This study dealt with the
route location between the southern outskirts of San Fernando and Point Fortir.
