For this purpose, a package of services was provided:\n            nutrition education, primary health care, supplementary\n            on-site feeding of children who were severely malnourished\n            or whose growth was found to be faltering, education for\n            diarrhea management, administration of vitamin A, periodic\n            deforming, and supplementary feeding of a limited number of\n            women. A principal characteristic of this project was the\n            use of growth monitoring through monthly weighing of all\n            children 6-36 months old to target delivery of these\n            nutrition and health services to needy children and to serve\n            as an educational device for mothers. Indeed, this project\n            was the first large-scale use of growth monitoring for this\n            purpose. Project funds were utilized, among other things, to\n            establish, equip and operate some 9,000 Community Nutrition\n            Centers (CNCs) and 2,000 new health sub-centers in 173 of\n            Tamil Nadu's 373 rural blocks (an administrative unit\n            covering a population of about 100,000)."}, "docdt": "1994-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
