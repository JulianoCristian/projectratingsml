The\n            objective of reducing congestion in the corridors has been\n            met with traffic on the highways taking from 27 to 67\n            percent of the total corridor traffic in 1999. Furthermore,\n            the economic benefits are considered sustainable, without\n            any predictable elements of risk, as traffic has been\n            growing rapidly. The lessons drawn from this project\n            include: 1) Securitization of Bank financed assets is the\n            most innovative aspect of the project. Securitization\n            operations contributed significantly to the financing of the\n            Foshan-Kaiping Expressway (FKE) without any liability to\n            sovereign or sub-sovereign agencies for the repayment, since\n            the funds raised through these transactions were in effect\n            leveraged by the future traffic stream on FKE. Efforts to\n            securitize existing revenue-producing assets with the\n            involvement of credible international institutions will\n            continue to be an important capital-raising device for the\n            country. 2) Substantial cost overruns were encountered in\n            the construction of FKE and Longgang-Tanxi Expressway. A\n            more in-depth project preparation will be cost-effective in\n            securing the technical design and selecting suitable\n            construction methods. 3) The soil settlement problem needs\n            further remedial works. 4) More involvement in construction\n            and rehabilitation of lower class roads would directly help\n            remote communities to alleviate poverty."}, "docdt": "2001-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
