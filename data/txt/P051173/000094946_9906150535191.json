protection system in\n            Moldova. The first project component, social protection\n            policy analysis and monitoring and evaluation, will\n            establish and develop the Social Policy Unit; monitor the\n            implementation of reformed pension policies; construct a\n            Social protection database; produce an annual social report;\n            and build capacity through training activities. The second\n            component, social project administration, will strengthen\n            the administrative capacity of the Ministry of Labor, Social\n            Protection, and Family through rationalizing its\n            organization structure and functions of the administration,\n            designing and implementing a human resource development\n            plan, strengthening financial management, and developing a\n            comprehensive information system. The third component,\n            public information provision and communication, will finance\n            the purchase of basic equipment, and the production of\n            information materials to be disseminated to various target\n            groups. The final component, project coordination, will\n            finance the operational expenses of the project coordination unit."}, "docdt": "1999-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
