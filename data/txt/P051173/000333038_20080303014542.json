"The overall outcome of the satisfactory;\n            the performance of the Bank is satisfactory; and the\n            performance of the borrowwer is moderately satisfactory. The\n            objective of the Social Projection Management Project was to\n            develop the capacity required to implement the pension\n            reform and to support the development of an efficient and\n            sustainable social protection system in Moldova. The project\n            major changes include: (i) increase of contributions to the\n            National Social Insurance House (NSIH); (ii) on time payment\n            of pensions; (iii) transparent budgeting and accounting\n            practice of the NSIH; (iv) improved management of the NSIH;\n            (v) efficient information support through improved IT\n            system; (v) strengthened social protection policy support;\n            and (vi) increased awareness of the public regarding the\n            pension system. Some lessons learned included: Improving the\n            awareness of the general public about their rights and\n            responsibilities in the pension system. The roles of the\n            Communication Unit (CU) and the NSIH in pension information\n            dissemination during this operation were crucial toward\n            meeting the project development objective; implementation of\n            similar projects requires improving the capacity of the\n            implementing agencies to analyze social protection policy\n            issues; it is essential to maintain commitment to pension\n            policy reform. Implementation of a similar operation on\n            pensions and social protection will require a better\n            understanding of the institutional environment in which the\n            project is to be implemented; strong reliance on sound\n            analytical basis for designing effective operations in\n            social protection is important. This operation was\n            underpinned by the Bank's Economic Sector Work (ESW)\n            and intensive dialogue with the Borrower, which contributed\n            to a better understanding of social protection issues in Moldova."}, "docdt": "2007-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
