Implementation Status Overview
The June 2011 project midterm review provided an opportunity to carry out a candid assessment of the implementation status and to agree upon a set of benchmarks to be met and
on a series of activities to be implemented within the coming months the majority of which have been accomplished. Project implementation has progressed and disbursement is now
at 48% from 15% in March 2011 and 6% in November 2010. Thus the project has essentially disbursed almost half of the funds in one year. Disbursement has been on high impact
o   activities such as procurement and distribution of bed nets, the provision of medical equipment for health centers and the support to the ongoing DHS. It is expected to continue
a progressing during the next 3 months as some new important activities such as the PBF pilot are being launched. Key project inputs, such as Long Lasting Insecticide-treated bed
b   nets had suffered initial delays due to poor planning -and lack of experience in mass distribution, but have now been completed in 6 departments. The contract with MACRO
o   International to carry out a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) has been signed and data collection is currently being carried out with a preliminary report to be completed in
0   February 2012. The hiring of a health services purchasing agent, of a monitoring agency and of a training agent to implement a large Performance-Based Financing (PBF) pilot has
F    been completed with contracts signed.. The project has also completed a census of health staff and data are being analyzed. A large UNFPA designed survey on obstetrical and
.0  neonatal care is also planned but implementation has been delayed because of last minute contract modifications required by UNFPA . The project continues to receive full support
-Q  of the Cabinet.. In addition the Ministry is currently revising its National Health Plan (2011-2014) and has began collecting data to complete a "carte sanitaire" ( health facilities map)

Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
World Bank country and sector management will continue to monitor implementation very closely. The Bank task team is pleased with the progress achieved since the Mid Term
Review and will continue to support implementation through monthly visits and regular dialogue with the government in Brazzaville. Finally, the Ministry will ensure that key activities
with a direct impact on population's health will be implemented, and in particular the mass distribution of bed nets and an increase in vaccination coverage.
Restructuring History
