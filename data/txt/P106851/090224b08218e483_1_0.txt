                         The development objective of the project is to support the strengthening of the health system in order to effectively combat the major communicable diseases and
                         improve access to quality services for women, children and other vulnerable groups. Within the comprehensive sector development program of the PNDS, the IDA
                         supported project will focus primarily on strengthening sector stewardship, fiduciary systems and monitoring and evaluation (Component1); human resources
                         (Component 2); Infrastructure assessment, mapping and comprehensive rehabilitation plan, including limited construction (Component 3) and, delivery of Package of
                         Essential Services (PSE), with emphasis on Malaria HIV/AIDS and MCH, pharmaceuticals management, community participation/indigenous peoples and equity
                         (Component 4).

                         Implementation continues to be satisfactory. The project closing date was extended by six months to June 30, 2014 to ensure that all activities are delivered but to also ensure
                         continuity between the current project and the new project which has been negotiated and will be go to the World Bank Board by the end of the month. Congo’s health outcomes are
                         slightly better than the SSA average and are at comparable levels as Low Income country (LIC) average. The 2011 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and project's evaluation
                         reports show positive progress in health outcomes. For example, Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) coverage has gone from essentially 0 to 67%; the under-five mortality rate fell from

                         117 to 68 per 1000 live-births and the maternal mortality rate is now estimated at 426 per 100.000 live birth, well below the 781 per 100 000 live-births in 2005 DHS. In terms of
                         percentage of children fully immunized, we note a progress from 65% at the start of the project to 86.7% to date.

                         The project has delivered most of its activities. The DHS has been validated by the Government and disseminated in October 2013. The Performance-Based Financing (PBF) pilot
                         is well underway in the 76 health facilities in 3 Department and is showing positive operational results in terms of utilization rate, quality of care, and quality of management and
                         supervision. These three indicators are showing an increase between the control and the treatment group as independently verified by the third party monitoring agent EPOS/
                         Brandeis. Such positive results are confirming that such approach when well designed and implemented can affect how health services are delivered. Both EPOS and the Catholic
                         Organization for Development Cooperation (CORDAID) have been devoting the technical assistance and management needed to ensure to support the implementation of this
                         initiative. The project has initiated a series of surveys which are in their first draft and ready to be reviewed these include a census of health staff and data, the first data collection of
                         Health facilities is now available; data which didn't exist for the past 20 years. The large UNFPA designed survey on obstetrical and neonatal care has been finalized and a first draft
                         made available in October 2013. The National Health Account for 2009-2009 has been completed and endorsed by the Ministry of Health. Dissemination is planned for January 2014.
                         A study of the health needs of the autochtones has been done and validated which was the basis for the development of the Indigenous People Planning Framework which enables
                         the new project to better target its activities to the indigenous people.
