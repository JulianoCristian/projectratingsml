risk to development. Both the Bank and\n            the Borrower received moderately satisfactory ratings for\n            their performances. Component 1 was found to be too\n            ambitious with little design built in. Thus, the objective\n            of the component was changed from \u0091Strengthening leadership\n            capacities of Ministry of Health, Social Services and Family\n            Welfare (MSASF) in managing a functioning and decentralized\n            health system\u0092 to \u0091Access to a package of high priority\n            health services\u0092 aimed at addressing the three health\n            problems that account for the largest share of the burden of\n            disease in the Congo: malaria, maternal and child mortality,\n            and interrupting the transmission of mother to child of the\n            HIV virus. Component 3 would become Component 2 to provide\n            support to new Component 1 and include rehabilitating and\n            equipping of primary health care covered by performance\n            based financing, and safe disposal of biomedical waste in\n            these facilities. Activities under Component 4 were narrowed\n            and put under the new Component 1 and delivered through a\n            performance based financing pilot. Five lessons were learned\n            from this project and are as follows: (1) A preliminary\n            political economy assessment may help identify appropriate\n            institutional frameworks for project coordination. (2) For\n            large-scale, complex projects a dedicated team of\n            professionals must be created for effective implementation.\n            (3) Streamline resources to the beneficiaries. In situations\n            where leadership and coordination remain weak at the central\n            level, efficient and effective interventions that streamline\n            resources to the decentralized level where services are\n            provided to the target population should be introduced. (4)\n            Reliance on significant counterpart and development partner\n            financing can impede achieving project results. (5)\n            Reinforce Monitoring and Evaluation systems through a\n            two-pronged approach can have significant effect."}, "docdt": "2014-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
