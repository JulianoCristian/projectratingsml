                         Implementation is well underway since the restructuring in March 2012 and disbursements are progressing, from 47% in November 2011 to 86% to date. Congo’s health outcomes
                         are slightly better than the SSA average and are at comparable levels as Low Income country (LIC) average. The 2011 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and project's
                         evaluation reports show positive progress in health outcomes. For example, Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) coverage has gone from essentially 0 to 67%; the under-five mortality
                         rate fell from 117 to 68 per 1000 live-births and the maternal mortality rate is now estimated at 426 per 100.000 live birth, well below the 781 per 100 000 live-births in 2005 DHS. In

                         terms of percentage of children fully immunized, we note a progress from 65% at the start of the project to 86.7% to date.

                         Since the project restructuring, the Bank team has worked closely with the project team to ensure that all activities were implemented in a timely manner. Despite some initial delays
                         as noted in the previous report, to date the project has delivered on most of its activities. The DHS has been published and made available to the government. A dissemination
                         workshop is expected to take place in the Summer of 2013. The Performance-Based Financing (PBF) pilot is well underway in the 76 health facilities in 3 Department and is showing
                         preliminary positive results in terms of utilization rate, quality of care, and quality of management and supervision. These three indicators are showing an increase between the
                         control and the treatment group as independently verified by the third party monitoring agent EPOS/Brandeis. Such initial positive results are confirming that such approach when well
                         designed and implemented can affect how health services are delivered. Both EPOS and the Catholic Organization for Development Cooperation (CORDAID) have been devoting
                         the technical assistance and management needed to ensure to support the implementation of this initiative. The project has initiated a series of surveys which are in their first draft
                         and ready to be reviewed these include a census of health staff and data, a survey on autochthone health needs, the first data collection of Health facilities is now available; data
                         which didn't exist for the past 20 years. The large UNFPA designed survey on obstetrical and neonatal care is underway, and an initial report will be made available end of July 2013.
                         The National Health Account for 2009-2009 has been completed and endorsed by the Ministry of Health. Dissemination will take place in August 2013. The impact evaluation of the
                         bed net distribution has been done and a draft report is available since May 28, 2013. In terms of health facilities rehabilitation of the 31 facilities, 26 have been completely done and
                         the remaining 5 will be completed by end of June 2013.
