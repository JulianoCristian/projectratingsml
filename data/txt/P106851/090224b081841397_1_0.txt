                         The June 2011 project midterm review provided an opportunity to carry out a candid assessment of the implementation status and to agree upon a set of benchmarks to be met and
                         on a series of activities to be implemented within the coming months the majority of which have been accomplished. Project implementation has progressed and disbursement is now
                         at 77.89% from 15% in March 2011 and 6% in November 2010. Thus the project has essentially disbursed almost half of the funds in one year. Disbursement has been on high
                         impact activities such as procurement and distribution of bed nets, the provision of medical equipment for health centers and the support to the ongoing DHS. It is expected to

                         continue progressing during the next 3 months as some new important activities such as the PBF pilot are being launched. Key project inputs, such as Long Lasting Insecticide-
                         treated bed nets had suffered initial delays due to poor planning -and lack of experience in mass distribution, but have now been completed in 6 departments. The contract with
                         MACRO International to carry out a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) has been signed and data collection has been completed with a final preliminary report expected by
                         March, 2013. The hiring of a health services purchasing agent, of a monitoring agency and of a training agent to implement a large Performance-Based Financing (PBF) pilot has
                         been completed with contracts signed. The project has also completed a census of health staff and data are being analyzed. A large UNFPA designed survey on obstetrical and
                         neonatal care is also planned but implementation has been delayed because of last minute contract modifications required by UNFPA. Data collection is expected in January 2013.
                         The project continues to receive full support of the Cabinet. In addition the Ministry is currently revising its National Health Plan ( 2011-2014) and has begun collecting data to
                         complete a health facilities.

                         Based on the progress made over the last year the accelerating rate of progress and the achievement of most of the goals agreed during the MTR, the project ratings were upgraded;
                         (ii) the project was extended; and (iii) the project was restructured based on the lessons learned and RBF’s contracts were extended. The project was restructured on March 2nd,
                         2012. The following components or sub-components from the original project have been dropped: I) component 1 (Strengthening of Leadership Capacities for Decentralized Health
                         Sector Management), (a) the project helped the client to get an organizational framework for the health sector and strengthening of MSASF’s managerial capabilities by hiring
                         consultants and training; (b) create human resources management and finances resources management and (c) the M&E is in the new component 3 in the restructuring project; II)
                         component 2 (Improvement of Effective Health Sector Human Resources Management) was dropped because it is financed by the AFD (French Development Agency) conforming to
                         the Memorandum of understanding signed with the MoH; III) from component 4 the subcomponent 4.2, 4.3 ( Empower communities in their roles as co-managers of health services)
                         and 4.4 (promotes equitable access to quality health services for all) were dropped. There are 3 new components: (A) Component 1: Access to a package of high priority health
                         services, (B) component 2: Support to provision of priority health services, (C) and component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management.

                         Since the restructuring date, the team continues to monitor closely the project: 31 health facilities should be completed at February 2013, but equipment are delayed due to some
                         difficulties from firm awarded the contract, (ii) the data collection of Health facilities should be available since 20 years in February 2013 (health facilities’ staff trained, materials
                         purchased and high level staff supervision is ongoing etc.). The assessment of the utilization of bed nets in two phases (first at 6 months and then at 12 months after distribution of
                         the bed nets which took place in November 2011) will be carried out by a team of graduate students of the Université Marian Ngouabi at Brazzaville supervised by their instructors.
                         But these surveys are delayed due some University's capacities building. The team is discussing with WHO to sort out the problem.
