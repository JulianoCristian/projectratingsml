                         Implementation support missions for PDSS I, in conjunction with project preparation missions for PDSS II, were conducted in October 2013 and February 2014. For activities related
                         to PDSS I, the mission of February 2014 aimed at helping the Ministry of Health to prepare for the closing of the project. The mission had the opportunity to review the remaining
                         activities to be implemented before the closing date (June 30, 2014) and to launch the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report produced by the Bank and the project
                         evaluation report produced by the Government. A mission dedicated to completing these two reports will be held in June 2014 and will most likely include a workshop at the national

                         level to discuss the outcomes of the project and also learn how the beneficiaries benefited from the project over the lifetime of the project.

                         In terms of the indicators, while progress has been made on most of them, except for the indicator pertaining to Pregnant women receiving ART, which sees a decrease in results.
                         This is a new indicator which was introduced at restructuring as part of the services to be purchased under the PBF. However, when the health center assessment was conducted in
                         the 3 departments where PBF was introduced, the team found out that not all the health centers contracted through PBF were in a position to offer these services, hence low results.

                         During October 2013 mission, the Bank noted the continued good management and implementation of the project. Despite the persistent financing gap (due to the fluctuation
                         between the SDR and the Dollar) which the Government has committed to cover but hasn't yet done so, the project has completed most its activities as described above. The
                         procurement plans have also nearly been executed; they have been updated and provided to the Bank on the agreed date. The Financial management of the project was deemed
                         satisfactory and the team has done a commendable job in following the Bank procedures throughout the past 6 months. The Government and the Bank finalized the preparation of
                         the new project which was negotiated in Washington in November 2013 and went to the Board on December 20, 2014. Collaboration has been laudable and the Government has
                         embraced PBF as a national policy to achieve its MDG targets. The PDSS I project was extended to June 30, 2014 to ensure continuity of the health services for the population until
                         the new project begins implementation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation

                         Under the original project structure there were 11 PDO indicators. For almost all information was not collected due to weaknesses in the monitoring system and availability of data,
                         and ability to measure the indicators.

                         After restricting, the number of PDOs was reduced to three two out of three targets were met:
                         PDO 1 (% children under five years of age who slept under an ITN the previous night): Against a target of 60%, the project achieved 80.9% as of June 2013.
                         PDO 2 (Health facilities renovated and equipped (number): 22 vs. 32 target
                         PDO 3 (Long lasting insecticide-treated malaria nets distributed (number): 700,000 vs. 400,000 target

                         Several of the original (pre-restructuring) Intermediate Outcome Indicators’ targets were achieved:
                         1.       Survey use of bed nets - 2 surveys in 6 departments: 2 surveys completed in 2013

                         6.       Develop a national strategy for operational research and carry out 3 research studies: Not achieved

                         All of the current (post-restructuring) Intermediate Outcome Indicators’ targets are being met:
                         1.        Number of outpatient consultations for children under five years of age): Against a target of 0.2 visits per capita per year, the project achieved 0.625 as of December 31,
                         2012.
                         2.        % Children fully immunized for Penta3 (DTP, Hep. B, Hemovirus): Against a target of 70%, the project achieved 82% of October 2013.
                         3.        Children receiving a dose of vitamin A (%)): Against a target of 70%, the project achieved 78% as of October 2012.
                         4.        Percent births attended by skilled health personnel): 93.6% in 2012 (DHS) against a target of 90%.
                         5.        Number of persons tested of HIV: Against a target of 10,700, the project has achieved 35,556.
                         6.        Pregnant women receiving ART: Against a target of 1,699, the project has achieved 166.

                         DISBURSEMENTS: Disbursement is at 96.2%, it is expected that the project will disburse 100% of the grant as well as deliver on its targets by the closing date.

                         FINAL REPORTING: The lessons learned from the operation will be further explored and developed in the ICR. A mission to the Republic of Congo to conduct activities related to the
                         preparation of the ICR (stakeholder workshops, data collection and analysis, etc.) will be conducted from June 20-July 5, 2014. The Government has already hired a consultant to
                         conduct the Government evaluation of the project.
