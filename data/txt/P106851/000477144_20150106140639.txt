I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country Context. At the time of project preparation, the Republic of Congo
(Congo) was recovering from a decade of civil war that left the majority of the citizens
destitute and the country’s infrastructure in shambles. Congo’s social indicators were rather
poor compared to countries with comparable income. Although the economic situation in
the country had recently improved and Congo was recently classified as a lower-middle-
income country, 50 percent of the population still lived in poverty, and the country
remained IDA (International Development Agency) eligible.
2.      Sectoral Context. Congo’s population of 3.9 million was growing at an annual rate
of 2.8 percent, and the estimated total fertility rate (TFR) of 6.3 was one of the highest in
Sub-Saharan Africa. The average life expectancy was only 49 years with no significant
increases for both sexes since 1984. Sixty to ninety percent of the morbidity in Congo was
due to infectious diseases and maternal and child illnesses. In 2006, 55 percent of outpatient
consultations in public hospitals in Congo were due to malaria alone. The infant mortality
rate of 75 deaths per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality ratio 781 deaths per 100,000
live births were elevated for a country with significant resources. The HIV/AIDS
prevalence rate of around 4.3 percent had remained stagnant for some years, although the
tuberculosis (TB) incidence was rising over time.
3.      The weaknesses in Congo’s health system and the poor outcomes were adequately
diagnosed in the Plan National de Développement Sanitaire (PNDS - National Health
Strategy) that was prepared with support from technical agencies, as well as local and
external partners and approved in 2007. The PNDS - while underlining the continued
dominance of communicable diseases in Congo and the resurgence of malaria, TB and
cholera as endemic problems – also highlighted the following key problems: (i) high levels
of malnutrition; (ii) gaps in leadership and organization of the sector at all levels in addition
to absence of accountability; (iii) inappropriate management of human resources; (iv) poor
quality of services (including recurrent stock outs of drugs and supplies); (v) poor
infrastructure and lack of basic maintenance; (vi) weak monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
with no feedback loops; and (vii) very weak regional and district health systems without
community participation.
4.      Paradoxically, the 2005 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) found that the use
of health services in Congo was relatively high. For example, the proportion of women
delivering in the presence of skilled birth attendants was over 80 percent, indicating that
the high maternal mortality could be indicative of poor quality of services. The skewed
distribution of facilities was another important factor contributing to poor health outcomes
in Congo, with over half of the health facilities being in the two major urban areas
(Brazzaville and Pointe Noire). The civil war destroyed Congo’s fragile health
infrastructure and public health services and recovery had been slow.
5.     Consequently, the government, in collaboration with national stakeholders and its
external partners, embarked on the preparation of a new comprehensive PNDS for the
2007-2011 period. Apart from IDA, other external donors had committed to support the


                                               1
sector during the duration of the PNDS included the European Union (EU), AFD (Agence
Française de Développement (French Development Agency) and the United Nations (UN)
agencies. It focused on the need to improve the health status of the population in general
and that of women, children and other vulnerable/marginalized groups in particular. The
plan sought to strengthen primary health care through the district health system and
community approach (Bamako initiative). The PNDS recommended a revision in approach,
focusing on strengthening the performance of the health systems at all levels and
developing integrated health programs to deliver a well-defined package of essential health
services (paquet de services essentiels - PSE). This would be done within the decentralized
approach already adopted for the public sector and by creating an enabling environment
for private sector participation. This would require revision of the institutional framework
in order to enhance communication and accountability at the central level and boost
stewardship capacity for policy formulation, planning, coordination and support of the
regional and district health management teams.
6.      Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The
Government of Congo had initiated several activities that were indicative of a strong
commitment to reforms. They included: a) satisfactory implementation of the Transitional
Support Strategy (TSS, 2004-2006) comprising the rehabilitation of basic small
infrastructure, primary education and combating HIV/AIDS; b) elaboration of the Interim
Strategy Note (ISN, 2007) that had two major themes: improving governance and
strengthening access to service delivery for the poor. The World Bank supported the
Republic of Congo through the CPS, which was approved in May 2009. The 2009 CPS,
aligned with the full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approved by the Congolese
Government in April 2008 envisioned a transition from projects to a more programmatic
approach by strengthening Congo’s fiduciary capacities and institutional arrangements for
service delivery.
7.      Recognizing the leading role the World Bank had in the health sector given its
considerable experience in Africa, the Government of Congo sought IDA’s leadership in
stimulating and coordinating dialogue between authorities and stakeholders on health
sector reforms. The Bank was also a key advisor in the preparation of the PRSP and an
advocate.

of the health system in order to effectively combat the major communicable diseases and
improve access to quality services for women, children and other vulnerable groups.
Within the comprehensive sector development program of the PNDS, the IDA supported
project would focus primarily on strengthening sector stewardship, fiduciary systems and
monitoring and evaluation (Component 1); human resources (Component 2); infrastructure
assessment, mapping and comprehensive rehabilitation plan, including limited
construction (Component 3), and the delivery of a package of essential services, with
emphasis on Malaria, HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health (MCH), pharmaceuticals
management, community participation/indigenous peoples and equity (Component 4).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
9.      There was no revision to the PDO. The 2012 restructuring introduced substantial
revisions to the Results Framework (RF) and key project indicators. Prior to restructuring,
the project had a total of 37 indicators. At the time of the 2011 Mid-Term Review (MTR),
it was highlighted that: many of the indicators were difficult to measure; the RF was
burdensome and unrealistic to maintain given the weaknesses of the M&E and health
management information system in Congo. For example, during the MTR, 24 of the
intermediate outcome indicators had no data available at all. As such, at restructuring, the
RF was substantially simplified, reducing the overall number of indicators, dropping the
indicators that were challenging to measure, and introducing indicators better linked to the
PDO and which would be able to be adequately measured through the PBF pilot and other
newly introduced activities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
10.    The main beneficiaries of the project were women, children and other vulnerable
groups such as the Autochthone people in Congo.
11.     Other beneficiaries included: (i) the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP),
which would benefit from support in collecting and analyzing data, developing health
reforms (with a focus on decentralization), strengthening management of human resources
for health, and defining a package of essential health services; and (ii) public and private
health facilities, which would benefit from rehabilitation and equipment upgrades.

1.5 Original Components
12.    Component 1: Strengthening leadership capacities in managing a functioning
and decentralized health system (US$10.2 million: US$8.87 million IDA, US$1.33
million counterpart funding). This component would strengthen management and
leadership capacities at all levels within the government’s decentralization program. The
process will involve strengthening capacities in planning and managing sector operations,
working within a framework of partnership and stakeholder coordination under the
following three sub-components.
13.    Sub-component 1.1: Capacity building for leadership and effective management of
a decentralized health system. Situation analyses would be done and the recommendations
would be used to inform appropriate institutional reforms in the sector through creation of
a new organogram. Specific attention was to be placed on capacity building for planning
and management of the sector at all levels as well as strengthening the coordination of all
stakeholders.
14.     Sub-component 1.2: Strengthening fiduciary systems. A thorough assessment of the
current financial and procurement systems identifying gaps was to be undertaken.
Additional analytical works, including National Health Accounts, were to lay grounds for
a Mid-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The project would use the information to
strengthen operational capacities for transparent financial management (FM) and
procurement. Systems would be put in place to document all resources at all levels for
equitable, efficient and a sustainable allocation of resources. Both internal and external


                                             3
audit functions would be developed. In addition, studies would be conducted to identify an
appropriate health sector financing system and policy for the Congo. Ministry procurement
capabilities at the central, regional and district levels would also be strengthened.
15.     Sub-component 1.3: Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation. Through this sub-
component, a M&E system strategy and plan for the sector was to be developed and
implemented to improve the availability and use of needed information by actors at
multiple levels of the system. An operational plan to refine and support the scale-up of a
national health management information system was to be developed and implemented.
Epidemiologic surveillance would be strengthened, for epidemic-prone diseases and for
supporting sentinel sites activities for tracking illnesses, insecticide-resistance, treatment
efficacy and pharmaceutical co-vigilance, among others. Appropriate planning for periodic
household and facility-based surveys would be ensured, and a health system operational
research plan developed and implemented. Finally, support would be provided for periodic
updates of service delivery maps.
16.    Component 2: Institution of an efficient and effective system for managing
health sector human resources (US$0.80 million: US$0.69 million IDA, US$0.11
million counterpart funding). A baseline human resources for health (HRH) database
would be used to establish a separate HRH Directorate in the central MOHP with specific
human resource management functions and the technical capacity to create position
descriptions and build a repository of technical fields and professions employed throughout
the health sector. The Directorate was to organize a multi-sector consultative framework
for working with ministries of education which are responsible for training medical and
paramedical staff to serve in the MOHP. Under this component, incentives were to be
created to motivate staff in all areas. The project aimed to design and set up a medium-
term development plan for HRH.
17.     Component 3: Rehabilitation and equipment of health facilities (US$2.30
million: US$2.00 million IDA, US$0.30 million counterpart funding). IDA would support
the mapping and priority and norms/standards-setting exercise and assist the government
in ensuring rational expenditure of their resources through phased rehabilitation of facilities,
with special attention to the primary care level.
18.    Sub-component 3.1: Infrastructure rehabilitation, maintenance and construction.
Based on the health infrastructure inventory report, the project was to support the adoption
of a rational comprehensive infrastructure rehabilitation plan and establishment of a
standardized regular maintenance calendar for buildings and equipment.
19.     Sub-component 3.2: Equipment standardization and maintenance. A full
evaluation of the equipment situation in Congo was to be undertaken with IDA support in
order to establish national equipment standards and norms and rational phased procurement
plans.
20.     Component 4: Improvement of access to a package of quality essential health
services (PSE) (US$23.90 million: US$20.80 million IDA, US$3.10 million counterpart
funding). This component, whose objective was to strengthen the organization and delivery
of essential health services in the country, was comprised of four sub-components.
21.    Sub-component 4.1: Define and provide a Package of Essential Services (PSE).



                                               4
  The PSE had already been defined with a clear content of services for children (Integrated
  Management of Childhood Illnesses - IMCI), mothers, adolescents to combat major
  communicable and non-communicable diseases. Maternal and child health outcomes and
  malaria were to receive special attention. IDA funds would be used to support the
  elaboration of norms, treatment protocols and service organization and training of staff at
  all levels of the health system.
  22.     Sub-component 4.2: Strengthen the procurement and efficient management of
  essential medicines and medical supplies. Operational capacity of the central medical store
  (Congolaise de Médicaments Esssentiels et Génériques - COMEG) was to be strengthened
  in order to undertake the expanded role of procurement of all pharmaceuticals and supplies
  according to the financing modalities in the agreement already signed between the Bank,
  EU and the Government of Congo. The Directorate of Pharmacies, Laboratories and
  Medicines (DPHLM) was also to be strengthened and new structures created to collaborate
  with the COMEG in monitoring pharmaceuticals supplies and stocks management. Quality
  control procedures would be established under this sub-component and qualified staff at
  the regional health directorates (Direction Départementale de la Santé - DDS) will be
  trained to enforce them.
  23.    Sub-component 4.3: Empower communities. This sub-component aimed to
  empower communities in their roles as co-managers of health services. It would entail
  building of professional capacity within the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Family
  Welfare (Ministère de la Santé, des Affaires Sociales et de la Famille – MSASF, which
  was later renamed Ministry of Health and Population - MOHP) and decentralized levels to
  coordinate government-community partnerships and strengthen community participation
  in the management and delivery of health services and enhancing effective synergy
  between PSE and other determinants of health (water, environmental sanitation, vector
  management).
  24.     Sub-component 4.4: Promote equitable access to quality health services for all.
  Activities were to include an analysis of constraints to accessing services among the most
  vulnerable and poor segments of the population, and the establishment of solidarity
  measures to support basic needs of the poor.

million). This component aimed to address the three health problems that account for the
largest share of the burden of disease in the Congo: malaria, maternal and child mortality,
and interrupting the transmission of mother to child of the HIV virus. It also included a
Performance-Based Financing (PBF) pilot. The option to include a PBF pilot in the
restructured project was chosen as an innovative strategy to improve health service delivery
in targeted areas of the country. The rationale for selecting departments for the pilot (Pool,
Plateau and Nairi) was based on the poor health outcomes of the populations in these areas,
the poor quality of health services at facilities, geographical accessibility of the population
and health facilities, and the financial envelope available for the pilot.
27.    Malaria control sub-component (US$25,000): The project was to finance
prevention activities, mainly Long-Lasting Insecticide-Treated Bed Nets (LLITNs) and
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).
28.    Performance-Based Financing sub-component (US$3 million). The project was
expected to implement a PBF pilot in three departments (Plateaux, Niari, Pool) over a two-
year period. The PBF pilot would involve the provision of a package of essential health
services by contracted health facilities, who would receive performance bonuses based on
the quantity and quality of verified health services.
29.     Component 2: Support to provision of priority health services (US$5.045
million). This component aimed to provide the tools enabling the effective delivery of the
high impact health services defined in Component 1 through the renovation and equipment
of physical facilities, retraining of health workers and the implementation of the biomedical
waste management plan in the health centers rehabilitated under the project covered by the
PBF zones. Component 2 was also to support the finalization of the analysis of the data
collected under the human resources management component from the previous
component 2, which included the health workforce census as well as the health facilities
master plan.
30.     Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management
(US$3.230 million). Component 3 was a new component to strengthen the Government’s
ability to track performance of its health sector, make adjustments, when needed, and
determine whether activities undertaken were resulting in the anticipated health benefits.
It also was intended to continue the technical assistance to the MOHP in implementing the
project through the financing of a full-time project coordination unit. This component also
included an assessment of the utilization of bed nets and a study to assess the health-seeking
behavior and health needs of the indigenous people (Autochthone).

1.7 Other significant changes

31.      The implementation arrangements were changed through a shift from ministerial
management of the project to the creation of a dedicated project coordination unit. Prior to
the creation of the project coordination unit, the Minister of Health and Population was the
official coordinator of the project and was expected to manage the day to day activities of
the project. In reality, the Minister could not fully assume the roles and responsibilities of
a full-time project coordinator, and as such, the day-to-day activities were not effectively
managed, thus leading to delays in activity implementation, disbursement etc. The
intention of creating a full-time coordination unit was to improve efficiency and


                                              7
effectiveness of project implementation. As such, qualified staff was hired, including M&E
experts, fiduciary and procurement specialists, and public health specialists. The project
coordination unit was attached to the Cabinet of the MOHP.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
32.      Project preparation. The project identification mission was conducted in
September 2007 and pre-appraisal mission in December 2007. During the Decision
Meeting (March 17, 2008) the team was authorized to appraise, although several
recommendations were noteworthy. First, given the status of the health sector it was felt
that a strategic comprehensive approach was most appropriate. The project support would
be largely for institutional reforms and capacity building (Component 1) and service
delivery with special attention to malaria, maternal and child health and community-level
actions. Second, the activities financed under Component 2 (human resources) were to
support planned activities to reinforce human resources for health that were to be financed
by the government and AFD, such as the preparation of the human resources for health
strategy and support the Human Resources (HR) Directorate. Lastly, IDA support to
infrastructure would be limited to facility mapping and prioritization of very limited
rehabilitation in exceptional circumstances. The project appraisal mission was conducted
from March 18-29, 2008 immediately after the Decision meeting.
33.     The project was prepared in a timely manner and the PAD contained
comprehensive and high quality background analysis on the projects that the health sector
faced and systemic weaknesses that led to poor health service delivery outcomes. Through
the four project components included in the PAD, the project was designed to address both
systemic organizational challenges at the central level, as well as the need to increase
decentralized decision-making for improved organization of health care at the periphery
level.
34.     On the other hand, the risk assessment may not have underlined enough gaps in
leadership and organizational capacity that would later contribute to the limited progress
achieved during the first phase of the project. While the institutional arrangements called
for management of the national project by key staff within the Government, many of these
key staff were rotated and changed during the first year of the project. As such, general
knowledge, ownership and commitment among key ministerial staff were inadequate, as
was their technical capacity to take on the procedural requirements of implementing a large
and complex operation. The first few ISRs (Implementation Status and Results Report) of
the project do not underline these challenges, and it was not until late 2009 that such issues
were brought to management attention. It was not until early 2010 that concrete actions
were taken to improve project performance and reorient key actions to achieve results.
35.    Quality at Entry. No Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was conducted.

2.2 Implementation
36.     The project was approved on May 29, 2008 and signed on July 18, 2008. However,
it was only effective on February 2, 2009.

employment of the international FM expert and the Financial Director and the Treasurer,

coming from the Inspection Générale des Finances to work in MSASF, and assumption of
their functions; (3) Adoption of new organizational structures for the MSASF, establishing
the new posts of Secretary General of MSASF, Director General positions, Head of
Finance, Head of Planning and Research, Head of Human Resources and Head of
Monitoring and Evaluation; and (4) Completion and adoption of the Project
Implementation Manual satisfactory to IDA.
38.     The four conditions of effectiveness were not fulfilled until January 2009, leading
to a delay in the project becoming effective from the initial target date for effectiveness of
September 30, 2008. As noted in the risk assessment during project preparation,
government ownership and strong leadership were important elements to be in place to
ensure the project’s success. While efforts were made to move forward with
implementation, a lack of stewardship from the ministry, coupled with a complex project
design and a new approach to implementation arrangements for the country, progress was
very slow during the initial project period. A replacement of key government actors that
were involved in project preparation with new and less-informed staff also contributed to
the delays.

39.     While declared effective on Feb 2, 2009, project implementation did not begin until
December 2009 (19 months after the board date). As a result, it was downgraded from
Satisfactory to Moderately Unsatisfactory in December 2009. Given the substantial delays
in implementation, the project should have been downgraded earlier than December 2009.
In February and April 2010, two additional supervision missions were carried out but
project implementation remained problematic. Overarching issues with disbursement


                                              9
(below 6 percent), implementation, and rehabilitation remained.
40.      While long effectiveness delays were common in the country, the key reasons for
the delays and roadblocks were weak government capacity for project management, and
insufficient human, material and financial resources. Regarding project management, the
issues were numerous: weak coordination; limited understanding and ownership by the
MOHP and development partners; administrative bottlenecks at the central level of the
ministry (such as the changing of key staff in the ministry, limited skills and lack of training
among administrative staff, and generally slow administrative procedures for
implementation of activities); and limited incentives for the increased workload for staff
tasked with project implementation. Regarding human, material and financial resources,
insufficiencies abounded: continuous reshuffling of key staff; no provision of counterpart
funds and only US$500,000 being provided as an advance for implementation, which may
have not been sufficient to meet effectiveness conditions and move forward with project
implementation. In addition, procurement and M&E plans were not produced on time due
to staff turnover and limited training of key personnel.
41.     The team began supporting the government by supervising the project in the field
monthly and closely monitoring progress. In July 2010, important activities were launched
such as: long lasting insecticide-treated bed nets had been procured, a contract for the DHS
survey was signed and vehicles and equipment were being procured. The Minister of
Health and Population remained the coordinator of the project but appointed a Deputy
Coordinator (Coordinateur Délégué) on February 2011. This Deputy Coordinator reported
to the minister and his functions were to coordinate and facilitate the implementation of
the project with the technical departments and to coordinate the work of the international
experts and local long term staff. The Ministry began to communicate to the staff at all
levels within the Ministry about the project to enhance ownership.

42.    At the time of the May 2011 MTR, the project faced the following issues: (i) delay
in implementation, (ii) slow disbursement, (iii) lack of data to assess progress made, (iv)
poor M&E capacity, (v) no inventory of public facilities was available in order to move
ahead with rehabilitation activities, and (vi) the package of essential services had still not
been developed.
43.      The MTR highlighted many of the growing problems with the initial design of the
project. The key problems identified included: (i) limited governance capacity for
management of the project, including buy-in and appropriation at all levels of the system;
(ii) the project included a set of complex interventions that were dependent on high-level
health system reforms (for which many had not seen much progress up to that point); and
(iii) the implementation arrangements relied on a central-level Ministry of Public Health
administration that was not accustomed to Bank operations and lacked the essential
capacities and resources for project management. In addition, several key weaknesses of
the project were highlighted: (i) inadequate staffing and lack of clarity about allocation of
responsibilities, (ii) weak capacity, insufficiently trained staff, low motivation, and lack of
authority in the coordination unit; (iii) insufficient knowledge and ownership of the project
by some MOHP Directorates and provincial management; and (iv) an unmanageable RF
with 37 indicators to measure.
44.    Options discussed with the Government at the MTR in June 2011 included
canceling part of the grant or formally restructuring the project together with a time
extension of the closing date. However, the Minister of Health and the Country Director
agreed on a series of actions that, if accomplished by October 2011 would lead the Bank
to consider a restructuring of the Project and an extension of Closing Date rather than


                                                 11
canceling the project. These actions included: (i) distributing Long-Lasting Insecticide-
Treated Bed Nets; (ii) engaging consultants to design a PBF pilot scheme; (iii) improving
the functioning of the project management unit; (iv) decentralizing project activities and
involvement of regional directors; and (v) a greater focus in the MOHP action plan on
activities directly related to mother and child health.
45.      The third option, to extend and restructure the project, was chosen, and the Bank
recommended the following actions to remedy the observed challenges: (i) continue to
support dialogue about civil service reforms and provide technical assistance if necessary;
(ii) relocate the project coordination unit to a new space and provide adequate facilities,
equipment, administrative support and budget to function and act independently; (iii)
improve communication/advocacy about sector reforms and about the project’s role to all
levels of the Ministry; (iv) have technical staff in the field for service purchasing, training
and monitoring agents before PBF pilot began; (v) distribute the bed nets by October 2011
with technical assistance provided by UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) and
others as needed; (vi) discuss a revision of the RF and indicators prior to restructuring;
and (vii) recruit two auditors by the MOHP to carry out auditing functions and ensure
adequate control of the flow of funds from the central to departmental levels. As such, the
project restructuring aimed to improve the project design by: (i) simplifying the project
design by introducing high-impact activities with clear public health objectives; (ii)
simplifying the RF and investing in the development of a strong M&E program, including
the generation of reliable data through routine administrative data (through the
Performance-Based Financing (PBF) intervention), punctual surveys, and an impact
evaluation; and (iii) introducing a clearly-defined project coordination unit that would
manage the day-to-day project activities.
46.      These actions included: (i) distribution of the Long-Lasting Insecticide-Treated
Bed Nets; (ii) engaging consultants to design the PBF pilot scheme; (iii) improving the
functioning of the project management unit; (iv) decentralization of project activities and
involvement of regional directors; and (v) a greater focus in the MOHP action plan on
activities directly related to mother and child health. Given the considerable progress that
has been made on these actions, a restructuring procedure was initiated in January 2012.
47.     By January 2012, the project implementation was progressing according to the
action plan and disbursement was at 49 percent, up from 15 percent in March 2011 and 6
percent in November 2010. The project disbursed almost half of its funds in one year.
Based on the progress made in one year, the accelerating rate of overall progress and the
achievement of most of the goals agreed upon during the MTR, the project ratings were
upgraded, the project was extended and restructured on March 2, 2012. During the
restructuring several components and sub-components were modified to simplify the
project.
48.    In addition, the expected government counterpart financing of US$300,000 per year
was never provided, leading to the cancellation of several planned activities.
49.     After restructuring, implementation progressed more smoothly with only some
minor delays in implementation. The PBF pilot began on schedule and was producing
positive improvements in health service delivery, the rehabilitation of health centers was
progressing, and investments under Component 3 were resulting in improved monitoring


                                              12
and evaluation systems for the MOHP. During the May 2013 mission, the Bank and the
counterpart agreed to a six month extension of the project closing date, leading to a new
closing date of June 30, 2014. This extension provided sufficient time to complete all
outstanding activities and allow for the PBF pilot to continue until implementation of the
new Health System Support Project II which was expected to be effective on June 30, 2014.
50.     As the disbursement profile in Section I of the Data Sheets shows, the project’s
disbursements lagged behind the PAD’s planned disbursements. In early 2012, only half
of the US$40 million IDA grant had been disbursed and committed six months prior to the
original closing date. Progress towards achieving the PDOs remained modest. While
Component 4 (increasing access to a package of priority health services) was the main
component of the project (in terms of financing envelope and), it remained the weakest
performing activity and had the lowest disbursement percentage of all four components.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
51.      The M&E system described in the PAD was comprehensive and appropriately
responded to the weaknesses of the health sector information system in Congo. The
subcomponents of the monitoring and evaluation system that was proposed included: i)
routinely reported health management information, including facility-based information on
service activities, illnesses and deaths, logistics management information related to
tracking equipment and consumables (e.g. pharmaceuticals and bed nets), among others;
ii) epidemiologic surveillance, particularly for epidemic-prone diseases and sentinel site
activities (e.g. tracking illnesses/deaths, insecticide-resistance, treatment efficacy and
pharmacovigilance); iii) periodic survey assessments, at both household and facility levels;
and iv) health systems operations research, for example, to identify “best practices.” Most
of these subcomponents were created and used during the project’s lifetime, with the HMIS
(Health Management Information System) and epidemiological surveillance systems being
reinforced and annual statistical reports being produced, various surveys being conducted
(health facility, household, DHS, maternal and child health, human resources for health,
and indigenous peoples). Achievements in developing an operational research program
were hindered by lack of project funds towards the end of the project.
52.     The 37 indicators that were originally included in the project never had data
collected for them (over 24 had no data at all by the MTR). The challenges in collecting
information and estimating values for these indicators is highlighted in the first six ISRs
and report from the 2011 Mid-Term Review and restructuring paper. Half of the PDO
indicators were dropped at restructuring. As data generation and M&E systems were
substantially strengthened at restructuring, data become more available and higher quality
(including reinforcement of the HMIS system, generation of routine PBF data, several
large-scale surveys and annual statistical reports, and an impact evaluation for the PBF
pilot).
53.    The PBF pilot included an evaluation component to contribute to the evidence on
the approach’s effectiveness in the Congolese context. To that effect, a quasi-experimental
impact evaluation (before and after with non-randomized treatment and control groups) of
the PBF pilot was designed and a small-scale household survey was planned at baseline
and endline of the pilot in order to measure changes in outcomes of interest. The survey
was carried out two years after the previous DHS with over-sampling in the PBF pilot


                                            13
districts and matched comparison districts.
54.     The M&E ratings in the Implementation Support Report (ISRs) varied over time,
from Satisfactory during project effectiveness to Moderately Satisfactory in the first year,
this was due mostly to the realization that there were far too many indicators for which data
was not available and that a system was not yet in place to collect the data. During the
December 2009 supervision mission, lack of progress on M&E was identified as an issue
to be addressed, and it was noted that M&E activities were not being implemented due to
the lack of capacity. By July 2010, the M&E rating were downgraded to Moderately
Unsatisfactory. It became clearer as the project progressed that reliable data was not
available and quality of information was a significant stumbling block to measuring results.
Data used for project monitoring and the Results Framework in the post-restructuring phase
were produced in a timely manner and of high quality as the majority of indicators were
based on PBF data and thus verified and counter-verified.
55.      M&E became an important component to tackle during the MTR and hence at
restructuring, it became obvious that the existing M&E framework needed to be
mainstreamed so as to ensure inclusions of indicators that could be monitored and
measured during the years to come. Therefore, during restructuring, a revised RF with
measureable indicators was developed. The new framework contained 16 versus 37
indicators with reliable baselines that were used to evaluate progress. Additionally, the
project recognized the need for reliable data and for capacity building in this area. During
restructuring a new component was developed that recognized the need to strengthen the
Government’s ability to track performance of its health sector, make adjustments when
needed and determine whether activities undertaken are resulting in the anticipated health
benefits. The new M&E component included support for the DHS as well as support to the
Health Management Information System, strengthening epidemiological surveillance and
initiating a new program of operational research. In the post restructuration phase, several
key results were accomplished, including the production of HMIS tools, an annual
statistical report, and thematic reports such as the 2011-2012 DHS survey, a national health
accounts report, and a report on the health needs of indigenous people.
56.     After restructuration, indicators for the revised RF were being collected, submitted
and validated on time. A full-time M&E expert was recruited for the project coordination
unit, contributing to the quality and timeliness of data management. M&E ratings remained
either MS (Moderately Satisfactory) or S (Satisfactory).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
57.     Environment. The environment category of the project at the time of appraisal was
B. The PAD identified weaknesses in the establishment and use of incinerators, the lack of
adequate plans and/or internal management procedures (technical guidelines), the
inadequacy of collection, storage and sorting of biomedical waste from household waste,
and the lack of adequate and regularly-supplied individual protection equipment as issues
to be addressed. Additionally, inadequate staff skills and behaviors in the biomedical waste
management were also identified. The restructured project included technical assistance to
implement the waste management plan at the health centers included in the PBF and those
to be upgraded under Component 2. It also included provision of personal protection
equipment, training of health staff, and distribution of information and awareness materials


                                              14
at the health centers.
58.      In the post-restructuring phase, the project conducted a diagnostic assessment of
the health status and health needs of indigenous population and developed a targeted and
realistic health plan to improve their health under Component 2. The Environmental and
Social Management Framework (ESMF) was developed during project preparation and
found acceptable. However, the national biomedical waste management plan (BWMP) for
health facilities, which was part of the ESMF, was found to be too ambitious. During
restructuring, it was decided that the project would only cover primary care facilities
covered by PBF and those being rehabilitated under the project, but that the government
had implementation responsibility for provincial and national hospitals and health centers
not covered by the Project. Regarding resettlement, the assessment conducted during
restructuring determined that the rehabilitation work on the health centers (the second
phase) would not cause resettlement of people as the buildings already exist and will not
be expanded, but will simply be upgraded and renovated within their existing footprint.
Consequently, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was not needed as a result of the
relatively minor adjustments at restructuring and the safeguards framework was not re-
disclosed.
59.     Financial Management. In the initial project design prior to restructuring, the
Direction of Financial resources, created in the context of new organizational structures of
the Ministry of Health, coordinated all fiduciary aspects (budgeting, accounting,
disbursement of funds and ensuring timely project auditing. Given the lack of training of
personnel in accounting and FM and lack of experience with accounting, disbursement and
auditing procedures for IDA-financed projects, fiduciary management was strengthened by
recruiting international experts in FM, procurement, an internal auditor, financial controller
and accountant. Prior to restructuring, ISR ratings for Financial Management varied
between S and MS, with decreasing ratings over time.
60.     In the post-restructuring phase, the project coordinating unit maintained sound FM
system throughout the implementation of the project. The project staff that was hired had
good experience in implementing IDA projects; having received several trainings on the
use of World Bank fiduciary procedures as well as project software. Unaudited Interim
Financial Reports were submitted on time, reviewed and found to be satisfactory. The
external auditors issued clean audit reports and the management letter from the external
auditors did not raise any major issues; there were no overdue audit reports and interim
financial reports from the project. After restructuration, FM ratings began with MS and
eventually improved to Satisfactory as actions agreed upon during supervision meetings
were adhered to in a timely manner with satisfaction from the FM team.
61.     The project had a FM manual which detailed out key internal control procedures
from transaction initiation, review, approval recording and reporting. The manual was
updated after the effectiveness as necessary as possible. There was a clear separation of
duties within the FM unit. One Designated Bank account was opened in a commercial bank
for the purposes of project implementation; the disbursement rate during the project closure
was 99.46 percent. There were no ineligible expenditures identified during supervision
mission and external auditors. The overall FM system was rated as satisfactory during the
final supervision missions.
62.     Procurement. Prior to restructuring, ISR ratings for Procurement varied between


                                             15
S and MS, with decreasing ratings over time. Post-restructuring, ISR ratings continued to
improve and were rated Satisfactory towards the end of the project. All procurement plans
were being executed as agreed upon and by following Bank guidelines. An in-depth review
in ISR 11 highlighted some problems but they were quickly addressed by the team.
Procurement plans were being prepared in time and submitted on time and large contracts
such as the hiring of organizations related to the PBF pilot and evaluation, surveys and
other operational activities were completed on time and without major delays or concerns.
63.     Project Management. At the beginning of the project, technical assistance
provided to implement the project has consisted of employing six international consultants
and two national consultants. The international consultant in human resources for health
had considerable trouble fulfilling his terms of reference due to (i) limited success in
integrating into the MOHP; and (ii) limited engagement from ministerial counterparts. As
a result, the consultant resigned and the post was not replaced. At the time of effectiveness
two internal auditors were assigned to carry out auditing and financial control functions.
However they resigned subsequently due to dissatisfaction with their working environment
and two consultants were recruited and assigned to the project coordination unit to replace
the auditors who left. These two national consultants were added to remediate the
weaknesses in carrying out internal auditing functions and to ensure adequate control of
the flow of funds going from central to departmental levels, i.e. an internal auditor and a
financial controller.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
64.     The PAD stated that the project would: (i) contribute to the PRSP objectives by
supporting the MOHP’s PNDS; (ii) establish planning and management capabilities at
central regional, district, and health facility levels; and (iii) reinforce health service delivery
for a package of essential maternal and child health services. Though the achievements
related to reinforcement of management capacities at the central level remained modest at
the time of project closing, most objectives, by project closing, had been achieved in a
manner that provides a basis for the current new health project to being implemented
(PDSS II).
65.    The PBF pilot in the three departments produced significant results, and has paved
the way for close-to-national scale up of PBF to improve utilization and quality of maternal
and child health to over 80 percent of the population. The new health project is primarily
financed by the Government (US$100 million counterpart financing), with the World Bank
providing US$10 million in IDA and a US$10 million Health Results Innovation Trust
Fund.
66.     The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) mission’s discussion of the post-
project prospects identified challenges going ahead. First, while enthusiasm is extremely
high at the department, district and health facility level, the lack of understanding and
ownership of the PBF approach remains, however, limited by central-level actors of the
MOHP. Second, as the new project is primarily financed by the Government, bottlenecks
in making funds available may block the timely and effective disbursement for PBF
payments.




                                                16
3. Assessment of Outcomes

67.    To facilitate the assessment of outcomes, the following discussion is linked both to
the summary of ratings in Table 7 and to the specific results of the PDO indicators and
Intermediate Outcome indicators in the Section F of the Data Sheet.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
68.      Relevance of the project objectives both before and after restructuring is rated
Substantial. The objectives of the project were in line with diagnoses of the country’s
health sector and remained relevant to the country’s national objectives as it supported the
priorities of the PND. Project preparation involved: (i) significant sectoral research to
identify the health system challenges in Congo and appropriate responses to these
challenges; and (ii) extensive participation by the Government. As subsequently adapted
to the more focused approach to improving health service delivery and efficiency in
financing through PBF, these objectives remained relevant by continuing to address both
the service delivery objective and the longer term policy development objectives
(decentralization, HRH development, referral systems, incentive mechanisms).

69.     After identification of the bottlenecks in achieving the project’s development
objectives, the 2012 restructuring aimed at introducing high-impact public health
interventions and a robust M&E system. The project also fits within the framework of the
Bank’s policies, including the 2007 Interim Strategy Note, which supported the first ever
PRSP (adopted in 2008). The PRSP aimed to: (i) improve governance and consolidating
peace and security; (ii) promote growth and macroeconomic stability; (iii) enhance access
to basic social services; (iv) improve the social environment and integration of vulnerable
groups; and (v) combat HIV/AIDS. The subsequent CPS (2010-2012, 2012-2016) also
included specific objectives linked to strengthening the delivery of basic services through
the use of Congo’s large oil revenues. One of the key lessons learned from the 2010-2012
CPS was the need to build the capacity of the public administration, including putting in
place performance-based mechanisms.
70.     Relevance of the project design and implementation both before and after
restructuring is rated as Modest. The project principles remained relevant through the
empowerment of MOHP services for the implementation of the project, and reliance on
enhanced local capacity to manage the implementation of project initiatives and participate
in the studies and evaluations. The components, focusing on improving stewardship of the
health sector and the availability and quality of essential health services, with a focus on
decentralization of decision-making, appropriately responded to the challenges that
Congo’s health sector was facing at the time of project design. In addition, the creation of
a project coordination unit after the initial challenges in implementation was an important
design adjustment to respond to the administrative weaknesses that were hindering
implementation at the project onset.
71.      However, based on the difficult early implementation experience, it was clear that
(i) the design was too complex for the context with the large number of indicators being a
sign of the complexity; (ii) there were too many small activities and those were not defined
in operational terms (e.g. “leadership strengthening”), thus the need now to focus on fewer


                                            17
high impact priorities; (iii) the RF was overly complex with unrealistic indicators that were
difficult to measure and relied on a weak information system and not enough attention was
paid to M&E; and (iv) there was too much focus on workshops, training, and process
measures that had little impact on the health system and the health status of the population.
72.     The project restructuring simplified its design and focused on high impact activities
that led to substantial improvements in overall implementation and results thanks to a
simplified RF, strengthened M&E and revised implementation arrangements deemed more
effective. The post restructuring redesign of the project greatly improved the relevance of
the project design to best support high impact services to improve health status. To that
effect, a strong focus was put in implementing a PBF pilot scheme (which was based on a
feasibility study as to whether or not PBF schemes could be introduced in Congo),
renovating and equipping health facilities and putting in place a robust framework for
monitoring progress and evaluating outcomes including relevant national surveys.
73.     Prior to restructuring, the objectives were overall in line with the existing political
orientations and technical considerations, but the weaknesses in project design noted
handicapped the translation of these orientations into effective actions. After restructuring,
the project objectives and design were more substantially aligned. Considering the
Substantial relevance of the Project Development Objectives and Modest relevance for the
project design and implementation, the overall relevance is rated as Modest.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
74.     The project’s efficacy rating is based on: (i) the project’s results as summarized in
section F of the Data Sheet; (ii) the quantitative results over the lifetime of the project for
the Objective Indicator (OI), Intermediate Outcome Indicator (IOI) as presented in Table
4, and outputs in Annex 2; and the (iii) the project’s weighted results as a proportion of
actual disbursements before and after restructuring. The following table provides an
overview of the results for the outcome and intermediate outcome targets in the data sheet
and shows that 81% of the project’s targets (13) were fully achieved, one was partly
achieved and two were not achieved:
         Table 4: Summary of the achievement of project targets, 2010-2014

75.     Given the general lack of data on indicators in the pre-restructuring phase and
significant strengthening of data generation in the post-restructuring phase as indicated in
the M&E section of the ICR, the assessment related to the achievement of PDOs will
largely focus on the indicators that were retained at restructuring and for which data is



                                              18
available until the closing of the project (8 OIs and 8 IOIs).
76.    Outcome Objective 1: Support the strengthening of the health system in
order to effectively combat the major communicable diseases.
77.     OI1: % children under five years of age who slept under an ITN the previous
night (Core indicator in PAD). The DHS surveys in 2005 and 2011-2012 showed that at
a national level the percentage of children under five years of age slept under an ITN the
previous night increased from 6% to 26.4%, although data for the 2011-2012 DHS survey
was collected during the PDSS ITN distribution campaign so does not register the complete
results of the project’s activities. The results of the 2012 bednets survey that covered six
departments in the country showed that 80.9% of households had an ITN and coverage
rates for 75.1 percent of children under 5 and 71.5 percent of pregnant women had slept
under an ITN the previous night. With a baseline value set at 6% and a project target value
of 60% coverage, achieving coverage of over 70% in the departments targeted by the mass
distribution shows that the project was effective in improving coverage for use of bednets
and in turn resulted in achievement of the outcome indicator.
78.     IOI1: Long lasting insecticide-treated malaria nets distributed (number) (Core
indicator from PAD). Over 700,000 bednets were distributed between October 2011 and
March 2012. Given that the end project target was the distribution of 440,000 bednets, the
target was largely met.
79.    IOI3: Survey use of bet nets – 2 surveys in 6 departments. Only one survey was
conducted. No baseline survey was conducted and the endline survey was completed in
2012, twelve months after the 2011 mass distribution of bednets. Thus this indicator was
only partially achieved.
80.    In the post-restructuring phase, the project, under subcomponent 1.1 (Malaria
Control) organized campaigns and distribution of long-lasting ITNs in 6 department (Pool,
Plateaux, Sangha, Cuvette, Cuvette Ouest, and Likouala. To support these distribution
campaigns, the project also organized media campaigns (radio and television) to educate
the population on the benefits of utilizing long lasting insecticide treated bednets.
81.     IOI2: Health facilities renovated and equipped (number) (Core indicator in
PAD). In the pre-restructuring phase, the two sub-components of Component 3 supported
rehabilitation, maintenance and construction of health facilities (3.1) and standardization
of maintenance and equipment (3.2). The component intended to support the adoption of a
rational comprehensive infrastructure rehabilitation plan and establishment of a
standardized regular maintenance calendar for buildings and equipment. Counterpart
funding was supposed to finance renovation of existing facilities and new construction
undertaken only in exceptional cases. The Government of Congo and other partners were
to provide the resources for setting up Maintenance workshops and to train bio-engineers
to cover every region in the country.
82.      The end project target was fully equipping and renovating 32 health facilities,
which was achieved with 0 being completed in 2010, 11 being completed in 2011 and 22
in 2012. The majority of activities were completed in the post-restructuration phase. The
PBF pilot also contributed to increasing the structural quality of health services in targeted
facilities, including the availability of equipment and investments in renovation of these



                                             19
facilities. Quality scores, based on an evaluation tool that uses over 200+ indicators to
measure the structural quality of PBF facilities every three months, increased from 51
percent to 71 percent in Plateau Department, 41 percent to 62 percent in Pool, and 54
percent to 57 percent in Niari.
83.    IOI4: Mini household health survey (mini-DHS) (New indicator introduced at
restructuring). To measure the health status and health seeking behavior of the target
populations in the three departments covered by the PBF pilot, a population-based
household survey was to be conducted prior to the PBF rollout. The survey was completed
by EPOS/Brandeis (contracted as the External Evaluation Agency for the pilot and impact
evaluation) in November 2012 and again in April-May 2014 for the endline survey of the
impact evaluation. As such, this intermediate outcome indicator was achieved.
84.     IOI5: Health facility survey (New indicator introduced at restructuring). To
measure the baseline performance and quality of care provided at health centers included
in the pilot, the project aimed to conduct one health facility survey prior to the launching
of the pilot. Two health facility baseline surveys were conducted, once in February-March
2012 by CORDAID (contracted to design and rollout the PBF pilot), and again in October-
November 2012 by EPOS/Brandeis. In addition, an endline survey was completed by
EPOS/Brandeis for the impact evaluation. As such, this intermediate outcome indicator
was achieved.
85.     IOI6: Survey on health status of indigenous population (New indicator
introduced at restructuring). In order to better understand the health needs and health
seeking behavior of indigenous populations in Congo and contribute to the development of
an Indigenous Peoples Plan Framework, the project aimed to conduct a study on the health
status of these populations. The survey was conducted in June 2013 and the report and
indigenous peoples plan were disseminated and validated in November 2013. As such, this
intermediate outcome indicator was achieved.
86.      IOI7: Payments made to PBF pilot health facilities in 3 departments (New
indicator introduced at restructuring). A key element of a well-performing PBF program
is timely payment of subsidies to contracted providers, based on verification of reported
results. As such, the projected set as an end target value that 90% of contracted health
facilities would receive their payments on time. As of September 2013, 60% of facilities
were receiving payments on time, increasing to 93% in May 2014. As such, the
intermediate outcome indicator was achieved.
87.     IOI8: Develop a national strategy for operational research and carry out 3
research studies (New indicator introduced at restructuring). The project aimed to initiate
a national research strategy and finance activities related to the design and rollout of this
strategy. This activity was not conducted due to budgetary deficits for the project as a result
of fluctuating exchange rate between US$ and SDR. Despite this, other activities related to
operational research were financed by the project, such as the national health map
assessment and other thematic studies.
88.    Outcome Objective 2: Improve access to quality services for women, children
and other vulnerable groups
89.    OI2: Number of outpatient consultations for children under five years of age



                                              20
(New indicator introduced at restructuring). Data from the national health information
system shows that approximately 194,826 under-5 consultations were conducted at a
national level for an estimated coverage of 0.309 visits per capita per year (based on an
assumption that 20% of the 4.2 million population are children under 5). HMIS data shows
that coverage increased over time, resulting in a coverage rate of 0.625 visits per capita per
year (394,061 visits) for outpatient consultations for children under 5 in 2013.
90.    Project activities that contributed to the increase in coverage for childhood
outpatient consultations include the hiring of CORDAID/Memisa and the piloting of PBF
in the departments of Pool, Plateau and Niari, the training of health cadres in PBF,
increased monitoring and enhanced supervision and coaching of health care providers
through PBF, and the increase in financial resources at the level of the health care provider
through the PBF scheme. A total of 104 health facilities were contracted in the three pilot
departments. Substantial improvements in the quantity and quality of health services were
observed in the pilot areas, as detailed in Annex 3.
91.     OI3: % Children fully immunized for Penta3 (DTP, Hep. B, Hemovirus) (Core
indicator in PAD). The objectives of the project were to increase immunization coverage
from 65 percent at baseline (both the national vaccination scheme in 2007 and the 2005
DHS survey report 65 percent coverage) to 70 percent coverage. Data from the national
vaccination scheme shows that coverage increased to 80.9 percent in 2010, 87.7 percent in
2011, 84 percent in 2012 and 84 percent in 2013. The 2011-2012 DHS survey also shows
a substantial increase albeit slightly less, with coverage at the national level at 72 percent.
92.      With an end target of 70%, both sources of data show that the project met the target
for this outcome indicator and achieved its objective. Several activities contributed to the
achievement. Several activities of the project contributed to this achievement. First,
activities related to the support of decentralizing decision-making to the department- and
district-levels of the health system provided opportunities to reinforcing logistics for the
national immunization program, while the PBF pilot supported immunization activities at
the provider and district levels by purchasing specific services related to immunization (the
number of children fully vaccinated by a health center).
93.     OI4: Children receiving a dose of vitamin A (%) (Core indicator in PAD). The
objective also aimed to increase coverage for children receiving vitamin A supplementation
to combat micronutrient deficiencies among children. For children, lack of vitamin A
causes severe visual impairment and blindness, and significantly increases the risk of
severe illness, and even death, from such common childhood infections as diarrhoeal
disease and measles. At baseline the project reported coverage for this indicator at 66
percent (2005 DHS). According to the national immunization program, coverage
increasing over time to 78.9 percent in 2010, 101.9 percent in 2011, 78 percent in 2012 and
78 percent in 2013.
94.     The project had a target of 70 percent coverage for children receiving a dose of
vitamin A. Statistics from national immunization program, whose activities include mass
campaigns for the distribution of vitamin A among children, shows that coverage remained
high throughout the duration of the project. In addition to activities financed under
Component 4 related to the development and implementation of a package of essential
health services, the PBF pilot also contributed to the increase in coverage over time with


                                              21
vitamin A being a component of the essential package of services to be provided by primary
care health centers.
95.      OI5: Percent births attended by skilled health personnel (Core indicator in PAD).
Increasing the percentage of women who deliveries are attended by a skilled health care
provider was one of the main objectives of the project. Coverage increased substantially
over the lifetime of the project. The 2005 DHS reported coverage at 86 percent (used as a
baseline value for the project), while the 2011-2012 DHS reported coverage at 93.6%. With
a target value of 90%, the project met its end target value and even surpassed it. In addition
to the rehabilitation of 32 health facilities to ensure that these facilities had high quality
equipment and material for the provision of maternal and child health services, PBF
statistics show that the number of births assisted by a professional health worker increased
substantially in the three departments covered by the pilot (Niari, Pool and Plateau). During
the first quarter of the PBF pilot (October-December 2012), 1,509 deliveries were
purchased through the scheme, increasing to 2,169 in the last quarter of 2013.
96.    OI6: Number of persons tested of HIV (Niari, Pool and Plateaux) (New indicator
introduced at restructuring). After restructuring, the project aimed to increase the number
of people tested for HIV, introducing a new indicator to measure progress in the three
departments included in the PBF pilot where subsidies were provided to facilities for the
provision of voluntary counseling and testing. At baseline for the restructuring
(2009/2010), the number of persons tested was 3,500 in Niari, 2,611 in Pool and 3,827 in
Plateau. The target values for the outcome objective were to test 3,800 in Niari, 3,000 in
Pool and 3,900 in Plateau, or 10,700 in total. The PBF pilot data reports that these targets
were achieved, with a total of 11,246 persons being tested in the three departments between
2012 and 2013.
97.     OI7: Pregnant women receiving ART (New indicator introduced at
restructuring). After restructuring, the project also aimed to increase the number of
pregnant women receiving anti-retroviral treatment in the three departments in the PBF
pilot. At baseline (2009 data) the numbers included 3 women in Niari, 6 in Pool and 11 in
Plateau. The target values for these indicators were 255, 261 and 193, respectively. During
the PBF pilot these numbers increased over time, from 17, 28 and 29 in 2011, respectively,
to 21, 6 and 35 in 2012-2013, yet the targets were far from being met.
98.     It was not until the health facility assessment survey was conducted that it was
identified that not all the health centers contracted through PBF were in a position to offer
these services. As such, the targets that were originally set were overestimated and the
expected results for this indicator were not achieved. This led to inflation in the target
values expected to be achieved by the closing of the project. Even though the target values
were not met, it is worth noting that the number of women put on ART did increase between
baseline and endline in the PBF zones. It can be hypothesized that the investments of the
project in improving health service delivery in both the three departments and general
health system strengthening activities at the national level contributed to these
improvements.
99.    OI8: Number of persons under treatment (New indicator introduced at
restructuring). Finally, the project also aimed to improve coverage of HIV+ persons under
treatment in the general population of the three departments in the PBF pilot zone. Baseline


                                             22
numbers report a total of 712 people under treatment in the three departments in 2009, and
the target value for the project was 2,216. Based on PBF data from 2012 and 2013, the
target was met and surpassed, with a total of 3,571 people put under treatment.
100. While at the time of restructuring limited progress was made towards achieving the
PDO indicators, after restructuring the project made good progress on all PDO indicators
and even surpassed the target for the majority of indicators (see Table 4 and Table 5). The
PBF pilot produced significant improvements in the utilization and quality of health
services in the targeted areas. For example, the number of outpatient consultations (verified
and purchased) increased from 16,460 in the period of October-December 2012 to 25,931
in the period of July-September 2013, and the average quality score increased from 35
percent at baseline (2012) to 56 percent by September 2013 (see Annex 3 for more
information on the results of the PBF pilot).

101. It should be noted that a few indicators did not come close to meeting their targets.
For example, the indicator pertaining to pregnant women receiving ART did not meet any
of its targets in the three PBF departments.
102. Other achievements prior to restructuring. Although not measured by any of the
OI or IOIs, the project implemented several activities that contributed to strengthening
leadership within the Ministry of Health and Population. Prior to restructuring, under
Component 1 the project: (i) facilitated the creation of functional procurement within the
MOHP; (ii) the creation of administrative, financial and accounting manual, which is still
applied today; (iii) managers at all levels of the system (central, departmental, and health
district)) were trained in FM and procurement; (iv) the creation of two directions linked to
M&E (the Direction of Organization and Evaluation and the Direction of Studies and
Planning); and (v) the elaboration and validation of a National M&E Plan.
103. Under Component 2, the Direction of Human Resource Administration was created
in 2009. An international expert was recruited to support this direction (but quit in 2011).
It was identified that the new direction itself had a lack of human resources in terms of both


                                             23
capacity and quantity, leading to limited effectiveness in its mission. The creation of special
units for HR management at the Departmental level was not achieved, nor the national
human resources for health policy. The majority of resources expected to be provided by
AFD were never provided, also contributed to the limited achievements of this objective.
104. Under Component 3, a variety of equipment was provided to facilities across the
country, including ambulances (5); general equipment provision; 20 vehicles for the central
level; 14 for the department level, and 40 motorcycles for the CSS (Circo-conscription
Socio Sanitaire - health district) level; very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) and internet
connection in all departments and central-level locations.
105. Finally under Component 4, results achieved: (i) validation of documents related to
norms, standards, guides and protocols for the provision of the essential package of
services; (ii) reorganization and strengthening of the Direction of Family Health; (iii)
strengthening of child health services through routine and national campaigns for
vaccinations; (iv) strengthening of maternal, neonatal and obstetrical care through the
provision of essential equipment and materials to facilities providing these services; (v)
strengthening of HIV/AIDS preventive and treatment care; (vi) strengthening of
management of communicable diseases through updating and diffusion of various guides
and protocols, distribution long-lasting insecticide treated bednets, extension of DOTS
(Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course coverage), (vii) revision and updating of
policies related to pharmaceutical management; and (viii) development and diffusion of
policies related to community engagement.
106. Other achievements, post-restructuring. Under Component 2, Support to
provision of priority health services, the activities related to the retention of health workers,
which were to be financed by AFD were not achieved due to the inability to mobilize the
resources committed by them. As such, only one activity, the finalization of the report on
human resources for health, was completed. The activities related to strengthening
community participation were also not implemented due to lack of financing for this
component.
107. Under Component 3, Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management, the
project also produced new HMIS tools, the 2012 annual statistical report, the production
of the national guide for integrated epidemiological surveillance, the evaluation of the
National Health Development Strategy, the development of a database for the national
health map, documents related to public-private partnerships, production of the national
health accounts report, the 2011-2012 DHS survey, and surveys related to urgent obstetric
and neonatal care. Additional key project coordination unit staff were recruited, including
a financial controller, an internal auditor, and a chief accountant.
108. Overall achievement result. Based on the project's overall results shown in the
Data Sheet, the project’s outputs presented in Annex 2, and the ICR guidelines (requiring
separate outcome ratings weighted in proportion to the share of actual credit disbursements
made in the periods before and after formal restructuring where key associated outcome
targets have been formally revised), the following table assesses the project's overall
efficacy rating is rated Modest before restructuring, Substantial after restructuring, and

109. As indicated in Table 6 and Table 7, the restructuring and extension of the project
contributed significantly to the achievement of the PDO. In addition, a number of the
project’s achievements are not captured in the results reported above, in particular the
successful piloting of PBF in three departments leading to improved coverage and quality
of health services and paving the way for a large-scale scale-up of PBF to be financed by
the new health operation (PDSS II).

3.3 Efficiency
110. Technical efficiency. Annex 9 of the PAD based its economic and financial
analysis on the proposed interventions by applying Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) by
estimating the equivalent value of the benefits and costs to the society as a result of
undertaking the project. The analysis was supported by an in-depth contextual analysis of
health financing in Congo, including budget execution at all levels of the health system and
health outcomes by socio-economic status. Based on this analysis, the project aimed to
improve the allocative and technical efficiency of health financing by supporting the
development and provision of a package of essential health services. To determine the
economic viability of implementing the project, the project team conducted a CBA, which
compared monetized benefits with costs and resulted in a positive Net Present Value (NPV)
of $11,894,241,711. The results indicated that the project would be an efficient investment
of resources, generating substantial benefits for the target population that outweighed the
resources committed to the project. More information on this is provided in Annex 3.
111. The project resources have been allocated to maximize the welfare of the
community. The project financed high impact interventions such as the distribution of
LLITNs and provision of maternal and child health services in rural areas. Information and
statistics on Congo’s health sector are more readily available now due to the production of
the annual health statistics report, several health facility survey reports, a health worker
census report, and a report on the health needs of indigenous populations in Congo.
112. Given the resources used, the project implemented the most effective interventions
by: (a) mass distribution of high-impact interventions such as LLTNs; (b) implementation
of a PBF pilot in rural and underserved areas leading to substantial increases in the quality
and utilization of maternal and child health services; and (c) strengthening the HMIS and
data availability in the country for improved health sector planning and policy


                                              25
development. LLTNs are one of the most cost-effective interventions in malaria
prevention1, and per capita budget for the Congo PBF pilot was less than US$3 per capita
per year. Given that PBF programs make payments only after verification of performance,
output-based investments in health service delivery are more likely to generate results more
efficiently than traditional input-based financing methods where payment is not contingent
on performance.
113. Performance Based Financing impact evaluation. A large-scale impact
evaluation was conducted from 2012-2014 to scientifically measure the effect of the
Performance Based Financing intervention on key outcomes of interest, such as the
coverage and quality of maternal and child health services. As the evaluation was
completed just months prior to the closing of the project and provides a high quality,
rigorous assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the project, the ICR team
concluded that it would be more relevant to include results of the impact evaluation than
to re-conduct a Cost-Benefit Analysis as was done in the PAD.
114. The evaluation was conducted in 5 departments (3 under PBF and 2 as control) and
included baseline and endline health facility and household surveys. Difference-in-
difference analysis was applied to estimate the effects of the PBF program (see Annex 3
for details).
115. The evaluation found statistically significant effects for several key indicators
related to the quality and coverage of maternal and child health services. Using household
survey data to estimate coverage, positive and significant effects were found for offering
of HIV testing and receiving of HIV test results. Positive (but not significant) effects were
found for increased utilization of certain maternal health services, such as: at least three
prenatal consultations among pregnant women; increased coverage of post-natal care
services; and use of family planning services. For child health, a positive (and significant)
impact was found for coverage of child health services.
116. Positive effects were also found for child health services: children sleeping under
long-lasting insecticide treated bednets and coverage of BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin,
tuberculosis vaccine) among children aged 12-24 months. The evaluation also found that
children in the PBF zones were less likely to visit health facilities in case of illness.
117. PBF was also found to have positive effects on perceived quality of care. In
particular, the impact evaluation showed that the perceived quality of care among patients
using health facilities (beneficiaries) substantially improved in the PBF pilot zone when
compared to the comparison zones. Statistically significant differences were found for: (i)
increased provision of drugs; (ii) improved reception attitudes by health workers; (iii)
improved hygiene of facilities; and overall quality.
118.    Using data from health facility survey, the impact evaluation found substantial


1
  A recent systematic review found the median financial cost of protecting one person for one year
was $2.20 for insecticide-treated bednets (White et al., 2011). The study found that the median
incremental cost effectiveness ratio per Disability Adjusted Life Year averted was $27 for bednets,
$143 for indoor residual spraying, and $24 for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria.



                                                26
increases in the provision of maternal and child health services such as institutional
deliveries outpatient consultations; severely ill patients being referred from primary care
to hospitals; children receiving Vitamin A supplements; and women receiving HIV testing.
119. The bonuses paid through PBF led to an increase in the quantity and quality of
selected health services in health centers and district hospitals. Each additional unit of
service delivered will lead to an improvement in the patient’s health status. The maternal
and child health services purchased through the PBF intervention are known to be cost
effective interventions and for many of them, the evaluation found an increase in utilization
and quality. For example, nutritional services for children aged 6 to 59 months have been
found to have a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER - US$/DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life
Year)) of US$41-43; a fully vaccinated child has a CER of US$296; and Integrated
Management of Childhood Illness programs have been found to have a CER of US$218
(see Annex 3 for references).
120. The evaluation also found that the financial contributions of the PBF subsidies to
health facilities relative to subsidies and inputs provided by the Ministry of Health to these
facilities was relatively small (ranging from 0.2 percent for hospitals to 13.5 percent for
health centers), but still led to substantial gains in the coverage and quality of services.
Complementary components of the PBF approach, such as coaching and training for
improved facility management and social marketing, most likely also contributed to the
significant improvements in health service delivery in PBF facilities.
121. The PBF intervention paid a total of US$1,883,259 in subsidies to health facilities
and to decentralized regulatory structures (district and department health teams) over a 16
months period, to cover a target population of 767,215. This translates into an annual per
capita investment in subsidies paid directly to health facilities of US$1.64 per capita per
year. Relative to overall government spending in the health sector, at 1.7 percent of total
GDP (Gross Domestic Product), and US$39 per capita per year – National Health Accounts
(NHA- 2009-2010), the PBF intervention can be seen as highly efficient when compared
to results obtained through traditional government investments (as measured in the control
areas of the impact evaluation).
122.   Details of the impact evaluation methodology and results are included in Annex 3.
123. Managerial efficiency. Managerially, the implementation arrangements during the
project’s initial phase, which sought to use internal government structures and methods
with the Bank’s fiduciary management procedures created leadership, coordination and
disbursement problems from the beginning. In addition, the delay in implementation
(2008), the slow start spending (2009), and the reshuffling of key ministerial staff included
in the project development phase (2009-2010) all contributed negatively to the project’s
efficiency. Finally, as can be seen in the volume of activities achieved since the
restructuring of the project and the creation of a Project coordination unit, the revised
implementation arrangements after project restructuring contributed significantly to the
rate of disbursement and number of activities and objectives achieved.
124. Management efficiency. From a management perspective, the project had mixed
results. During the pre-restructuration phase, the project dealt with systemic management
and organizational weaknesses at the central level of the health system, leading to delays
in implementation. While the Minister of Health was the project coordinator and central-


                                             27
level directors key project team members, high turnover among these posts, coupled with
a need for capacity reinforcement in project management, contributed to the limited
achievement of results prior to restructuration.
125. The introduction of the project coordination unit and hiring of key technical staff
(M&E, public health, procurement, financial management, etc.) to the unit that were
dedicated to project implementation led to a dramatic improvement in managerial
efficiency during the post-restructuration phase. This change in managerial efficiency can
be observed in the level of activity that was maintained throughout the duration of the post-
restructuration phase and the achievement of many of the projects indicator targets.
126. Based on the results of these dimensions of efficiency, the project’s efficiency is
rated at Modest before restructuring, Substantial after restructuring, and Substantial
overall.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
127. Based on considerations of the various ratings criteria and indicators and
disbursement prior to (40%) and after project restructuring (60%), Table 7 presents the
overall outcome rating for the project as Moderately Unsatisfactory prior to restructuring,
Satisfactory after restructuring, and Moderately Satisfactory overall.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
128. The project contributed to the government’s PRSP and targeted several of the
poorer departments of the country with the piloting of the PBF scheme (Pool, Niari and
Plateau). The PDOs were articulated around two groups known to be the most vulnerable:
pregnant women and children under the age of five. The majority of the Project Outcome
Indicators related to maternal and child health (PDO1, PDO2, PDO3, PDO4, PDO5) were
all surpassed, resulting in an increase in coverage for key MCH services such as outpatient
consultations for children, child immunization, vitamin A distribution, and skilled
deliveries. By introducing interventions such as the distribution of bednets and PBF where
indigenous people lived, the project contributing to improving the availability of essential
preventive and curative health services. The project also produced a detailed assessment of
indigenous peoples’ health-seeking behavior and health needs, which will assist the


                                             28
Government in designing effective interventions for improving health outcomes among
them.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
129. At the broadest level, the project achieved only limited success in advancing the
reform agenda, particularly prior to restructuring where the major focus was using central-
level institutional structures to implement reforms. In particular: (i) the project did not
achieve the ambitious steps graduating toward a program approach, resulting in the creation
of a project coordination unit anchored within the MOHP (leading to greater efficacy in
attaining project goals); and (ii) the integration of project implementation into the
Ministry’s own structures or even the more limited step of transferring skills related to FM,
procurement and human resource management was not fully achieved. Efforts to broaden
the participation of technical and financial partners into the project achieved very limited
success. The project steering committee did not meet regularly, and interviews during the
ICR mission emphasized that Ministry leadership of the sector was insufficient.
130. The project achieved greater results in institutional strengthening after restructuring,
with the introduction of the PBF pilot. The PBF pilot led to substantial reforms at the
department, district and health service delivery level and paved the way for much larger
institutional reforms that will be implemented in the new operation. The PBF approach is
now fully-embedded in the MOHP’s approach to improving results in health service
delivery, supported by the substantial counterpart funding included in the new health
operation (US$100 million).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
131. While not a specific objective of the PBF pilot, the pilot experience has provided
an opportunity for the Government to engage in a strategy for public-private partnership
within the health sector. As both public and private health facilities were qualified to sign
PBF contracts, the strategy has been found to be a mechanism to strengthen
communication, coaching planning between the decentralized authorities of the Ministry
of Health (districts and departments), and improve reporting by private health facilities.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
132. As an impact evaluation of the PBF pilot was conducted and results disseminated
during the last month of project implementation during a stakeholder workshop, the results
of the evaluation, including beneficiary perceptions of the PBF pilot, is presented in Annex
3. Overall, the evaluation found that the utilization and quality of essential maternal and
child health services increased due to the PBF pilot, resulting in improved coverage of high
quality services among the beneficiary population.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
133. Several elements should contribute to reducing risks to the development outcomes;
these include strategic measures for implementing a national health strategy focusing on
results and value for money, oil revenues and available resources for the health sector, and
improve management in human resources for health and information systems. The gains


                                             29
the project accomplished in decentralizing decision making also reduce the risk to
development outcomes. However, several risks identified in the PAD still exist:
stewardship and ownership, continued administrative decentralization, and capacity for
managing large-scale and complex operations.
134. While significant progress has been made and the successes of key interventions
like the PBF pilot have led to large-scale reforms planned under the new health sector
support project, PBF remains a new and technically challenging intervention that needs
substantial implementation support over the short- to medium-term. The PBF pilot was
implemented by an international NGO (non-governmental organization) with substantial
experience in designing and implementing PBF pilots. The level of technical capacity and
ownership of the MOHP to take over this promising reform and scale it up to cover the
majority of the country (as planned in the new health operation) remains questionable. This
is particularly important given the outcomes of the project design prior to restructuring,
where a number of reform initiatives started under the project were abandoned (for example
reforms linked to improve management of human resources for health). While the
Directorate of Human Resources was created and remains functional, significant and
continuous support will be needed.
135. Financially speaking, the risk to development outcome remains modest given the
low cost per-capita of PBF (approximately US$3 per capita per year) and financial capacity
of the Government of Congo. As such, the Government has committed US$100 million
towards scaling up PBF to cover 84 percent of the population under the new Bank project.
As such there seems substantial government commitment to scaling-up PBF, as was noted
throughout the ICR interviews conducted by the ICR team. Despite limited understanding
of the technical aspects of the approach by the majority of key informants interviewed,
levels of enthusiasm were quite high for PBF. The opportunities for collaborations with
other development partners for scaling-up PBF also remains to be seen.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory
136. Preparation of the PDSS project was conducted relatively quickly and the PAD
combined an abundance of ideas and specific activities for strengthening MCH services,
backed by sound contextual analysis. The institutional frameworks were in-line with the
approach to program implementation that were being introduced in the region at that time.
Despite this, several important risks and challenges were not addressed and as such the
institutional arrangements were not well-suited to the implementation of the project’s
initiatives.
137. The four conditions of effectiveness were not fulfilled until January 2009, leading
to a delay in the project becoming effective from the initial target date for effectiveness of
September 30, 2008. It was not until the fourth ISR in late 2009 and in early 2010, when
supervision and implementation support activities were intensified, that concrete actions
were taken to address (i) capacity, commitment and motivational challenges at the central
level for implementation of the project, (ii) the overly-complex institutional reforms that


                                             30
comprised certain components of the project (Component 1, 2 and 4), and (iii) the poorly
designed Results Framework for measuring progress achievements.
138. The major consideration in rating quality at entry as unsatisfactory is that after one
year of effectiveness (which was also delayed), little progress had been made in project
implementation and severe weaknesses to the project design and implementation
arrangements were identified. A Quality Enhancement Review, which was not conducted
for the project, may have helped identify and address these issues. As such, challenges in
implementation began immediately after Board approval and was not fully addressed until
the Mid-Term Review several years later.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
139. At the beginning of the project, supervision mission were carried out on a regular
basis. Although there were blockages in moving forward with implementation, the first
four ISRs assess the project as Satisfactory for both DO and IP. Given the delays in
effectiveness and then implementation, the early ISRs could have been used as an
opportunity to inform management of challenges on the ground. These issues were not
underlined in ISRs #1-4.
140. In February and April 2010 two additional supervision missions were carried out
but project implementation remained problematic; some progress had been achieved but
the overarching issues with disbursement (below 6 percent), implementation and
rehabilitation remained. After over a year with very little progress, the Bank team and
Government felt the only way they would be able to see the project performance improve
was to increase the level of Bank supervision and technical support to the project, by
introducing an PBF pilot, investing more on M&E, strengthening the counterpart team and
formalizing their role and ultimately restructuring the project during mid-term.
141. In retrospect, the Bank team could have been more proactive in addressing the
initial problems by increasing the level of supervision and implementation support earlier
on in the project, or conduct the MTR and eventual restructuration early on. The
information provided in the first four ISRs was limited and did not point out the challenges
the project was facing. It was not until ISR #5 in December 2009 that any implementation
challenges were noted. The quality and comprehensiveness of ISRs began to improve after
this point.
142. Once the problems were identified and the action plan was put in to place, the
regular supervision missions allowed for the thorough treatment of the essential issues
(technical, legal, fiduciary) by the Task Team Leader (TTL) and Task Team members, and
the systematic review of actions taken on recommendations of the previous missions. With
a couple of exceptions, from then on the supervision mission aides-mémoires were
comprehensive, and the implementation status reports (ISR) were candid.
143. For the remainder of the project, supervision and implementation support were
characterized by flexibility and proactivity as measures were planned early in the project
to address the weaknesses in the institutional arrangements for project implementation and
the insufficient data to monitor the project’s progress. While project restructuring did occur
somewhat late into the operation after substantial time without much progress in


                                             31
implementation, the Action Plan that preceded the restructuring and subsequent
restructuring allowed the project to substantially improve performance and led to an
achievement of the majority of the project’s objectives. After restructuring, each of the
issues above was adequately addressed and the project went on to accomplish the majority
of its objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
144. Following ICR guidance indicating that, when ratings for the two dimensions are
in different ranges (Unsatisfactory for quality at entry and Moderately Satisfactory for
supervision), the rating for overall Bank performance depends on the outcome rating and
is therefore rated Moderately Satisfactory. The rating is justified as while Bank
performance for ensuring quality at entry was low and supervision during the first year
could have been improved, the Bank’s continuous technical assistance and field support
from 2010 to 2014 contributed significantly to turning around a problem project to a
successful project that paved the way for future health operations in the country.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
145. Significant ministerial changes and shortcomings in the institutional arrangements,
weakened political and technical leadership for the project within the MOHP. The team of
ministry directors that were appointed closely after project implementation began largely
came from academic institutions and had little managerial experience. After the
establishment of the new cabinet, the Minister took the lead to ensure better coordination,
with a senior staff being appointed to coordinate the project. First, while the basic policies
and directives for the sector were established in the PNDS, the daily operations to monitor
implementation of the project were ineffective due to the preliminary institutional
arrangements: (i) the role of project coordinator being filled by the Minister of Health and
Population, who was unable to manage the day-to-day aspects of project management; (ii)
a general lack of leadership and clear roles and responsibilities among the key government
stakeholders at the central level; (iii) a poorly functioning steering committee; (iv) reform
initiatives that were initiated but not completed; and (v) the lack of central-level support,
which was particularly felt at departmental and district levels. On the other hand, through
the piloting of PBF after restructuring, the project demonstrated that, by channeling a
certain level of financial resources and providing autonomy at the operational level (district
and health facility), highly satisfactory results can be obtained. The Government has
recognized this and in turn the key feature of the new health operation is the scaling-up of
PBF to close to national scale.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
146. Central-level Ministry management (pre-restructuring). Prior to the
restructuring, the implementation approach aimed to use existing MOHP structures at the
central level for coordination and execution of activities. As mentioned above, this


                                             32
approach faced challenges (lack of leadership, lack of technical skills, high staff turnover,
lacking clarity in roles and responsibilities. During the first few months of implementation
with the newly formed project coordination unit (just before restructuration), the project
coordination unit’s performance was handicapped by the initial implementation
arrangements of using central-level ministerial departments for project management. The
modification of these arrangements, the recruitment of limited (but dedicated and
competent) staff, and the enthusiasm of central and decentralized MOHP personnel for the
PBF pilot contributed to the project’s achievement of many of its expected results.
147. Project Coordination Unit (post-restructuring). In the post-restructuration phase
the project coordination unit had responsibility for the overall implementation of the
project; specific project implementation responsibilities were shared with the appropriate
Ministry services for technical matters. The introduction of a Project coordination unit and
effective project coordinator at the time of restructuring contributed significantly to the
greater achievement of results during the post-restructuration phase. In the post-
restructuration phase, the ISRs consistently rated project management, FM and
procurement as satisfactory or moderately satisfactory. Assessment of implementation
progress varied considerably, from moderately unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory
over the 2008-2011 period, to moderately satisfactory or satisfactory starting in 2012 for
the entire period of the restructured project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
148. Following ICR guidance indicating that, when ratings for the two dimensions are
in different ranges (moderately unsatisfactory for government performance and moderately
satisfactory for the implementing agency performance), the rating for overall Borrower
performance depends on the outcome rating and is therefore rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
149. A preliminary political economy assessment may help identify appropriate
institutional frameworks for project coordination. During the project preparation phase,
a more in-depth political economy assessment could have potentially identified challenges
in institutional capacity and the need to establish effective incentive frameworks for project
management by the Ministry of Health. Weak government structures cannot lead reforms
about improving governance and leadership. Relying on structures with limited capacity
and a multitude of activities and priorities led to limited implementation success and
achieving of results during the pre-restructuration phase. The high staff turnover (including
the Minister of Health and Population), lack of full-time project coordinator, and weak
management capacity (financial, procurement, HR) all contributed to the limited results
prior to restructuration.
150. For large-scale, complex projects a dedicated team of professionals must be
created for effective implementation. Having a dedicated project coordination unit can
contribute to effectively implementing planned activities, having efficient management
(financial, organizational, procurement) of project resources, and avoiding blockages
caused by high ministerial staff turnover and limited motivation from civil servants who


                                             33
wear many hats at one time. Projects should substantially invest in strengthening
government counterparts and Bank teams should ensure that sufficient implementation
support is provided at the onset of the project. In addition, when capacity is limited, it may
be more prudent to begin with a simplified project design with modest objectives, and once
capacity is strengthened, scope and complexity can be expanded.
151. Streamline resources to the beneficiaries. In situations where leadership and
coordination remain weak at the central level, efficient and effective interventions that
streamline resources to the decentralized level where services are provided to the target
population should be introduced, such as Performance Based Financing.
152. Reliance on significant counterpart and development partner financing can
impede achieving project results. The fact that co-financing from certain development
partners for specific project activities was not realized (for example AFD and HRH
activities under Component 2) led to limited progress and results achieved in certain areas.
Equally important, the expected government counterpart financing of US$300,000 per year
was never provided, leading to the cancellation of several planned activities. Future World
Bank projects should ensure that co-financing is ensured before linking essential project
components to non-Bank financing sources (for example the substantial counterpart
financing that is expected to be contributed in the new health operation.
153. Reinforce Monitoring and Evaluation systems through a two-pronged
approach. Investing in the HMIS system through both strengthening routine data creation
and management (annual statistical reports, data produced by PBF) and punctual large-
scale surveys (DHS, health worker survey, bednets survey, PBF impact evaluation surveys,
etc.) can lead to higher quality data for tracking results and general system strengthening.
Prior to restructuring, the RF was over-complex with approximately half the indicators
remaining without data for the first two years. Through a restructuration that put emphasis
on strengthening the M&E and health information systems and included an impact
evaluation of an ambitious pilot project, the project was turned around into one with a
realistic RF that relied on sound data and analysis while strengthening national systems.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies:
154. The task team and the Borrower reviewed and agreed on the results of the indicators
reported in the Data Sheet. The Borrower has prepared a comprehensive final evaluation
report in French. The Borrower’s final evaluation report is available from the Project Files.
 (b) Co-financing: The majority of resources expected to be provided by AFD for
strengthening human resources for health were never provided.
(c) Other partners and stakeholders: Not applicable

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Initial situation. Annex 9 of the PAD based its economic and financial analysis on
the proposed interventions by applying Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) by estimating the
equivalent value of the benefits and costs to the society as a result of undertaking the
project. In order to determine whether the project is worthwhile, the project team conducted
Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) by estimating the equivalent value of the benefits and costs
to the society as a result of undertaking the project. A CBA is a procedure whereby costs
and benefits of a project are identified, measured, and compared in monetary terms so as
to generate net returns to a project’s investment.
2.      To determine the economic viability of implementing the project, the project team
conducted a CBA, which compared monetized benefits with costs. Direct benefits are
considered the benefit of avoiding or delaying the health care costs associated with treating
diseases addressed in PDSS programs; and increased productivity from not being ill. To
monetize project benefits, the project team characterized the costs of health care that can
be delayed or avoided as a result of utilizing services supported by the project. The results
indicated a positive Net Present Value (NPV) of $11,894,241,711, hence the project would
generate the expected benefits.
3.      Performance Based Financing impact evaluation. A large-scale impact
evaluation was conducted from 2012-2014 to scientifically measure the effect of the
Performance Based Financing intervention on key outcomes of interest, such as the
coverage and quality of maternal and child health services. As the evaluation was
completed just months prior to the closing of the project and provides a high quality,
rigorous assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the project, the ICR team
concluded that it would be more relevant to include results of the impact evaluation than
to re-conduct a Cost-Benefit Analysis as was done in the PAD.
4.       The impact evaluation was conducted in 5 departments (Pool, Niari and Plateau
where PBF was being implemented and Bouenza and Cuvette as control departments) and
included baseline and endline health facility and household surveys. Difference-in-
difference analysis was applied to estimate the effects of the PBF program. The health
facility survey sampled 73 health facilities across the five departments and visited the same
health facilities for baseline and endline. The household survey sampled approximately
1350 households for each survey round through two-stage sampling. The same
communities were visited for baseline and endline.
5.      The evaluation found statistically significant effects for several key indicators
related to the quality and coverage of maternal and child health services. Using household
survey data to estimate coverage, positive and significant effects were found for offering
of HIV testing (difference = +10.6%, p<0.01); and receiving of HIV test results (difference
= +Positive (but not significant) effects were found for increased utilization of certain
maternal health services, such as: at least three prenatal consultations among pregnant
women (difference = +0.4%); increased coverage of post-natal care services (difference =
+7.1%); and use of family planning services (difference = +6.8%). For child health, a
positive (and significant) impact was found for coverage of child health services
(difference = +10.2%, p<0.01).



                                             41
6.       Positive effects were also found for child health services: children sleeping under
long-lasting insecticide treated bednets (difference = +3.3%, p<0.01) and coverage of BCG
among children aged 12-24 months (difference = +3.0%, p<0.001). The evaluation also
found that children in the PBF zones were less likely to visit health facilities in case of
illness (difference = -8.8%, p<0.001).
7.       PBF was also found to have positive effects on perceived quality of care. In
particular, the impact evaluation showed that the perceived quality of care among patients
using health facilities (beneficiaries) substantially improved in the PBF pilot zone when
compared to the comparison zones. Statistically significant differences were found for: (i)
increased provision of drugs (difference = +14.2%, p<0.001); (ii) improved reception
attitudes by health workers (difference = +10.8%, p<0.001); (iii) improved hygiene of
facilities (difference = +11.1%, p<0.001); and overall quality (difference = +6.4%,
p<0.05).
8.      Using data from health facility survey, the impact evaluation found substantial
increases in the provision of maternal and child health services such as institutional
deliveries (difference = +3.1 services, p<0.001) outpatient consultations (difference =
+24.7, p<0.001); severely ill patients being referred from primary care to hospitals
(difference = +5.0, p<0.001); children receiving Vitamin A supplements (difference =
+24.7, p<0.001); and women receiving HIV testing (p<0.001).
9.      The bonuses paid through PBF led to an increase in the quantity and quality of
selected health services in health centers and district hospitals. Each additional unit of
service delivered will lead to an improvement in the patient’s health status. The maternal
and child health services purchased through the PBF intervention are known to be cost
effective interventions and for many of them, the evaluation found an increase in utilization
and quality. For example, nutritional services for children aged 6 to 59 months have been
found to have a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER - US$/DALY) of US$41-43 2 ; a fully
vaccinated child has a CER of US$2963; and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness
programs have been found to have a CER of US$2184.
10.      The evaluation also found that the financial contributions of the PBF subsidies to
health facilities relative to subsidies and inputs provided by the Ministry of Health to these
facilities was relatively small (ranging from 0.2 percent for hospitals to 13.5 percent for
health centers), but still led to substantial gains in the coverage and quality of services.
Complementary components of the PBF approach, such as coaching and training for
improved facility management and social marketing, most likely also contributed to the
significant improvements in health service delivery in PBF facilities.
11.     Financial analysis. The Economic and Financial Analysis included in the PAD
noted that the direct benefits to be considered for this operation are the benefit of avoiding
or delaying the health care costs associated with treating diseases addressed in PDSS
programs, and increased productivity from not being ill. The Results Framework and
impact evaluation of the PBF intervention showed that there were significant increases in

utilization of key maternal and child health services in the targeted areas at less than $2 per
capita per year investment. The PBF intervention paid a total of US$1,883,259 in subsidies
to health facilities and decentralized regulatory structures (district and department health
teams) over a 16 month period, to cover a target population of 767,215. This translates into
an annual per capita investment in subsidies paid directly to health facilities of US$1.64
per capita per year. Relative to overall government spending in the health sector, at 1.7
percent of total GDP, and US$39 per capita per year – National Health Accounts (NHA-
2009-2010), the PBF intervention can be seen as highly efficient when compared to results
obtained through traditional government investments (as measured in the control areas of
the impact evaluation).
12.     The project conducted other efficient activities and high-impact interventions, such
as the mass distribution of insecticide-treated bednets. A recent systematic review found
the median financial cost of protecting one person for one year was $2.20 for insecticide-
treated bednets (White et al., 2011). The study found that the median incremental cost
effectiveness ratio per Disability Adjusted Life Year averted was $27 for bednets, $143 for
indoor residual spraying, and $24 for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria.
13.    Process evaluation. The impact evaluation was accompanied by a process
evaluation that capitalized on the lessons learned from the Congo PBF pilot. These lessons
can be summarized as follows (Table 2A):

14.    The process evaluation provided several recommendations for future PBF
interventions in the Republic of Congo:
   1. Strengthen health sector capacity building at all levels to ensure proper steering of
      PBF implementation by the Ministry of Health;
   2. Ensure payments are made on time and that health facilities have sufficient
      autonomy to distribute bonuses based on performance;
   3. When scaling-up, the pilot experience should contribute to adapting general PBF
      principles to the specific context of the Republic of Congo;
   4. When scaling-up from the pilot phase, PBF should be integrated into the broader
      health care financing strategy in the Republic of Congo.

Annex 8. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


1.      Held from April 30 to May 31, 2014, this final evaluation mission of PDSS was
entrusted to a mixed team of an international expert and a national expert with the objective
to proceed with (i) an analysis of the relevance and performance of the project, (ii) a review
of the results and impacts of actions taken, (iii) a summary of lessons learned in the
program components and (iv) the suggestions and recommendations at the end of the
setting work of PDSS. The methodology was based on a review of key documents,
interviews with key informants at the central level health facility visits and coordination
bodies in the departments of Brazzaville, Pool, Cuvette and Niari selected by stratification
on the basis of their demographic, epidemiological and health coverage. The evaluation
team reviewed - component by component - the degree of achievement of outcomes and
impacts of actions taken by the PDSS, firstly, during the period from April 2008 to May
2012 (the "first period or period I ") and on the other hand, the period from June 2012 to
June 2014 (the" second period or period II "). For each component, the analysis has
consistently focused on achievements against expected results and discussed the
constraints and challenges.
2.      During the first period of the project, the PDSS project experienced multiple
burdens with mixed results. The Bank's supervision mission conducted in June 2011
revealed a series of constraints, both structural and operational, to project implementation.
These included an excessive delay in the implementation of planned activities; lethargic
administrative procedures and mechanisms for planning, supervision, coordination and
management; low estimated disbursement; lack of prioritization of activities and a lack of
visible impact on access to care.
3.      The mid-term review covering the period from February 2009 to May 2012
identified two major issues, namely (i) the low capacity for stewardship of the project
(mainly due to weak leadership, low ownership actors and donors, a low level of motivation
of staff involved and a low level of government structures and institutions, ...) and (ii)
insufficient human, material and financial resources.
4.       Following the recommendations of the MTR, the Bank and Government decided to
restructure the project to refocus and redefine the priorities, retaining only high-impact
activities. To enable the project to better focus on priority areas, the number of program
components was reduced from 4 to 3 components and the Results Framework was
streamlined. The project management approach has been redesigned and experts were
grouped in a "Project Coordination Unit (PCU)".
5.      This restructuring allowed the project improve its performance and attain
significant achievements, resulting in the launch of major rehabilitation of health facilities,
the initiation of the Performance Based Financing pilot, and ultimately a substantial
improvement in achieving project objectives. Despite the difficulties, the results obtained
by the PDSS are satisfactory and constitute a major contribution to the national health
system.
6.      Overall, it appears that the PDSS has contributed significantly to: (i) strengthening
the national health system (both central and decentralized levels), (ii) strengthening MOHP


                                              53
directorates and health programs (especially those related to maternal and child health),
(iii) strengthening the Community system (to a lesser extent), and (iv) through PBF
motivating health care providers to provide quality care.
7.     Two major factors are likely to contribute to the sustainability of the project’s
achievements. First, scaling-up PBF could help improve the quality of care and address the
challenge of motivation. Second, ownership of the PDSS by the Congolese Government is
shown by their contribution of US$100 million to the new health operation.
8.      Overall, the Borrower ICR recommends: (i) strengthening oversight mechanisms
of activities and coordination of partners, (ii) improving the volume, predictability and
sustainability of financing, (iii) pursue capacity building at the decentralized level and
strengthening human resources, and (iv) improve organizational planning of the national
health map.
