                         EXTENSION OF CLOSING DATE

                     HONDURAS — BARRIO-CIUDAD PROJECT

                         CREDIT AGREEMENT 4096-HN

                                 Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Honduras, Barrio-Ciudad Project, Credit IDA-4096-HN,
   P088319 will be extended from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013.

2. The performance of the Borrower and the project implementation agency has been
   satisfactory; the Project is currently rated as satisfactory in DO and moderately
   satisfactory in IP. As of May 23, 2012, approximately US $ 10.74 million of the total
   amount of the credit (or 69.5% of the credit has been disbursed) and around
   US $0.6 million have been committed for the execution of new investments.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to benefit an additional 4,000 residents in the
   new cities targeted by the second round of investments (Puerto Cortez, Choloma,
   Choluteca, La Ceiba and Danli). Furthermore, the Project has demonstrated positive
   impacts on the prevention of crime and violence in the Project’s municipalities and it
   is closely linked to the strategic importance of the crime and violence prevention
   agenda of the government.

4. This will be the second extension of the project. A first one year extension was
   approved on April 2008, extending the closing date to June 30, 2012.
