                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The ISR and the ratings reflect the status of the last supervision mission in late November 2012. The project has considerable progress since the last mission and is on its track to
                         meet the project development objectives. The mission observed that neighborhood upgrading projects generated positives impacts in the project communities. An integrated
                         approach of infrastructure program coupled with participatory social intervention proved to be highly effective to mitigate risk associated with crime and violence and to improve the
                         quality of life in the project neighborhoods. In particular, local authorities and communities highlighted the impact of the project in improving social cohesion and preventing urban

                         noted that the project interventions had already produced multiplier effects in some municipalities. For instance, the municipalities of El Progreso and Puerto Cortes had started to
                         develop additional educational and training activities geared towards the urban youth and violence prevention based upon the methodology adopted by this project. Up to date, all the
                         sub-projects in the first-phase neighborhoods and two sub-projects in the 2nd phase have been completed; the implementation for 7 additional sub-projects in the 2nd-phase

                         neighborhoods is well under way and expected for completion by mid January, 2013 (Danli, Choloma, Villanueva, Puerto Cortes). Furthermore, works for 4 sub-projects in Danli,
                         Siguatepeque, and Choloma have been initiated. Finally, three sub-projects are still in the bidding process (Choluteca, El Progreso, and Puerto Cortes).
                         Up to date, the project has disbursed about US$ 12.1 million, equivalent to 81% of the loan amount, and all the remaining funds have been assigned: about US$ 1.2 million have
                         been committed for the implementation of sub-projects in second-phase neighborhoods, while US$ 1.6 million are assigned to 3 sub-projects that are still in the bidding process.

                         Despite the considerable implementation progress over the last year, the project still has to disburse about US$ 2.8 million until its closing date on June 30, 2012. It was therefore
                         agreed that the UCP will strengthen its supervision of ongoing investment components, in particular by hiring additional field-based supervision consultants in order to ensure the
                         successful and timely completion of all sub-projects.

                         The last supervision mission is planned for May 2013 and it will focus on lessons learned from the Project. It was agreed that the team and the UCP will jointly organize a workshop
                         with high-level participation to facilitate exchange of experiences and best practices between different municipalities as well as the municipal and national level. In addition, it was
                         agreed that the project team will provide additional technical support to the UCP for the project's impact evaluation, which is under the procurement process. The IE will serve as an
                         important analytical foundation to prepare the ICR and more importantly to share lessons and measure impact for this type of project intervention.
