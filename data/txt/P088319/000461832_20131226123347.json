Significant lessons\n            learned during the implementation of the project were: 1)\n            the need to invest in designing a simple yet enforceable\n            monitoring and evaluation framework; 2) the importance of\n            integrated delivery of physical infrastructure and social\n            interventions; 3) placing municipalities in the lead and\n            increasing their technical capacity to increase their\n            technical capacity and ensure sustainability of\n            sub-projects; and 4) the importance of active community\n            participation and strengthening of community organization\n            structures throughout the entire cycle of the project."}, "docdt": "2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
