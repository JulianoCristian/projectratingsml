                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Activities in the first phase neighborhoods are well advanced or have been finished (Villanueva, El Progreso, Danli, Comayagua, Choluteca and Santa Rosa de Copan) and the
                         preparation of second phase of neighborhoods is well underway (Danli, Choloma and Puerto Cortez). During the last Bank's supervision mission it was observed that neighborhood
                         upgrading projects had generated positive impacts. Communities and local authorities highlighted the importance of making integral interventions that went beyond physical
                         infrastructures. It also came to notice that the crime and violence prevention concepts for urban upgrading had been used for other urban interventions in some of the municipalities

                         involved in the project and that other nearby municipalities were starting to plan to make similar interventions. For instance, in El Progreso the Mayor explained how 83 public spaces
                         had been recuperated/upgraded.
