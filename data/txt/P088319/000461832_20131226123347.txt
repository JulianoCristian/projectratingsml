                                        INTRODUCTION
The Honduras Barrio Ciudad Project was the Bank’s first urban development project in
Central America in over ten years at the time of its Board approval in July 2005. The
Project became effective in March 2006 and closed in June 2013. It represents one of the
Bank’s first multi-sectoral projects that introduced an integrated approach of improving
basic urban infrastructure while also addressing crime and violence prevention in poor
and high-risk urban communities through a highly participatory and demand-driven
process. It was extended twice for a total of 24 months, mostly due to difficulties in
implementation. In particular, the political crisis in 2009 that resulted in the ousting of
President Zelaya led to a pause in Bank operations in the country for over six months.
Notwithstanding the implementation challenges and difficult political and institutional
environment, the Project reached its development outcomes and produced several
important lessons for subsequent Bank and Borrower’s projects.
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country and Sector Background. At the time of appraisal, Honduras was one of
the poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean Region (LCR) with a gross
national income per capita of US$1,013 (2003) 1. The country was experiencing one of
the highest urbanization rates in Latin America and the rapid urbanization was
characterized by the concentration of households living in poverty. In 2005, 64% of the
population lived below the national poverty line. Accompanying the rapid urbanization
was a drastic increase in the incidence of urban crime and violence (C&V), exacerbated
by the lack of basic service and infrastructure provision 2. Especially the youth and poor
people increasingly became victims of gang violence.
2.      Government Strategy. At the time of project preparation, the Government of
Honduras (GoH) was focusing its efforts on improving coverage of basic services and
infrastructure and reducing poverty and vulnerability in the fast growing urban areas,
largely resorting to decentralized provision through municipal governments. The 2001
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) prioritized three main policy areas: (i)
restoring economic dynamism through improvement of the country’s investment climate
and infrastructure, (ii) developing human capital by increasing access to public services,
and (iii) improving justice and personal security.
3.     Rationale for the Bank’s intervention. Until 2005, the Government’s approach to
urban development remained fragmented with emphasis on decentralization, local
government strengthening and sector-specific interventions in service delivery for
housing, water and sanitation, roads, and, to a much lesser extent, crime prevention.
While this approach had worked to improve the capacity of urban municipal governments
and increase access to basic services, the Government acknowledged the need to pursue a


1
 GNI per capita in 2012 was $2,070.
2
  Between 1980 and 2000, the average annual urban population growth rate was 4.17%. Homicide rates more than
doubled from 37 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005 to 86.5 in 2010.


                                                   1
more cohesive and integrated urban development strategy to meet PRSP goals and
support the development of the country’s intermediate-sized cities; provide incentives
and resources to upgrade and invest in poor urban neighborhoods; increase access to
financing for municipal governments for major capital investments and urban works; and,
mainstream C&V prevention into the broader urban development agenda.
4.       The Project addressed the Government’s priority to implement an integrated
approach to urban development. The Bank has extensive experiences supporting service
delivery and infrastructure subprojects at the local level through central government
institutions, aimed to build on an established decentralization framework and improved
capacity of urban municipal governments. Finally, no other donor had implemented
integrated urban development projects outside the primary cities of Tegucigalpa and San
Pedro Sula, which provided a strategic entry point for the Bank’s assistance in
intermediate cities with a population of more than 15,000.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve the quality of life for
the urban poor and to enable their municipal governments to continue and sustain such
improvements through capacity building and improved access to credit.
6.     The PDO’s key performance indicators were: (i) Poverty reduction in beneficiary
urban neighborhoods; (ii) Improved access to basic urban services in participating
municipalities; (iii) Improved perception of public safety and security in beneficiary
urban neighborhoods; (iv) Decreased incidence of crime and violence in beneficiary
urban neighborhoods; (v) Improved creditworthiness indicators in participating
municipalities; (vi) Increased commercial lending to municipalities in Honduras; (vii)
Improved capacity of municipalities to prepare financing proposals and secure funding
from private banks; and (viii) Improved municipal capacity for service delivery.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators
7.      A Project restructuring in 2008 revised the PDO to improve the quality of life for
the residents in selected poor urban neighborhoods of the Borrower in Eligible
Municipalities The revision of the PDO became necessary since the Project restructuring
eliminated a component supporting lending to municipalities and reallocated those funds
to scale up urban upgrading activities by including additional neighborhoods (see section
1.6 for more details).
8.      The following key indicators were established to measure expected results and
reflect the revised scope: (i) % of households with access to water in the household in
selected neighborhoods; (ii) % of households with access to sanitary sewage system in
selected neighborhoods; (iii) % of households with public lighting always working in
selected neighborhoods; (iv) % of households who feel safe in the house in selected
neighborhoods; (v) % of households satisfied with the project in selected neighborhoods.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
 9.     The Project’s primary target groups were participating municipalities and the
inhabitants of the selected neighborhoods. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did
not specify a target number of beneficiaries but embedded a set of eligibility criteria to


                                           2
select beneficiary municipalities among the country’s medium-sized municipalities with
at least 15,000 inhabitants. 3 The urban neighborhoods of qualified municipalities also had
to meet a set of eligibility criteria, including population size and density, recognized
social organization, and electricity consumption levels as a proxy for poverty. The
selected neighborhoods were characterized by a lack of access to basic services and
infrastructure. In addition, their residents were disconnected from economic opportunities
in the city centers given their peripheral location. This spatial exclusion was exaggerated
by the high C&V incidence; most of the neighborhoods were considered as too dangerous
to even be entered by non-residents. See Annex 2 for a full list of beneficiary
municipalities and neighborhoods.

1.5 Original Components
10.       The Project components according to the Loan Agreement (Schedule 2) were:
Part A - Urban Services and Infrastructure: Provision of loans to eligible municipalities to
carry out Loan Window Subprojects consisting of city-level infrastructure investments to:
(i) promote urban development and attract new investment, such as markets,
transportation terminals, slaughterhouses and extensions/improvements to water and
sanitation systems; and (ii) help equip cities with basic facilities, such as fire stations, city
center improvements and communications services.
Part B - Neighborhood Upgrading: Provision of grants to eligible municipalities to carry
out Grant Window Subprojects consisting of typical urban upgrading interventions, such
as land titling, water and sanitation connections, drainage, access roads, recreation
centers, parks, community facilities, street lighting, and risk mitigation works.
Part C - Technical Assistance: Provision of technical assistance (TA) to: (i) build the
capacity of eligible municipalities and neighborhood organizations for participatory
planning and execution of urban upgrading; (ii) improve the capacity of eligible
municipalities for commercial borrowing and debt management; and (iii) strengthen the
capacity of the General Directorate for Housing and Urban Development within
SOPTRAVI to deliver TA to municipalities, formulate policy and provide oversight and
regulation in urban development.
Part D - Urban Crime and Violence Prevention: Development of public works and
prevention strategies that enhance community security and integration, including: (i)
situational prevention, which includes measures that reduce opportunities for particular
C&V problems through spatial interventions; (ii) capacity building, training and technical
assistance in multi-sectoral C&V prevention (excluding police activities), such as
community crime mapping and diagnostics, preventing juvenile delinquency and
domestic violence, community safety and monitoring and evaluation; and (iii)
complementary investments and activities, including municipal plans for C&V
prevention and provision of grants to eligible municipalities for complementary
infrastructure and programs for community safety (excluding police activities).

3
  The eligibility criteria included the existence of a strategic municipal development plan and annual investment plans;
then, funds were to be allocated to qualified municipalities on a first come-first served basis (within a maximum limit
per grant and loan window) according to the municipality’s capacity to take on additional debt, ability to pay the cash
counterpart contribution for grants, and ability to cover recurrent costs of operation and maintenance for the subprojects.


                                                          3
Part E - Project Administration: Provision of TA, equipment, training and incremental
operational costs as necessary to operate and strengthen the implementing agencies to
enable them to effectively monitor and evaluate project implementation.

1.6 Revised Components
11.    A Project restructuring approved by the Board in May 2008 eliminated
component Part A that was designed to create a loan window for municipalities to finance
urban services, city-level infrastructure projects and other revenue generating
investments. BANHPROVI (Honduran Bank for Production and Housing), a public
second-tier bank that provides financing for productive projects and low-income housing,
was the implementing agency for the loan window. Funding was reallocated to the
neighborhood upgrading component to increase it by 2.9 million SDR to 6.1 million
SDR, which allowed for a substantial scaling up of integrated urban upgrading and
included additional neighborhoods. TA activities related to commercial lending and debt
management as well as capacity-building support to BANHPROVI were eliminated. In
addition, the Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS) became the sole implementing
agency of the entire Project.
12.     The cancelation of the municipal loan component can primarily be attributed to a
change in BANHPROVI management following the change of government in January
2006. The new BANHPROVI management demonstrated neither political commitment
nor interest in implementing the component. This manifested itself in considerable delays
in designing operational norms and policies. Hence, no disbursements were made under
the component. In addition, while experiences in Honduras of private sector municipal
lending at the time of appraisal were considered positive and legal and institutional
frameworks were deemed favorable, demand from municipalities was low due to their
weak technical and financial capacity. More importantly, a drop in interest rates for
market-based loans from 17 to 12 percent in 2007, due to improved liquidity in the
financial system, rendered the terms of the Bank supported credit line through
BANHPROVI less attractive for both financial intermediaries and municipalities. In
particular, the interest rate advantage of the subsidized loans (the final interest rate for
municipalities would have been based on an interest rate of 6.25% for 25% of the final
loan to the municipality) did not seem to have outweighed the more cumbersome
procedures and paperwork associated with these loans.

1.7 Other significant changes
13.     Extension of Closing Date. The Project closed on June 30, 2013, after two
extensions: (i) In April 2008, the closing date was extended from June 30, 2011, to June
30, 2012, to allow FHIS, which had become the sole implementing agency, sufficient
time to carry out the full project cycle for sub-projects after cancelling the municipal loan
component; (ii) In May 2012, the Project was extended for another year to June 30, 2013,
to compensate for the implementation delays caused by the pause in Bank disbursements
from June 2009 to March 2010 and to benefit an additional 4,000 residents in the new
municipalities targeted by the second round of investments .
14.     Project Restructuring December 2010. The amendment had two objectives: (i) to
include the financing of goods out of the proceeds of the Credit under the disbursement


                                            4
categories for grant window sub-projects and community safety projects, which allowed
the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to purchase public lighting in all of the
participating municipalities (a key factor for success in crime and violence prevention);
and (ii) to modify the due dates for the audit reports and FMRs, so that these reports
could be furnished to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year
(December 31). This was going to help synchronize the delivery of Bank-required reports
across all Bank-financed FHIS projects.
15.    Reallocation of Credit Proceeds. In March 2012, a reallocation of credit proceeds
was approved to increase the total amounts for the urban crime and violence prevention
component to 822,634 SDR and for the neighborhood upgrading component to 6,248,832
SDR. The reason for this reallocation was to allow for the construction of infrastructure
for C&V prevention and to enhance TA to municipalities respectively. The detailed
information on credit reallocation is provided in Annex 1.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
16.     Soundness of background analysis. During project preparation, the Project was
considered a pilot as it represented the Bank’s first urban development project in Central
America in over ten years and one of the first that combined urban upgrading with the
C&V agenda. 4 In addition to a detailed analysis of the living conditions and C&V hot
spots in the eligible municipalities and neighborhoods, the task team took into account
experiences from past projects in the region and incorporated lessons learned to develop
the Project’s intervention strategy. One of the strongest points derived from this analysis
was the social strategy designed to ensure full participation of key stakeholders
throughout preparation, design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of sub-
projects to be financed by the Project. One challenge associated with the analysis was to
adequately evaluate the feasibility of the loan window component. Although the Project
design built upon private sector municipal lending experiences in Honduras and the
presence of a favorable legal and institutional framework, the team could not anticipate
the change in BANHPROVI’s management and the related political risks, which
eventually resulted in the elimination of the component in 2008. In addition, it was
impossible at the time of the analysis to predict the political crisis of 2009, which had a
direct impact on the implementation of the Project.
17.    Assessment of the Project’s design. The Project design had initially been
appropriate to achieve the original PDO. However, unforeseen changes in BANHPROVI
management and the financial market rendered the municipal loan component unviable,
while the remaining components were implementing well (see section 1.6). The design of
those components remained appropriate for the revised PDO after restructuring in 2008.
The Project design included a clear methodology based on transparent eligibility criteria
to identify eligible municipalities and subsequently beneficiary neighborhoods. This
methodology ensured equitable access to project benefits and adequate targeting of


4
  Because of the pilot nature of the project, the credit amount was smaller ($15 M) than that of a typical urban
development project of similar scope; however, the resources were considered sufficient to implement the project’s
components in a selected set of eligible urban municipalities.


                                                      5
project interventions, and also helped minimize social risks of objection by municipalities
or communities. The selection of sub-projects was based on, among other criteria, the
number of and potential impact on poor individuals; the social and physical urban impact;
the sustainability of the investments; the impact on crime prevention and reduction; and
the ability to scale up and / or replicate them.
18.     In addition to focusing on the country’s fast-growing intermediate cities (rather
than Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula that had been traditional intervention sites of urban
projects), the main Project innovation was mainstreaming C&V prevention activities into
urban upgrading interventions at the community level using a highly participatory
approach. Taking into account best practices from traditional urban upgrading projects,
Project activities at the local level were to be advanced through close collaboration
between the communities (in particular, their neighborhood associations called
patronatos), municipalities and the implementing agency FHIS. Local governments were
to be supported to continuously engage with neighborhood residents, who took the lead in
identifying, planning, and implementing upgrading projects. Given the intricacies of a
highly participatory approach that would implement sub-projects based on a demand-
driven nature, the Project design also emphasized capacity building of the implementing
agency and the participating municipalities.
19.     Risk Assessment. The overall risk of the Project was assessed as Substantial at
appraisal and continued to be Substantial after restructuring. One of the risks rated as
substantial was the administrative changes and staff turnover after general elections. This
risk was mitigated to the extent possible by keeping in place key staff in the PIU as well
as the usual covenants in the credit agreement protecting the key staff. The risk of
political changes at the head of FHIS and a deterioration of its fragile fiduciary capacity
remained throughout project implementation. One important risk factor that was not
considered at appraisal had to do with the risks associated to working in violent
neighborhoods and advancing a highly participatory community-based approach in
challenging high-risk environments. On the positive side, some risks identified at
appraisal did not materialize, such as land tenure issues.

2.2 Implementation
20.     Implementation rated Moderately Satisfactory or Satisfactory throughout the
Project’s life, underpinned by strong commitment of the PIU within FHIS and
participating municipalities. The successful implementation of the Project can be
attributed to several factors:
21.      Continuous engagement of local officials and communities. One of the key factors
that contributed to a successful project implementation was the high degree of
participation of municipal staff and residents of beneficiary neighborhoods throughout
the whole project cycle. The Project ensured this through its well-developed multi-phase
participatory methodology, which included: socialization of the Project, its objectives and
the role of the community (which was key in order to obtain buy-in and trust from
community members, who were accustomed to being made promises that were never
fulfilled); conducting household surveys to create the baseline; carrying out participatory
diagnostics (including walk-throughs of the community by day and night to identify
hotspots); design of Integrated Neighborhood Improvement Plans (INIP) that included


                                           6
the identification of community needs as well as their priorities; and the implementation
and maintenance of sub-projects. The continuous active community participation not only
helped to ensure transparency and sustainability of the subprojects but also to increase the
beneficiaries’ voices and, for the first time, make them active partners in the development
of their communities
22.     Community organization and development. Although most communities in
Honduras have some type of neighborhood organization, the Project played a key role in
strengthening existing structures and/or creating new structures and mechanisms that
improved the organizational capacity of the participating communities, and ultimately
helped them be more actively involved in the implementation of sub-projects. Examples
of how the Project achieved this included the ‘sectoralization’ of neighborhoods, which
entailed dividing the neighborhoods into sectors according to geographic, social,
historical, cultural, and financial aspects. Once the sectors were created, neighborhood
general assemblies were organized to introduce the Project; identify and catalogue the
existing social capital and human resources within the community (patronatos, water
councils, parent associations, etc.); identify the existing assets (schools, churches, etc.);
and map the number of children, youth, and leaders within the communities, all in an
effort to ensure their active and equal participation in the Project. Via the strengthening
of community organizational structures and the active inclusion of the community in all
phases of the project cycle, the Project helped to incorporate communities into the
municipal structure for decision-making and planning of projects, allowing community
leaders’ access to municipal authorities that were in charge of delivering services to the
communities.
23.     Permanent presence of Technical Municipal Liaison Team (ETEM). One of the
most successful implementation features of the Project was the creation of a Technical
Municipal Liaison Team, which consisted of one engineer/ urban development specialist/
architect; one social worker/ community development specialist; and one to three social
promoters, depending on the size of the neighborhood. The main roles of the ETEMs
were to serve as the link between FHIS and the municipality, as well as between the
municipality and the community. In addition, they were responsible for providing
monitoring and any necessary follow-up on subproject implementation, as well as TA to
the municipal technical team. An important characteristic of the ETEMs was for them to
have equal knowledge of the infrastructure and the community development aspects of
the Project, thereby ensuring that the Project was truly integrated in nature and that C&V
prevention was mainstreamed whenever possible.
24.     Shared responsibility of municipalities and communities. The Project required
municipal and community counterpart contributions of at least 15% of the total sub-
project costs. These funds had to be contributed prior to starting project interventions,
which called for a “leap of faith” from the municipalities and the communities given past
experiences whereby “projects come and go but they do not leave a positive impact” 5.
While it required much efforts and time to mobilize counterpart financing, the
counterpart funding proved to be important to create a sense of ownership among the

                                            7
project beneficiaries. The Project also encouraged community participation by
contracting local skilled and unskilled labor for construction and maintenance which
promoted both, cost recovery and effectiveness.
25.     Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED). An innovative
contribution of the Project was the mainstreaming of CPTED principles into urban
upgrading activities. CPTED is based on the premise that if the physical environment is
planned, designed, and managed appropriately, certain types of crime can be reduced and
perception of safety can be increased. Common CPTED tactics include: minimizing the
number of exit and entry points to a neighborhood; installing adequate lighting in public
spaces; facilitating natural surveillance by minimizing obstructive landscaping and
structures; and avoiding hidden areas and other recesses where offenders may hide. The
Project included CPTED through: capacity building in CPTED methodology to both
municipal authorities and community members; exploratory marches to identify
community ‘hotspots;’ rehabilitation of public spaces; and construction of public spaces
in abandoned spaces. The CPTED methodology was essential in bridging the
infrastructure component and the social interventions of the Project to help improve the
quality of life of the residents of the targeted communities.
26.     Complementary grant from the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF). The
preparation and incipient implementation of a complementary JSDF Grant for
Employment Generation in Poor Urban Neighborhoods Project 6 contributed positively to
project implementation and outcomes. The Grant project of US$ 2.45 million created
synergies and sustainability to the physical infrastructure and social work. In particular, it
helped to provide additional training to local officials and community leaders on C&V
prevention strategies, gender-based violence, and prevention among others.
27.    Nevertheless, several factors – some outside of the control of the implementing
agency, but some within their own control – contributed to delays in project
implementation that required two extensions of the original closing date.
28.     Political crisis in 2009. The political crisis that started in June 2009 had
considerable effects on project activities and disbursements. Consistent with its
Operational Policy on Dealings with De Facto Governments (OP 7.30), the Bank
conducted an assessment of the prevailing situation and paused disbursements for all
projects in the country for over six months. While disbursements were formally resumed
in December 2009, actual disbursements could not be made before March 2010 when the
Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF), through which payments and
disbursements for the credit were handled, was reopened. Similarly, missions only
restarted in March 2010 after the new government had taken office. It should be noted
that despite the disbursement pause of almost nine months, the PIU managed to keep



6
 P124157 –TF097916 and TF097945. The JSDF grant finances the cash for work programs for vulnerable youth and
head of households, crime and violence prevention activities in participating communities, as well as operational costs
for NGOs that carry out these activities in close collaboration with the Project PIUs. Under the grant, intensive training
and capacity building for representatives from selected NGOs and participating municipalities on how to mainstream
C&V prevention activities was provided. The activities financed by the grant are carried out in the following
municipalities: Santa Rosa de Copán, Danlí, Villanueva, Comayagua and El Progreso Puerto Cortes, Siguatepeque,
Choloma and La Ceiba.


                                                          8
implementing all activities. By March 2010, the PIU had accumulated a debt to
contractors of nearly $800,000, which had to be settled through direct payments. It also
took the PIU and Bank team several months to sort out all the contractual problems that
had resulted from the disbursement pause.
29.      Politicization and high turn-over of FHIS leadership. In addition to the political
crisis in 2009, politicization and the frequent changes of FHIS leadership throughout the
life of the Project posed a significant challenge to implementation. There were seven
different FHIS ministers during the life of the Project, which implied frequent shifts in
political agendas and also resulted in changes and staff turnover within the central FHIS
administration to which the PIU was reporting. While the PIU staff was kept intact, the
frequent changes often made it difficult to insulate political influences from day-to-day
project implementation and maintain their core function of implementing the Project.
30.     Fiduciary capacity and internal procedures of FHIS. During Phase I
implementation, poor FHIS performance due to its declining fiduciary capacity
considerably slowed down implementation progress. The Bank responded by financing
an in-depth, integrated institutional fiduciary review in April-May 2007. The review
highlighted several structural problems such as reporting and approval process between
PIU and central FHIS administration and presented several areas for improvements in
financial management (FM) and procurement. Based on these results, additional
measures to strengthen FHIS were put in place. While FM improved during the last two
years of project implementation, slow internal evaluation and approval processes in FHIS
continued to be a main constraint for the project activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
31.     M&E Design. At appraisal, a set of key development and progress indicators were
defined but no baseline data were available and no target values had been defined at the
time of Board approval. Baseline data were subsequently collected for neighborhoods
that benefitted from the integrated urban upgrading as well as control neighborhoods in
the same municipalities as part of an impact evaluation of these interventions. In addition,
target values were defined for most indicators. The ICR team found that the M&E
framework included only few intermediate output indicators for the physical
infrastructure investment and additional output indicators for the infrastructure
investment were collected at the closing of the Project.
32.      M&E Implementation and Utilization. FHIS was responsible for managing the
data collection and analysis for the M&E of project outcomes and results for all
components. Some of the M&E activities were subcontracted by FHIS, including the
baseline and end-line surveys in the intervention and control neighborhoods for the
impact evaluation of the Project. The Bank team provided direct TA to the PIU during the
initial stage of the baseline study design in Danlí municipality so as to ensure the quality
of the survey. Similarly, the Bank team provided extensive TA to the PIU for the design
and implementation of the ex-post survey for the impact evaluation before the project
closing, as well as the subsequent analysis of baseline and end-line data. Although
monitoring arrangements were considerably simplified when the Project was restructured
in 2008, the Bank team identified weaknesses in the PIU to perform M&E activities in a



                                            9
timely and efficient manner. For instance, some of the key outcome indicators were not
systematically followed upon and measured at the time of project closing.
33.     Overall, the lack of a systematic M&E process built into the project cycle was one
of the main weaknesses of the Project. The PIU did not have a dedicated M&E specialist
assigned to the Project. This task was left in the hands of the Project Coordinator who
would rely on FHIS staff to follow up. Another key weakness was the lack of data
collection and disaggregation for gender and ethnicity. However, despite the lack of
systematic recording and documentation of M&E and little due diligence to ensure the
quality of indicators collected during project implementation, the built-in impact
evaluation of the project interventions, in particular the ex-post survey, helped to fill gaps
in M&E of outcome indicators and determine further impacts of the Project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
34.   Safeguards. The project triggered (i) OP4.01 Environmental Assessment; and (ii)
OP4.12 Involuntary Resettlement.
35.     OP4.01 Environmental Assessment. As corroborated during supervision missions
and assessments, the Project did not have any major or irreversible negative
environmental impacts. Moreover, no field evidence was found to indicate any indirect
negative environmental impacts. On the contrary, it contributed to improving the urban
environment (not captured through the Project indicators) by providing drainage and
sewage services, as well as recovering and creating public spaces. In addition, capacity
building activities helped promote social and behavioral change in relation to solid waste
management, rational use of water, and environmental conservation. An institutional
agreement was signed between the Secretariat of Natural Resources and the Environment
(SERNA) and FHIS, whereby the Environmental Management Unit (UGA) was
responsible for granting environmental permits under Category 1 and 2 Projects. The
Project also supported the institutional strengthening of the UGA in FHIS, specifically in
the oversight of decentralized activities and delivery of TA. Regarding compliance with
Environmental Laws, all subprojects complied with the Secretariat of Natural Resources
and the Environment’s (SERNA) regulations and obtained their environmental licenses in
a timely fashion, although there were some initial delays at the beginning. The Project’s
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was updated in 2009 and all
the tools included in the instrument were applied properly. Overall, environmental
safeguard compliance is Satisfactory.
36.     OP4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. This policy was originally triggered as there was
a slight possibility that small-scale land acquisitions would be required for the community
improvement infrastructure. An Involuntary Resettlement Framework was prepared by
the government and approved by the Bank in 2005. However, the vast majority of the
sub-projects financed by the Project did not require any land acquisition as they were
either upgrades of existing infrastructure (sidewalks, paths, stairways) or were
implemented on municipal land. So no involuntary resettlement took place and the
instrument did not have to be used. Overall, social safeguard compliance is Satisfactory.
37.     OP8.30 Financial Intermediary Lending. The Bank conducted a thorough review
of the Project, concluding that it fully complied with the requirements of the operational



                                             10
policy. However, since the loan window component was eliminated in 2008 no further
actions were needed.
38.   Fiduciary Compliance. There were no major issues with respect to fiduciary
compliance during project implementation.
39.      Financial Management (FM). For the most part, the PIU complied with the terms
and requirements of the FM specified in the Credit Agreement. Some financial
management shortcomings existed but information required to manage and monitor the
implementation of the Project was provided in the timely and reliable fashion. Main
shortcomings were related to weaknesses in the central FHIS administration (outside the
PIU), namely: (i) audit reports were submitted to the Bank with considerable delays,
mainly due to late contracting of the auditors; (ii) Financial Management Reports (FMRs)
were submitted with considerable delays due to delays in closing accounting periods; and
(iii) issues with reconciliation of accounting records. FHIS managed to improve these
deficiencies during the last two years of project implementation after a detailed FM
action plan had been agreed on in 2011. FM had been rated Moderately Satisfactory until
March 2013 and it was then upgraded to Satisfactory.
40.     Procurement. Procurement ratings remained Satisfactory or Moderately
Satisfactory throughout implementation. Similar to FM, there were some shortcomings in
procurement management. The main procurement challenges had to do with limited
procurement capacity of the PIU and participating municipalities, especially with respect
to a steep learning curve associated with the use of Bank guidelines and procedures. In
addition, the PIU experienced some delays due to long FHIS internal approval procedures
for issuance of bidding documents and contract awards. The findings of the last Post
Procurement Review (PPR) mission in 2012 showed that procurement performance was
considered as Moderately Satisfactory and overall risk rated as Moderate.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
41.     Completion of project activities after closing date. One sub-project in the La Roca
and Km 5 neighborhood was not completed by the closing date. Given delays in the
procurement process related to the technical design and counterpart financing
mobilization, it became evident that the sub-project would not be fully implemented
before the closing date. Prior to initiating the works, the municipality of Puerto Cortes
and the PIU therefore made a formal agreement that the municipality will be responsible
for financing the remaining works after the closing date, which consisted of about 50% of
the total investment amount. It was communicated clearly both to the PIU and the
municipality that the sub-project, even if the remaining works are financed with
municipal resources after the closing date, must comply with the Bank’s environmental
and social safeguards. As of October 2013, about 75% of the total works had been
completed; experiencing some delay caused by incremental weather conditions and the
works is due for completion by the end of December 2013. The municipality has already
provided full financing for the sub-project and the PIU is providing regular supervision,
including the compliance with the Bank’s safeguards policies.
42.     Safer Municipalities Project (P130819). Building on the experiences of the
Project, a new lending operation, the Safer Municipalities Project in the amount of U$ 15
million, was prepared and approved in December, 2012. The Safer Municipalities


                                           11
Projects builds on the approach and mechanisms developed by the Barrio Ciudad Project
while adding additional interventions to improve the capacities of national and local
actors in violence prevention. FHIS was selected as the Project’s implementing agency
based on its successful track record in carrying out the Barrio Ciudad Project and the PIU
staff were absorbed by the new operation. The new Project targets two municipalities that
participated in the Barrio Ciudad Project and includes one new municipality.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
43.     The Project’s objectives and design proved to be timely and highly important to
addressing Honduras’ main development challenges related to urban poverty and citizen
security. Honduras remains one of the poorest countries in LCR and average annual
urbanization rates are expected to continue above 2% until 2030. In 2010, approximately
52% of its population lived in urban areas and about 60% of this urban population was
poor. Many municipalities lack financial resources to support these urban poor and to
provide basic service and infrastructure. In addition, Honduras has one of the highest
murder and kidnapping rates in LCR, resulting from its growing role as a central trans-
shipment point in the international drugs trade. Insecurity has increased since 2006 and in
2011 a murder rate of 92 per 100,000 habitants made Honduras the country with the
highest homicide rate in the world. Murder rates are particularly high in the northwest of
the country (e.g. 174 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in San Pedro Sula in 2010),
where most of the project municipalities are located. Weak governance, slow economic
growth, and poor social outcomes have contributed to a more favorable environment to
attract organized crime, often related to drug trafficking. The impact of these external
stresses has been amplified and exacerbated by the high prevalence of many of the risk
factors that make individuals and communities vulnerable to violence, largely a result of
the weak and fragmented social safety net system.
44.    It is important to note that the Project’s focus on C&V prevention has
considerably evolved during project implementation from being one separate, relatively
small component to becoming a key underpinning element for the entire Project that was
mainstreamed in all sub-projects. This integrated approach that combines traditional
urban upgrading activities with social interventions related to C&V prevention, as well as
the Project’s participatory methodology throughout the project cycle, turned out to be
highly relevant for the current national priorities of addressing increasing levels of urban
crime and violence. In addition, these key features have informed the design of other
lending operations in the region, such as the Safer Municipalities Project.
45.      The Project’s experiences also contributed to articulating and formulating one of
the four strategic objectives of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy
2012-2014 for Honduras (Report No. 63370-HN), which responded to the Honduras’
priorities laid out in the Country Vision and National Plan. These priorities focus on: (i)
improving social investments and opportunities; (ii) crime and violence prevention; (iii)
social protection and reaching those in extreme poverty; and (iv) building the
Government’s capacity to implement a multi-sectoral and integrated citizen security
strategy at both the national and local levels. The Project contributed to policy dialogue
by supporting the prevention and institutional aspects of the national citizen security and


                                            12
coexistence policy, as well as advisory and convening services related to the sharing of
international violence prevention good practices.
46.      Given the above, the ICR rates the relevance of the Project as “high.”

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
47.      The neighborhood upgrading projects and crime and violence prevention
activities generated positive impacts in the project communities and contributed to
enhancing the quality of life of the residents at project closing. During the ICR missiona
and the stakeholder workshop, local authorities and beneficiaries expressed their
satisfaction with the Project’s results (see Annex 4 and 7 7).
48.    The Project achieved all three PDO indicators related to infrastructure
components. By the time of project closing all households in the six neighborhoods
where water provision infrastructure was financed were connected to the water supply
system. 8 Overall, 81.6 percent of households in the eight neighborhoods that benefitted
from integrated urban upgrading were connected to the sanitary sewage system and 96.5
percent of them had access to public lighting
49.     Some additional outputs and outcomes related to infrastructure improvements are
highlighted as follows:
   a. A total of 2,187 households benefited from either new connections to the water
      system or from the rehabilitation of the existing water connection, with a
      construction of over 18km of water networks;
   b. 2,291 households were incorporated into the sanitation system resulting in a total of
      2,799 households that are now connected to improved sanitation system with a
      construction of almost 34km of sewerage system. The impact evaluation that was
      carried out in selected neighborhoods shows that the percentage of households
      without any service of waste water disposal decreased from 62.2% in 2005 to 0.4%
      in 2013. At the same time, the share of households whose toilet is connected to the
      sewage system increased from 25.7% to 92.2%;
   c. Over 4,727m of access roads were paved and another 20,973m of access roads were
      improved, resulting in an increase of households with access to roads from 38% in
      2006 to about 72% in 2013. This contributed to increasing the percentage of
      households with access to domiciliary trash collection from 72.9% in 2005 to
      81.6% in 2013 as evidenced by the initial results from the impact evaluation;
   d. More than 2,794m of pedestrian paths and staircases in the beneficiary
      neighborhoods have been improved;
   e. Over 14,000 households benefitted from public lighting interventions near their
      houses;
   f. A total of 1,338.8m3 of retention walls were built as land slide and flood mitigation
      measures; and


7
 See Annex 7 for a full list of 88 representatives from 5 municipalities that were interviewed during the ICR mission.
8
 Two of the neighborhoods that benefitted from integrated urban upgrading under the Project had nearly universal
access to water systems at Project appraisal and prioritized sanitation infrastructure for their intervention.


                                                        13
   g. A total of 12 multi-purpose neighborhood sports facilities and playgrounds were
      built or rehabilitated.
50.     Regarding PDO Indicator 4, the Project seemingly fell short of the target
percentage of households who feel safe in the house in selected neighborhoods (65%
target versus 54% actual, increase from baseline of 45%). However, this result deserves
to be assessed in comparison with the perception of crime and violence risk in the control
group from the impact evaluation, and in the context of an overall worsening security
situation in the country. The results from the impact evaluation show that the perception
of neighborhood security has improved in the project neighborhoods compared to the
control groups. In the four neighborhoods that were surveyed, more people reported they
feel safer at the project closing than at the beginning. The percentage of household that
reported to feel safer increased from 45% in 2006 to 54% in 2013. This compares with
the control group where the perception did not change much at all from 50% in 2006 to
49% in 2013. Another interesting result has to do with the percentage of households who
think security situation in their neighborhood has worsened in the last two years. In the
treatment group, it increased by 5% from 34.8% in 2006 to 39.9% in 2013, whereas for
the control group the increase was considerably higher: 19% increase from 22.6% in
2006 to 41.3% in 2013. Finally, the households who responded gang exists in their
neighborhood decreased considerably in the treatment group from 73.5% in 2006 to
59.6% in 2013, whereas in the control group over 40% of the household reported the
existence of gang in their neighborhood in 2013, increase from 27.8% in 2003. The
analysis confirms the qualitative assessment of the ICR mission as well as a number of
anecdotal cases that the residents feel safer in their communities and their own homes,
and suggests the Project made an important contribution to the perceived level of crime
and violence in beneficiary neighborhoods. In addition, the ICR team questions the
validity of the proposed target value of 65% and feels that it could have been revised
during implementation. A 20% increase from the baseline is unrealistic considering that
the Project worked with poor neighborhoods that have been grappling with social and
economic exclusion as well as high C&V incidence for a long period of time.
51.     Finally, information for the last indicator to assess the percentage of households
satisfied with the project in selected neighborhoods was not directly available from the
ex-post household survey (highlighting the lack of systematic follow-up on the M&E
indicators). However, qualitative assessment through focal group discussions with a total
257 youth and community leaders as well as municipal staff in seven of the beneficiary
municipalities 9 demonstrated the high levels of satisfaction and appreciation for the
Project, in particular the infrastructure interventions. For instance, in the words of a
beneficiary in La Roca y Km. 5, “this is the best thing that has happened to us. It is one
of the most violent and difficult neighborhoods, people have access to electricity, water,
sewerage, roads and a kindergarten for the first time in their lives, we now have public
lighting 24/7, people feel safer, they go out, socialize and the community is more united”.


9
  As part of the impact evaluation, one focal group discussion with youth leaders and another one with adult community
leaders were carried out in beneficiary neighborhoods in the municipalities of Comayagua, Santa Rosa de Copan,
Villanueva, El Progreso and Danli. In addition, during the ICR mission consultation meetings with a total of 88
representatives from local administration and communities in the municipalities of Puerto Cortes, Villanueva, Choloma,
El Progreso and Danli were conducted.


                                                        14
52.     In addition, results from the household surveys in four intervention
neighborhoods indicate that beneficiaries’ satisfaction with project-related infrastructure
overall increased from 33% in 2005 to 62% in 2013. In particular, satisfaction with
sewage nearly tripled from 28% in 2005 to 83% in 2013. Similarly, satisfaction with the
quality of sidewalks and stairs in the neighborhood increased from 32% in 2005 to 64%
in 2013 and from 21% to nearly 75%, respectively. Finally, the end-line household
survey also showed that the communities’ trust level for the implementing agency FHIS
is considerably high: 64% of the beneficiaries trusted FHIS by the time of project closing
which was the second highest rating for trust in any organization after the church with
72% and suggests a high level satisfaction with the way the project was implemented.
53.    Beneficiaries. The number of direct beneficiaries, according to the Borrower’s
Final Report, is estimated to reach 55,891 people in 21 neighborhoods. 10 Indirect
beneficiaries are estimated to be over 925,000 people, including 883,500 benefitting from
the urban upgrading and the remaining from social intervention components.
54.     It is also important to mention that the Project achieved more than what was
originally envisioned in some areas. The results framework for intermediate outcomes
shows that the Project exceeded its original target especially in terms of training for
community leaders and municipal staff, e.g. in community development, C&V prevention
and environmental management. Detailed outcome indicators are provided in Annex 2.
55.     Overall, the ICR rates the efficacy of the Project as “High.” The Project exceeded
the three PDO indicators related to improving the quality of life for the residents in
selected poor urban neighborhoods in terms of providing physical infrastructure. While
the Project fell short of meeting the target for the PDO indicator on perception of security
in absolute terms, the comparison with the control group and overall security situation in
the country, suggest considerably positive results of the Project on the perception on
crime and violence risk. Similarly, the indicator on satisfaction with the project could not
be directly measured, but results from focus group discussions and the impact evaluation
surveys strongly suggest that beneficiaries’ satisfaction was substantial. In addition, the
Project fully achieved or exceeded all intermediate outcome indicators. Finally, the
Project also received qualitative feedback from both the beneficiaries and project
implementing agency that reinforced the positive results of the outcome indicators.

3.3 Efficiency
56.     Ex-ante economic analysis. At appraisal, an ex-ante indicative cost-benefit
analysis using the hedonic pricing method was carried out for the neighborhood
upgrading activities to be financed under Component 2 of the Project. The ICR team
could not replicate the ex-post cost-benefit analysis following the same hedonic pricing
model, as the original model and data could not be located, even after considerable efforts
by the team. In addition, updated cadastral data for the actual intervention neighborhoods
would not have been readily available and given the small sample sizes the hedonic price
analysis would most likely not have produced robust and significant results.



10
  The direct beneficiaries are the inhabitants of the neighborhoods that benefitted from the infrastructure and social
interventions.


                                                          15
57.     Cost per beneficiary household. At project preparation, the Project analyzed
average household costs for various infrastructure interventions that would likely be part
of the neighborhood upgrading packages to be financed based upon market prices and
cost data from other projects at the time. 11 Based on this analysis, it was determined that
financing should be capped at around U$2,250 per beneficiary household. This not only
took into consideration the minimum financing requirements for basic infrastructure
provision but would also help ensure that the resources are not captured by a small
number of neighborhoods. Given the large number of poor neighborhoods that needed
interventions in the project municipalities, the Project was conscious of supporting as
many neighborhoods as possible, avoiding non-essential infrastructure provision and
making the neighborhoods prioritize their most needed infrastructure.
58.     An ex-post evaluation of the actual investment costs per beneficiaries was carried
out for the 7 integrated urban upgrading sub-projects that were fully completed using
project funds. 12 The analysis yielded an average cost per household of US$ 2,275 and
average cost per capita beneficiary of US$ 379. This only slightly surpasses the original
threshold established in 2005. The team considered comparing average investment costs
per beneficiary for similar projects in comparable contexts in order to assess the Project’s
cost effectiveness. However, no data for similar projects in Honduras or other Central
American countries was readily available. In addition, the team considered it inadequate
to compare with cost per capita from other projects that have financed larger-scale urban
infrastructure in vastly different socio-economic context. In order to have a benchmark to
put the project costs in perspective, the team therefore resorted to estimates from the UN
Millennium Project on investment needed between 2005 and 2020 to carry out similar
upgrading activities in Latin and Central America. The UN study estimates that the
average investment per capita required for such activities would be US$355 13 . The
comparison demonstrates that the Project’s cost per capital is within the range of
estimated average financing required per capita, suggesting acceptable cost efficiency in
terms of investment allocated per capita.
59.     The ICR Team rates the Project’s efficiency as “moderate” given the analysis of
cost allocation/effectiveness and considering the lack of quantitative data to corroborate
the project’s economic rate of return and cost effectiveness.




11
   This indicative allocation was based on the average household cost of a full neighborhood upgrading package that
included water and sanitation connections, community parks and recreational areas (cost estimate derived from average
project cost per beneficiary in FHIS database of previous projects in urban areas), electricity connection and public
lighting installation (cost estimated by ENEE), street paving (costs estimate derived from average project cost per
household in IDB-financed street paving projects in marginal urban neighborhoods in Tegucigalpa), built-in operation
and maintenance cost (estimated to be 5% of the investment costs of the project), and built-in resettlement costs. Costs
were calculated for an average urban neighborhood of 400 households with an average of 5 residents per household.
12
   The costs for the sub-project in the neighborhood Colonia La Roca and Km 5 were not included in this calculation as
the sub-project had not been completed by the time of project closing and a formal agreement was reached with the
municipality that it would be responsible of financing the remaining works after the project closing date (see 2.5 Post
Completion Operation/Next Phase).

includes US$235 for provision of networked infrastructure, US$71 for provision of bulk infrastructure, US$ for
construction of community facilities, US$7 for purchase of land or transfer and US$ for relocation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
60.     The ICR rates the overall outcomes of the Project with the current PDO as
“Moderately Satisfactory” based on a “high” rating for relevance and efficacy and
“moderate” for efficiency. The ICR team had considered a “Satisfactory” rating given the
Project’s high relevance and impact, but ultimately decided against it due to the lack of
quantitative analysis to evaluate its economic rate of return as well as outcome indicators
that could not be measured and had to be replaced with proxy analysis.
61.     The ICR also assessed project outcomes against the original PDO. At the time of
the project restructuring in 2008, the Project had disbursed about US$2 million (13% of
the total Credit) and the main bottleneck in terms of implementation progress towards
meeting the PDO was the lack of progress under the urban services loan window. The
implementation of the urban upgrading and crime and violence components was
satisfactory. Based upon the review of implementation process and the ISR (which was
rated as Moderately Satisfactory) at the time of the Project restructuring, the ICR team
rates the project outcomes assessment against the original PDO “Moderately
Satisfactory”, resulting in overall Project outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
62.     Poverty impact. The Project had considerable impacts on improving the quality of
life of the poor in the project neighborhoods by providing much needed basic services
and by improving the livelihood and quality of life in the project neighborhoods. Most of
the project neighborhoods were characterized as socially marginalized and deprived of
basic service with high C&V incidence. In addition, the Project activities were
complemented by a JSDF Grant Project for Employment Generation in Poor Urban
Neighborhoods that developed strategic partnership and programs with NGOs and private
sectors for employment generation for youth at risk and job skills training, among others,
to enhance skills of young people to improve employability and transition to the labor
market, and to prevent them from engaging in risky behavior, including C&V.
63.     Gender. Although the Project did not have a specific gender mainstreaming
strategy at the design stage, it brought an important contribution to gender aspects. It
helped to empower and bring capacity to patronatos (neighborhood organizations). The
patronatos in the eight neighborhoods that benefitted from the integrated urban
upgrading are now predominantly comprised by women (44 women, including four
patronato presidents and 7 vice-presidents, versus 20 men) 14 , who have played an
instrumental role in guaranteeing the success of the Project. Throughout the life of the
Project, the active role of the patronatos in sub-project implementation (including


14
  Each patronato is comprised of 8 community representatives. The patronato of the La Roca y Kilometro 5
neighborhood in Puerto Cortes is now entirely comprised of women and there are 7 women and only one men in the 2
de Marzo community. The patronatos of Nueva Esperanza (Danli), Santo Domingo (Danli), and La Independencia
(Comayagua) each are composed of six women and two men. In Santa Eduviges (Santa Rosa de Copan) and Miguel
Yanez Rios (Villa Nueva) gender representation is equally balanced with four male and four female leaders. Lastly, Fe
y Esperanza (Choloma) is the only neighborhood where there are more men (5) than women (3) in the patronato.


                                                        17
identifying investment needs, monitoring and supervising physical works and social
intervention, and ensuring accountability from municipal authorities) resulted in
empowering female leaders to take a stronger role and voice in neighborhood
improvement projects, including community safety and C&V prevention.
64.     Social Development. The Project brought positive impacts on social aspects given
its emphasis on promoting social inclusion and addressing urban poverty. Local
authorities and communities highlighted the impact of the project on improving social
cohesion and strengthening social capital, thereby preventing the risk of urban C&V.
Positive impacts identified by almost all the people interviewed during the ICR mission
included the change in their attitudes, improved perception of violence risk in the project
neighborhoods, and improved citizens’ participation. A number of community members
also commented how the provision of key infrastructure and basic service had positive
impact on their sense of pride and hope for the future. In addition, more interactions with
adjacent neighborhoods allowed them to share their concerns and identify common
solutions and the project provided a platform to interact more and build a positive
relationship between the communities and its elected officials.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
65.     The Project contributed to strengthening the capacity of local government and
community organizations in organizing and investing in neighborhood improvements and
also in mainstreaming a participatory CPTED method into their efforts. In particular, the
Project enhanced the capacity of local authorities to implement an integrated approach to
urban upgrading and social interventions to address urban C&V. Local authorities
emphasized their intention to replicate the integral approach adopted by this Project in
other neighborhoods. For instance, the municipalities of El Progreso and Puerto Cortes
started to develop additional educational and training activities geared towards the urban
youth and violence prevention based upon the methodology adopted by the Project 15.
 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
66.    Strategic Partnership. Given the multi-sectoral nature of urban upgrading and
C&V prevention, the Project formed several strategic partnerships with various entities
throughout project implementation. Examples of partnerships at the national level
include: the police, SANAA (national water board); ENEE (national electricity board);
and INFOP (national training institute); at the municipal level: municipal agencies such
as Justice, Women, Cadaster, and Social Development); and at the community level:
community-based organizations, local schools; PTAs; and patronatos.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Stakeholder Workshop
67.     A Stakeholder Workshop was held on 7 June, 2013, to discuss Project’s lessons
and experiences with national level decision makers, mayors, and community
participants. According to the participants, the neighborhood upgrading projects and
C&V prevention activities generated positive impacts in the project communities. Local

stressed that the integrated approach and the participatory methodology throughout the
project cycle had been key for the Project’s success. In particular, they highlighted the
impact of the Project in strengthening community organization and enhancing social
cohesion, a sense of pride for the community and self-esteem, in particular among the
youth. In addition, the counterpart financing through the municipality and communities
helped to create project ownership (See Annex 4 for details).
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
68.   The risks associated with sustaining the Project’s actual benefits and maintaining
the PDO are the following:
69.     The risk to sustaining the infrastructure investments through adequate operation
and maintenance (O&M) is substantial. The sustainability of water, sewerage, and
electricity infrastructure depends largely on the communities’ continued ability to pay for
provision of these services so that the operators will provide regular O&M. Similarly,
municipalities will have to provide operation and preventive maintenance for drainage,
community facilities, and roads built under the Project. Moreover, the continued
involvement of the communities in social activities related to minor infrastructure
maintenance, such as cleaning of streets and gutters, reporting problems with public
lighting, protecting walls and street signs from vandalism, and minor repairs of sport
fields, will be crucial. During implementation, the ETEMs facilitated dialog between
municipal authorities, communities and operators to determine the tariffs for the residents
of intervention neighborhoods. Average monthly tariffs for water provision now range
from US$1 to US$3.40 for water supply systems operated by water councils and between
US$2.40 and US$6.50 for those managed by water utilities. In the latter case, a sliding-
scale tariff structure helps to cross-subsidize these low-income tariffs and contributes to
ensuring financial sustainability of the water utilities. 16 During the ICR interviews,
beneficiaries expressed their willingness to pay these tariffs, especially since they are
considerably cheaper than what they used to pay for water from private vendors (average
monthly expenses ranged from US$19 to US$25). For O&M of the sewage systems,
beneficiaries pay a monthly fee of US$1 to US$1.50 to the municipalities. In addition, the
participating municipalities have earmarked funds in their budgets to account for tariff
subsidies as well as O&M of service infrastructure and community facilities.
70.    It is also worth noting that the municipalities of Siguatepeque, Comayagua and
Puerto Cortes receive support to improve the efficiency of their water utilities in terms of
performance and financial management under the Water and Sanitation Sector
Modernization Project (P103881). In some cases (Siguatepeque, Choloma, Villa Nueva
and Danli), the municipalities have also hired the Project’s technical and social liaisons in
order to carry out community activities related to O&M. In addition to this, some
patronatos have proposed and initiated charging user fees to maintain the sports facilities
and public space. For example, in Villeda Morales in Danli, the patronato hired a

   For water utilities of the municipalities of El Progreso, Puerto Cortes, Comayagua, Villanueva, Santa Rosa de Copan,
Choloma and Danli, the average tariff effectiveness was 97% in 2012. This means that tariff collection allowed water
utilities to recover 97% of their overall costs for operation, maintenance and administration of the systems.

security guard and a maintenance staff; in Comayagua each neighbor contributes US$1
per month towards maintenance and beautification of the community square.
71.     The risks to sustaining active community involvement are Moderate. It will be
important to maintain social cohesion and trust in beneficiary communities in order to
continue preventing C&V in these neighborhoods in the future. The realization of further
social activities, in particular to engage youth at risk, will largely depend on the initiative
of the patronatos and other community leaders, but will also have to be accompanied by
the continued mobilization of financial resources as well as strategic alliances and
partnerships with the municipal administrations and, if possible, the private sector.
Experiences from early sub-projects in Danli, Santa Rosa de Copan and Villanueva have
shown that the strengthening of community organizational structures and capacity
building of patronatos and other community leaders have not only enabled them to carry
out community activities independently, but also incorporated them into the municipal
structures for decision-making and planning of projects. Given their increased confidence
to make their voice heard through these channels as a result of the project interventions, it
seems likely that community leaders will continue to demand municipal support to carry
out social activities in their neighborhoods.
72.     Finally, it is important to acknowledge external risk factors that could worsen the
condition of the participating municipalities and neighborhoods and negatively affect the
Project outcomes. There is a risk that staff turn-over in the municipal governments
following elections every four years weakens the built capacity to carry out integrated
projects in vulnerable communities. In addition, the C&V risk is likely to continue to
exist in the municipalities and could easily be worsened by external factors, such as an
economic downturn. In particular, the ICR team notes that youth-at-risk are extremely
vulnerable and it would be important to continue supporting them to allow access to
productive activities and continue to provide social interaction and education. While
these risks are beyond the Project’s control, the Bank’s continued support through the
Safer Municipalities Project and the JSDF Grant could help address them and provide a
longer-term support to find a viable and sustainable solution to C&V risk.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
73.     The Bank team took into account lessons learned in the country and sector in
Project design. The integrated approach with a focus on C&V developed for this Project
was innovative and relevant. Its design also included a clear and transparent methodology
to identify eligible municipalities and incorporated a strong participatory approach.
However, there were also some shortcomings that later affected effective implementation.
In particular, the initial preparation did not thoroughly evaluate the viability of
implementing the loan window component in the context of Honduran institutional
environment and capacity, which eventually led to the cancellation of this component. In
addition, the original PDO seems to have been too vague and the M&E framework was
perhaps overambitious including about 35 indicators without clear target values. The


                                             20
framework had to be simplified and modified during project implementation in
accordance with the new Bank guidelines on M&E. The Bank performance in ensuring
quality at entry is therefore considered Moderately Satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
74.     The Bank team demonstrated great flexibility and determination throughout
supervision, especially during the political crisis in 2009-10. In particular, the Bank team
intensified its presence and supervision activities when the Bank reinitiated operations in
the country following the disbursement pause by providing proactive support to contract
management for the works that had been carried out during the pause and by mitigating
further risks for project delay. The Bank team was also responsive to the Borrower’s
request for Project restructurings so as to mitigate risks and ensure successful project
completion. More importantly, the Bank brought invaluable technical support related to
C&V prevention activities to the PIU and facilitated cutting-edge knowledge and
expertise, such as private-public partnership initiatives for C&V prevention and school-
based violence prevention. Finally, the task team supported modernizing and improving
FHIS management by providing specific recommendations to introduce service standards
and streamlining procedures for internal review and approval, and by facilitating south-
south exchanges of the successful examples of similar entities in Georgia and Jamaica.
There were four task team leaders during the life of the Project. While this created initial
anxiety among the PIU, it did not affect overall project performance. FHIS emphasized
the high quality of the Bank’s guidance throughout implementation (see Annex 5
Summary of the Borrower’s ICR).
75.      Shortcomings in the Bank’s supervision included: (i) a lack of adequate fiduciary
and procurement supervision during the first half of the project implementation. The
inadequate staffing and the lack of timely responsiveness by fiduciary and procurement
staff (e.g. time it took for the Bank to response to the Borrower’s audit report and provide
no objections) was considered as major shortcoming, delaying project implementation
considerably. However, this was addressed during the second part of the project
implementation; (ii) more emphasis and guidance on the M&E framework could have
been provided; and (iii) the Bank team could have assisted the PIU better in knowledge
management and communications given that rich knowledge and experiences from the
Project are dispersed and there has not been a systematic approach to manage and
communicate knowledge and information.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
76.     Both the Bank’s performance at entry and during supervision is rated Moderately
Satisfactory, which leads to a combined rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                            21
77.     Both FHIS (central management and administrative groups outside the PIU) and
the Ministry of Finance provided political support for the Project throughout its
implementation. However, the ICR team views that the national government entities did
not always provide an enabling environment to facilitate project implementation. More
specifically, the frequent changes in the FHIS leadership (there were seven different
Ministers during the life of the Project) added to the difficulties in implementation. In
addition, implementation was often adversely affected by bureaucratic internal reviews
and lengthy approval processes in FHIS outside the PIU (e.g. time it took to send out
requests for the Bank’s no objection/review or to get the Minister’s signature on formal
documents). Another shortcoming was the initial lack of compatibility and coordination
between the central financial system within the Ministry of Finance and the FHIS
financial management system, creating significant time lags in the flow of funds which in
turn further delayed project implementation. The performance of participating
municipalities was generally satisfactory. They played an active and important role in
liaising between project communities and FHIS PIU and also demonstrated a keen
interest in and political support for the project implementation.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
78.     The PIU within FHIS has maintained a proactive and dedicated team of
professionals who were instrumental in achieving the PDO. The PIU was responsible for
coordinating overall project activities, monitoring implementation, ensuring compliance
with fiduciary and safeguards requirements, and strengthening the capacity of the
municipalities to implement the Project. The PIU took time to develop strong ties with
local communities through reiterative process of consultation and discussion, gaining
trust and confidence from the communities. It was important to build a foundation with
communities at the initial stage – which took almost two years in many cases – since
many of the local communities showed initial reservation about the Project, especially for
the need to contribute to counterpart financing up front, and had doubts that the sub-
projects would actually materialize. It was also important because virtually all project
communities were considered as high risk areas in terms of C&V incidence. The PIU’s
extensive engagement with the local communities and a number of community activities
supported by the Project helped to jump start the implementation of urban upgrading
investments and social intervention activities. Finally, the PIU worked closely with the
local communities and government and provided hand-holding for the local authorities
with limited capacity. In addition, despite initial weaknesses in procurement and FM
capacity, there were no major issues with respect to compliance with the Bank’s fiduciary
and safeguards requirements during the life of the project.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
79.     The overall Borrower’s performance is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory.” The
Project’s outcomes were achieved; the Borrower maintained its commitment over the life
of the Project and is expected to continue to do so after Project completion through its
continued support to the JSDF Grant and the Safer Municipalities Project as well as the
mitigation measures to potential risks identified by FHIS. Notwithstanding the political


                                           22
crisis and the high turnover of FHIS Ministers, the PIU maintained its continuity for
smooth implementation during these difficult transition times.
6. Lessons Learned
80.     Invest in designing a simple yet enforceable M&E framework. One of the
shortcomings of the Project was the limited attention given to the systematic M&E
framework throughout the project cycle. In low-capacity countries such as Honduras, it is
crucial to keep the design of the M&E framework as simple as possible and clearly define
from the beginning methodologies that the PIU can use throughout implementation to
monitor progress towards the PDO. In particular, measures should be taken to avoid
M&E indicators being sidelined in the midst of other priorities during implementation.
81.     Integrated delivery of physical infrastructure and social interventions. The
Project demonstrated the importance of combining both physical infrastructure and social
prevention interventions, as opposed to intervening in only one area, in order to address
effectively C&V risk in urban areas. This integration can be achieved by using
methodologies such as CPTED, which is based on making changes in the built
environment to prevent certain types of crime and also includes a significant community
participation component (e.g. community residents identifying hotspots, the use of
natural surveillance). In addition, the institutionalization of technical liaison teams in the
participating municipalities, which are composed of infrastructure and social
development specialists as well as social promoters paid by the Project, can also promote
this integration. Given the additional costs of these features, it is important to assign
sufficient funds for project management and activities of integrated urban upgrading
projects.
82.     Placing municipalities in the lead and increasing their technical capacity. The
Project also highlighted the importance of sharing responsibility for implementation of
urban upgrading, community development and violence prevention sub-projects with
municipalities and local communities to increase their technical capacity and ensure
sustainability of sub-projects. Some possible ways to actively involve local actors and
transfer responsibilities are to have them lead the process of planning and developing
INIP; present subproject proposals for their approval; be responsible for collecting
counterpart funding; and work with the communities to ensure that they were actively
involved in the implementation, operation, and maintenance of the subprojects.
Specifically in the area of C&V, it is important to dedicate significant resources and time
in building the capacity of municipal authorities to understand how to approach C&V
from a preventive angle, how to carry out municipal diagnostics of C&V with community
participation, and how to design integrated violence prevention strategies, among others.
83.     Active community participation and strengthening of community
organization structures throughout the entire cycle of the project. The Project
ensured the achievement of results through its well-developed multi-phase participatory
methodology that included: socialization of the Project and its objectives as well as the
role of the community; carrying out of household surveys to create the baseline; carrying
out participatory C&V diagnostics; design of INIP that included the identification of
community needs as well as their priorities; and the active monitoring of implementation
sub-projects by beneficiaries. In addition, existing organizational structures were


                                             23
strengthened and community leaders received significant capacity building in community
development, C&V prevention strategies and working with municipal decision-making
and planning structures. When preparing similar urban upgrading projects, task teams
should not underestimate the importance of these activities to ensure transparency and
sustainability of subprojects, but also their contribution to increasing the self-esteem and
voice of the targeted communities by making them active partners of the municipalities in
the development of their neighborhoods.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
84.    A Spanish translation of the draft ICR was shared with the Borrower and
implementing agency for their review and comments. On December 13, 2013, a
videoconference was held with representatives from Ministry of Finance, FHIS and the
PIU to discuss the findings of the ICR and obtain their feedback.
85.     The representatives expressed the Government’s appreciation of the Bank’s
support and their satisfaction with the project results. The Borrower, through the
representatives, noted the general alignment of the draft ICR with their own evaluation
and concurred with the ratings for Bank and Borrower performance as well as for the risk
to the development outcome. The Borrower however suggested that the overall rating for
the outcome should have been Satisfactory rather than Moderately Satisfactory given the
Project achieved virtually all indicators and even exceeded several targets, generated
innovative methodologies and valuable lessons learnt for subsequent projects, and
disbursed nearly all funds. The project outcomes are particularly appreciated considering
the challenging environment in which it was implemented. It was noted that it was
unfortunate that the lack of quantitative analysis to determine the Project’s economic rate
of return prevented a satisfactory overall outcome rating. As a lesson learnt, the Borrower
would like to highlight that moving forward both the PIU and the Bank should pay more
attention to making sure that an economic analysis can be carried out at project closing.
86.     In addition, regarding the fiduciary aspects, the Borrower clarified that the
fiduciary capacity of FHIS and the FM of the Project were considerably improved during
the last few years of project implementation based on a detailed action plan that had been
agreed on with the Bank. The ICR team reviewed this matter and subsequently modified
the main text of the ICR accordingly.

   Project implementation was carried out in two phases. During Phase I (2007-2011), the Project started working with five municipalities and adopted a centralized approach to
financial administration through FHIS. In Phase II (2012-2013), an additional three municipalities were included and some responsibilities for financial administration and
supervision were devolved to municipalities.

   The Project was not implemented in its entirety in Barrio San Jorge (community participatory processes and unfinished design of the INIP) due to lack of political commitment
from the Municipality.

Annex 4. Results from Stakeholder Workshop and Interviews with Beneficiaries

The lessons learned and best practices presented below draw from discussions with
mayors, municipal authorities, community leaders, and youth during the last supervision
mission of the Barrio Ciudad Project (carried out from June 3-8, 2013); the national level
workshop on lessons learned that was organized by the PIU and held in Tegucigalpa on
June 7, 2013 and the ICR mission carried out by an independent consultant on 30
September – 4 October 2013.
   A. Stakeholder Workshop
According to the participants, the neighborhood upgrading projects and crime and
violence prevention activities generated positive impacts in the project communities.
Local authorities and beneficiaries expressed their satisfaction with the project’s results
and stressed that the integrated approach and the participatory methodology throughout
the project cycle had been key for the project’s success. In particular, they highlighted the
impact of the project in strengthening community organization and enhancing social
cohesion, a sense of pride for the community and self-esteem, in particular among the
youth. In addition, the counterpart financing through the municipality and communities
helped to create project ownership.
Placing municipalities in the lead and increasing their technical capacity: The Barrio
Ciudad Project followed best practices in terms of urban upgrading, community
development, and violence prevention by placing the municipalities in the lead and
having them be responsible for overall subproject implementation; leading the process of
planning and developing the integrated neighborhood improvement plans (INIP);
presenting subproject proposals to FHIS for their approval; being responsible for
collecting community counterpart funding of 5%, as well providing the municipal
counterpart funding of 15%; and working with the communities to ensure that they were
actively involved in the implementation, operation, and maintenance of the subprojects.
Specifically in the area of violence prevention, the Project dedicated significant resources
in building the capacity of municipal authorities to address crime and violence (i.e. how
to carry out a diagnostic of crime and violence in a given municipality, how to design
integrated violence prevention strategies, among others), following the example of many
cities around the world who have successfully lowered levels of crime and violence by
focusing on actions at the municipal level. In addition, the Project also helped to further
strengthen municipal capacity and to advance the decentralization process underway in
Honduras, by decentralizing the procurement process in selected municipalities and
allowing them to lead the entire process (instead of FHIS as was typically done). Having
experience in World Bank procurement processes places Honduran municipalities in a
much stronger position in terms of being able to manage funds from various other donors
in the future.
Strengthening of community organizational structures: Although most communities
in Honduras have some type of community/neighborhood organization, the Project
played a key role in strengthening these existing structures and/or creating new
mechanisms and structures which would strengthen the organizational capacity of the
participating communities, and would ultimately help communities be more actively


                                            39
involved in the implementation of this Project (as well as in future projects). Examples of
how the Project achieved this included carrying out (as one of the first stages of the
Project) a ‘sectoralization’ of the neighborhoods, which entailed dividing the
neighborhoods into sectors according to geographic, social, historical, cultural, and
financial aspects. Once the sectors were created, the Project would organize and carry out
neighborhood general assemblies (asambleas generales) to introduce the Project; identify
and catalogue the existing social capital and human resources within the community
(patronatos, water councils, indigenous groups, parent associations); identify the existing
assets (schools, churches, etc.); and map the number of children, youth and leaders within
the communities, all in an effort to ensure their active and equal participation in the
project. All of the mechanisms and tools that were created by the Project have been
instilled in the communities and the communities continue to utilize them in the
development of their own projects or in projects with the Municipality.
Active community participation throughout the entire cycle of the project: Perhaps
the factor that stood out most prevalently during discussions on what seemed to work best
in terms of project implementation was the importance of ensuring the active
participation of the community throughout the entire cycle of the project. The Project
ensured this through its well-developed multi-phase participatory methodology, which
included: socialization of the Project and its objectives as well as the role of the
community (which was key in order to obtain buy-in and trust from community members,
who are typically accustomed to being promised services and programs and in the end not
receiving them); carrying out of household surveys in order to create the baseline;
carrying out participatory diagnostics (including walk-through of the community by day
and night to identify hotspots); design of integrated neighborhood upgrading plans
(INIPs), which included the identification of community needs as well as their priorities;
and the implementation and maintenance of community sub-projects, through the active
use of ‘social monitoring.’ Community participation was also achieved through the
hiring of community members as manual labor for the implementation of infrastructure
subprojects. Having active community participation throughout the life of the project not
only helped to ensure transparency and sustainability of the subprojects, but it also helped
to increase the self-esteem and the confidence of the targeted communities, in that the
Project for the first time helped to increase their voices and make them active partners in
the development of their communities. Importantly, the Project - via the strengthening of
community organizational structures and the active inclusion of the community in all
phases of the project cycle – also helped to incorporate communities into the municipal
structure for decision-making and planning of projects, by allowing community leaders
access not only to the mayor but also to other municipal authorities who were in charge
of delivering services to the communities.
Integrated delivery of physical infrastructure and social interventions: The Barrio
Ciudad Project demonstrated the importance of combining both physical infrastructure as
well as evidence-based social prevention interventions as a way to address crime and
violence. Two examples of how this integration was achieved include: (1) using
methodologies such as CPTED (Crime Prevention through Environmental Design),
which is based on making certain changes in the built environment to prevent certain
types of crime from occurring, and which also includes a significant community
participation component (i.e. community residents identifying hotspots, the use of natural


                                            40
surveillance, among others); and (2) the creation of a Municipal Technical Liaison Team
(Equipo de Enlaces Tecnicos Municipales), which was composed of an
engineer/architect/urban development specialist, a community development
specialist/social worker with expertise in violence prevention, and social promoters
(promotores sociales). Both of these project features helped to promote the integration of
physical and social interventions as a way to improve the quality of life in poor, urban
neighborhoods with high incidences of crime and violence.
Ensuring municipal and counterpart funding: The Barrio Ciudad Project required
municipal counterpart funding of 15% of the total sub-project cost, as well as 5% in
community counterpart funding. This aspect of the Project proved to be critical not only
in terms of ensuring the successful implementation and sustainability of the project, given
that the municipalities and communities were as a result much more heavily invested in
ensuring the sub-project was implemented successfully and according to their standards,
but it also created sense of ownership and a feeling of being true implementation partners
on the part of the municipality and the community. Importantly, the PCU highlighted the
need to request this counterpart funding before the sub-projects began implementation.
Strong coordination between national, municipal, and community level: The
implementation model of the Barrio Ciudad Project was based on strong coordination
between the national government, municipal government, and the communities. At the
national level, FHIS (via the PCU) was responsible for the overall implementation and
marketing of the project; of receiving and reviewing all of the integrated neighborhood
upgrading plans (INIPs); managing the project funds; providing and coordinating
technical assistance to the municipalities and the neighborhood associations for the
implementation of the subprojects; and monitoring the design, procurement, and
implementation process. At the municipal level, the municipalities were responsible for
overall implementation of the subprojects; marketing and socialization of the project at
the community/neighborhood level (together with the municipal technical liaison team);
leading the process for the planning and the design of the integrated neighborhood
upgrading plans (INIPs); presenting the subprojects to FHIS for their approval; providing
15% of total subproject cost in counterpart funding, and ensuring 5% in community
counterpart      funding.     At      the    community      level,     the  neighborhood
organizations/associations were responsible for participating in the planning and design
of the integrated neighborhood upgrading plans (including the approval of the total
investment to be made); providing a minimum of 5% of total subproject cost in
counterpart funding;        carrying out ‘social monitoring’ activities during the
implementation of the subproject, notifying the municipality and FHIS of any
irregularities or problems; and organizing themselves for the operation and maintenance
of the infrastructure projects (in coordination with the Municipality).
Permanent presence of Technical Municipal Liaison Team (Equipo de Enlaces
Tecnicos Municipales – ETEMs): One of the most successful implementation features
of the Barrio Ciudad Project was the creation of a Technical Municipal Liaison Team
(Equipo de Enlaces Técnicos Municipales – ETEMs), which consisted of one
engineer/urban development specialist/architect; one social worker/community
development specialist (including a background in crime and violence prevention); and
one to three ‘social promoters’ (promotores sociales), depending on the size of the


                                           41
neighborhood. The main roles of the ETEMs were to serve as the link between FHIS and
the municipality, as well as between the municipality and the community. In addition,
the ETEMs were responsible for providing monitoring and any necessary follow-up on
subproject implementation, as well as providing technical assistance to the municipal
technical team. An important characteristic of the ETEMs was for them to have equal
knowledge of the infrastructure aspects of the Project, as well as of the community
development aspects of the Project, thereby ensuring that the Project was truly integrated
in nature and that crime and violence prevention was mainstreamed whenever possible.
Utilization of CPTED methodology (Crime Prevention through Environmental
Design): One of the innovative strategies utilized by the Barrio Ciudad project was the
CPTED methodology (Crime Prevention through Environmental Design), which is based
on the premise that if the physical environment is planned, designed, and managed
appropriately, certain types of crime can be reduced and perception of safety can be
increased. Common CPTED tactics include: minimizing the number of exit and entry
points to a neighborhood; installing adequate lighting in public spaces; facilitating natural
surveillance by minimizing obstructive landscaping and structures; and avoiding hidden
areas and other recesses where offenders may hide. The Barrio Ciudad Project included
CPTED in the following project activities: capacity building in CPTED methodology to
both municipal authorities and community members; exploratory marches to identify
community ‘hotspots;’ rehabilitation of public spaces; and construction of public spaces
in abandoned spaces. The CPTED methodology was essential in bridging the
infrastructure component and the social interventions/crime and violence prevention
components of the Project to help improve the quality of life of the residents of the
targeted communities.
Importance of developing a community-wide capacity building plan: One of the most
successful elements of the Barrio Ciudad Project was the development and
implementation of a community-wide capacity building plan. This capacity building plan
was developed with the community members, who prioritized their greatest needs.
Examples of the types of capacity building activities that were carried out in the
communities included: community development activities (leadership and self-esteem
activities for children and youth; cultural activities; after school programs for children
and youth; sports leagues for children and youth); environmental improvement
(community cleanup campaigns, among others); and citizen coexistence and social
cohesion activities (conflict resolution, peace marches, activities to promote police-
community relations; among others).
Creating strategic alliances and partnerships: Given the multi-sectoral nature of urban
upgrading and crime and violence prevention, the Barrio Ciudad Project formed several
strategic partnerships with various entities throughout project implementation. Examples
of partnerships at the national level include: the police, SANAA (national water board);
ENEE (national electricity board); and INFOP (national training institute); at the
municipal level: municipal agencies such as Justice, Women, Cadaster, and Social
Development); and at the community level: community-based organizations, local
schools; PTAs; and patronatos. These partnerships not only helped to further advance the
goals of the Project, but they will also contribute towards ensuring the future
sustainability of the Project by combining and leveraging financial and human resources


                                            42
from various sources.
    B. Beneficiaries’ Assessment of Project Impact
One of the most important innovation or contributions of the Project to its sustainability
and commitment from all stakeholders was the concept of shared responsibility by the
municipality and the community. They are both important partners in Project financing.
The Municipality was contributing 15% and the community 5% of total funds. These
funds were contributed prior to starting project works or interventions, which called for a
“leap of faith” from the municipalities and the communities given past experiences
whereby “projects come and go but they do not leave a positive impact”. It took a lot of
effort from the local project team (PIU) to convince the people and future beneficiaries,
to create trust and to keep a positive attitude.
During the ICR mission several of the beneficiaries interviewed started their
conversations saying they were the most “negative people around, they did not believe in
the project”, however the work done by the Technical Team Liaisons and their
commitment to the project convinced local authorities and the community members to
participate and support the project. They are now strong and fervent supporters of the
project, the work they have accomplished and the lessons they learned.
The communities started to help each other and the project contributed to increasing
solidarity and social cohesion. For example, there were some instances that due to the
very poor situation of community members the municipality advanced their contribution.
For example Villa Nueva (Danli) reimbursed the municipality for the advance by paying
taxes (in installments) and in the Colonia Santo Domingo (Danli), the municipality paid
for the contribution of 22 families considered “casos sociales” (too poor to pay). Below
a summary of the Project’s beneficiary’s assessment of the project:
•   Vehicular access to neighborhoods and settlements: public transport, emergency
    services (ambulances or police presence) helps promote social inclusion and a feeling
    of trust in the government / municipalities and public services. It also has a positive
    impact in reducing health risks by improving the chances of a sick person, or a
    pregnant woman, to reach a health unit in time.
•   Improved health due to reduced risk of environmental contamination from unsafe
    water sources. All neighborhoods/settlements in the project have access to safe water
    (not drinking water). Reduction in skin diseases and diarrhea due to better water
    quality.
•   People, and specially women and girls, feel safer in their neighborhoods since they
    have public street lights.
•   People are investing more in improving the appearance of their homes since the
    neighborhood looks and feel better.
•   Children and youth have access to recreational facilities. It has helped create a sense
    of community.
•   Some of the surrounding neighborhoods, which were not part of the Project, are
    requesting the same type of projects or activities because they have sensed the change
    in social and individual behaviors and “they want to be like them”


                                           43
•   Active participation of communities throughout the project cycle and integration of
    the community as part of the municipal structure.
•   Increased real estate value (due to paved roads, access to water and electricity and
    increased safety).
•   Having social control / audits to improve accountability and good governance.
•   Timely and sufficient counterpart funds and power to participate in identifying budget
    priorities for the neighborhood create a sense of empowerment, ownership and being
    a “partner” in the project.
•   Facilitating the implementation process through local teams under the leadership of
    Technical Liaisons.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
This section presents an informal translation and summary of the Borrower’s Final
Project Completion Report submitted to the Bank on November 26, 2013, prepared by
the ICR team. The full report is available in the Project files. In order to avoid repetition
of basic project information already presented in the main text of the ICR, this summary
focuses on the Borrower’s assessment of the Project’s key achievements, crime and
violence (C&V) methodology, sustainability and challenges for the future. In addition,
supporting tables with quantitative information and data on outputs have been omitted as
this information is included in Annex 2 of this ICR.
   A. Assessment of project outcome
The PDO as revised in 2008, to improve the quality of life for the residents in selected
poor urban neighborhoods of the Borrower in Eligible Municipalities, was reached and
in some cases exceeded expectations.
One of the main reasons for the success and achievements of the PDO was the highly
participatory nature and integral interventions of the Project through a comprehensive
and complementary approach including: (i) neighborhood improvement activities, (ii)
technical assistance, and (iii) prevention of crime and violence though the CPTED
methodology. The Project contributed to a significant improvement in the quality of life
of the beneficiary communities as well as other inhabitants of participating
municipalities. The Project’s intervention strategy became a role model for other
neighborhoods that are experiencing similar challenges as the beneficiary neighborhoods,
mainly violence, insecurity, lack of public services and mistrust of public officials.
In addition to providing needed basic services, the Project helped to strengthen local
capacities and social organization, which helped transformed the attitude of the
inhabitants of the beneficiary communities to become more actively engaged within their
respective municipality and improve the perception of safety through more social
controls.
   B. Key achievements of Project
The Borrower identified the following key achievements as part of the implementation of
sub-projects in 21 precarious urban neighborhoods, directly benefiting and improving the
lives of more than 55,000 people:
   •   Joint responsibility between the municipalities and the community as key partners
       in development. The communities and municipalities did not only collaborated in
       the design, budgeting, construction of the works and social controls, but actually
       contributed financial resources (15-20 percent of sub-project costs) prior to the
       beginning of project activities as a sign of good faith and commitment towards the
       project.
   •   Recovery, refurbishing and upgrading of abandoned public spaces for recreation
       and community activities using the CPTED methodology.
   •   Organization of daily, weekly or monthly events in participating neighborhoods in
       order to encourage social cohesion and as a motivational tool to maintain the
       sense of ownership and responsibility for their own communities and solidarity



                                            45
       with their neighbors. Some of the activities included Cohesion and Solidarity
       Days with youth and children leaders to create a “culture of peace”.
   •   Design and implementation of Health Days, Environment Days and Citizen
       Security days to educate the beneficiaries and to involve them in future activities
       and make them agents of change in their societies.
   •   Positive reinforcement by bringing back to life and respecting their local
       traditions, as well as encouraging sports and cultural activities among youth
       groups.
   •   Promotion of good citizenship values and camaraderie.
   C. Crime and Violence Prevention Strategy
The C&V prevention strategy of the Project introduced the topic of C&V prevention
under a citizen security and coexistence framework and the preparation of an urban safety
diagnostic which was part of sub-project preparation. It included the following phases:
Phase I: Introduction and Socialization of Citizen Security Concept and Mechanism at the
local level
During this phase there were identification visits and meetings with local officials, police,
mayors, municipal technical staff and NGOs. Several communication materials were
developed, such as promotional printed material, security walk-ins and exploratory visits
with community leaders and crime and diagnostic mappings.
Subsequently, the Project strengthened the local capacity to address C&V through the
design and development of Integral Neighborhood Upgrading Plans. It provided capacity
building to strengthen security mechanisms of the municipal administration; it identified
and established specific responsibilities within the municipality structure; and it identified
organizations dealing with C&V prevention, such as security committees, neighborhood
watch and organized citizen security roundtables. The Project helped to organize
meetings to assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and identified
community and municipal needs and priorities; it provided training in safety related
issues such as training for local change agents on prevention of C&V programs and on
CPTED, as well as participatory planning in support of community security organizations.
The methodology used by the Project also included the establishment of strategic
alliances with public and private institutions, private firms, universities, and other civil
society organizations within the framework of Community Action Plans for the
Prevention of Crime and Violence. Finally, the Project strengthened alternative conflict
management skills at the district and city levels through training and organization of
Reconciliation            and             Conflict             Mediation             Units;
supported the establishment and / or improvement of C&V municipal information
systems, and provided participatory capacity building for the approval and socialization
of Community Coexistence Security Plans.
Phase II: Violence Prevention Action Plans Identified by the Neighborhood and / or
Municipality
During the second phase, the Project supported municipalities and neighborhoods to
prepare violence prevention action plans that frequently included the following activities:



                                            46
1. Social prevention actions to control, punish and reduce the use of alcohol and
   drugs. These measures included: control of alcohol sales in bars, pubs, and
   neighborhood grocery stores. It also promoted healthy living habits within the family,
   school and community (e.g., through the organization of cultural, recreational and
   sports events, health fairs, walks, parties without consumption of alcohol, etc.), in
   close collaboration with children, youth and families, as well as schools, colleges,
   sports centers, churches, health centers and parents. The Project encouraged and
   facilitated the recovery of public spaces by organizing cleaning campaigns of parks
   and playgrounds, reforestation activities, use of road signs and maintenance
   campaigns.
2. Activities for the prevention of child abuse and youth, domestic and sexual
   violence. These activities included the strengthening of Parent Associations;
   education and training activities for youth solidarity groups, parents associations in
   support of violence prevention; peace walks; organized meetings to include active
   participation and dialogue among parents and children; youth assemblies; cultural and
   sports events, and income-generating activities and management of small enterprises.
3. Development of situational prevention actions to control and reduce the
   incidence of burglary, theft, fraud and other related crimes. The Project
   conducted initial victimization surveys (baseline studies focusing on safety issues); it
   trained the community and individuals on environmental or context aspects that
   create opportunities for crimes to take place, and improved the environmental
   conditions of the neighborhoods and municipalities so as to reduce the incidents of
   C&V.
4. Security and coexistence information, education and communication campaigns.
   The Project facilitated interactive and participatory consultations, messaging, and
   communication and education campaigns through different media, such as radio and
   TV spots, newsletters and murals painted by local artist and the community in the
   municipalities, as well as active and continuous messaging in schools, colleges,
   public and private entities and public spaces; as well as coexistence days in the
   neighborhoods and municipalities including activities such as theme walks, games,
   talks, painting, singing, dance, theatre, puppetry and mime competitions and events.
    D. Sustainability of Project Interventions
Below are key measures identified by the Borrower to ensure social and economic
sustainability of the Project:
•   Operation and maintenance (O&M). The municipalities and communities have the
    O&M manuals for the subprojects and they also received training during the life of
    the project.
•   Hiring of technical staff and budget allocation for O&M. The municipalities of
    Siguatepeque, Choloma, Villa Nueva and Danli have hired some of the Project
    technical staff to give continuity to the project activities and guarantee proper follow-
    up and timely remedial actions. They have also allocated operation and maintenance
    (O&M) line items in their budgets. Some of the leaders of community organizations
    have been hired for six months (after project completion) to provide O&M.


                                            47
•   Replicability. Most of the municipalities have stated that they will use the Barrio
    Ciudad methodology to reinforce territoriality, identity, reclaiming public spaces and
    social advancement in other neighborhoods.
•   Income-generating activities. The Borrower will continue to look for alternative
    income generating opportunities for the youth to keep them productive and out of
    trouble. They intend to do this through the strategic alliances established during the
    life of the Project, such as alliances with churches, chambers of commerce, National
    Institute of Professional Training, private and corporate sponsors and sports
    organizers.
    E. Challenges for the Future and Mitigation Measures
The Borrower identified the following medium-term risks for the Project’s outcomes:
•   At the municipal level. The Borrower has identified a potential lack of political will
    and / or commitment by the municipalities to provide O&M to the works or to
    continue supporting social mobilization and behavioral change. In addition, there is a
    risk that municipalities do not have the necessary funds to provide good quality
    services. In the case of Danli, the only municipality with which an Urban
    Development Plan was developed as part of the Project, there is a risk that the
    municipality does not implement the Plan. They have also pointed out to the
    possibility that the municipalities stop implementing the C&V Prevention Action
    Plans or the CPTED methodology. Finally, they have identified as another potential
    risk the no-compliance with best practices and lack of vision towards community
    development.
•   At the neighborhood level. The main risk is that community members do not apply
    for social/infrastructure and prevention of C&V projects which have been identified
    through the integrated neighborhood upgrading plans. In addition, there is a risk that
    community organizations stop working together in support of youth, children and
    women issues, and that violence continue to increase in the neighborhoods.
•   Lack of funds. The main challenge in the case of strategic alliances is to guarantee
    the necessary funds to continue supporting community initiatives, entrepreneurship,
    infrastructure works, and social cohesion and coexistence.
The Borrower is conscious that the proposed mitigation measures are not supported by
the necessary funds. However, the mayors of the participating municipalities remain
committed to maintaining the results of the project. The Borrower has had several
meetings with municipality officials in order to create awareness among them about the
need to support O&M and to continue supporting important activities such as
communication for social change and other interventions geared towards the prevention
and reduction of C&V, such as trying to create jobs, one of the main needs expressed by
the communities.
As an indication of the municipalities’ and communities’ commitment to the Project it is
important to note that in the case of the subprojects that finished two and three years ago,
the municipalities and communities have continued to provide O&M and still apply the
C&V prevention methodology. Public and private alliances established during the Project
are still active, such as the alliance among the El Progreso municipality and the


                                            48
Corporación Municipal, the Chamber of Commerce of El Progreso and the Museo
Ferroviario Foundation, all active participants in the creation of the first railway museum
in the country and in Central America 20. The new museum has become the main tourist
attraction of the city, an outdoor museum that transport visitors back to the time of “green
gold”, a time of the “great Banana and Railroad Empire” 21 . The museum also has
audiovisual classrooms to be used for educational and communication purposes. In the
case of the most recent subprojects (that are also beneficiaries of the Temporary
Employment Generation project financed by the Japanese Social Development Fund),
they have indicated their commitment to keep the technical municipal liaison team
employed for at least six more months.
       F. Borrower and World Bank Performance
Borrower performance: Some of the issues mentioned with regards to Borrower
performance are the high turnover of Ministers of FHIS (seven ministers in a five year
period) and the corresponding new level of efforts that the PIU staff had to invest every
time there was a new Minister so that he could understand the Project and would support
it. According to the PIU, each change of Minister caused an approximate delay of two
months (14 months total) in order to follow through with signing of contracts, beginning
of sub-projects and budget execution.
The Borrower also identified the change of the Project Coordinator in 2008 as a positive
change, since Project implementation accelerated once the change took place. During the
2009-2011 periods, under the first Project Coordinator, 44 percent of the funds were
executed. After the change of Project Coordinator, during the period May 2011 – June
2013, the Project executed 49 percent of the funds, reaching a total of 97 percent by
closing date of 30 June 2013.
Notwithstanding the political crisis (2009), the high turnover of FHIS Ministers and the
change of Project Coordinator during the project implementation, the PIU maintained its
continuity and ensured smooth implementation during these difficult transition times.
These changes did not affect the disbursement of funds since the technical staff assigned
to the municipalities followed the instructions provided by government offices, the PIU
and the World Bank. In the case of awarding contracts, such as in “Santa Rosa de Copan”,
there had to be an extension of the contract but there were no delays in the disbursement
of funds.
The FHIS had a good relationship with other government units, such as the Ministry of
Finance and the Presidential Palace (Torre de Control de Casa Presidencial) which is in
charge of monitoring Project activities for the Government. The FHIS kept track of
disbursements for subcontractors, service providers and individual consultants through
the Financial Administrative System (Sistema Administrativo Financiero – SIAFI) which
ensured transparency in the management of funds.
World Bank performance: The Borrower states that the involvement of the Bank was
timely and provided support each time there was an important need, either by providing

legal or administrative advice or ensuring the correct implementation of the Bank’s
policies. Furthermore, the World Bank maintained direct and constant communication
with FHIS. It also monitored the progress of financial performance through the FMR
reports, statement of expenditures (SOEs) and the Client Connection software. The Bank
conducted at least two supervision missions per year. All changes (extensions,
elimination of component A in the original Agreement and change to the PDO) were
discussed and agreed with the Bank. These changes guaranteed fewer risks to project
implementation. In addition, the Bank facilitated institutional, municipal and community
strengthening processes by organizing specific technical assistance sessions, or by hiring
specialized consultants who provided training on, among others, C&V prevention,
CPTED methodology and violence prevention tools in schools. The Bank officials
showed a high degree of dedication and professionalism by providing immediate answers
to the needs of the project and by respecting national norms, as well as participatory
processes that took place in the neighborhoods.
