                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


1.     This Restructuring Paper seeks Bank approval to grant reallocation of credit
proceeds for the Honduras Barrio Ciudad Project.

2.      Background: The Project was approved by the Board on July 7, 2005, and
became effective on March 31, 2006. The objective of the Project is to improve the
quality of life for the residents in selected poor urban neighborhoods of the Borrower in
eligible municipalities. The Project consists of four components: (1) neighborhood
upgrading; (2) technical assistance; (3) urban crime and violence prevention; and (4)
project administration.

3.     Implementation Progress: As of February 14, 2012, the Credit has been
disbursed at 65% (US$ 10.1M of a total of US$ 15M). Furthermore, in the last
Implementation Status Report (ISR), the Project’s overall progress towards achieving the
Project Development Objective was rated moderately satisfactory (in particular via the
implementation of activities under the crime and violence prevention component).

4.      Justification of reallocation: The Project consists of four components: (1)
neighborhood upgrading; (2) technical assistance; (3) urban crime and violence
prevention; and (4) project administration. The GoH has requested the reallocation to
increase the total amount to US$822,634 in Component 3 and to US$6,248,832 in
Component 2 to allow for the construction of infrastructure for crime and violence
prevention and to enhance technical assistance to Municipalities respectively. Given the
strategic importance of this Project for the Government and based on the justification
provided above, we recommend that the reallocation be approved.
