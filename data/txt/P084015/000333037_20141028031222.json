for Ghana were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: there is a need for developing a robust\n            Sector Information System to facilitate the monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) of not only access to water and\n            sanitation, but the quality of the services provided and the\n            financial sustainability of the decentralized and\n            community-managed systems. There is the need to review the\n            design for small town water systems to give more\n            consideration to the category of small towns to ensure lower\n            and uniform unit cost. It was realized that the population\n            of a number of the beneficiary communities was less than\n            5,000 inhabitants, which meant that they were medium small\n            towns as defined by the CWSA ( i.e. population between 1,200\n            and 5,000) but benefitted from systems intended for larger\n            sized small town (i.e. population of over 5,000). This\n            contributed to higher unit costs. High turnover of\n            membership of the WSDBs, mostly due to political\n            interference, meant that members who had been trained during\n            project implementation had to be replaced by new people who\n            never had the benefit of any training. As political\n            decisions are invariably unpredictable, it would be\n            necessary to involve more of the private sector to\n            complement the management of the WSDBs in subsequent\n            projects. WSDBs, even though they contributed to the\n            management of the project at the community level, in a\n            number of cases resisted the participation of the private\n            sector in the management of the installed water supply facility."}, "docdt": "2011-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
