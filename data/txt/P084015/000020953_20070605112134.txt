I.INTRODUCTION

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide an
additional credit in an amount o f SDR 6,600,000 (US$lO million equivalent) to the
Republic o f Ghana for the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Cr.
397 1-GH). The proposed additional credit would support the completion o f original
project activities inview o f unanticipated cost overruns arising from higher unit costs.
These increased costs reflect the fact that the demand-driven selection o f beneficiary
communities during the first two years o f implementation has resulted in a larger
share o f towns with small population sizes, compared to appraisal estimates, thereby
leading to higher per capita investment costs for the smaller piped water schemes.
The proposed additional financing would thus enable the Borrower to achieve the
original key outcome indicator o f serving 500,000 people with safe and sustainable
water supply services. Except for the revision to the project costs and financing plan,
no changes to the project development objective, outcome indicators, general design,
and implementation modalities are sought. Financial management and procurement
arrangements, institutional roles and responsibilities and the closing date remain
unchanged.


11. BACKGROUND RATIONALEFORADDITIONAL FINANCING
                    AND

Country and Sector Context

2.      InGhana, it is estimated that about halfthe population do not have access to
safe water and two-thirds do not have access to adequate sanitation.       Water-related
diseases such as guineaworm infections resulting from the inadequate water supply
situation continue to plague the rural poor. Access to safe water in rural Ghana
remains low, currently estimated at 53% and progress towards achieving the
ambitious sector target o f 85% by 2015 remains slow (this target i s set higher than the
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target o f 73% by 2015). If important gains
are to be made in other areas o f human development, such as health and education,
then access to safe water supply and adequate sanitation i s required to improve
considerably.

3.      The Government's strategy for rural water supply and sanitation i s embedded
inthe Ghana Poverty ReductionStrategy (GPRS 2) andstressesthat increasing access
to potable water and sanitation i s key to achieving health outcomes and sustained
poverty reduction.     This i s affirmed in the Government o f Ghana's (GOG) draft
national water policy.     The draft policy states that the overall objective o f the
community water supply and sanitation program i s to "improve the public health and
economic well being o f rural and small town communities through provision o f
adequate, safe and sustainable water for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes
in a planned and coordinated manner, with integrated hygiene education and
sanitation interventions."

4.      A focus on small towns water supply, given the right approach and adequate
investments, has tremendous potential to significantly increase water supply access in
rural Ghana and enhance the possibility o f meeting the MDG target for water. In
Ghana, it is estimated that about 6.7 million or 32 percent o f the population reside in
small towns (with a population o f 2,000 to 50,000 inhabitants). As inother countries


                                            5

inthe sub-region, smalltowns have notreceivedfocusedandadequateattentioninthe
context o f water supply and sanitation. Recognizing the trend o f rural migration to
towns and cities in Ghana, focused attention to the needs of small towns remains
critical.  Ensuring that water and sanitation projects adequately address issues
associated in particular with operation and management requirements o f water
services insmall towns i s o f paramount importance.

Project Description

5.       The project's development objective is to increase access to small towns water
supply and sanitation services insix regionsbythe project's closing date, providing
500,000 people withwater supply facilities, and 50,000 people with sanitary facilities.

6.       The project, the second phase o f an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) credit,
was approvedby the BoardinJuly 2004 andbecame effective onNovember 17,2004.
The first phase o f the APL (in support o f the Community Water and Sanitation
Program) which closed on December 31,2004, successfully provided potable water to
over 750,000 rural dwellers and helped establish a system o f decentralized delivery o f
water and sanitation services through the local government system. The original
credit amount o f SDR 17.8 million (US$26.0 million equivalent) i s financing three
distinct project components - Community Subprojects (US$21.6 million), Sector
Support (US$3.1 million) and Project Management (US$1.3 million) - and has a
duration o f 4 years (closing date April 30, 2009).

7.      Project implementation i s decentralized to the Districts and i s based on a
demand-driven approach. CWSA plays a facilitation role. Implementation i s on-
going in six Regions: Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Western, Upper West and East
Regions. In total, 54 communities are participating in the project in 42 District
Assemblies.     A key feature of the project is the flexibility in planning and
implementing service delivery based on community and district demand for improved
water and sanitation services. Eligible communities receive assistance to enable them
operate and maintain the facilities ina sustainable manner.

Project Progress

8.      Implementation progress and achievement o f the project's development
objectives has been consistently satisfactory during the past two years o f
implementation.        This project has been an important catalyst in deepening
decentralization o f service delivery inthe sub-sector and has achieved good results so
far.  To date, about 170,000 people in 19 small towns have benefited from the
provision o f new water supply infrastructure and capacity building for sustainable
operation and maintenance. In all, it i s expected that close to 300,000 people will
benefit from safe water supply by end o f May 2007 as indicated inTable 1.

A third Batch o f small town water systems are planned to be rolled out in2008-09 to
provide a further 80,000 people inall six regions with access to potable water.

9.       A total of 30 Water Boards comprising community members have received
training in a range o f areas including tariff setting, basic accounting, environmental
sanitation and water system management. District Water and Sanitation Teams from
the respective local governments have also received training in various aspects o f
water supply and sanitation delivery as well as logistical support. Overall, the project
i s making modest progress on sanitation and will achieve the target within the original
credit allocation. Integration o f water, sanitation and hygiene education interventions
i s at the core o f the strategy. Hygiene Education and Sanitation activities are under
way in 30 small towns including hand washing initiatives which have been launched
in the respective Districts.      Regular Information, Education and Communication
programs are being undertakento precede and complement the delivery o f latrines.

10.      Compliance with fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards has been
satisfactory. The Government i s fully committed to the project and has complied with
all covenants specified inthe Development Credit Agreement. The executing agency
(the Community Water and Sanitation Agency          - CWSA) has demonstrated adequate
ownership o f the project. CWSA has instituted a participatory monitoring mechanism
at both regional and national levels incorporating regular stakeholder reviews on
project progress. Progress reporting i s consistent with the agreed indicators in the
monitoring and evaluation framework o f the project. About 40% o f the credit has
been disbursed with substantial commitments coming up inthe next quarter following
the conclusion of three major consultancy contracts in Western, Central and Upper
East Regions and the commencement o f construction o f a second batch o f 10 small
towns inthe Upper East Region.

Rationalefor Additional Financing

11.      The Government has requested additional financing in view o f water supply
cost-overruns, arising for two reasons: (i) predominance o f participating towns
                                                 the
with relatively small population sizes resulting in a shortfall in the access target; and
(ii) percapitainvestmentcostsofthesesmalltownssystemsthananticipatedas
    higher
a result o f the smaller size o f the populationinthese towns.

(i)PopulationAccessTarget Shortfall: Theprojectwas designedto cover 500,000
people insmall towns insix regions o f Ghana with safe water facilities. However, the
demand-driven approach governing community selection and participation meant the
project could not accurately determine upfront the exact sizes o f the towns that met
the participation requirements. The nature and sizes o f qualifyingtowns only became
certain during actual project implementation. Inthis particular case, there has been a
predominance o f towns with small-sized populations, specifically towns with
population sizes less than 10,000 people. The table below provides a distribution of
populationranges over the 54 project towns currently participating.

12.      The Central, Western and Upper Regions in particular have very small
populations, some as low as 2,400. This contrasts sharply with some large towns in
the Brong Ahafo Region for example with population sizes above 30,000.                  It is
evident that over 76% o f participating towns fall under 10,000 population contrasting
with the 22% estimatedduringproject preparation. Furthermore, itwas estimated that
there would be a predominance o f large-population towns, amounting to 78% o f the
total participating towns. In reality, large-population towns constitute only 22% o f
the total. Overall, this situation has given rise to the target shortfall o f 80,000 people.

13.     It derives from the foregoing that the higher unit costs for towns of relatively
small population sizes and the predominance o f these towns inthe project will impact
on the level o f investment required to achieve the water supply access target. While
the project appraisal assumed a total investment cost o f US$18.2 million (based on an
average per capita investment level o f US$37), the actual investment now required
based on project implementation is estimatedat US$26.1 million (based on an average
per capita investment level o f US$52), as follows:

14.     There are other costs relating to software activities in the new towns that will
ultimately join the project to make up the population shortfall. Specifically, these are
community mobilization, training, hygiene education and project management
services altogether amounting to about $2.15 million. The project components to
which the additional funds will be applied are the community subprojects, sector
strengthening and project management components. The total additional financing
requirements are as follows:
                                                                            Costs by Component

111. PROPOSED      CHANGES

15.     The only proposed change relates to the project costs and financing plan -
otherwise, there are no changes to the project objective, outcome indicators, or project
scope/design.     Financial management and procurement arrangements, institutional
roles and responsibilities and the closing date remain unchanged. Revised project
costs and financing planare presented inAnnex 1.

Iv.  CONSISTENCYWITH CAS

16.     The CAS identifies water and sanitation as part o f the human development
pillar, one o f the three pillars underpinningBank strategic response to the GPRS 2.
The Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project i s one o f three water sector
operations contributing to the overall water sector effort to accelerate access to water
and sanitation services, keeping in view the need to achieve the MDG targets. The
outcome o f this additional financing project will enable the CAS objectives and
targets regarding water and sanitation delivery to be fully realized. The important
contribution water and sanitation plays in achieving other MDG targets including
reduction in infant under-five mortality rates and enhancing enrolment rate o f girls in
basic schools cannot be emphasized.

V. EconomicAnalysis of Cost Overrun

17.      The project continues to remain economically justified. The revised internal
rate o f return for the project, including additional financing, i s estimated to be in the
range of 12.6 to 14.9 percent. This incorporates some changes to the specification o f
the economic analysis, as described in more detail in Annex 4.              The economic
analysis for the additional financing i s based on the methodology laid out in
considerable detail in the original Project Appraisal Document (PAD), with changes
as specified below:

         The number of beneficiaries o f the project i s specified as 500,000. This i s a
         change from the economic analysis specification o f the PAD, which was
         specified as 625,000.
         The costs o f the project, as well as that o f the additional financing, are
         specified to be that o f the physical construction o f the infrastructure, i.e. civil
         works.
         The fees collected by small town standpipes and by private households have
         been adjusted from that estimated in the PAD analysis, and represent the
         actual rates communities agreed to pay, higher than was initially assumed.
         The population coverage by size o f small town systems has been adjusted to
         represent the predominance of smaller-sized towns, as noted inTable 2.
         Economies o f scale o f average investment per person have been revised to run
         on a scale from US$55 per person in the smallest towns to US$45 per person
         inthe larger towns.
         Physical contingency funds specification, as well as sensitivity analysis, has
         been excluded from the additional financing analysis, as unknowns are now
         known and incorporated into the revised analysis.          More specifically, the
         initial sensitivity analysis proved precient in analyzing ranges for operation
         and maintenance (O&M) collection as well as materials costs. These revisions
         have been folded into the base analytical work, thus precluding the need for
         additional sensitivity analysis.


With regards to financial analysis, the present value of the inflows is estimated to
exceed that o f the outflows by US$4.0 million (at 12 percent interest) for a 15-years'
time period.


VI. EXPECTED     OUTCOMES

18.      The project outcome targets remain unchanged. The Project i s expected to
increase access to small towns water supply and sanitation services insix regions over
the next four years, providing 500,000 people with water supply facilities, and 50,000
people with sanitary facilities. Inaddition, the project will report on the IDA 14 Tier
1 Indicator for Infrastructure Development related to water supply. This indicator i s
"proportion o f population with sustainable access to an improved water source". This
indicator is already being monitored by the respective national water sector
institutions with support from a number o f Development Partners aimed at
strengthening institutional capacity for monitoring and harmonizing sector M&E


                                            10

systems. The results framework o f the project will be modifiedaccordingly to include
thisindicator.

VII. BENEFITSAND RISKS

19.    The overall risk rating remains modest as originally assessed at appraisal.
Mitigation measures remain unchanged. There i s no anticipated adverse impact o f
higher unit costs on sustainability o f O&M. Tariff setting (vital to sustainability) and
O&M arrangements are processes embedded in the community/District capacity
buildingprogram and thus communities determine how much they will pay for water
(including a replacement fund) and how they want their systems operated.             The
subproject cycle and minimum content o f the social process including capacity
building o f Water Boards i s not affected in any way. In any case, across Ghana,
communities have chosen to pay more than actually pertains inurban areas so long as
they assure themselves o f regular and reliable supply.

VIII. FINANCIAL TERMSAND CONDITIONSFORADDITIONAL FINANCING

20.    Standard IDA credit terms would apply to the additional financing.

considerable detail on pages 17 and 18 o f the main text o f the original project PAD as
well as inAnnex 9 of that same PAD, with changes as specifiedbelow:

       (i)The number ofbeneficiaries of the project, i.e. the peopleresiding at
       present in the small towns having been served by the original credit as well to
       be served by the additional financing, i s specified as 500,000. This i s a change
       from the economic analysis specification o f the PAD, which was specified as
       625,000, a figure higher than the stipulated target inthe project's development
       objective.   This figure was part o f the original assumptions based on the
       anticipated highpercentage of large sized towns. This has been corrected to be
       congruent with the originalproject development objective outcome indicator;

       (ii) costsoftheproject,aswellasthatoftheadditionalfinancing, are
            The
       isolated as that o f the physical construction o f the infrastructure, i.e. civil
       works, and thus exclude funding which has been used to fund sector support
       and management fees. In dollar specifics, this is specified as roughly US$25
       million o f the original US$29 million total project cost and US$8 million o f
       the US$10 millionadditional financing;

       (iii) feescollectedbysmalltownstandpipesandbyprivatehouseholds
            The
       have been adjusted from that estimated in the PAD analysis. The current
       analysis has tariffs for operations and maintenance (O&M) and sink funds to
       finance depreciation o f parts. These collected fees are estimated at US$0.77
       average tariff collected at standpipes, and represents a higher collection fee
       than was suggested by the project's Operational Manual.

       (iv) Estimatesofpopulation coverage by size of small town systems havebeen
       adjusted to represent the predominance o f smaller-sized towns, as noted in
       Table 3 o f the Project Concept Memorandum.

       (v) Revisions in economies of scale of average investment per person have
       been made to run on a scale from US$% per person in the smallest towns to
       US$45 per person in the larger towns.        In spite of the higher average per
       capita investment costs, overall implementation costs for this Bank-financed
       operation relative to similar donor-funded operations in the Ghana water
       sector remains relatively lower as a result o f the project implementation
       approach that utilizes local competitive bidding for all civil works contracts.
       Higher unit costs ranging from 36-84 Eurodcapita i.e. (US$47-1lO/capita)
       have also been estimated for 40 small town systems funded by the EU intwo
       o f the six participating regions i.e. Western and Central Regions. This has
       also been attributed to smaller population towns, generally less than 10,000
       people.

        (vi) Physical contingency funds specification, as well as sensitivity analysis,
        has been excluded from the additional financing analysis, as unknowns are
        now known and incorporated into the revised analysis.

22.     In terms of estimated benefits, the revised economic analysis continues to
comprise the following two elements: (i)    the value o f incremental water sales, using
tariffs collected as a proxy; and (ii)   consumer surplus resulting from the assessed
monetary value o f added welfare inhouseholds that will be directly connected to the
new water systems, which remains unchanged from the initial analysis.

23.     The economic value o f the indirect benefits specific to improved water
supply-such     as, time saved reliable supply, better quality water, and improved
convenience and healthwith newly construction sanitation facilities+ontinues      not to
be included inthe cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, the costs as well as the benefits
accruing to improved sector management are not detailed in this economic analysis.
As the PAD economic analysis contained no proxy for estimating the benefits of
project support specific to improved sector management, the revised analysis isolates
the analysis to that o f the costs and benefits specific and direct to improved water
supply*

24.     With these factors inmind, the revised internal rate of return o f the project is
estimatedto be inthe range o f 12.6 to 14.9 percent.

25.     The financial flows o f the project will be, outflows: investment (construction),
operation and maintenance, set asides for replacement and loan repayment (after a
grace period); inflows: loans, local contributions, and water sales. Outflows and
inflows remains from the original analysis to be close to balance, with small deficit in
several o f the project's years. For fifteen years, the present value o f the inflows i s
estimated to exceed that o f the outflows by US$4.0 million (at 12 percent interest).
Detailed figures are provided inTable 5.
