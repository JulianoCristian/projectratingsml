The additional credit will support the\n            completion of original project activities in view of\n            unanticipated cost overruns arising from higher unit costs.\n            These increased costs reflect the fact that the\n            demand-driven selection of beneficiary communities during\n            the first two years of implementation has resulted in a\n            larger share of towns with small population sizes, compared\n            to appraisal estimates, thereby leading to higher per capita\n            investment costs for the smaller piped water schemes. The\n            proposed additional financing would thus enable the Borrower\n            to achieve the original key outcome indicator of serving\n            500,000 people with safe and sustainable water supply\n            services. Except for the revision to the project costs and\n            financing plan, no changes to the project development\n            objective, outcome indicators, general design, and\n            implementation modalities are sought.
