I. Introduction

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a
supplemental Credit inthe amount of SDR 10,200,000 (US$15 million equivalent) to the
Republic of Ghana for the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (CR3971-
GH). The proposed additional financing would: (i) un-anticipated cost overruns
                                                       finance
in community water supply and sanitation subprojects and enable the Borrower to
complete the remaining project activities and achieve the original development
objectives, and (ii)support scaling-up the project's impact and expand access to water
supply services and enhance the possibility ofmeetingthe MDGtarget.

11.      BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancing

2.       Background. InGhana, it is estimatedthat about 44 percent of the population in
rural areas and small towns do not have access to clean water and two-thirds do not have
access to adequate sanitation. Although important gains have been made over the years,
the overall access to water remains low at 56 percent (2007-8) and progress towards
achieving the MDGtarget of 76 percent for water by 2015 is slow. Water-related diseases
such as guinea-worm infections resulting from inadequate water supply and sanitation
continue to plague the population living insmall towns andrural areas.

3.       During the past decade, with the creation of the Community Water and Sanitation
Agency (CWSA) and implementation of a series of Community Water and Sanitation
Projects (CWSP), small-towns have received focused attention. Giventhe growing trend
of urbanization, it is recognized that increased attention needs to be given to small towns
because of their tremendous potential to significantly increase water supply access and
enhance the possibility o f meeting the MDGs.The Bank is making direct contribution in
Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, in Phase 2 of an Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) which is helping expand and refine the District based Rural Water Supply
and Sanitation programs (RWSSP) in six regions. The on-going Small Towns Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (STWSSP) i s designed to expand water and sanitation
access insmall towns.

4.       ProjectDescription.The original IDA Credit inthe amount of SDR17.8 million
(US$26 million equivalent) was approved on July 27, 2004, and became effective on
November 17, 2004 with a closing date of April 30, 2009. The Project's development
objective i s to increase access to sustainablewater supply and sanitation services in small
towns in six regions of the Recipient. The project's original outcome indicators are to
provide 500,000 people with water supply facilities, and 50,000 people with sanitary
facilities. The project has three components: (i) Community Subprojects to provide water
supply systems and institutional and household sanitation facilities and hygiene
promotion activities in small towns, (ii)  Sector Support to support training and technical
assistance for major stakeholders to improve their capacity to fulfill their sector roles, and
(iii)Program Management to provide the CWSA with a management fee equal to five
percent of the funds disbursedto the districts relative to planned disbursement under the
project (Component l), and support the incremental costs incurred by the Agency in
implementing the project.




                                              2

5.      An additional Credit o f SDR6.6 million (US$lO million equivalent) was approved
on June 21, 2007, to support the completion o f original project activities in view o f
unanticipated cost-overruns arising from higher unit costs. These increased costs resulted
from the predominance o f participating towns with relatively small population sizes. The
Project is the second phase o f an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) promoting
decentralized rural water supply and sanitation service provision in Ghana. The first
phase APL (in support o f the Community Water and Sanitation Program) closed on
December 31,2004, and successfully provided potable water to over 750,000 o f the rural
population. The STWSSP has served as an important catalyst in deepening
decentralization o f service delivery in water and sanitation and has achieved satisfactory
results.

6.      Project Implementation. Currently, about 360,000 people in 40 small towns
have gained access to clean water supply services. This represents about 72 percent of the
project target for water supply. Although the sanitation component initially experienced
delays due to the CWSA's limited experience in small-town sanitation, it is showing
progress and the project target o f 50,000 people with adequate sanitation facilities i s
expected to be reached by September 2009. The Project's Development Objectives
(PDO) and Implementation Progress ratings are satisfactory as evidenced inthe archived
ISRs.

7.      Disbursementand FinancialManagementArrangement. To-date, the Project
has disbursed about 73 percent o f the original IDA Credit and the remaining balance has
been fully committed for additional new water supply and sanitation facilities and
capacity buildingfor sustainable operation and maintenance. Furthermore, the project has
disbursed 26 percent o f the additional Credit amount of US$10 million and committed
the balance on a second-batch o f 22 small towns to serve a further 142,000 people.
Compliance with fiduciary and safeguards has been satisfactory. The existing financial
management arrangements have been used for the project since inception in 2004 and
remain satisfactory. Based on review o f financial statements and audit reports, financial
management arrangements at CWSA are adequate and satisfactory. The implementing
agency has consistently complied with all financial management covenants including
financial reporting and annual audits. Overall, the financial management arrangements in
place meet the minimumBank requirements. The overall financial management risk rating is
rated as modest. The flow of funds arrangements for transfer to subprojects have been
documentedinthe ProjectOperationalManual(POM) which have beenapprovedby the Bank for
the original Credit. Financial management and flow o f funds arrangements are summarized
inAnnex 6.

8.      As part o f the revised arrangementfor funds flow, the project will open a Separate
Designated Account inU S dollars for the additional credit, whilst the existing Designated
Account will be used for the original credit andthe first additional Credit. The funds flow
arrangements for transfer to Districts currently inplace are satisfactory. To speed-up the
transfer o f funds to the Districts to implement their subproject activities, the authorized
amount to be deposited in the new Designated US dollar Account under the second
additional Credit has been increased to US$5 million. The CWSA staff have prior
experience working on World Bank funded projects and are, therefore, familiar with the


                                             3

Bank's disbursement procedures. The agency has inplace agreed arrangements that cover
releases and accounting o f funds to the Districts to enable them to implement their
subprojects and the regions for their operating activities.

9.      Procurement Arrangements.          Procurement activities under the additional
financing will be carried out by the various beneficiary District Assemblies under the
coordination and technical support o f CWSA. Capacity assessment o f CWSA shows that
they have handled Bank funded projects since the year 2000 and have gained extensive
experience to handle procurement. Procurement capacity at both the CWSA head office
and the RWST's in the original project areas is found to be adequate, based upon a
review o f their past performance during previous supervision missions. To date most
procurement has involved prior review, and there have been too few other contracts to
justify formal Post Procurement Reviews. All the contracts being carried out in 11 small
town water supply systems will be overseen by regional CWSA engineers (in four
regions) that have sufficient knowledge and experience in Bank's procurement
procedures and sufficient technical knowledge to provide technical assistance to the
implementing DAs. These DAs have also previously received training from CWSA and
thus have knowledge on Bankprocurement, but will continue to receive technical support
from CWSA. Under the project implementation arrangements, capacity o f Water Boards
will be enhanced by DAs while that o f the DAs will be enhanced by continuous capacity
efforts and support by CWSA Regional Teams, as well as by use o f procurement and
financial procedures specified inthe Project Operational Manual.

 10.    For contracts included inthe original project's Bank approved procurement plans,
for which invitations to bidwere issued under the old procurement rules prior to approval
o f the additional financing, procurement arrangements and conditions o f the original
guidelines will continue to apply. However, in line with Bank policy, all new
procurement that uses the additional financing will be governed by the Bank's May 2004
Procurement and Consultant Guidelines as revised in October 2006. Given that the
procurement planshows that all the new contracts for 11 towns are being procured under
NCB, it shall be ensured that the following provisions will apply (which are exceptions to
National Bidding Procedures and acceptable to the Bank): (a) foreign bidders shall be
allowed to participate in N C B procedures without restrictions o f any kind; (b) bidders
shall be given at least one month to submit bids from the date o f the invitation to bid or
the date o f availability o f bidding documents, whichever is later; (c) no domestic
preference shall be given for domestic bidders and for domestically manufactured goods;
(d) in accordance with para.l.14 (e) o f the Procurement Guidelines, each bidding
document and contract financed out o f the proceeds o f the Financing shall provide that:
(i) bidders, suppliers,contractorsandsubcontractors shallpermittheAssociation, at
   the
its request, to inspect their accounts and records relating to the bid submission and
performance o f the contract, and to have said accounts and records audited by auditors
appointed by the association; and (ii) the deliberate and material violation by the bidder,
supplier, contractor or subcontractor o f such provision may account to an obstructive
practice as defined inparagraph l.l4(a)(v) o f the Procurement Guidelines..

 11.    SafeguardCompliance.The project is beingimplemented inaccordance withthe
principles and institutional procedures established in the Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) which


                                             4

were approved under the original Credit and are under implementation in the on-going
project. In 2007, at the recommendation o f a Bank mission to improve safeguards
implementation, the CWSA hired an Environmental and Social Development consultant
responsible for monitoring and reporting o f safeguards implementation. The capacity to
monitor safeguards has, therefore, increased substantially over the last year and a half and
the project's safeguards implementation was rated satisfactory inthe latest ISR.

12.     Community sub-projects financed by this additional Credit will meet the
environmental standards outlined in the ESMF. An addendum to the main EMSF has
been prepared to cover the 11new towns. The main ESMF and an approved addendum
have been disclosed in the districts of the participating new small towns. Similarly, the
project has an approved RPF which has guided its implementation. Although new
subproject activities are not expected to generate new social issues that will require new
commitment by the Borrower, an addendum has been prepared, approved by the Bank
and disclosed inthe districts o f the participating new towns. On resettlement, the project
will require pieces o f land for the construction o f water sources, reservoirs, and
communal standpipes. These lands are often released by communal leaders, ascertained
and endorsed by the District Assemblies. These are not likely to result in involuntary
resettlement. Nonetheless, the original RPF and the addendum will be used to guide the
process o f land acquisition andproper implementation o f social safeguards.

13.     Sustainability. The Borrower is fully committed to the project and is in
compliance with all covenants specified in the Development Credit Agreement. The
Implementing Agency has also demonstrated adequate ownership o f the project. The
sustainability o f the W&S facilities rests on community willingness and the capacity to
manage and sustain services. To help strengthen the districts' capacity to plan, appraise
and implement subprojects, the project has provided support, through external short-term
assistance inthese areas. Similarly, to strengthen the capacity o f communities to manage
their services, the project has provided training in community management and
strengthened the capacity o f the Water and Sanitation Development Boards (WSDBs).
The Beneficiary communities will assume full responsibilities for O&M costs for all
subprojects. This will help ensure the long-term sustainability o f the completed water
systems. Furthermore, water prices paid at standpipes and household connections cover
100 percent o f the O&M cost and also enable the communities to finance replacement
cost o f the capital assets in the future. To-date, the project has completed and handed
over to the beneficiary communities 40 small town water systems. The WSDBs are
operating water systems serving less than 10,000 people with support from qualified
technical personnel with experience and the overall performance has been satisfactory.
For systems serving more than 10,000 people, however, the small towns are required to
engage local private operators to operate and manage the systems and so far, three large
systems are being operated and managed by private operators; the systems are
functioning satisfactorily.

14.     Rationale for Additional Financing. The proposed second additional IDA
Credit of US$15 million equivalent would finance: (i) cost overrun on completing 22
                                                          a
small town water supply systems and several sanitation facilities, thus enabling the
Borrower to achieve the original project objectives and outcome indicators, and (ii)
scaling up the project's impact by providing 50,000 more people in 11 additional small


                                              5

towns access to water supply facilities and increase the country's chances of meeting the
MDG.

15.     A second additional financing, instead of a third phase APL, is requested to
support scaling up the development impact of the project because of exceptional
circumstances.      The proposal is to scale up access to water and sanitation in 11
communities inthe Western, Central, Upper East and Upper East regions of the country
where services remains very low and poverty incidence high compared to the national
average. In particular, it targets districts in the Upper West and Upper East regions
suffering from water borne diseases such as guinea-worm infections. Providing water
supply and sanitation under the on-going project will mitigate the situation faster than
processing anew APL.

16.     Whereas the unit cost averaged US$40 per person for the first batch of 40 water
systems completed, the unit cost for the second batch o f 22 water systems under
construction increased sharply to US$106. This was largely due to a combination of
record high oil prices that pushed up prices of construction materials and equipment in
the local market in Ghana and the predominance of participating towns with relatively
small population sizes. The per capita costs for towns with small population sizes are
muchhigher thanfor towns with largepopulation sizes as there are fixed costs associated
with implementation of the pipedschemes regardless of size.

17.     Despite the subsequent sharp fall in global oil price, inflation has remained high,
as the depreciation of the Ghana's currency (the Cedi) has increased, pushing up prices
for imported goods. Consequently, the average unit investment cost for the 11 additional
small towns to be financed from the second additional Credit reached US$120. Despite
such increases, however, the overall average unit investment costs for this Bank-financed
operation are now at par when compared to similar donor-funded projects in the Ghana
water sector. For example, under the EU funded projects in the Central and Western
Regions, the average per capita unit cost ranges US$120-130. Annex 3 presents the
average unit costs per capita for the different batches of small-towns water supply
systems inthe participating districts.

18.     The additional financing is requested because the Government will not be able to
provide additional resources from the budget given its fiscal constraints and there are no
development partnersready to finance the cost-overrun and scaling up activities underthe
on-going IDA-fundedproject. The second additional Credit is financing 11 small towns
located inregions with low access to clean water supply comparedto the national average
and districts where the incidence of water-borne diseases (e.g. guinea-worm) attributed to
lack of water supply services is high. The CWSA has confirmed that construction of the
water supply facilities inthese towns will be completed before the Credit closing date.'




 The original Project ClosingDate was extendedfrom April 30,2009 to April 30,2010 to allow for the
completionof ongoing activities.

111.     ProposedChanges

19.      The proposed changes relate to the project's cost, financing terms, sub-project
cost sharing arrangements, Procurement Guidelines and outcome indicators. For the 11
new small towns to be financed under the proposed Additional Credit, the project
requirement that the District Assemblies and beneficiaries each contribute 5 percent of
the capital cost has been removed at the request o f the Government for equity
considerations as the selected communities in these regions have relatively low income
levels. Furthermore, because o f fiscal constraints, the Government will not be able to
provide additional budget to the Districts to meet their share o f the subproject costs and
IDAwill finance 100percent ofsubproject costs o fthe new 11small town water systems.
These agreed changes are reflected inthe Financing Agreement and will also be reflected
inarevisedProject OperationManual.

20.      Otherwise, there are no changes to the project development objectives, project
design, financial management and institutional roles and responsibilities. The current
Credit closing date o f April 30, 2010, remains unchanged. The revised project costs and
financing plan are presented in Tables 1 and 2 in Annex 1. The scaled-up project
activities being supported by the proposed additional Credit, however, would involve
changes in the outcome indicators by providing 550,000 people with water supply
facilities, (50,000 more people) compared with the original outcome target of 500,000
people.    The project's original outcome indicator of providing 50,000 people with
sanitation facilities remains unchanged. The revised outcome indicators are presented in
Annex 5.

IV.      Consistency with CAS

21.      The Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) and the MillenniumDevelopment
Goals (MDGs) identified rural water supply and sanitation as priority areas. The CAS
identifies water and sanitation as part of the humandevelopment pillar, one o f the three
pillars underpinning the Bank's strategic response to GPRS. The small Towns Water
Supply and Sanitation Project is one o f the three water sector operations contributing to
the overall water sector effort to accelerate access to water and sanitation services,
keeping inview the need to achieve the MDG. The objective o f the original APL was to
extend the coverage o f sustainable water and sanitation facilities inthe rural communities
and small towns and support the Government o f Ghana (GoG) to reachthe MDGtarget.
By extending the coverage to additional 50,000 people, the scaled-up project activity is
consistent with the overall APL objective. The outcome o f this additional financing will
enable the CAS objectives regarding water and sanitation delivery to be fully realized.
The important contribution water and sanitation play in achieving other MDG targets
including reduction ininfant and under-five mortality rates and enhancing the enrollment
rate of girls inbasic school can not be over emphasized.

V.       EconomicAnalysis of Cost Overrunand Scaled-upActivities

22.      The project is re-appraised taking into account the cost overruns and cost of
scaled-up project activities financed by the proposed additional credit. The economic
analysis is based on the methodology and financial parameters laid out in the original


                                             7

project PAD, and the Project Paper for the first additional Credit with some changes as
specified below:

             The number o f direct beneficiaries in the participating small towns i s
             specified as 550,000 people an increase of 50,000 compared with figures
                                            -
             used for the economic analysis o f the first additional Credit. The population
             inthese small towns is expected to increase at the rate o f 3 percent per year
             to reach in fifteen-year time 825,000 people. The water systems built are
             designed to accommodate this expansion and in the near future, the system
             will operate in conditions of under capacity, particularly the pumps. Safe
             yield o f boreholes, pipelines and storage tanks are designed in terms o f the
             future population. These are the same parameters laid out inthe PAD.

             Costs included in the economic analysis are original costs and additional
             cost o f funding 73 small-town water systems, O&M and replacement costs.
             Costs not directly associated with the provision o f water supply systems in
             these towns, such as technical assistance and capacity building in the water
             and sanitation sector, and cost o f sanitation facilities are not included in the
             economic analysis.

             Benefits are revenues from sales o f incremental water supply in 73 small
             towns financed from the original investment and scaled up facilities and also
             consumer surplus ( i.e. an increase inwater consumption and willingness to
             pay by households with private connections to the new water systems) that
             would result in enhanced welfare to these families. The additional welfare
             to families taking water from standpipes i s not included in the assessment.
             Furthermore, the economic value o f the indirect benefit - such as time
             saved, reliable water supply, better water quality and improved health from
             using newly constructed water facilities cannot be estimated with the
             available information and are not included inthe cost-benefit analysis.

             Water tariff at standpipes and private household connections paid in these
             small towns represent the actual rates paid by water users and are
             significantly higher than was estimated during appraisal. At standpipes,
             beneficiaries pay US$O.S5/m3 (33 percent higher compared to US$0.64/m3
             estimated at appraisal). The tarifffor households with private connections is
             20 percent higher thanthe standpipe price.

23.    The project remains economically viable in the face o f recurrent cost-overruns
largely due to increase inbenefits for the additional 50,000 people in 11 small towns that
will get access to water supply facilities financed by the second additional Credit. The
additional benefits are due to: (i)   increase in the quantity o f water consumed (about
365,000 m3 per year), (ii)  increase inthe revenue from sales o f incremental water due to
a higher water tariff charged at standpipes and households compared to appraisal
estimates, and (iii)additional welfare to households taking water from private
connections. The cost-benefit is shown inTable 5 inAnnex 4. With these parameters, the
revised economic rate o f return o f the project is estimated at 12 percent, a slight decrease
fiom about 13 percent estimated duringthe first additional financing.



                                              8

VI.     ExpectedOutcomes

24.     The project would provide: (i)   550,000 people with water supply facilities, a
50,000 increase in the targeted population in 11 towns, compared to 500,000 people
projected in the PAD; and (ii)   50,000 people with sanitary facilities. In addition, the
project will report on the IDA Tier 1 Indicator for Infrastructure Development related to
water supply. This indicator is the "proportion of population with sustainable access to
an improved water sources". This indicator is already being monitored by the respective
national water sector institutions with support from a number of development partners
aimed at strengthening institutional capacity for monitoring andharmonizing sector M&E
systems.

VII.    BenefitsandRisks

25.     Benefits. The project would increase access to small-towns water supply and
sanitation services in six regions by the project closing date, providing 550,000 people
with water supply facilities and 50,000 people with sanitary facilities. The project, thus,
contributes to enhancing the country's progress towards achieving the MDG target of 76
percent coverage for water by 2015.

26.     Risks. The overall risk rating remains modest in the face of successive cost-
overruns. Potential risks and mitigation measures are: (i)   delays in completion of the
additional 11 water supply systems, and (ii) cost-overruns during the remaining
                                               further
12 months of project implementation. The risk of delays i s considered to be low because
the preparatory work including technical design, and the process of tendering and bid
evaluation has already been completed. The District Assemblies are ready to award
contractsand launch implementation inthe new 11small towns. These small towns are in
the same regions and of similar scale as those in the second batch of 22 water supply
systems under implementation where the CWSA has gained valuable experience. The
CWSA will hire consultants to closely monitor contractors and ensure timely completion
of the water supply and sanitation facilities. The risk of further cost overrun i s low
because the investment costs for the construction of 11 small town water supply systems
are actual figures derived fiom latest tender prices for these towns. As a price
contingency, the project has allocated adequate funds in the event of an increase in
contract prices during the next 12 months of implementation. Project management has
confirmed that the original project activities and those financed under the additional
Credit would be completed before the closing date of April 30, 2010.

VIII. FinancialTerms andConditionsfor AdditionalCredit

27.     The second additional Credit would be provided on blendedIDA terms repayable
over a 35-year maturity with a 10-year graceperiod.

         ANNEX 6: FINANCIALMANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
                                    ARRANGEMENTS


Introduction

1.      In line with the guidelines as stated in the Financial Management Practices
Manual issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on November 3, 2005, a
financial management assessment was conducted on the Community Water and
Sanitation Agency (CWSA). The purpose of the assessment was part of the requirement
for qualifying for additional financing. The assessment covered a review of the key
financial management systems and also focused on desk reviews of the IFR and annual
audit reports.

2.      The existing financial management arrangementshave been used for the project
since inception in2004 andhave been found to be satisfactory. The latest FMsupervision
report and ISR rating was done in November 2008, and rated as satisfactory. This
supervision report forms the basis of the current assessment. Overall, an assessment of
the financial managementarrangements at the implementing agency concludesthat there
are systems in place that satisfy the Bank's minimum requirements under OPh3P10.02,
andoverall financial managementrisk ratingis rated as modest.

CountryIssues

3.      Ghana's fiduciary environment for utilizing bothbudgetary funds and donor funds
i s considered adequate. The June 2007 ERPFM noted that the Government continues to
make encouraging progress in implementing its wide ranging program o f strengthening
public financial management (PFM) through adoption of the Short-Term and Medium-
Term Action Plan (ST/MT AP. Budget formulation has been improved by revising the
budget timetable to enable earlier tabling of Estimates and thus the passage of the
Appropriations Bill prior to the start of the new financial year, with a view of allowing a
more orderly implementation of spending plans. There is now increased consultation
with stakeholders in budget formulation, more comprehensive information in budget
documents, and encouragement of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to
undertake procurement planning for use as abasis for financial planning andbudgeting.

4.      Recent PFM reviews notes the Government's continuing efforts to improve the
commitment control system to strengthen cash management and facilitate payments
through decentralized treasuries. Key challenges do remain inthe predictability of flows
to MMDAs and releases by the CAGD and these impacts on the pace o f budget
execution. Financial statements of the Consolidated Fund and o f MDAs are current and
audited, but delays continue with regard to public enterprises and other statutory bodies,
as well as that of other statutory funds. The InternalAudit Agency (IAA)was established
by the Internal Audit Agency Act, 2003 with the objective to coordinate, facilitate and
provide quality assurance for internal audit activities withinMDAs andMMDAs.




                                             18

5.      Concerning external audit, the Ghana Audit Service (GAS) continues to show
progress in clearing the backlog of audits and submitting the audited annual accounts
prior to the statutory deadline of 30 June, withthe final 2005 Consolidated Fundaccounts
completed on time.

6.      Insum, as partofthe overall publicsectorreforms, the GoGaims at strengthening
central government structures and institutions by introducing programs to make them
more efficient and effective through legislation and other reforms. Recent PFM laws
including the Financial Administration Act of 2003, the Internal Audit Agency Act of
2003 and the Public Procurement Act of 2003, have been enacted and enforced to help
regulate the use of public funds. GoG has also demonstrated its commitment to
continuing its PFM reforms by developing more efficient public financial management
systems, and ensuring transparency by strengthening state oversight institutions including
the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament which has recently been holding public
hearings on instances of financial irregularities and allegations o f fraud and corruption.

ProjectFinancialManagementArrangements

7.      The project will be executed by the Community Water and Sanitation Agency
(CWSA) which has in place an effective and functioning financial management system
with an adequate mix of technical and non-technical staff to ensure smooth
implementation. Based on periodic supervisions and reviews of the control environment,
the conclusion is that there are effective internal controls that seek to prevent fraud, waste
and mismanagementof its operations. The existing systems and funds flow mechanism
which have been used for implementation of the first two phases of the project will be
relied on for implementing the current additional financing.

Summary

8.      A summary of the key findings of the financial management assessment is
presentedas follows:

9.      Budgeting. The budgeting arrangementsare satisfactory and derive from the IDA
allocations which serve as a basis for preparing the annual work plan incorporating the
activities to be undertaken by the regions and the sub-projects (district and community
water projects). The budgeting process is documented in the Bank approved Project
Operational Manual (POM). Individual work plans, procurement plans and budgets are
collated and consolidated at the CWSA headquartersand reviewedjointly by key project
staff. The major challenge has been in contract management and project implementation
which leads to delays, contract variations, and extensions indicating that project
managementremains a critical link inachieving the PDOs.

10.     Accounting. The finance department of CWSA is headed by the financial
controller who is a qualified charteredaccountant with relevant years of experience and i s
supported by a team of four accounting staff o f varying qualifications and competence.
Each of the CWSA regional offices is adequately staffed with accounts and budget
officers who report to the financial controller and are familiar with IDA financial




                                              19

management arrangements and reporting requirements. Interms o f accounting systems,
CWSA uses Navision Accounting and a combination o f spread sheets and manual
systems and follows a Bank approved Accounting Manual which documents the
processes for initiating, recording and reporting transactions. Our assessment based on
previous supervision missions notes that the accounting function i s adequate and has
satisfactorily supported implementation though there are observable weaknesses in
technical capacity at the district levels.

11.      Internal Auditing. There is a functioning internal audit department within the
CWSA which i s mandated with ensuring that the control environment is adequate and
procedures for transaction processing authorization and approvals are adhered to at all
levels o f implementation. The processes for internal controls are documented in an
auditing manual. Quite recently, management has formed an Audit Review and
Implementation Committee to ensure compliance and also to follow up on the report o f
boththe internal and external auditors. Members are also assigned with the responsibility
o f implementing corrective actions and deficiencies ininternal controls.

12.      Financial Reporting. As part o f the financial covenants the project is required to
prepare and submit, on a quarterly basis, interim financial management reports incontent
and format satisfactory to the Bank. The accounting and information management
systems are robust and reliable in generating such reports. Over the period o f
implementation, the project has fully complied with this covenant though there are times
where there are delays inthe timeliness. The delays are because the CWSA headquarters
have to rely on expenditure returns from the regional and district offices to consolidate
for reporting purposes. To address this weakness, standard reporting templates have been
designed and these reports'are adequate and have the necessary supporting schedules and
attachments.

13.      Funds Flow Arrangements. Project activities and expenditure are mostly at the
sub-project and district levels and as such the funds flow mechanism has been designed
to support implementation at those levels. Although implementation is at the district
level, the designated accounts are maintained and managed at headquarters from where
further transfers are made directly to the district offices with the regional offices being
notified to help in monitoring. As part o f the revised arrangement for funds flow it has
been agreed that the Project will open separate DesignatedAccounts inUS dollars for the
additional funding whilst the existing Designated Account will be used for the original
credit and the first additional credit. The funds flow arrangements for transfers to
subprojects and districts have been documented inthe P O M which has been approved by
the Bank.

14.      Inbrief, the processes oftransfer as documented inthe POMcan be summarized
as follows: once the procurement process for award o f contract is completed at the
district, the Districts sign a Sub Project Agreement (SPA) with CWSA. Upon signing o f
the SPA, the CWSA transfers 40 percent (advance) o f the total contract value to the
District Water and Sanitation Accounts maintained by the District Assemblies. District
Assemblies then undertake the project and, after spending at least 70 percent o f the initial
advance, submit a claim with adequate supporting documentation to the CWSA Regional

office. The documents and returns are reviewed and verified by the Regional offices and
subsequently submitted to the national CWSA office for further processing and
replenishment to the District Water and Sanitation Accounts. However unlike the
arrangement under the original credit where the first tranche was released to district
assemblies upon the basis of satisfactory evidence o f availability o f district contributions
i.e. 5 percent community and 5 percent District Assemblies funding, this is no longer a
requirement due to a decision taken by the new Government. In conclusion the review
noted that the funds flow arrangements currently inplace are satisfactory and do not lead
to delays or lapses incontrol and can be relied on for the additional financing.

15.     External Auditing. Throughout implementation CWSA has fully complied with
the financial management covenant o f ensuring that project funds are periodically audited
by auditors satisfactory to the Bank. The audit report for the year ended December 2006
was received by the Bank on June 29,2007, and that for the year ending December 2007
was submitted on June 27, 2008, within the six months period after the end o f the fiscal
year and incompliance with the provision o f the DCA, Article IV Section 4.01 (b) (ii).     In
both periods the auditors' expressed an unqualified opinion on the financial statements
anddesignated accounts.


Conclusion

16.     In summary, based on supervision missions, review of financial statements and
audit reports the conclusion is that financial management arrangements at CWSA are
adequate and satisfactory and meet the minimum requirement as per Bank policy.
Generally, at the country level the inherent risks are rated as modest due to challenges in
budget implementation and accountability, at the project level risks are rated as
substantial primarily because o f the community based approach o f implementation but
overall the project control risk particularly at headquarters is rated as modest.
