Sanitation Project. The additional\n            financing will: (i) finance un-anticipated cost overruns in\n            community water supply and sanitation subprojects and\n            enables the Borrower to complete the remaining project\n            activities and achieve the original development objectives;\n            and (ii) support scaling-up the project's impact and\n            expand access to water supply services and enhance the\n            possibility of meeting the millennium development goal (MDG)\n            target. The additional financing is requested because the\n            Government will not be able to provide additional resources\n            from the budget given its fiscal constraints and there are\n            no development partners ready to finance the cost-overrun\n            and scaling up activities under the on-going International\n            Development Association (IDA)-funded project. The second\n            additional credit is financing 11 small towns located in\n            regions with low access to clean water supply compared to\n            the national average and districts where the incidence of\n            water-borne diseases attributed to lack of water supply\n            services is high."}, "docdt": "2009-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
