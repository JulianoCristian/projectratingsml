The project built\n            on lessons learned from the first Community Water and\n            Sanitation Project (CWSP1,) and adopted a large-scale\n            decentralization approach in the planning, implementation\n            and management of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services\n            in Ghana. The development objective of the CWSP2 was to\n            increase access and achieve effective and sustained use of\n            improved community WSS services in villages and small towns\n            in four regions in Ghana.
