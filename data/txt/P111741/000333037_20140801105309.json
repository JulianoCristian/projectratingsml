Some lessons learned\n            included: notwithstanding these positive elements, the\n            channeling of non-performance based investment funds to the\n            same municipalities risks weakening the performance\n            incentive and making transaction cost to access MDP funds\n            appear high. For this reason parallel funding should be\n            reduced and over time limited to major investments. A more\n            explicit consensus on a timeframe for aligning donors to a\n            performance-based mechanism and transition to a\n            preponderantly PA-funded transfer system will help assure\n            the integrity of the system and transition process. The\n            delicate balance between performance incentives and\n            investment financing should be resolved more explicitly from\n            a policy perspective, since the success of a\n            performance-based grant system as an incentive tool to\n            implement national policies depends on alignment and\n            attaining critical mass. Municipalities can be successfully\n            supported to incorporate economic efficiency considerations\n            into investment decisions through introduction of simple\n            screening tools and well-targeted pilot activities in energy\n            conservation. Economic reasoning and screening of\n            investments supported by standardized modeling in Excel can\n            encourage development of least-cost solutions and designs\n            for investments in improved service delivery, leading to\n            high rates of return. Further, energy efficiency investments\n            are financially and technically feasible in the WBG. With a\n            simple payback time of just over two years, these\n            investments have the potential to improve municipal finances\n            substantially and to reduce 'net lending'. The\n            positive results have led to the energy efficiency\n            investments being mainstreamed into window one of MDP-I and\n            introduction of a new renewable energy pilot."}, "docdt": "2014-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
