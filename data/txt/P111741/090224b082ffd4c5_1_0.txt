        IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of
lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20–25 percent of the Bank’s lending
operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative,
large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors
or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower for
review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers’ comments are attached
to the document that is sent to the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the
Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
      IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their
project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is
available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s objectives are
consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector
Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project’s design is consistent
with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is
expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to
alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome:
Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High, Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition
arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for
Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward
the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the following two projects in
the West Bank and Gaza (financed through trust funds administered by the World Bank):

          The Second Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP II)
           was approved on December 19, 2006 and closed on June 30, 2011 after a two-
           year extension. The World Bank Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank (TFGWB)
           financed the project for the total amount of US$13 million, including Additional
           Financing (AF) of US$3 million signed on July 14, 2009. The project was also
           financed by the Swedish International Development Assistance (SIDA) (US$8.62
           million) and the Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA)
           (US$5.22 million)—both through trust funds administered by the World Bank.
           Parallel financing was provided by the Netherlands (US$6.17 million), the
           German Development Bank (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau [KfW]) (US$20.71
           million) and the French Development Agency (Agence Française de
           Développement [AFD]) (US$16.57 million).

          The Municipal Development Program—Phase I (MDP I) was approved on
           September 17, 2009. The closing date was extended by four months from April
           30, 2013 to August 30, 2013.The project was financed by the TFGWB for a total
           of US$12 million, including AF of US$2 million signed on March 14, 2012. The
           project was also financed with a multi-donor trust fund from DANIDA and SIDA
           administered by the World Bank (US$13.48 million) which was supplemented
           with AF of US$12.21 million. Parallel financing was provided from AFD
           (US$11.82 million), KfW (US$22.0 million), and Belgium (US$1.28 million).
The World Bank, KfW, and AFD closely cooperated during the conception and
implementation of MDP I. In 2014, the evaluation department of KfW discussed with the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) the prospect of conducting a joint ex post evaluation to
continue the cooperation between the development banks and to jointly learn from the MDP I
experience. IEG scheduled a joint mission with AFD and KfW. IEG selected EMSPR II
along with MDP I to verify project results and assess sustainability of these projects. The
PPAR will feed into IEG reviews on project implementation in conflict affected areas and on
projects involving donor coordination and contributions.

The joint mission met with officials from the Ministry of Local Government (MOLG) and
the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) as well as local municipal officials
and project staff in both the West Bank and Gaza. The mission also met with the
representatives of other donors that participated in the project, including Sweden and the
Netherlands. The IEG mission with KfW and AFD undertook field visits to 14 municipalities
in West Bank and four municipalities in Gaza and observed the quality and use of roads,
public facilities, and other works financed through the two projects. These visits gave the
mission an opportunity to engage directly with the beneficiaries of the projects.

The IEG acknowledges the attention and cooperation provided by local interlocutors and the
excellent planning and support provided by the MDLF, local governments, and the Bank’s
                                              vi


country office in Jerusalem. A list of municipalities visited and the persons met by the
mission are included in Annexes B and C, respectively.

Following IEG procedures, the draft report was sent to the government officials and agencies
for their reviews and comments and no comments were received.

Summary
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for two projects in the West Bank
and Gaza financed through trust funds administered by the World Bank1 namely: (i) the
Second Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project (EMSRP II), and (ii) the
Municipal Development Program—Phase I (MDP I). The two projects are part of a series of
projects funded by the World Bank and development partners that aims to improve municipal
management and municipal. These efforts were preceded by the First Emergency Municipal
Services Project (completed in March 2006) with the establishment of a Municipal
Development Lending Fund which had among its aims to introduce a mechanism to link
central and local government budgetary planning processes, enhance mobilization of donor
assistance, and improve the efficiency and equity of resource transfers to local governments.
These efforts have continued with the ongoing second Municipal Development Program
(MDP II). The objectives of these efforts have transitioned from emergency responses to war
destruction (EMSRP I and II), toward improving municipal management (MDP I) and
municipal services (MDP II). Ultimately the intention is to improve creditworthiness of the
larger and more capable municipalities in the future.

Second Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project
The objectives of this project were to: (i) provide assistance for mitigating further
deterioration in the delivery of essential municipal services in West Bank and Gaza; (ii)
create job opportunities at the local level; and (iii) promote pilot initiatives that foster
collaboration among local governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and
promote municipal cost recovery. The objectives continue to be highly relevant to the
Palestinian National Development Plan (2014–2016) and the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy (2015–2016) both of which focus on governance, institution building infrastructure,
and employment.
The project design was highly relevant to the objectives and aimed to finance municipal
infrastructure services, while creating jobs and undertaking initiatives to foster local
government and nongovernmental organization (NGO) collaboration. Financing prepaid
electric meters was included in the project in order to enhance collection efficiency and
improve cost recovery. The project also financed much needed non-wage operational costs of
municipalities such as fuel and spare parts to enable operation of existing equipment and
infrastructure and to deliver essential services.
The project undertook rehabilitation activities to avoid deterioration of infrastructure such as
roads and water supply. According to the beneficiary satisfaction survey, citizens were fairly
satisfied with the services provided by municipalities. Had these sub-project investments not
been undertaken to improve solid waste services and rehabilitate buildings, roads, water, and
sanitation lines, this infrastructure would have further deteriorated and services to
communities would have been downgraded.

 This includes the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank (TFGWB) and the multi-donor trust fund
(SIDA and DANIDA).
                                              viii


The project assisted in the creation of job opportunities at the local level. Labor intensive
activities were used in several municipal small projects, including digging culverts,
construction of retaining walls, roads and drainage. The project had positive outcomes with
respect to benefits for the community including for women and children. However, it was
noted that for several of the facilities, the municipality built the buildings (community
centers) and handed them to the NGOs for operation with modest impact on long term
government/NGO collaboration through the project. Municipalities were satisfied with
energy efficiency sub-projects such as streetlights and pre-paid meters; the latter (funded by
German Development Bank) contributed significantly to improved collection of revenues
from electricity. However, parking meters that were funded by the trust funds administered
by the World Bank were not operational.
The overall outcome of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The risk to
development outcome is rated Significant. Bank Performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

The Municipal Development Project – Phase I (MDP I)
The objective of this project was to improve municipal management practices for better
transparency. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) goes on to say that “this is a necessary
condition for improving service delivery in subsequent phases.” The objectives continue to
be highly relevant to the Palestinian National Development Plan (2014–2016) and the Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy (2015–2016) which focus on governance, institution building
and infrastructure. The project addresses these through institution building and the
strengthening of governance in municipalities and national sector agencies, and through
improvements in infrastructure and service provision.
The design of the project was highly relevant to the achievement of the objective. The project
financed municipal infrastructure investments such as roads, water, waste-water, solid waste,
and public buildings in order to improve services. Capacity building supported municipalities
in their reform efforts and strengthened national institutions (Ministry of Local Government
and the Municipal Development and Lending Fund) as well as local institutions
(municipalities and local communities) in the conduct of their operations and development of
projects and policies.
The achievement of the objective of improving municipal management practices for better
transparency is rated substantial as 96 percent of the municipalities have graduated to a
higher performance level based on the performance criteria developed under the project.
About 70 percent of the municipalities are applying at least two public disclosure methods
such as municipal budgets, strategic development plans, or external audits. The overall
outcome of the project is rated Satisfactory. The risk to development outcome is rated
Significant. Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory. Borrower Performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

Lessons
The main lessons are:
    A common donor approach to project design and implementation can yield
     positive results by utilizing and strengthening the same implementing agency, using
     a consistent results framework, aligning fiduciary and safeguards requirements, using
     similar criteria in selecting and implementing projects, and conducting joint
     supervision missions. In the case of MDP I, this approach avoided duplication of the
     efforts of the implementing agency and provided a common platform through a sector
     steering committee to agree on reform and next steps. Working through multiple
     institutional players can enhance policy and operational outcomes, but requires
     upfront that mechanisms are developed to formalize institutional partnerships with
     clearly defined common targets and timetables.
    The programmatic approach used in the Municipal Development Program
     allows for the evolution of effective reform solutions through identifying needs in
     road management, designing and implementing capacity building efforts, and
     learning from experience. The design and implementation of MDP I was adjusted
     based on lessons learned from the EMSRP II, and the results, measured through
     indicators, were improved.
    The inability to combine resources of the many financing partners can adversely
     affect the size of projects and the composition of the sub-projects. In the case of
     MDP I, this led to a concentration of funds in the roads sector, where investments
     could be modular, but conversely this led to the funding of projects that were not
     necessarily the first priority to the communities. Numerous small projects tend to
     strain the capacities of the Municipal Development and Lending Fund and its staff.
     On the other hand, smaller funds and stricter access may deter the larger
     municipalities from seeking further funding.
    Use of local codes, materials, and experiences in building roads instead of
     internationally accepted technical standards lowers costs, but can also
     compromise quality. The lack of standard materials in the case of Gaza led to local
     innovation in use of local material; rubble was made into brick like shapes
     (interloctyles). However, the life of these materials is unknown. The Technical Audit
     and Usability Assessment prepared under MDP I highlighted the reasons for the low
     costs for roads construction, including reliance on experience rather than technical
     specifications and codes, as well as using lower standards.

1. Background and Context
Country Context
1.1    The West Bank and Gaza, referred to as the Palestinian Territories, are
noncontiguous geographical entities. The West Bank is on the western bank of the Jordan
River. The Gaza Strip lies on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and borders the Arab
Republic of Egypt on the southwest and Israel on the south, east, and north. The
population in the West Bank is about 2.5 million, and in Gaza it is about 1.5 million.2
During the period 2001–2009, the real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the
West Bank had fallen 10 percent below its 1999 level. In Gaza, real GDP per capita was
40 percent below the 1999 level.3

1.2     During 2007 to 2011, the economy sustained an average annual growth rate of 8
percent. The decline started in 2012 when the overall growth rate dropped to 6 percent.
Growth rates declined further to 1.9 percent in 2013 and 0.4 percent in 2014.4 The recent
slowdown has been reflected in higher unemployment levels. For the West Bank,
unemployment was 17.4 percent and for Gaza 43 percent. Youth unemployment (15 to 29
years) is very high—overall 39.5 percent, West Bank (25.3 percent), and Gaza (63.3
percent).5

1.3     In recent years, the Palestinian Authority has succeeded in reducing the recurrent
budget deficit, from 23.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 14.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to 11.9
percent in 2014. The improvement in revenue was driven mostly by strong growth in
clearance revenue from Israel (20 percent), rise in fuel VAT and excise revenue
collection, and stepped-up tax administration efforts to reduce under-invoicing.6 The
Palestinian Authority has been making efforts to strengthen domestic revenue
performance, and is adopting a number of short-term measures and some structural
reforms to improve efficiency and sustainability of public spending. Domestic revenue
underperformed, declining by 15 percent, despite improved collection efforts. The
authorities resorted to about $200 million of new borrowing from domestic banks and
accumulated wage and non-wage arrears.

1.4     Notwithstanding fiscal reforms, the entire Palestinian economy will require
sustained, substantial, and predictable donor aid. Donor support accounts for more than
one-third of budgeted income. Donor support fell sharply, by 19 percent, in 2014 to
US$1.2 billion, or about 80 percent of the total projected official donor support for the
year. As a result, overall debt including arrears reached an estimated 39 percent of GDP.
2
  For the West Bank, the latest census (2007) was conducted by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics
(PCBS). Gaza the figures are from the earlier census (1997). PCBS estimates the population in 2014 at 4.6
million in the Palestinian Territories, with 2.8 million in the West Bank and 1.8 million in Gaza.

A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas ended last summer’s war of August
2014. Meanwhile, blockade of Gaza in terms of restrictions placed on the movement of
goods and people between Gaza and Israel, and the closure of the Rafah crossing by
Egypt, remains in place.7

Sector Context
1.5     The Palestinian population is largely urban with 74 percent living in 135
municipalities. Municipalities, which existed prior to the establishment of the Palestinian
Authority, have a clear role as the local level of governance, representation, and
accountability for citizens. Municipal councils are elected, and the last election took place
in October 2012. Municipal governments face profound challenges in meeting their
responsibilities. Budgets have been shrinking due to the ongoing conflict and a culture of
nonpayment among users—thus eroding the coverage and quality of municipal services.
Although municipalities can access 17 revenue sources, collections are volatile. West
Bank municipalities saw a 15 percent decline in revenues between 2010 and 2011.8
Although property tax collection has increased, its use as an intercept by the Ministry of
Finance to offset municipal water and electricity debt makes it difficult for municipalities
to use it as a reliable source of income. Consequently, although municipalities are
required to provide basic services within 27 functions mandated by law, only three
functions (i.e., solid waste management, street maintenance and water supply) are
consistently provided by the majority of municipalities. The municipalities chronically
suffer from deficits and accumulation of arrears. Forty-four percent of West Bank
municipalities and 70 percent of Gaza municipalities incurred deficits on average during
2008–2011.9

1.6     On the other hand, the Palestinian Authority and municipalities have
demonstrated significant progress in municipal and local development. In 2005, the
Palestinian Authority established the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF)
to address financing and capacity building of municipalities. Established by a ministerial
decree, the MDLF has the legal mandate to provide development assistance to
municipalities through transparent, rules-based, and efficient financing. The Palestinian
Authority, through the MDLF, and with the support of donors, implemented several
municipal reforms with the support of donor financed projects including the Local
Government Capacity Building Project and Emergency Municipal Services
Rehabilitation Projects I and II. In 2009, the Palestinian Authority developed the
Municipal Development Program (MDP) which was supported by seven donors to
operationalize the local government goals of the Palestinian Reform and Development
Plan, which is to strengthen local government through greater fiscal and administrative
autonomy. The ongoing phase II (MDP II) will consolidate the MDLF’s experience in
performance-based grant programs. Practical achievements of the Palestinian Authority
in the sector include the development of a unified chart of accounts and standard budget

guidelines. All municipalities now report their budgets yearly to the Ministry of Local
Government. Fixed Assets Registration guidelines have been issued and implemented in
at least 32 municipalities, a Financial Policies and Procedures Manual has been
developed and is being used in at least 96 municipalities; and nearly 84 municipalities
have prepared Strategic Development and Investment Plans (SDIPs) in an effort to
prioritize investments over the medium term. Furthermore, an Integrated Financial
Management Information System was piloted in 33 municipalities. Since 2008, the
Ministry of Finance, supported by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency and the
Danish International Development Agency has been rolling out a program to improve
property tax collection.

1.7     The main objective of the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) is
to encourage the flow of financial resources from the Palestinian Authority and various
donors to the Palestinian local government units and other local public entities to improve
the delivery of local infrastructure and municipal services, to promote economic
development, and improve municipal efficiency and accountability. The MDLF is
mandated to provide municipalities, village councils, local councils, joint services
councils, municipally controlled institutions, and local government units with improved
financial products and services, and access to capital markets. The MDLF aims to
enhance mobilization of donor assistance, strengthen intergovernmental financial
transfers and promote emergency response capacity.

Bank and Partner Involvement in the Municipal Sector in West Bank
and Gaza
1.8     The World Bank’s engagement in West Bank and Gaza is directed primarily
through the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank (TFGWB), which was established in
1993 following the signing of the Oslo Accords.10 The trust fund was created as the
technical solution to the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza, since only sovereign
states are eligible for membership of the World Bank and to receive direct Bank
financing. The Bank’s assistance from the TFGWB leverages substantial complementary
resources from donors. In recent years, the TFGWB has annually been replenished by
$55 million from the surplus of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD). Investment grants from this trust fund leverage substantial (3.8
times) project financing from development partners.11

1.9     The composition of the World Bank’s lending portfolio to the West Bank and
Gaza has changed over time. When it first engaged in the mid-1990s, the Bank financed
primarily infrastructure projects before devoting its attention to employment generating
projects in 1996 in response to Israel’s border closures. Since 2000, however, the Bank
has increasingly financed projects on an emergency basis as the situation in West Bank
and Gaza deteriorated. By the end of the 2000s, the Bank was mostly concerned about the

financial aspects of the municipalities, especially the transparency of their operations and
the efficiency of their expenditures.

1.10 Funding partners agreed with the Palestinian national authorities to work together
on a program to sustain the capacities of municipalities to provide the necessary
municipal services. These efforts were initiated in the First Emergency Municipal
Services Project (completed in March 2006) which had among its aims to introduce a
mechanism to link central and local government budgetary planning processes, enhance
mobilization of donor assistance, and improve the efficiency and equity of resource
transfers to local governments. The Local Government Capacity Building Project focused
on the capacity of the local governments.

1.11 The Bank’s advice was critical in the establishment of the Municipal
Development Fund (MDF) in 2003, and its subsequent transformation into the Municipal
Development and Lending Fund in 2005. The MDF was established to “induce local
governments to increase revenue collection, adopt sound accounting practices, improve
spending management and boost accountability and reporting.” According to an IEG
report “Prior to the creation of the MDF/MDLF, Bank advice rarely led to any action,
partly because of institutional weakness in the Ministry of Local Government.12

1.12 These efforts continued with the approval of the two-phased Municipal
Development program. MDP I has closed while the second Municipal Development
Project (MDP II) is ongoing. The objectives of these efforts have moved from emergency
response to destruction from the war (EMSRP I and II), to improving municipal
management (MDP I), to improving municipal services (MDP II) and ultimately to
improving credit worthiness in the larger and more capable municipalities in the future.

1.13 An IEG mission, joined by AFD and KfW, visited the West Bank and Gaza in
2015 from January 26 to February 8 to review the two projects (ESMRP II and MDP I)
results in the field and to hold discussions with government officials and other
stakeholders. The joint mission provided an opportunity for exchanging information and
ideas among the development partners, and the government appreciated this joint
approach. KfW financed and shared an Empirical Impact Assessment Study to validate
the outcome of MDP I. AFD’s mission was an inception mission, and a report of the
initial findings was shared with the Bank and KfW. AFD will undertake a follow-up
mission to complete the assessment, which will include case studies in selected
municipalities.

1.14 On February 10, 2015, KfW hosted a workshop in Frankfurt to discuss the
outcome of the joint mission. At the outset, it was agreed that each institution will
prepare its own final evaluation report. This PPAR is the assessment by the Bank of the
two projects and is based on a review of project documents including Implementation
Completion and Results Reports, PADs, legal documents, and other documents relevant
to the project as well as discussions held with Bank staff and counterparts involved in the
projects.

2. Second Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation
Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVES

2.1     The objectives of the Second Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation
Project (EMSRP II) as laid out in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement, Schedule 1, are to:

          Provide assistance for mitigating further deterioration in the delivery of
           essential municipal services in the West Bank and Gaza;

          Create temporary job opportunities at the local level; and

          Promote pilot initiatives that foster collaboration among local governments
           and NGOs and promote municipal cost recovery.

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.2     The overall relevance of objectives is rated High. The first Interim Strategy for
West Bank and Gaza was for the period FY08–10 and was dated March 2008, that is after
the project’s approval in December 2006. The three-year Palestinian Reform and
Development Plan (PRDP 2008–2010), assigns resources to priorities in governance,
economic and private sector development, social development and infrastructure. The
Bank Group’s strategy is organized into four pillars to support the Palestinian Authorities
efforts to: (i) improve governance and support fiscal reform; (ii) support human
development in health, education, and social safety nets; (iii) support economic and
private sector development; and (iv) support public infrastructure development.

2.3     The project objectives were highly relevant to the Palestinian National
Development Plan 2011–2013 (PNDP) which focuses on strengthening local governance
and service provision, and on creating employment and providing services by
municipalities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The strategy links
unemployment with poverty and outlines the intent of the Palestinian Authority to
address the unemployment problem. The Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (FY12–14) dated
March 2012 supports the PNDP with its emphasis on strengthening public administration.
It recognizes the role of local governments in service delivery and in being responsive to
users’ needs. The strategy also recognizes in two of its outcomes the importance of
enhancing the labor market and increasing the sustainability of infrastructure.

2.4      The project objectives remain highly relevant to the current Bank Country
Assistance Strategy (2015–2016) which is aligned with the new Palestinian National
Development Plan (NDP) (FY14–16). Both strategies focus on good governance and
institution building, social protection, economic development, employment, and
infrastructure. Reflecting the Palestinian Authorities priorities outlined in the NDP, the
two pillars of the Bank’ current strategy are: (i) strengthen the institutions of a future
                                            6


state to ensure service delivery to citizens, aligned with the governance and institution
building, and social protection themes of the NDP; and (ii) support private sector led
growth that increases employment opportunities, aligned with the economic development
and employment, and infrastructure components of the NDP. The project’s objectives
focusing on employment and infrastructure are aligned with the Bank’s and the
Palestinian’s latest strategies.

DESIGN

2.6    The project included the following four components:

Component 1: Emergency Municipal Services Assistance Grants: (Original cost
US$29.7 million; Revised cost US$60.70 million; Actual cost US$61.05 million). This
component finances: (i) rehabilitation, reconstruction, and upgrading of damaged
municipal infrastructure and facilities as well as the supply of equipment to sustain
municipal service provision; and (ii) non-wage recurrent expenditures as direct inputs to
the provision of essential municipal services for up to two years.

Component 2: Labor Intensive Employment Generation. (Original cost US$6.10
million; Revised cost US$3.10 million; Actual cost US$3.08 million). This component
finances temporary labor intensive employment sub-projects that are identified and
implemented by municipalities in coordination with locally based community groups.

Component 3: MDLF Innovation window. (Original and Revised cost US$1.20
million; Actual cost US$0.91 million). This component consists of (i) piloting prepaid
electricity metering systems, financing the purchase of over 3,500 new meters,
administrative systems and technical assistance; and (ii) piloting local government-NGO
collaboration for emergency and other joint programming purposes to encourage greater
coordination and joint programming by local governments and NGOs through joint
funding proposals.

Component 4: Project Management costs. (Original cost US$3.2 million; Revised cost
US$5.19 million; Actual cost US$3.18 million). This component finances: (i) MDLF
management fee of 5 percent; (ii) technical assistance and monitoring, including
preparation of emergency assistance programs, technical review audit, environmental and
social safeguard reviews, training, and a beneficiary impact assessment.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.5     The overall relevance of design to achieve the objectives is rated High. Each
component was designed to correspond directly to the achievement of the project
objective. The grants for emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction are highly relevant
to bring municipal services back on line and prevent further deterioration in
infrastructure. Labor intensive activities are highly relevant to the creation of job
opportunities. Pilot sub-projects tested approaches to foster collaboration between
governments and NGOs. Cost recovery sub-projects were designed to increase revenue
collection through pre-paid electricity meters.

Planned versus Actual Costs
2.6     At appraisal, the total cost of the project was estimated at the equivalent of
US$40.2 million. This was to be financed through US$10.0 million from the TFGWB.
Parallel financing was provided by the government of the Netherlands for the amount of
US$6.3 million and the French Agency for Development (AFD) for US$14.8 million.
The residual financing gap amounted to the equivalent of US$9.1 million. No counterpart
funding was planned or provided by the government.

2.7     During implementation, the project succeeded in leveraging additional financing
beyond the identified financing gap. Additional financing from the TFGWB equivalent to
US$3.0 million was mobilized for Gaza; a Swedish Trust fund of US$8.62 million and a
Danish trust fund for US$5.22 million also contributed to the project. These trust funds
were administered by the Bank and are therefore considered as cofinancing. Parallel
financing was mobilized from AFD for the amount of US$2 million and Germany (KfW)
for US$22 million (Annex F). The final total cost of the project was $68.21 million. The
first two components were spent close to the revised estimates at 100.5 percent, while
components 3 and 4 were spent 64 percent of the allocation. Annex D provides the
comparison between allocated and actual costs.

OTHER CHANGES

2.8     Additional funding from the Bank of US$3 million was provided in July 2009 for
additional rehabilitation in Gaza after the Israeli attacks of December 2008/January 2009.
The closing date was extended by two years to June 2011 to allow for the implementation
of activities under the additional funding. The electric metering innovation sub-
component was replaced with installation of parking meters in the Ramallah area.

Implementation
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

2.9     The project was implemented by the Municipal Development and Lending Fund
(MDLF), which is an autonomous agency created by the Council of Ministers and
governed by a board of directors chaired by the Ministry of Local Government with
members from the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Public Works, and Economy as well
as representatives from associations of local authorities, commercial banks, and civil
society. The MDLF was responsible for the implementation of the project, including
selection, supervision and monitoring of sub-projects, and for the fiduciary and
safeguards procedures. The MDLF was also responsible for coordinating the project with
the national authorities and the funding partners, informing them of progress and of
achievements.

2.10 Implementation of sub-projects was often hampered by Israeli military restrictions
on the movement of people and goods particularly in Gaza, but also in the West Bank.
The 2008 military attack on Gaza disrupted project operations there. Implementation in
Gaza was more difficult because of the restrictions on movement of people and goods
                                             8


and an overall shortage of construction materials which led to delays in implementing
infrastructure sub-projects.

2.11 There were initial teething problems at the MDLF. Delays in contract
implementation were faced when contractors stopped working due to the change in the
value of their contracts because of depreciation in the U.S. dollar. The pilot electric
metering was replaced with the pilot parking meters in Ramallah which was developed in
a rush and without full consideration of all the requirements for enforcement. MDLF
contractual management issues were resolved early on. Additional staff was recruited and
further training provided to project participants including municipalities and technical
consultants. The MDLF became a strong rules based and transparent organization, which
was able to attract and deal with multiple financing partners. It publishes its reports and
manuals on a well-designed website.

2.12 From the Bank’s administered Trust Fund for the West Bank Gaza, 36 percent of
the funding was spent on roads, followed by 25 percent for “other” sectors and 15 percent
for solid waste. For SIDA, where the focus was on Gaza, the majority of funding was
spent on solid waste (38 percent), followed by “other sectors” (including operating costs),
then roads which accounted for 11 percent. For DANIDA, which also focused on Gaza,
the majority of the funding went to other sectors (41 percent), followed by solid waste
(25 percent) and roads (20 percent). According to the MDLF 2011 annual report, funds
administered by the World Bank financed over 1,000 subprojects, and over 500 sub-
projects were financed by other funding partners. On average, the per-project cost was
about $45,000.

2.13 All municipalities visited by the IEG mission were satisfied with the project and
with working with the financing partners and with the MDLF. Providing operational
costs, especially for Gaza was very well appreciated given the scarcity of material. The
provision of fuel and spare parts was particularly useful to keep the existing infrastructure
services and equipment in operation.

SAFEGUARDS

2.14 The project was assigned Environmental Category B. Safeguard policies on
Environmental Assessment (OP4.01) were triggered. At appraisal the Environmental
Management Plan was prepared and was to be finalized before effectiveness. This was
acceptable because of the emergency nature of the project (OP8.50). A Pest Management
Plan was also envisaged as it was foreseen that the project would finance purchases of
pesticides for pests, mosquitoes, and rodent control, and OP4.09 on Pest management
was triggered. According to the task team and discussions with the MDLF staff, these
purchases were not undertaken.

2.15 The MDLF included in its staffing an environmental specialist to help
municipalities implement the environmental management plan. Sub-projects that required
land acquisition were not eligible for financing in order to avoid involuntary resettlement.
During the joint evaluation mission, the IEG team met with the environmental specialist
in the MDLF office who indicated that the Bank procedures were followed during
implementation. IEG was also informed that training was provided to municipalities on
                                             9


implementing the EMP, with specialists hired by the MDLF. Also, the Bank’s EMP was
applied to all sub-projects regardless of the source of funding. Donors who provided
parallel financing (Germany and France) indicated that the sub-projects they financed
followed the Bank safeguards policies.

2.16 According to the ICR, there were no safeguards compliance issues. Also, none of
the social safeguards were triggered as the works consisted of rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure.

FIDUCIARY

2.17 Interim and annual financial reports were prepared regularly and submitted to the
Bank and the donors. Annual audits were also undertaken, submitted on time and were
unqualified. The quarterly and annual financial reports covered financing from all
funding partners and provided a comprehensive picture of the project implementation and
achievement by donor and cumulatively. The reports were shared among all financing
partners. Financial management arrangements were the same for all partners and no
financial management problems were encountered. According to the ICR, the project was
in compliance with Bank’s financial management policies.

2.18 According to the ICR, procurement was in accordance with Bank procedures for
all Trust Fund activities. Limited procurement capacity was encountered at the beginning
of the project. Local Technical Consultants were hired to assist municipalities in
undertaking procurement and contract management. The project encountered delays in
contract implementation due to the restrictions imposed on the movement of people and
goods, particularly in Gaza but also in the West Bank. The Bank carried out three ex-post
procurement reviews and no major noncompliance issue was noted. Procurement for
funds provided in parallel were reviewed by the corresponding funding partners.

Achievement of Objectives
EFFICACY

2.19 In the ICR, the Bank team only reported on the Bank funded activities that is the
Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank and not on the Bank managed Danish and SIDA
trust fund activities. During the field mission, IEG team obtained data on activities
funded by these trust funds as well as other donors from the MDLF staff. The outcomes
of the project as measured through the improvements in municipal performances or the
satisfaction survey, for example, are hard to attribute only to the activities financed by
trust funds administered by the Bank (i.e., TFGWB, SIDA, and DANIDA). They are the
outcomes from the efforts of all donors. On the other hand, the outputs presented in this
report are differentiated by the source of funding and cover trust funds administered by
the Bank.

Objective 1: Provide assistance for mitigating further deterioration in the delivery of
essential municipal services. Rating: Substantial.

OUTPUTS

2.20 The first component of the project “emergency municipal services grants”
addressed the first objective. It included demand driven sub-projects selected by
municipalities in accordance with their emergency priorities. Therefore, no baseline or
target indicators were set at appraisal. The MDLF kept records on the physical outputs of
the project. The ICR reported only on the Bank financed activities. The IEG mission
requested MDLF to provide all the outputs delivered under the project irrespective of the
source of funding (Annex D, Tables 1 and 2).

2.21 The outputs listed below include outputs financed by all Bank administered trust
funds:

      In the roads sector, 80 km of pavement, 10 km of sidewalks, 0.81 km of culverts
       and drainage, 240 m of hand rails, and 630 m of retaining walls were
       rehabilitated. In addition, 8,191 light bulbs, a street roller, an asphalt cutter,
       concrete mixer and excavator were provided.

      In the water sector 3.9 km of the water network was rehabilitated, this comprised
       of 31,159 meters of pipes and 2 water pumps

      In the wastewater sector, 7,858 meters of pipes were provided and 2.69 km of the
       network were rehabilitated.

      In the electricity sector, 9 km of the network was rehabilitated. This consisted of
       48,173 meters of cables.

      In the solid waste sector, 635 containers, 2 tractors, and 2 trailers were provided.

      Public facilities (municipal and community buildings, parks, shelters) with an area
       of 10,963 square meters were rehabilitated.

      Fuel, spare parts and other operations and maintenance materials and non-wage
       expenditures were provided to keep municipalities in operations to provide
       essential services.

OUTCOMES

2.22 The project financed rehabilitation of infrastructure in a number of sectors,
thereby assisting in halting the deterioration of the services under an environment of tight
municipal budget availability and restriction on Gaza. These investments were critical for
continuing and maintaining the basic services for the 74 percent of the urban population
living in 135 municipalities in the West Bank and Gaza. The provision of fuel and
necessary spare parts allowed municipalities to operate and maintain existing
infrastructure and equipment. The joint mission visited a few sites with electricity meters
and found them in working order. Providing fuel and spare parts allowed municipalities
                                            11


to operate and maintain existing infrastructure and equipment, which was critical for
Gaza. The project contributed to building consumer payment discipline through prepaid
electricity meters, thus improving revenue collection by municipalities. According to the
beneficiary satisfaction survey conducted at the end of the project, 81 percent of the
beneficiaries surveyed indicated that they are satisfied and/or are very satisfied with the
serviced provided by the municipalities. A similar portion (81 percent) of beneficiaries of
the infrastructure development indicated that the project was very relevant to their
community’s needs.

2.23 Following the project completion, and based on the conclusions of IEG desk
review of the project, the MDLF requested the Palestinian Central Bank of Statistics
(PCBS) to survey roads and their condition in order to provide further evidence of halting
deterioration through rehabilitation financed by the donors. Using the project output data
above and the baseline (2009) indicators and the situation of the same infrastructure in
2012 available from PCBS, the EMSRP II contribution is calculated at 7 percent, 1.5
percent, and 15 percent, respectively, of the improved water, wastewater, and roads
networks.

2.24 Following the second Intifada in 2000, municipalities experienced sharp decline
in their revenues from the conflict and a culture of non-payment among users,
accelerating degradation of infrastructure and services damaged during the Intifada. The
grants for emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction were highly relevant to bringing
municipal services back on line and prevent further deterioration in infrastructure.
Purchase of fuel, spare parts and other operations and maintenance materials and the
financing of non-wage expenditures under the project was integral in keeping
municipalities in operations to provide essential services and preventing further
deterioration in the delivery of basic service. The project also assisted the municipalities
in building capacity to mitigate further deterioration in the delivery of basic services.
Through project implementation, the capacity of municipalities to prepare and implement
projects was enhanced. As a first step, the municipalities were required to submit both the
planned as well as executed municipal budget reports to the Ministry of Local
Government. All municipalities submitted their budget to MOLG, however not all
budgets were disclosed to the public. About 56 percent of the municipalities disclosed
their municipal budgets and according to the beneficiary survey, only 46 percent of the
beneficiaries reported that the municipalities were transparent in their disclosures.

2.25 MDLF became an important instrument for channeling financial assistance from
foreign donors. The project laid the foundation for a major policy shift under the
successor MDP I. MDLF staff made clear that the project experience highlighted the
benefits of coordinated donor support. Increased donor cooperation was sought in the
development of the successor Municipal Development Program (MDP) projects. MDP
was prepared and supervised collectively by the donors as a truly joint project to respond
to the needs of the borrower and beneficiaries. This included unified approach toward the
results framework, fiduciary management, safeguards, and joint supervision missions.

Objective 2: Create temporary job opportunities at the local level. Rating: Substantial.

OUTPUTS

This component was funded by the Bank under the TFGWB. A total of 167,535 person
days of employment at the rate of US$12.59/day was created compared to the target of
140,000 person days. It was estimated that an additional 3,304 indirect person days were
created at the rate of US$15/day through the project. This constituted 70 percent of the
labor content in financed sub-project compared to the target of 50 percent.

OUTCOME

2.26 Labor intensive activities were used in several municipal small projects, including
digging culverts, construction of retaining walls, roads and drainage infrastructure. The
allocations for this component was distributed among municipalities based on the
unemployment index from the Palestinian Central Bank of Statistics. About 82.3 percent
beneficiaries were satisfied or very satisfied with this component versus a targeted
minimum of 70 percent. People employed were out of work, and considered that such
programs are much needed. People who expressed dissatisfaction indicated that the
employment was too short. The MDLF explained to the donor joint mission, the details of
the selection and inspection scheme of using labor to ensure workers were unemployed
and providing sustenance to families. This component was well used in Gaza including in
solid waste removal activities. An innovative approach in Gaza was to send out skilled
labor for the purpose of street signing and collecting physical address information. In the
process, workers collected complete and detailed data on the buildings including location,
physical attributes, service connections, and usage. The Gaza municipality demonstrated
to the mission team the computer system with these new data which are being used to
upgrade the GIS of the municipality on all properties for the purposes of planning,
property taxation, and permits to assess other usage fees. The municipality is using the
updated data for the purposes of improving tax collections.

Objective 3: Promote pilot initiatives that foster collaboration among local
governments and NGOs And promote municipal cost recovery initiatives. Rating:
Modest.

OUTPUTS

2.27 A total of 1,647 pre-paid electricity meters were installed and financed by KfW
(prepaid electricity meters were not supplied by the trust funded activities). IEG visited a
building where pre-paid electricity meters were installed. The municipality was satisfied
since such meters improve bill collection considerably.

2.28 For Trust Funded activities, prepaid electric meters were replaced by the parking
meters pilot in Ramallah/Al Bireh at the request of the municipalities. The evaluation
mission made special efforts to locate parking meters in Ramallah, none of which were
found to be operational.

2.29 Thirty three joint proposals were received from municipalities and NGOs
covering initiatives such as community centers, women’s training centers, libraries and
                                             13


computer centers. Proposals were developed by NGOs in consultation with local
communities who participated in meetings and workshops that were held to develop the
proposals. Ten pilots were implemented and the following municipalities benefited from
the pilot projects: Beit Sahour, Janata, Al Samou’, Sourif, Al Shyoukh, Beit Awwa, and
Khuza’a. The pilots included building of a community center in one municipality in
Gaza; construction of a women’s training center in Ajanta municipality in the southern
West Bank, development of a park and building of a community center in Beit Sahour
municipality, also in the southern West Bank. The Janata (West Bank) pilot supported
training and economic activities for women and the Gaza pilot supported youth
development.

2.30 The joint evaluation mission visited a community center which included a
community center and a children’s library. The computer center appeared not to be
functioning, the computers were disconnected. The children’s library was well
maintained with books, learning tools and posters. IEG was unable to visit the women’s
center in Gaza, which was partially damaged by the war and not safe for visit.

OUTCOMES

2.31 In terms of pilots for promoting cost recovery, the achievement is modest. The
pilot for electricity meters (financed by KfW) was successful. The municipality was
satisfied since it improved bill collection considerably. Based on the success of electricity
meters, the municipality indicated that it has implemented pre-paid meters to all
households that have electricity from its own funding. However, the pilot for the
introduction of parking meters was unsatisfactory. The Municipal Development and
Lending Fund and the municipality were not able to provide evidence about the operation
of the parking meters. It was indicated that there was lack of coordination, weak outreach
and lack of enforcement for the parking meter program.

2.32 The MDLF staff informed IEG that the partnership process between the
municipality and the local NGOs was fairly mechanical, with the municipality simply
constructing the building and handing it over to the NGOs for operations. According to
the beneficiary survey which included questions on fostering collaboration between
municipalities and NGOs, 80 percent of the 15 NGO personnel interviewed (12
respondents) specified that communications continued between them and the
municipality after the end of the project.

Efficiency
2.33 The project was prepared as an emergency operation under OP 8.50 and no
economic analysis was done during preparation. Component 1 of the project: Emergency
Municipal Services Assistance comprised 70 percent of the original trust funding and
about 74 percent of the original estimated total funding. The component was demand
driven and comprised grants for services in the water, sanitation, electricity, solid waste
and roads sectors. In addition it provided for non-wage recurrent expenditures. The
average cost of a sub-project implemented in component 1 was less than $45,000, and
projects covered a diversified spectrum of sectors.
                                                      14


2.34 The Implementation Completion Report presented the economic analysis for three
purposely-selected sub-projects in different sectors. The results were as follows: Roads:
Economic rate of Return (ERR) was 25.8 percent and NPV of $0.88 million; Solid Waste
Collection: ERR 37.8 percent and NPV US$0.3 million; Municipal Buildings: ERR 14.8
percent and NPV US$95,000. Roads constituted about 35 percent of the total
investments. Because the economic analysis covered only about 4 percent of the project
costs, it was assessed by IEG as not sufficient to verify the efficiency of the project.

2.35 To supplement the analysis, the Municipal Development and Lending Fund
provided the evaluation mission with the three scenarios of average costs for
rehabilitating roads.13

        Rehabilitation of 1 km of road including concrete shoulders, 2 lanes (5.5 m
         width): Euro 106,144 (US$141,171);

        Rehabilitation of 1 km road with 2 lanes (5.5 m width): Euro 88,000
         (US$117,046); and

        Rehabilitation of 1 km of road with 2 lanes (6.6 m width) including sidewalks (1.5
         m width): Euro 164,600 (US$218,918).

2.36 The average cost of rehabilitating 1 km for the project is Euro 119,000
(US$158,270). A World Bank study entitled Monitoring Road Works Contracts and Unit
Costs in Sub-Saharan Africa for Enhanced Governance estimated the cost of a 7 m wide
2-lane road. The figures are presented in Table 2.1.

Table 2.1. Comparison of Average Costs for Roads

 Type of work                  Minimum                           Mean                    Maximum
 Rehabilitation/Reconstruction 221,823                           397,899                 450,801
 Upgrade to paved                        296,516                 360,071                 403,830
 West Bank and Gaza                      117,046                 158,270                 218,918

2.37 While comparison among different countries and types of roads is a very difficult
undertaking, the above numbers show that investments in roads financed by the
Municipal Development and Lending Fund are lower than international practice. Other
estimates obtained for asphalting internal roads (funded by USAID) in the West Bank
obtained during the evaluation were up to US$300,000/km, and US$100,000 for
agricultural roads. They also compare favorably with average costs in Jordan
(US$177,500/km) and Yemen (US$162,400) obtained from World Bank financed
projects. A reason for the low cost of roads construction in the Palestinian territories is
the very limited funds available that have to be stretched. The Technical Audit and

13
   Costs of roads provided were consolidated from roads built under EMSRPII and MDP I, and does not
distinguish the roads rehabilitated with different financing donors. The uniformity of road investments
makes it difficult and futile to differentiate road investments; different parts of the same roads were at times
rehabilitated under the two projects and with more than one financier.
                                             15


Usability Assessment (December 2012) prepared under MDP I cast some light on the
reasons for the low costs, including using local engineers and labor, relying on
experience rather than technical specifications and codes, as well as using lower
standards. This raises concerns about the quality of roads rehabilitated under the project.
In Gaza, the cost for material was low because of the lack of standard materials and the
practice of using interloctyles tiles (made of rubble) to construct roads.

2.38 The purpose and quality of roads varied. Some were one lane access roads to
schools, while other were two lane roads in major market areas. IEG was unable to obtain
a breakdown of the types of roads rehabilitated or the daily traffic on these roads.

2.39 Another measure of efficiency of the project is that of the Municipal Development
and Lending Fund (MDLF) operations. MDLF is a lean organization comprised of highly
skilled local staff. In EMSRP II, the MDLF administrative fee was 5 percent of the funds
used.

2.40 The project experienced a two year delay, the extension of two years was granted
in order to implement the additional financing.

2.41   The efficiency of the project is rated Modest.

Project Ratings
OUTCOME

2.42 The project outcome rating is defined as “the extent to which the project’s major
relevant objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved efficiently”. The project
laid the foundation for a major policy shift in the municipal sector—highlighted a need to
move away from an uncoordinated individual donor-supported activities to increased
donor cooperation. The successor project, MDP I was designed by the donors collectively
as a truly joint project.

2.43 The relevance of objectives is rated high—the objective remains highly relevant
from inception until completion and final evaluation. The relevance of design is rated
high since each component directly addresses each of the objectives. The objective of
providing assistance for mitigating further deterioration in the delivery of essential
municipal services is rated substantial. The objective of creating temporary job
opportunities at the local level is also rated substantial. However, the objective of
promoting pilot initiatives that foster collaboration among local governments and NGOs
and promote municipal cost recovery is rated modest. Efficiency is rated modest. Based
on these ratings and analysis, the project outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.44 The overall risk to development outcome of the project is Significant. Despite the
high risks external to the project and its implementing agencies, the risk to the
development outcome of the project is moderate.
                                            16


2.45 Projects in the West Bank and Gaza are at risk of external forces such as the
political, military and security situation in the area which all have been high risks for a
long time, and are highly likely to continue in the future. These external risks have
caused delays in implementation and can disrupt the achievement of outcomes to improve
municipal services and livelihoods.

2.46 On the other hand, the follow-on projects have contributed to building a
reasonably strong implementing agency, the Municipal Development and Lending Fund
(MDLF), for improving service delivery by the municipalities, and improving the
understanding and resolve of national institutions to reform local governments. MDP I
and MDP II have built in institutionalized requirements for improvements in MDLF and
Palestinian municipalities such as in the selection, implementation, and operation of sub-
projects. Other improvements include community participation, improved financial
management of municipalities, training and support for preparation of sub-projects and
overall municipal performance. These improvements contribute to the sustainability of
the project and to reducing the impact of the associated risks.

2.47 The risk of not maintaining the investments under the project is substantial given
the limited resources at the municipalities. This risk is being mitigated with the emphasis
given to O&M by the funding partners and the MDLF through the initiation and
institutionalization of O&M practices based on asset management principles in the
follow-up project.

2.48 The Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) receives all funding
from international donors. The risk of losing this funding is moderate in the short to
medium term. The project has the support of the international community as evidenced
by the financial leverage (six times the Bank’s initial contribution) it has managed. The
Bank and the financing partners have continued the support of local government reform
through follow-up projects (Municipal Development Projects I and II), which have
continued to leverage Bank funding and attract additional financial partners to support the
MDLF and the municipal and service reform processes that the project initiated.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

2.49 The quality at entry of the project is rated Satisfactory. The project was initially
prepared as a regular operation (Municipal Management and Service Delivery Project).
However, due to hostilities at the time, the project was converted to and prepared under
the emergency recovery assistance procedures (OP8.50). The project benefitted from
being a follow-up operation to the First Emergency Municipal Services Project (EMSRP
I). The main benefit was the existence of the Municipal Development and Lending Fund
which had acquired experiences as the Project Management Unit for previous Bank
financed projects. Under OP8.50, a full-fledged economic analysis is not required, which
in the case of the demand driven sub-projects would only have been demonstrative in
nature. However, the project retained the higher level objectives of the initial project as
part of the results framework, where the key indicators continued to focus on the reform
issues, and were not reflective of the stated development objectives.
                                           17


QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

2.50 The Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank team
was working under difficult conditions, especially in Gaza which was difficult to access
due to Israeli restrictions and blockades, and due to its physical separation from the
authorities in the West Bank. The Bank team responsible for the project operated from
the Jerusalem office supported by other staff from the region and from headquarters. The
team was in constant communications with the authorities and was continuously solving
problems with them on the ground. No safeguard or fiduciary issues were raised in the
ICR.

2.51 There were two shortcomings in the implementation that hampered the overall
management of the project from the Bank’s perspective. These were: (i) the Bank team
reported only on the Bank funded activities (i.e., the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West
Bank) in terms of project progress, fiduciary, safeguard and results parameters and did
not report on Bank managed trust fund activities (i.e., the Danish and Swedish Trust
funds); and (ii) the Bank team did not adjust the results framework during
implementation to correct the key outcome indicators. The joint mission found evidence
that MDLF kept records of Bank as well as donor funded activities.

2.52   The overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT

2.53 The performance of the government as represented by the Ministry of Finance and
the Ministry of Local Government is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The two ministries
took the necessary steps to ensure that Bank requirements are complied with in a timely
manner. They ratified the environmental management plans and the subsidiary
agreements in a timely manner. They also facilitated the operations of the MDLF in Gaza
despite the difficulties. During implementation, issues of payment signature and a
reluctance to delegate responsibilities by high levels of the Ministry of Local Government
(MOLG) caused delays. Currently, MOLG is the chair of the Board of Directors of the
MDLF and co-chairs the municipal sector working groups. MOLG’s role has changed
over time, its focusing policy development at the local level rather than project
implementation.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY

2.54 The performance of the implementing agency, the Municipal Development and
Lending Fund (MDLF), is rated Satisfactory. The MDLF staff is well qualified with the
required skills to implement the project including engineering, environmental, financial,
procurement and social specialists. The MDLF implemented sub-projects in accordance
with accepted fiduciary and safeguard requirement. The MDLF maintained the required
monitoring indicators for all donor financing, provided shared reports to all funding
partners. The MDLF was effective in; (i) developing and implementing more transparent
rules for the allocation of funds to the sector; (ii) helping municipalities to prepare
                                             18


projects, (iii) persuading them to comply with their legal obligation to submit budgets on
a timely basis, and (iv) resolving the initial problems encountered with local technical
consultants.

2.55 Currently, the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) is an open and
transparent institution. It operates a website where reports about the projects it handles
are available to the public. Also made public are manuals, strategic plans, and other news
about MDLF activities. The staff and management met during the evaluation mission
were qualified, committed and enthusiastic about the project. They provided full support
to the joint evaluation mission. The main shortcoming of MDLF is weak focus on O&M.
MDLF was slow in developing the O&M manual and providing the necessary training for
municipalities.

2.56   Overall Government Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
M&E DESIGN

2.57 The PDO indicators focused on the higher level program objectives that were not
directly addressed by the project. This was true of M&E design at appraisal which was
complex for an emergency type of operation, and of the final revised M&E framework.
M&E indicators focused on: (i) grants provided in accordance with a transparent fair and
rules based formula; (ii) public disclosure of budgets; and (iii) equalization effect. This
misalignment in the objectives is due to the switch from a regular operation within a
program of municipal development to an emergency-type project. Some of the measures
such as cost recovery were not addressed by the project. Others were not clear at the
outset, such as improved health and environmental conditions or leveraging social
capital. Because the first rehabilitation of infrastructure component is demand driven,
indicators for infrastructure sectors (e.g., water, solid waste, roads) were included, and no
baseline or targets were established pending the selection of the activities. A social
survey was undertaken during the preparation which helped in gauging the interest of the
Palestinian population in the project and to improve its design.

M&E IMPLEMENTATION

2.58 The M&E system was implemented by the Municipal Development and Lending
Fund (MDLF) as modified during the mid-term review in March 2008. The key outcome
indicators remained as designed at appraisal and reflected higher level objectives. The
intermediate indicators were revised to measure (i) citizen satisfaction with municipal
services; and (ii) number of workdays generated. As planned, the social survey was
followed up with a beneficiary satisfaction survey during implementation which rated the
satisfaction of the population with the ongoing investments as well as with the
performance of municipalities. The Bank did not reflect the physical outputs as
monitoring indicators in its own system, and at ICR only indicators for Bank funded
activities were reported. On the other hand, the MDLF kept and reported on detailed
records of outputs by each donor (see Annex D Tables 3 and 4). This has facilitated the
review of project performance and achievement of objectives.
                                            19


M&E UTILIZATION

2.59 The main reason for the high rating is due to the extent of utilization of the
EMSRP II data and experience in the design and implementation of the follow-up
Municipal Development Projects (MDP I and MDP II). Similarly, the beneficiary impact
assessment was used in the development and design of the follow-up projects. Lessons of
success and shortcomings were incorporated into the M&E system of the two projects.
For example, more attention was paid into incorporating donor financing. Community
participation was introduced in the follow-up projects as part of the design and selection
of sub-projects. Independent technical assessment studies were added to measure and
verify the indicators.

2.60   Overall, M&E is rated Modest.

3. Municipal Development Program—Phase I
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
3.1    The World Bank, along with several funding partners including Denmark, France,
Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden, has been supporting the Palestinian Authority to
implement municipal reforms through donor financed projects including the Local
Government Capacity Building Project and the Emergency Municipal Services
Rehabilitation Projects I and II. In 2009, the Palestinian Authority developed the
Municipal Development Program (MDP) which was supported by seven donors to
operationalize the local government goals of the Palestinian Reform and Development
Plan which is to strengthen local government through greater fiscal and administrative
autonomy. The MDP consolidates the experience of the Municipal Development Fund,
the implementing agency of the MDP, in performance-based grant programs.

3.2 The Municipal Development Program (MDP) has the following hierarchy of
    objectives.14

          Sector-Level Objective: To strengthen municipal governance to enable
           municipalities to become creditworthy;
          Program Level Objective: Support municipalities in providing better coverage
           and improved coverage of services over the medium term;
          Objective of the First Phase of MDP (MDP I): Over the short-term, to improve
           municipal management practices for better transparency;
          Objective of the Second Phase of MDP (MDP II): To improve municipal
           management practices for better service delivery and municipal transparency.

3.3   The objectives of the MDP, therefore, evolve from improving municipal
management (MDP I), to improving municipal services (MDP II) and ultimately to
improving credit worthiness in the larger and more capable municipalities in the future.

OBJECTIVES

3.4    The project under review is the first phase of the Municipal Development
Program. According to the Trust Fund Grant Agreement, the objective of the project is
“to improve municipal management practices for better transparency.”

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

3.5    The overall relevance of the project objective is rated High. At the time of project
preparation, the three-year Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP 2008–10),
emphasized its priorities in governance, and provision of infrastructure. Two of the Bank
Group’s strategy pillars supported the PA’s efforts to: (i) improve governance and
support fiscal reform; and (ii) support public infrastructure development.

3.6     At closing, the project objectives were highly relevant to the Palestinian National
Development Plan 2011–2013 (PNDP) which aimed to strengthen local governance and
service provision by municipalities. The Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (FY12–14) dated
March 2012 supports the PNDP with its emphasis on strengthening public administration
and the role of local governments in service delivery and responsiveness to users’ needs.
The strategy also recognizes the importance of increasing the sustainability of
infrastructure.

3.7      The project objectives remain highly relevant to the current Bank Country
Assistance Strategy (2015–2016) which is aligned with the new Palestinian National
Development Plan (PNDP) (FY14–16). Both strategies focus on good governance and
institution building, social protection, economic development, employment, and
infrastructure. Reflecting the priorities of the Palestinian Authority as outlined in the
PNDP, one of the Bank’ pillars of its current strategy focuses on strengthening the
institutions of a future state to ensure service delivery to citizens. Increased transparency
and accountability in service delivery is to be accomplished through municipalities as
they adopt practices that emphasize transparency and accountability through increased
public participation and adoption of sound financial and managerial policies in the
implementation of projects and municipal functions.

DESIGN

3.8 The project has four components/windows:

       Window 1: Municipal grants for capital investment (estimated cost US$46.16
       million of which US$7.6 million from the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank
       (TFGWB); actual cost US$64.69 million). Window 1 allocates grants to
       municipalities for capital investments or operating expenditures for service
       provision. It addresses two key constraints for municipalities: severe municipal
       deficits, and poor municipal management. Eligible sectors (per the Local Councils
       Law No. 1 of 1997) are: (i) water and waste water services if provided by the
       municipality for the purposes of ensuring continuous supply; (ii) solid waste
       management; (iii) roads; (iv) public facilities (v) street lighting and (vi) electricity
       services not provided by a utility. The interventions could include rehabilitation,
       reconstruction, construction, or the supply of equipment and spare parts to sustain
       municipal service provision. Due to the special circumstances in Gaza,
       municipalities there could use their allocations for recurrent expenditures
       (excluding salaries of municipal employees) as direct inputs for sustaining
       essential municipal services.

       Window 2: Support to municipal innovations and efficiency (estimated cost
       US$3.7 million of which US$0.7 million from TFGWB financing; actual cost
       US$1.91 million). Window 2 promotes learning and innovation for municipal
       development, including implementation of policy decisions by the Ministry of
       Local Government (MOLG). The window covers the costs of goods, works,
       training and services. The two main areas of intervention envisaged are:
                                           22


       (i) Strengthening newly amalgamated local governments by providing funds for
       the expansion of their services including small scale infrastructure and capacity
       building; and

       (ii) Piloting innovations that promote municipal revenue generation or cost
       savings by supporting studies, consultation and testing of innovative approaches
       to enhance municipal revenue generation, responsiveness or cost savings. The
       project will pilot one stop shops/customer service centers in three Gaza
       municipalities to promote municipal transparency, accountability, responsiveness
       and service delivery.

       Window 3: Capacity Building for municipalities and the Municipal
       Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) (estimated cost US$5.43 of which
       US$0.6 million from TFGWB; actual cost US$2.52 million). This window
       supports municipalities to graduate to higher performance categories in the
       performance ranking system in which they are currently classified. MDP provides
       technical assistance to municipalities to improve their (i) financial management,
       including revenue enhancement for municipal service delivery, (ii) planning
       capacities, with a specific focus on community participation, and (iii) technical
       capabilities, in particular for operations and maintenance. This window
       strengthens the MDLF’s capacity to implement the project, ensuring that it
       continues to use innovative approaches that build on international best practices.

       Window 4: MDP Management (estimated cost US$6.64 million of which
       US$1.1 million from TFGWB; actual cost US$6.53 million). This Window
       finances (i) MDLF Management Fee; (ii) Monitoring and Evaluation; (iii)
       Outreach and Communications; and (iv) Local Technical Consultants.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

3.9     The relevance of the project design to the objectives is rated High. The two
phased approach of MDP, first focuses on improving municipal performance under MDP
I and then service delivery under MDP II.

3.10 Infrastructure investments (Window 1) tests a performance based formula for
allocating resources and serves as an incentive for adopting reforms by municipalities. At
the same time, the transfer formula provides incentives for the municipalities to improve
their management as well as transparency through the requirement to improve
community participation in formulation of strategies and projects. Window 2 encourages
municipalities to cooperate for better efficiencies and management of providing public
services. Window 3 includes capacity building packages for municipalities to assist them
in graduating to higher performance categories through the performance ranking system.
Targeted technical assistance and training is provided to municipalities in order to
improve their performance in specific areas such as community participation, strategic
planning, financial management, project preparation, implementation and operation.
Community participation and public disclosure of budgets and strategic plans are
required for the achievement of the objective of increasing transparency and improving
                                                     23


services. The results chain, therefore, was clearly established with outputs leading to
outcomes.

Implementation
3.11 The project was approved in September 2009 and became effective January 2010.
The project was financed by the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank for a total of US$12
million, including additional financing of US$2 million signed March 14, 2012. The
project was also financed with a multi-donor trust fund from the Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA) and the Swedish International Development Agency
(SIDA) administered by the World Bank (US$13.48 million) which was supplemented
with a US$12.21 million additional financing. France, Germany and Belgium provided
parallel financing in the amounts of US$11.82 million, US$22.0 million, and US$1.28
million, respectively (Annex F).
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

3.12 There were some teething problems due to delays in the recruitment of staff
particularly in Gaza. The Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) staff at
times could not travel to Gaza due to the security restrictions. The MDLF Gaza office
lacked skills for social specialists and planners. Initially, municipalities needed time to
prepare projects in accordance with the requirements of MDLF to access funds. All
proposals in the first round were rejected due to lack of familiarity of the municipalities
with the detailed requirements of the project. The MDLF then provided training on public
participation, safeguard and fiduciary aspects. The MDLF visited municipalities regularly
to give hands on training and answer questions. MDLF Staff observed community
participation sessions, inspected progress of projects and their final delivery. MDLF staff
explained the processes involved in community participation and the purposes of their
technical visits to the joint evaluation mission.

3.13 Procurement training was provided to MDLF staff in Gaza and the West Bank as
well as to municipalities. Additional staff was recruited in order to keep up with the
volume of work. Technical and environmental review of sub-projects were contracted in
preparation for the mid-term review.

3.14 The mid-term review was used to follow-up on lagging components such as the
One Stop Shops,15 where difficulties were resolved once a qualified consultant was
recruited to manage the work. The project was divided into two cycles in order to allow
for incorporating lessons learned in the first cycle and to improve performance. The
Municipal Development and Lending Fund conducted an independent Technical Audit
and Usability Assessment for the infrastructure projects in the West Bank in order to
assess performance, take corrective actions, and learn lessons. The ranking of
municipalities was also done independently and documented the achievements and needs
for of municipalities in terms of their performance against the criteria selected in the

15
  A municipal office that offers citizens a variety of municipal services in one location. The citizen would
submit the application to one office and receive final outcome in the same place. The idea is to provide
convenient and efficient service.
                                             24


project. Such studies provided lessons to the project and added to the credibility of the
assessment of results.

3.15 Two hundred and Ninety Eight (298) out of the 522 sub-projects were for roads,
and the remaining projects were for public buildings/facilities (56); wastewater (33);
water (30); solid waste (28); electricity (8); and others (69). Roads accounted for 67
percent of total funding for the infrastructure component. In Gaza, the need for roads
rehabilitation is very apparent. Some main roads travelled in Gaza by the evaluation
mission needed rehabilitation. The roads rehabilitated under the project were well used
by all sorts of vehicles, humans and donkey carts. Safety of pedestrians was an issue due
to a lack of sidewalks. Roads are also a priority in the West Bank, but to a lesser extent
than Gaza. During the evaluation, the reasons for selection of roads were clarified, these
include: (i) roads are a basic necessary for access, (ii) roads are easier to build in a
modular fashion and adapt to the budget; and (iii) roads are visible. Roads were part of
the municipalities Strategic Development Investment Plans (SDIPs), but were not
necessarily the first priority in the SDIPs; however in most cases they were chosen to fit
the budget. These observations point to the need to find an alternative solution to the
small allocations that are provided and to find means to finance more desirable, larger
and potentially more economically and socially preferable projects. This desire was noted
by municipalities as well as the MDLF staff.

3.16 During the joint evaluation mission, the municipalities expressed positive views
with regard to the project. Smaller municipalities found the capacity building packages
more useful than larger municipalities. There were some complaints with regard to the
transfer formula, in that it does not reflect the needs and special situations of
municipalities (e.g., university towns, tourist towns, and distance from major urban
areas). On the other hand, there was unanimous appreciation for the discipline, fairness
and transparency and the institutionalization of a rules based system in the municipal
sector. The formula was clear and was based on population (40 percent), needs (20
percent) and performance (40 percent). Performance is well defined in the 12 criteria
listed in the performance ladder (Annex E). Municipalities were satisfied with their
relations with the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) staff and with the
level of support provided by MDLF. Municipalities indicated that they now practice new
approaches such as community participation, budget preparation, and project selection
based on clear criteria learned and applied in the project. Several of the working officials
met (engineers), members of the municipal councils (and one mayor) were active women
who showed understanding of the project and its objectives. Municipalities were
appreciative of MDLF and the support it provided during implementation. Municipalities
expressed a desire for new types of training such as technical, engineering and project
management as well as packages for raising awareness of the population in areas such as
paying taxes and fees to maintain the infrastructure.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHANGES

3.17 On March 6, 2012, Additional Financing for US$2 million was obtained from the
World Bank Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank. The AF was to: (i) scale up the
project and support additional grants for municipal infrastructure (98 percent of AF); and
(ii) complete some original project activities (2 percent of AF). The PDO Indicators were
                                            25


revised upward to accommodate the additional financing. In April 2013, the closing date
was extended from April 2013 to August 2013 to complete the ongoing work.

SAFEGUARDS

3.18 The project was assigned Environmental Category “B.” The project triggered
operational policy OP4.01 on environmental assessment and OP4.09 on pest
management. As required, the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) had
prepared an environmental management framework during preparation. The framework
could be updated to suit the sub-projects selected. Sub-projects that might trigger OP4.12
on land acquisition and involuntary settlements or OP4.11 on cultural resources were
automatically rejected as per the operational manual of the MDLF. The Technical Audit
and Usability Assessment Report (2012) explained the steps taken to comply with
environmental safeguards including measures prior to, during and after construction.
According to the Bank team, pesticides were not purchased and OP4.09 was not
triggered. The environmental specialist prepared Environmental Management Plans for
sub-projects and included it with the procurement documents. The technical audit report
found the measures during construction to be acceptable but less than intended. Safety
measures for workers needed to be enhanced. More water spraying was needed to control
the dust. Measures that were applied included dumping in approved sites, using properly
maintained vehicles and equipment, and avoiding the cutting of trees. Post construction
measures were not sufficient. For example, road signs and markings were not installed,
and landscaping was not a priority. The evaluation team met with the safeguard
specialists who explained their procedures during site visits and indicated that the Bank’s
safeguards policies were followed.

3.19 During the initial phase of the project, the municipal capacity to identify and
manage social risks was weak. MDLF staff held discussions with municipalities to
improve the understanding of how voluntary land donation process should be carried out
and how to develop complaints handling processes. Formal and informal capacity
building sessions were carried out by the Bank starting in December 2012 and throughout
the remainder of the project life cycle. A grievance redress mechanism was piloted in
three Gaza municipalities.

3.20 The ICR notes that the Bank’s Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement
(OP 4.12) did not apply. According to the ICR, the World Bank safeguards procedures
were complied with.

FIDUCIARY

3.21 The ICR reports that the project was in compliance with the Bank’s financial
management requirements. Interim and annual financial management reports were
prepared by an auditing company covering the activities of all the financing partners. The
company also audited the interim financial reports, which is beyond Bank requirements.
The financial reports were informative and of good quality. They included a description
of the results framework and the project achievements. The financial reports covered the
accounts and funding of all financing partners. External audits were performed jointly for
all donors. Audit reports were received on time and were unqualified – except for one,
                                            26


where non-compliance with the grant agreement was noted. In this instance, the
Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) submitted the cumulative annual
report for the preceding calendar year (that is 2010) after the required 60 days period. No
accountability, fraud or corruption issues were found. Financial management was rated
moderately satisfactory because the MDLF did not apply a risk based approach to their
internal audit. Financial management procedures and oversight were applied to all World
Bank administered Trust Funds. The same arrangements and common reports and audits
were shared with parallel donors.

3.22 The ICR reports that procurement was undertaken in accordance with Bank
procedures. There were implementation delays due to lack of procurement staff during
the early years of project implementation. This initially slowed down the procurement
process, but as the positions were filled within 6 months of effectiveness, the rate of
implementation improved. The procurement capacity of the MDLF, and the
municipalities improved over the life cycle of the project. In 2010, the Bank provided
procurement training to the MDLF procurement agents and technical staff and to
municipalities in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Procurement procedures and
oversight were undertaken by Bank staff for Bank administered trust funds. Funding
partners undertook their own procurement reviews. Procurement training was provided
and performance improved. Procurement rating was upgraded to satisfactory and
remained so since September 2011.

Achievement of the Objectives
Objective: Improve municipal management practices for better transparency. Rating:
Substantial.

OUTPUTS

3.23     To improve municipal management practices for transparency, all municipalities
received capacity building support. The project developed manuals for the capacity
building packages and provided training to implement the packages. The project
approved 218 applications from municipalities for different capacity building packages,
these include:

      96 municipalities received Financial Policies and Procedure Manuals (FPPM).
      90 municipalities received Strategic Development and Investment Plan (SDIP),
       package and 52 for SDIP updates.
      32 municipalities received Fixed Assets Registration and Valuation package.
      Targeted budget preparation support was provided to 26 municipalities that
       ranked in the lowest ranking category “E” to help them to graduate up the ranking
       scale.
      Ten municipalities received O&M manuals and piloted their implementation
       compared to the 5 municipalities initially planned.
                                             27


      The MDLF provided training to newly elected mayors and council members on
       the legal framework, management and administrative issues, financial issues,
       technical issues and gender issues.
3.24 The project allocated funds for infrastructure rehabilitation - under the project,
522 sub-projects were implemented in two cycles. The MDLF staff and municipalities
visited confirmed that all sub-projects were prepared in accordance with criteria
established in the project. These criteria include public participation, selection from the
strategic development plan, in accordance with sound procurement, financial, social,
operations and maintenance consideration. Most sub-projects were for roads (298);
followed by public facilities (56); wastewater (33); water (30); solid waste (28);
electricity (8); and others (69). Details of the outputs are as follows (Annex D Table 4):

              In the roads sector, the project rehabilitated 310 kilometers of road, 49,927
               meters of sidewalks, 6,279 meters of retaining walls, and 3,415 lighting
               units were supplied.

              In the water sector, 11 km of water networks were rehabilitated, 47 wells
               were maintained, 167 household connections were provided and 3257
               water meters were installed.

              In the wastewater and solid waste sectors, 35 kilometers of wastewater
               network were rehabilitated, 103 house connections, and 498 containers
               were provided.

              16,783 square meters of public buildings were constructed, 29,000 square
               meters of public gardens were constructed, and 35,159 square meters of
               public buildings were rehabilitated. See Annex D, Table 4 for detailed
               outputs delivered under the project.

              97 percent of sub-projects are operational compared to the target of 80
               percent.

3.25 The evaluation mission observed the roads built with project funds in all
municipalities visited. The purposes of the roads varied—some were one lane access or
connector roads, while others were main roads with two lanes, sidewalks and drainage.
Roads and sidewalks observed appeared to be in good condition, and compared favorably
with nearby un-rehabilitated or unpaved roads. Several of the roads with sidewalks
visited during the mission were access roads to schools. The roads observed were being
used and most had considerable in town traffic (about 30 vehicles per hour). At the same
time, the mission was informed that one road was built to serve a wealthy household.
Newly installed street lights were observed and confirmed to be working by officials
when operated at night. One shortcoming with the road rehabilitation was the lack of
signs for directions and safety. In Gaza, due to the lack of cement and other building
materials, roads were constructed out of rubble, and made into brick like shapes
(interloctyles tiles). The roads visited appeared of good quality. The Technical Audit and
Usability Assessment, however, found some faults with some of the roads, where cracks
were appearing.
                                                    28


3.26 The mission visited parks in 4 municipalities (Beita, Aaqaba, Beit Sahour, and
Kharas). All parks appeared to be well maintained and equipped. The parks were closed
for the winter, but officials from the municipality assured the mission that the parks are
well used on weekends, holidays and during the spring and summer seasons. The officials
also gave examples how the parks are used for exhibits, outings for school children and
youth, festivals and commercial exhibitions. Most parks were concessioned to private
operators for a fee to the municipality. Other parks were maintained and operated by the
municipality. In Gaza, a center for maintaining and operating water wells using the
SCADA system was visited. The municipality was very pleased with the system and
demonstrated to IEG how the system works.

3.27 The project piloted one-stop shops. The evaluation mission also visited 2 one-stop
shops (OSS) in the municipalities of Beni Suheila and Gaza City in Gaza. Both offices
provide a range of services to citizens from extending new water connections to
registering properties. The Beni Suheila OSS was in the process of being moved to a new
building of the municipality, but staff there showed the offices and equipment and
discussed the operations of the OSS with the evaluation mission. In Gaza, the OSS was
open and a lot of activities were going on. The Information Technology team that
developed the business process system demonstrated the system to the evaluation
mission. The team was skilled and enthusiastic with plans to expand and improve the
system. They indicated the need for training and updated software. The mission also had
a discussion with a family visiting the OSS for the purpose of completing formalities to
sell real estate. Overall satisfaction with the system and the improvements were voiced,
procedures were clear, and time needed to complete the transaction was short. The
evaluation mission visited a smaller OSS office in the West Bank where the main
function was for payment of bills.

OUTCOMES

3.28 The project substantially improved municipal management for better
transparency, by introducing a transparent rules based funding allocation mechanism
through a performance based system. All municipalities received funding through an
agreed formula which allocated 40 percent of the funds according to municipalities
population; 40 percent according to municipalities performance (incentive based
mechanism), with municipalities being ranked according to key performance indicators;
and 20 percent based on municipalities needs. The MDLF staff provided evidence to the
joint mission that showed that the project adhered to the transfer formula.16 Figure 3.1
shows the performance rankings of the municipalities.




16
  The Joint mission was given the excel tables used for allocation. This included the population data from
the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics and the ranking of municipalities.

3.29 At the start of the project more than 80 percent of the municipalities were ranked
low at D or E meaning they only had a budget in place. By the end of the project over 90
percent were ranked B or C meaning they have in place a strategic development plan,
adequate financial accounting policies and were subject to external audits. As a result of
the capacity building packages provided by the project, the following outcomes were
achieved:

      96 percent of the municipalities graduated up the performance category compared
       to the original target of 25 percent and the revised target of 30 percent. Table 3.1
       shows the change in the performance ranking of the municipalities.

      At the end of the project 68 percent of the municipalities compared to the revised
       target of 60 percent were applying at least two public disclosure methods such as
       municipal budgets, strategic development plans, or external audits. Transparency
       in selection of projects and budgetary process was substantially improved.

      As planned, all municipal investments financed were identified in the Strategic
       Development Plans using community participation.

3.30 During the discussions, there was unanimous appreciation among government and
municipal stakeholders of the uniform, transparent, and rules based approach to providing
and obtaining grants from the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF). There
were questions as to whether the rules, that is the transfer formula was fair in terms of
addressing the different needs of the municipalities (e.g. transient population such as
students or tourists, or distance from urban centers and services). Nevertheless, the
clarity, equity and transparency of the approach remained of paramount in importance.
There was also appreciation of the capacity building packages and their relevance to the
project objectives and to improving municipal management, and to selecting and
implementing projects on a sound basis.

3.31 The project strengthened donor coordination activities in the municipal sector in
the Palestinian Territories. The Bank is the Technical Advisor for the Sector Working
Group on Municipal Development and Local Governance (co-chaired by Denmark and
MOLG). The sector working group brings together all donors under the chairmanship of
the Palestinian Authority and coordinates efforts to address Palestinian needs and
priorities.

IMPACTS

3.32 The assessment of the impact of the project’s capacity building support on service
delivery was carried out through two citizen satisfaction surveys, conducted in 2009 and
in 2012. These surveys differentiated between citizens who directly benefitted from the
project and those who did not. The surveys covered 37 municipalities and 631 individuals
in 2009. In 2012, 1,230 individuals were included. The selection of individuals was done
on a stratified cluster sampling basis. Individuals were asked to rate their satisfaction with
different municipal services and service delivery characteristics. Municipal services
covered electricity, water, sewage, solid waste, roads, and parks/entertainment. The
respondents were also asked to rank their perception of the municipality regarding
interaction with citizens, awareness of municipal activities, participation in decision-
making processes and transparency of the municipality. The ICR reported that overall
citizen satisfaction improved from 50 to 57 (on a scale of 100) with over ten point
improvement in the water and sewerage sector, and a 9 point improvement in the road
sector; there was however a decline in satisfaction with electricity and parks.

3.33 The German Development Bank (KfW) who participated in the joint evaluation
mission financed an Empirical Impact Assessment of the project to validate the findings
of the beneficiary survey and to strengthen the assessment analysis by the funding
partners. The assessment concluded that the overall level of citizens’ satisfaction with
local services remained constant in most sectors, however, the satisfaction with roads
even deteriorated17. The study finds that being “treated household” (i.e., households that
benefitted from MDP I) significantly increases overall satisfaction levels as well as
satisfaction with road indicators. Treated households did not experience such a decline
while the decline was even more pronounced for “untreated” households. On a scale from
one (not satisfied at all) to four (very satisfied), being treated on average increased
reported satisfaction levels by 0.06 points for overall satisfaction with municipal services.
While this effect seems rather small, effects are considerably larger for satisfaction with
road infrastructure (0.59 points and statistically significant).

3.34 Drawing on two rounds of the municipal infrastructure survey, together with
project-level spending data for EMSRP II and MDP I, panel regressions indicate a
significant positive relationship between project funds spent on road infrastructure and
the length of paved roads in good condition.

3.35 One concern with the incentive-based allocation mechanism was that richer
municipalities may become richer while poor municipalities fall behind. The results of
the KfW funded Empirical Impact Assessment indicate that “the performance-based fund
allocation does not discriminate against economically poor municipalities. More

17
  In the citizen satisfaction surveys, several indicators address the roads sector. One of them was “opening
of new roads and rehabilitation of existing roads,” but there were a few more on drainage, traffic signs, and
so on. The consulting firm in charge of the surveys, Alpha International, reported in their 2012 final report
only the change in the indicator “opening of new roads and rehabilitation of existing roads” rather than an
average across all road indicators. This creates the impression that the situation in the road sector improved
considerably while it actually deteriorated when all indicators are contemplated jointly.
                                                      32


specifically, poor municipalities on average neither received lower performance ratings
initially (in year 2009) nor did they improve their management practices/governance at a
slower pace. There is no indication that poorly performing municipalities are falling
behind in terms of service delivery.”

Efficiency
3.36 Administrative Efficiency: Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF)
was responsible for the implementation of the project. MDLF is a lean organization
comprised of highly skilled local staff. The MDLF fee for MDP I is 7 percent of the
project cost. Under the previous EMSRP II, MDLF administrative fee was 5 percent of
the project costs. This compares favorably with other international implementation
agencies that charge up to 20 percent.18

3.37 The project provided technical assistance to improve the capacity of the
municipalities in managing municipal budgets and planning of municipal services. There
were no problems with financial management or procurement. This indicates that
resources were invested in accordance with Bank procedures.

3.38 The project was implemented on time, an extension of the closing date of four
months was granted in order to complete the scaled-up activities under the additional
financing. Initially there were delays in the procurement of capacity building packages.
The start-up of Cycle 2 experienced five months delays due to municipal elections.

3.39 Economic Efficiency: No economic analysis was carried out at appraisal due to
the demand-driven nature of the project (IEG recommends costing a sample in such
circumstances19). At appraisal, the project introduced a simplified approach to assess the
efficiency of the sub-projects. The MDLF staff and technical consultants were to be
trained on the methodology to evaluate sub-projects submitted by municipalities.
Examples for calculating the economic efficiency of several types of potential
investments in sub-projects were provided.

3.40 The sub-projects implemented under the project were selected from the Strategic
Development and Investment Plans (SDIP) prepared by the communities in the
municipalities. These were small sub-projects (average US$50,000). The MDLF
maintained a unit price database, which was updated yearly and used for verification of
the budgets and cost estimates and for control of bidding prices.

3.41 Ex-post evaluation was conducted by the project team for the main types of
investments under Window 1 (roads and public facilities) and for revenue-generating
pilots under Window 2 (energy efficiency). The analysis of investments of US$45.8
million to rehabilitate or construct 310 kilometers of roads quantifies benefits from
savings in transport time and maintenance cost of vehicles and incorporates the cost of
maintaining the roads. The result shows an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 29.7. The

Technical Audit and Usability Assessment for the randomly selected eleven roads
projects found that local engineers relied on personal experiences and local traditions in
designing the roads rather than technical specifications and codes. According to the
report, these shortcomings were due to the absence of mandatory codes and regulations
for the design of urban internal roads. This raises a concern regarding the efficiency of
the road projects implemented under the project, since lower standards can reduce asset
life. However, since most of the roads were of an access nature, low standards in many
cases was acceptable. Sensitivity analysis carried out by the project team showed that
reducing benefits by 25 percent, lowers the ERR to 20.2 percent.

3.42 In public facilities, US$7.6 million were invested in 56 sub-projects to construct
new buildings, rehabilitate old buildings, and construct public gardens and parks. The
analysis quantifies benefits from savings in rentals and revenue from renting out space.
The result shows an ERR of 15.7 percent. Lowering benefits 25 percent, drops the ERR
to 8.2 percent just above the opportunity cost of capital (assumed to be 8 percent, which
is higher than the rate of 5 percent that the Palestinian Authority can borrow at).

3.43 The energy efficiency pilot invested US$533,547 in cost-saving electric
installations. Energy audits were undertaken prior to installation, and measurements were
carried out at the end of the trial period to verify savings. The results show an ERR of
22.8 percent, and a simple pay-back period of 2.2 years.

3.44 Overall, the efficiency of the project is rated Substantial, despite some concerns
about the design practices adopted because of local circumstances.

Project Ratings
OUTCOME

3.45 The relevance of the project objective is rated high, and the relevance of design is
also rated high. The achievement of the objective of improving municipal management
practices for better transparency is rated substantial as 96 percent of the municipalities
have graduated to a higher performance level based on the performance criteria
developed under the project. About 70 percent of the municipalities are applying at least
two public disclosure methods such as municipal budgets, strategic development plans, or
external audits. Efficiency is rated substantial. The overall outcome of the project is rated
Satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.46 The overall risk to development outcome of the project is rated Significant.
Despite the high risks external to the project and its implementing agencies, the risk to
the development outcome of the project is moderate. Projects in the West Bank and Gaza
are subject to risks external to the project such as the political, military and security
situation in the area which all have been high risks for a long time, and are highly likely
to continue in the future. These risks have been highest in Gaza which continues to face
harsher restrictions and military actions. The mitigating factors include (i) a stronger
implementing agency, the Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF),
                                                    34


committed to reform and to improving services by municipalities; (ii) municipalities that
are better equipped to manage their budgets and projects; and (iii) support of the
international community. The Bank and the funding partners continue the support
municipal reforms through follow-up projects (Municipal Development Projects II).

3.47 Given the limited local government financing in the West Bank and Gaza and the
continued strain on public resources from a weak revenue base and the stoppage of
transfer of Palestinian tax funds by Israel, the risk of continued operations and
maintenance of the new projects is substantial. The evaluation mission noted, however,
that public parks, community centers (except for the computer center), SCADA operated
water wells management systems and roads visited are well maintained and operated with
the resources available. Operations and maintenance manuals are now available and
being implemented in 10 municipalities, and are intended to be rolled out under MDP II.

3.48 Two other risks were identified in the ICR which were discussed during the
evaluation mission. The first risk is the pending approval of the MDLF law to confirm its
role in financing local governments. The law has not been passed because the responsible
authority, the cabinet, has not been meeting to pass laws due to the continued
postponement of elections. The President is reluctant to pass presidential decrees, and this
law is not currently a priority. At the same time, the Municipal Development and Lending
Fund (MDLF) and Ministry of Local Government (MOLG) informed the mission that the
non-passage of the law has not affected MDLF operations as it continues to operate based
the detailed existing by-laws that are in force. The mission reviewed the law, and the
MDLF and MOLG confirmed that the law does not require that all funds to
municipalities pass through the MDLF, a condition which several donors would not agree
to. The second risk mentioned in the ICR is the flow of other donor funds that do not
utilize the same reform criteria conditions as the MDLF. The evaluation mission, in
discussion with donors noted that (i) some of the donors have their own screening
criteria, many but not all of which are similar to those of the MDLF; and (ii) the local
government sector working group keeps donors abreast of the local government sector
and aims to unify donors approaches to the extent possible.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

3.49 The Bank’s performance at entry is rated Satisfactory. The project is a first phase
in a program for municipal development and reform in the Palestinian Territories. The
project’s design takes into account the lessons learned from previous projects including
the EMSRP II and the Local Government Capacity Building Project. One of the lessons
from ESMRP II was the need for collaboration among the various donors. MDP was
prepared collectively by the donors as a truly joint project to respond to the needs of the
borrower and beneficiaries. This included unified approach toward the results framework,
fiduciary management, and safeguards20.


20
  While the project was a joint effort, there was no pooling of funds (separate accounts for each Funding
Partners were kept for accounting purposes), but all FPs agreed to use World Bank procedures.
                                             35


3.50 The project was prepared in reasonable time. The concept review was in October
2008, and appraisal was in June 2009, following which the project was approved in
September 2009. All Bank requirements for readiness were met. Safeguards, risk
assessment and mitigation measures were adequate. The main risks were correctly
identified as project-external due to the socio-political conditions in Palestine. The
project was designed to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes to context, and
was based on a strong ownership of sub-projects and technical assistance at the local
level.

3.51 Project preparation drew upon the experience of several Bank and donor
supported projects in the Palestinian territories including the Local Government Capacity
Building and the First and Second Emergency Municipal Services Recovery Projects.
The Bank agreed with the donors on a common strategy for assessing municipal
performance and facilitated the leveraging of funds for the project based on a common
approach to sector reform. It is notable that the project included lessons of experience
from EMSRP II, and especially the shortcomings that were found by IEG’s review. For
example, fiduciary, safeguard, and results framework monitoring and reporting included
all donor funding and activities.

3.52 A minor shortcoming was a weak assessment of the need for staffing at the
Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF), particularly for the Gaza operation.
The PAD stated that the MDLF had the appropriate organizational structure in place and
that it had filled some of the key positions that were vacant at pre-appraisal (e.g., General
Director, Procurement Specialist, Public Relations Officer, and Capacity Building
Manager). However, there were other vacant positions (e.g. Procurement Manager,
Procurement Officer in Gaza, Municipal Finance Specialist and the Manager for Strategic
Development). Finally, the Bank was optimistic about the speed of implementation of the
first cycle.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

3.53 The Bank’s performance during supervision is rated Satisfactory.
Implementation support missions were conducted regularly and appropriate skills were
included in mission staffing. Supervision missions were carried out jointly with other
donors and all mission aide-memoires were prepared jointly. The MDLF provided all
donors with a joint financing report, thereby reducing the transaction cost for MDLF.
Field based staff was helpful in resolving problems in time. Missions were joint with the
financing partners who also had their staff based locally. The Funding Partners had
technical experts based in the field, and GIZ and DANIDA provided a full-time technical
assistant to the Ministry of Local Government, who worked regularly with the MDLF to
follow-up on any technical issues.

3.54 The Bank and all funding partners were members of the Sector Coordinating
Group of international donors and were active in the policy dialogue with the
Government. The mid-term review took place in May 2011 as scheduled. The project was
completed in a timely manner with a short extension of four months.
                                             36


3.55 Although, the project was jointly prepared in close coordination with the Funding
Partners, and supervision missions were carried out jointly - for the revision of key
performance indicators targets, the FPs partners were not fully aligned. The Bank
considered the targets too low, but the other partners did not want to adjust the targets
because their bilateral engagements were based on original targets. The negotiations with
the funding partners resulted in minor adjustment of the targets.

3.56   The Bank’s overall performance is rated Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

3.57 The Government’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
Government was represented by the Palestinian Authority, and the Ministry of Local
Government (MOLG). Both entities were highly committed to the project from its
inception and participated actively in its preparation. The Government took action to
bring donors together, participated as the chairman of the Sector Coordinating
Committee, and worked to align other donor financing with MDP performance criteria.

3.58 Until the clarification of the role of MDLF, the chairman of the Board of MDLF –
at the time the Minister of Local Government - was reluctant to delegate responsibilities
which caused delays.

3.59 At appraisal, the requirement for government contribution was not clear.21 Project
reporting indicates that the financing partners were requiring the Palestinian Authority
(PA) to make a contribution to the project as an indication of commitment to the
Municipal Development and Lending fund (MDLF) and to the transfer formula adopted
to promote municipal performance. The ICR shows an actual contribution of US$3.36
million by the Palestinian Authority. The additional financing project paper dated January
3, 2012, indicates a Borrower contribution requirement of US$4 million. During
evaluation mission, the MDLF reported that the Palestinian Authority provided financing,
but the contribution was often late. The Palestinian Authority was late in providing
counterpart funds for cycle one which led to delays in payment of contractors, and its
final contribution was less than required.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

3.60 The performance of Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) as the
implementing agency is rated Satisfactory. The MDLF learned from previous projects
financed by the Bank and the international community, in particular, the EMSRP II. The
MDLF acquired the necessary staffing and skills, and established appropriate systems and
methods to work with a number of financing partners. There were initial teething
problems in recruiting staff, which was completed 6 months following effectiveness and
as the security situation in Gaza allowed. There were also delays in initiating the first

21
  Source: PAD, Data Sheet Page (i); however, Annex 5 of the PAD lumps together contributions
from other donors with other funding from the PA.
                                            37


cycle of sub-projects. The MDLF had a large responsibility to inform 135 municipalities
of new rules and requirements to access funds under the MDP I. The MDLF prepared one
operational manual for the project, which satisfied World Bank and other Funding
Partners in terms of meeting their requirements.

3.61 The Municipal Development Fund (MDLF) Gaza office initially lacked key skills
for project implementation (e.g. social and planning skills). The Local Technical
Consultants hired to assist the municipalities in Gaza faced difficulties due to security
concerns and travel restrictions. The MDLF staff in Gaza was able to overcome this
through weekly audio conferences between with MDLF offices in Ramallah (West
Bank). By the Mid-Term Review an additional Community-Based Planner was hired by
the MDLF in Gaza which improved the situation. The main shortcoming of MDLF is
weak focus on O&M. MDLF was slow in developing the O&M manual.

3.62 The Municipal Development Fund (MDLF) ensured that the municipalities
understand the importance of and received a variety of capacity building packages that
would assist the municipalities in meeting the requirements and progress on the
performance ladder. MDLF initiated independent reports such as the Technical Audit and
the Municipal Ranking in order to verify critical information about the progress of the
project. The annual and quarterly reports presented by the MDLF were clear and
addressed project progress and results for each of the Funding Partners. MDLF is a
transparent agency, it publishes the reports and manuals prepared under the project on a
well-organized website.

3.63   The Borrower’s overall performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
M&E DESIGN

3.64 The MDP project incorporated lessons learned from EMSRP II including lessons
from the IEG evaluation. The key performance indicators addressed directly the
objectives of the project in terms of improvement in municipal management and
transparency. The first key performance indicator: the percentage of municipalities that
graduate up the performance category reflects the improvements of all municipalities in
their management performance. The second key performance indicator directly measured
the transparency improvements of municipalities. This was also a requirement from
municipalities under the project, and that is to make public their budgets and ranking,
strategic development plans, audit reports and project related data. Baseline and targets
for sub-project outputs were not determined at appraisal due to the demand-driven nature
of sub-projects. Project preparation included a beneficiary satisfaction assessment which
informed the design of the project and was the baseline for the follow-up beneficiary
satisfaction assessment at the end of the project.

M&E IMPLEMENTATION

3.65 The Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) used the key monitoring
indicators to monitor progress of municipalities toward achieving the targets set for them
                                                   38


and to move up the performance ladder in order to determine their grant allocations. The
performance measures were monitored annually as they were the conditions for receiving
grants. The survey of municipalities to determine their ranking was conducted by an
independent consultants. Progress was reported to the funding partners. Key outcome
indicators (percentage of municipalities achieving the targets) were surpassed quickly by
the end of cycle 1. A shortcoming of the M&E implementation is that targets were
revised only moderately (from 25 percent to 30 percent for the first key indicator and
from 50 percent to 60 percent for indicator 2) after the additional financing. Nevertheless,
the key targets were exceeded at the end of the project (96 percent and 68 percent
respectively). The MDLF maintained detailed records of the physical outputs of the sub-
projects and their achievements and engaged independent consultants to assess the
technical, environmental and use of a sample of sub-projects.22 A follow-up beneficiary
survey was conducted to assess the satisfaction of citizen’s with municipal services.

M&E UTILIZATION

3.66 The results framework was used as a tool to implement and assess project
progress toward achievement of objectives. The indicators were designed to be the
benchmarks against which municipal performance is measured and how grants are
allocated. An end of the project beneficiary assessment was undertaken to assess the
changes in citizens’ attitudes toward their local governments and the services they
provided under the project. The results of the survey were used by KfW to provide an
empirical impact assessment of the project which alleviated the concern that the
allocation/transfer formula is biased toward richer and larger municipalities. Poor
municipalities did not fall behind in terms of service provision. The results framework
and monitoring indicators are continually upgraded to raise the bar for municipalities as
they receive capacity building packages and apply the requirements of the project for
improving their performance. Finally, the results framework and the beneficiary survey
supported the preparation of the follow-up project MDP II.

3.67    Overall, M&E is rated Substantial.

4. Lessons
4.1    Since MDP I closed, the Bank and the funding partners provided additional
financing for a follow-up project: the Municipal Development Project II. The experience
under MDP I encouraged the funding partners and the recipient to utilize MDP I’s modes
of implementation through the MDLF. The performance indicators have been tightened,
and municipalities have to perform even better. This is intentional in order to reach
higher objectives of the program for municipal sector reform that were agreed on
between the Palestinian Authority and international donors. MDP I by design has
provided valuable lessons to the follow-up projects and for the overall local government
reform program in the Palestinian territories.

The main lessons are:
    A common donor approach to project design and implementation can yield
     positive results by utilizing and strengthening the same implementing agency,
     using a consistent results framework, aligning fiduciary and safeguards
     requirements, using similar criteria in selecting and implementing projects, and
     conducting joint supervision missions. In the case of MDP I, this approach
     avoided duplication of the efforts of the implementing agency and provided a
     common platform through a sector steering committee to agree on reform and
     next steps. Working through multiple institutional players can enhance policy and
     operational outcomes, but requires upfront that mechanisms are developed to
     formalize institutional partnerships with clearly defined common targets and
     timetables.
    The programmatic approach used in the Municipal Development Program
     allows for the evolution of effective reform solutions through identifying needs
     in road management, designing and implementing capacity building efforts, and
     learning from experience. The design and implementation of MDP I was adjusted
     based on lessons learned from the EMSRP II, and the results, measured through
     indicators, were improved.
    The inability to combine resources of the many financing partners can
     adversely affect the size of projects and the composition of the sub-projects.
     In the case of MDP I, this led to a concentration of funds in the roads sector,
     where investments could be modular, but conversely this led to the funding of
     projects that were not necessarily the first priority to the communities. Numerous
     small projects tend to strain the capacities of the Municipal Development and
     Lending Fund and its staff. On the other hand, smaller funds and stricter access
     may deter the larger municipalities from seeking further funding.
    Use of local codes, materials, and experiences in building roads instead of
     internationally accepted technical standards lowers costs, but can also
     compromise quality. The lack of standard materials in the case of Gaza led to
     local innovation in use of local material; rubble was made into brick like shapes
     (interloctyles). However, the life of these materials is unknown. The Technical
     Audit and Usability Assessment prepared under MDP I highlighted the reasons
     for the low costs for roads construction, including reliance on experience rather
     than technical specifications and codes, as well as using lower standards.
