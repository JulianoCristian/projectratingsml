Some lessons learned included:\n            a common donor approach to project design and implementation\n            can yield positive results by utilizing and strengthening\n            the same implementing agency, using a consistent results\n            framework, aligning fiduciary and safeguards requirements,\n            using similar criteria in selecting and implementing\n            projects, and conducting joint supervision missions. The\n            programmatic approach used in the Municipal Development\n            Program allows for the evolution of effective reform\n            solutions through identifying needs in road management,\n            designing and implementing capacity building efforts, and\n            learning from experience. The inability to combine resources\n            of the many financing partners can adversely affect the size\n            of projects and the composition of the sub-projects. Use of\n            local codes, materials, and experiences in building roads\n            instead of internationally accepted technical standards\n            lowers costs, but can also compromise quality."}, "docdt": "2015-06-16T13:25:03Z"}
