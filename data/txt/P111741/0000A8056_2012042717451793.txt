                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The objective of the Municipal Development Program (Phase 1) is to improve municipal management practices for better transparency. The project is meeting its Key Performance
                         Indicator targets and is, in some cases, exceeding these. An anticipated 82% of municipalities will graduate into a higher performance category by 2011 (target is 15% by year 2); and
                         69% of municipalities disclosed information in at least two of three areas (a) financial data and municipal budgets, (b) municipal ranking, (c) projects and achievements (survey
                         realized in 2011) (target was 30% in year 2). Consequently, achievement of the project development objective is rated satisfactory.

                         There has been some delay in the implementation of cycle 1 of this two cycle project. However, 95% of investment sub-projects are completed and disbursement was at 80% by the
                         end of October, 2011 and expected to rise to 95% by the end of 2011. Consequently, implementation progress is rated satisfactory.
