                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the second cycle of the program. The project is meeting (and in some cases exceeding) its Key Performance Indicator targets: 86% of municipalities graduated into a higher
                         performance category at the end of cycle 1 (target was 15% by year 2); and 68% of municipalities disclosed information in at least two of three areas (a) financial data and municipal
                         budgets, (b) municipal ranking, (c) projects and achievements (survey realized in 2011) (target was 30% in year 2). Consequently, achievement of the project development objective
                         is rated satisfactory.

                         Even though Cycle 2 has started, and is progressing in a satisfactory manner; the Palestinian Authority (PA) will request a project extension in order to accommodate a delayed start
                         to several capacity building packages, and some anticipated delays in a few civil works packages. The capacity building work was delayed so that it could start after the local
                         government elections which were concluded in late October, 2012 and the MDLF anticipate some delays in the start of civil works packages, especially in Gaza, due to the recent
