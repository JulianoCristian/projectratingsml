The physical\n            objectives of the project were substantially achieved. A new\n            25 MW diesel plant was added to the system; transmission\n            lines, substations and a modern load dispatch center were\n            constructed; and distribution systems were expanded.\n            However, the project was completed 28 months behind schedule\n            with a cost overrun of 25 percent. The delay in the\n            installation of the power plant resulted in power shortages\n            in the period 1975-76. Although the rate of return for the\n            power plant is negative, Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y\n            Electrificacion (IRHE) overall investment program continued\n            having a high rate of return comparable to appraisal\n            estimates. Although energy sales grew much slower than\n            expected, the timing of the project was not premature, as\n            the new power plant has been used to meet peak demand in\n            normal hydrological years and to replace hydro-energy during\n            dry periods."}, "docdt": "1982-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
