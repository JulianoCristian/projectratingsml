Technical assistance would be provided to: (i)\n            strengthen the system for metropolitan planning; (ii)\n            establish a system for financial programming and budgeting;\n            (iii) improve the collection of existing taxes and service\n            charges using an improved urban cadastral system as a\n            revenue generating tool; and (iv) develop the\n            Municipality's project preparation capabilities. The\n            project would also finance pilot developments in: (i) a\n            metropolitan solid waste collection and disposal component\n            to test the capacity of the municipality to plan, coordinate\n            and deliver a major service; (ii) a market rehabilitation\n            component which would implement physical and administrative\n            improvements in one of the eight zonal markets which form\n            part of the city's food distribution network; and (iii)\n            a traffic management component which would include low-cost\n            improvements in the transit network."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
