There were no disbursements under\n            the loan except for the front-end fee. A Bank supervision\n            mission in November 1983 detected a basic loss of commitment\n            on the part of the Central Government toward the strict\n            financial measures required at the local level. Without\n            those measures, attainment of project objectives was\n            jeopardized. In January 1984, the Government confirmed the\n            municipality's inability to provide counterpart funds.\n            In February 1984, the municipality requested that the loan\n            be cancelled for macroeconomic reasons. Although the Bank\n            did not discount the country's difficult macroeconomic\n            situation, it felt that political considerations were more\n            to blame for the project's demise. The project called\n            for a disciplined approach to municipal management. The loan\n            agreement contained covenants requiring stricter enforcement\n            of land tax and other financial and accounting measures.\n            Also, the project supported a reduction in the city's\n            blue collar workforce. The Bank concluded that the project\n            was too politically sensitive to be implemented. As a result\n            of cancellation, the project's institutional impact was\n            nil and there were no benefits to be sustained. The overall\n            project rating is unsatisfactory. No audit is planned. The\n            Bank's experience with this project illustrates the\n            pitfalls of attempting to deal with a Government\n            characterized by highly centralized decision making, lack of\n            clear economic policy, uncertain commitment to reform, and\n            weak institutional capacity. The Bank has learned to move\n            cautiously in the Dominican Republic."}, "docdt": "1993-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
