INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCITATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
FOR A LIVESTOCK DEVELOPI'IENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the L'ollowing report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$5 million to
the Dominican Republic.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The proposed credit wrould be the second by IDA to the Dominican
Republic, Because of its difficult balance of payments positLon, noted in Pa;'t V
and discussed in the Economic Report, the Dominican Republic is not
presently regarded as eligible for Bank loans except for projects of an
enclave type, such as that made to Falconbridge Dominicana, C. por A.
on December 10, 1969.
3,       A Bank Group Economic Mission wihich visited the Dominican
Republic in early 1969 identified the favorable possibilities for the
accelerated development of livestock in the Dominican Republic and a
Bank Group expert assisted in the preparation of the project during 1969,
The Government requested financial assistance from the Association for
it in April 1970. The project was appraised in September 1970 and
negotiations were held on February 16 - 19 and March 18 - 19.   The
Government and the Central Bank were represented by Messrs. Diogenes
Fernandez, Governor of the Central Bank, Juan Esteban Hernandez, Manager
of the Central Bank and Juan 0. Velasquez, General Counsel of the
Central Bank.
4.       The following is a summary statement on the Bank loan and the
IDA credit to the Dominican Republic as at MIarch 31, 1971.

Construction and disbursements under the Falconbridge loan are on schedule.
The education credit -- not yet effective -- wTas approved by the Board
on November 24, 1970 and signed on February 18, 1971. The signing was
delayed pending agreement upon the appointment of the Project Director.
5.       No other projects are at an advanced stage of consideration.
Projects in the fields of irrigation, industrial credit, water supply,
tourism and highways are now at various stages of preparation for
later consideration by IDA.
6.       There has been no IFC operation in the Dominican Republic to
date.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.       Borrower:                     The Dominican Republic.
Amount:                        In various currencies equivalent to
US$5 million.
Beneficiaries:                Participating ranchers
Purpose:                      To provide financial and technical
assistance for approximately 260
beef and dairy ranches to increase
production through modern teciniques.
Amortization:                 In 50 years, including a 10-year period
of grace, through semi-annual
installments of one-half of 1% from
May 15, 1981 through November 15,
1990 and of 16 from May 15, 1991
through November 15, 2020.
Service Charge:               3/4 of 1% per annum
Relending Terms:              Subloans to ranchers would be for
seven to ten years, with grace
periods of two to four years, at
a 9% per annum interest rate.
Economic Rate of Return:      21 percent (cf. paragraph 12 below).

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.         The appraisal report entitled "Livestock Development Project
Dominican Republic" (PA-71a) is attached.
9.         The mainstay of the Dominican Republic is agriculture, which
now accounts for 25% of GDP, at least 60% of total employment and 90%
of the value of commodity exports. The country is particularly well
suited to the development of livestock. It is estimated that from
one-third to one-half of its available arable land is better suited to
grazing and livestock production than to anything else and a favorable
export market exists in the U.S., particularly in nearby Puerto Rico,
and in other Caribbean islands. Its development has been hampered,
however, by inadequate technology and a shortage of development credit
even though financing had been made available to small ranchers by IDB
through the Agricultural Bank. The prospects for further growth of
beef cattle are favorable for both the domestic market and export and
an expansion of dairying is of high priority to meet domestic needs.
10.        The project consists of the development of 260 beef ranches
and dairy farms in the Eastern, Northern and Cibao regions through
credit and technical services. Project funds would be channeled by
the Central Bank's Department of International Agreements (DIA) to
ranchers through financial intermediaries including commercial banks
and the Agricultural Bank. The alternative of making the IDA Credit
available directly and exclusively through the Agricultural Bank was
judged inappropriate because of the importance of developing additional
channels of lending to agriculture. On-ranch development subloans
would be granted for land clearing and preparation, pasture establish-
ment and renovation, fencing, watering points, cattle handling
facilities, machinery and equipment and purchase of cattle. Participa-
ting credit institutions would *-fitani& shbrt-term loans for working
capital requirements wihile rediscounting with DIA 100% of on-ranch
development loans.   The contribution of IDA, the Central Bank, participa-
ting credit institutions and ranchers would be 55i%%, %15, 13% and 17%
respectively.
11.        Ranchers, who are likely to be commercial operators, will
receive loans from participating financial institutions at 9 percent,
the same interest rate as is charged to industrial borrowers by DIA.
These loans wrill be discounted at 5 percent by the Central Bank. The
Central Bank will receive funds from the Government out of the proceeds
of IDA's credit, paying interest to the Government at 3.5 pcrtent and
repaying the principal on the same schedule as that of IDA's credit.
The Central Bank would use the difference between the repayments it
received from the participating banks and the repayments it had to make
to the Government for further lending to agriculture. The IDB has
already made a loan for small ranchers and is contemplating a further
similar loan. To avoid confusion the Government intends to restrict
the use of the proposed credit to ranch development loans of more than
U&S` 10,000.

12.      The economic rate of return of the project is estimated
at 2lpi. In addition, there would be substantial non-quantifiable
benefits, particularly the introduction of superior livestock production
techniques, the building of local expertise and encouraging credit
institutions to become familiar with livestock development financing.
13.      The cost of the project is estimated at approximately US$9
million (including working capital). The proposed credit of US45.o
million would finance the foreign exchange component of about US$2.4
million and US$2.6 million of local costs. This is justified because
the fulfillment of the country's development program, modest as it is,
will require funds in excess of the domestic savings and public and
private capital that can be expected from external sources. These
funds cannot reasonably be provided to the country in adequate amounts
if the foreign exchange component of development projects alone were
to be financed. In financing this project IDA should also exert a
beneficial influence on the country's development since the project
is a key element in the Dominican strategy to diversify agricultural
output and strengthen the structure of the balance of payments.
14.      Goods required for the project Twould be procured through
existing commercial channels. Individual contracts would be small
and numerous. There are sufficiently competitive outlets for both
local and imported goods needed for the project, and duties and taxes
on them are low.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRTIENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Dominican
Republic and the Association and the draft Project Agreement between
the Central Bank and the Association and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Artic'les of
Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in agreements for
agricultural credit projects. A Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory
to the Association, between the Government and the Central Bank will
be executed on the same date as the Development Credit Agreement and
the Project Agreement, and will include an amortization schedule on the
same terms as provided for the Government under the Development Credit
Agreement. The relending to ranchers through participating banks will
be governed by the terms of the Project Agreement and of a Project
Administration Agreement, to be entered between the Cential Bank and
each participating credit institution (Section 2.04 of the Draft Project
Agreement).

PART V - THE ECO,1OMY
16.      A new economic report, "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of the Dominican. Republic" (CA-8) is boing distributud separately.  A basic
data sheet is annexed. The report notes the uncertainty surrounding
the country's balance of payments prospects, which hinge upon continued
access at favorable terms to the U.S. Sugar market, Even on the basis
of optimistic assumptions, the Republic's future capacity to service
external debt on conventional terms is judged to be severely limited,
The report also notes the Government's successful efforts in carrying
out effective fiscal and monetary policies with the result that public
investment has expanded significantly, prices have been fairly stable
and balance of payments surpluses have been recorded in the past few
years. However, in view of the basic balance of payments weakness,
and an international reserve position which as of the end of 1970 wHas
negative to the extent of US$10.6 million, the Dominican Republic is
properly following a general policy of obtaining external loans on con-
cessional terms whenever possible.
PART VI - COIMPLIAINqCE WITH ARTICLES OF AC-REEMENT
17.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VIIr - RECOIfENDATION
18.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
