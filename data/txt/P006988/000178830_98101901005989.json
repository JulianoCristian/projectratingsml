The project financed\n            imports of industrial inputs needed to restore production,\n            provided local counterpart funds for the purchase of an\n            emergency power plant, and supported implementation of other\n            projects in the power sector. From a balance of payment\n            support view, the loan provided financing for twenty percent\n            of the increase in the deficit of goods and services during\n            1980, when the major impact of the hurricanes was felt.\n            Moreover, with the provision of local currency, the loan\n            financed 7-8 percent of the public sector deficit. The loan\n            also contributed substantially to government efforts to\n            restore and expand electricity services, which were\n            essential for the country to resume production.\n            Nevertheless, this assistance was delayed by ten months\n            mainly because the Dominican Congress did not ratify the\n            loan documents as early as needed. Because of the delay, the\n            loan did not provide the balance-of-payments relief at the\n            time it was most needed. This brings into question the\n            desirability and effectiveness of Bank financing of\n            emergency projects in the Dominican Republic in the future."}, "docdt": "1982-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
