PROJECT COI 7LETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
URGENT IMTORT REQUIREMENTS
LOAN 1782-DO
PREFACE
This is a Completion Report of the Urgent Import
Requirements Project, for which Loan 1782-DO was approved on
December 18, 1979 for US$25 million. It was fully disbursed on
December 9, 1980. The objective of the loan was to provide
assistance to the Government's hurricane reconstruction program,
by financing urgently needed imports of raw materials, semi-
finished and final goods to restore national production.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Latin
America and Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of a country
visit in April 1982, the President's Report of November 29, 1979,
and a study of the files. Comments received by the Borrower are
attached as an Appendix.
The project has not been audited by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

r                                           HIGHLIGHTS
The project achieved its limited objective of assisting the
Dominican Government in its reconstruction efforts by financing imports
of industrial inputs needed to restore production, and by providing local
counterpart funds for the purchase of an emergency power plant, and for
implementation of other projects in the power sector. Nevertheless, this
assistance was delayed by ten months mainly because the Dominican Congress
did not ratify the loan documents early as needed.
Because of the above delay, the loan did not provide the
balance-of-payments relief at the time it was most needed. This brings
into question the desirability and effectiveness of Bank financing of
emergency projects in the Dominican Republic in the future.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
URGENT IMPORT REQUIREMENTS
LOAN 1782-DO
I. INTRODUCTION
Loan Origin and Preparation
1.                 A special mission visited the Dominican Republic on
September 9-14, 1979, in response to a request by the Dominican Government
for hurricane reconstruction assistance. Hurricanes David and Frederick had
hit the Dominican Republic on August 31 and September 2, causing considerable
damage to property. A subsequent mission (October 14, 1979) obtained data on
the economic impact of the disasters, and on the Government's reconstruction
program, and proposed that the Bank assist the country's reconstruction
effort with a US$25 million Urgent Import Requirements loan to finance
imports of raw materials, semi-manufactured and final goods to restore
national production (Loan 1782-DO); and with a US$25 million Emergency Road
Reconstruction loan.
2.                 The economic impact of the disasters derived from direct
loss of p-roduction due to destruction of crops and livestock, damage to goods
and interruption of services, mainly of public utilities, distribution and
transport; as well as indirect losses due to damage to infrastructure and
productive capacity.   Production losses were estimated at RD$400 million.
3.                 The deficit in the current account in the balance of
payments increased from US$319 million in 1978, to US$341 million in 1979,
owing to extensive damage to coffee, cocoa and sugar crops, reduced earnings
from non-traditional exports as a result of damage to factories and infra-
structure, and an increased level of imports needed to replace inventories
and meet equipment needs to resume production. In 1980, the deficit in the
current account increased to US$670, of which US$120 million were the result
of hurricane damage.
4.                 Current Government revenues fell in 1979 as a result of
loss in production in general, especially in cocoa and coffee, thus making
more difficult the already tight government fiscal situation. The overall
public sector deficit was of the order of US$286 million in 1979, and of
US$335 million in 1980, which included US$110 million of emergency
expenditures.
5.                  The Government's reconstruction program provided for the
restoration of essential services and domestic food and export production
capability; and adjustment of the three-year investment program to achieve a
blend of replacement and improvement in resource availability. In agri-
culture, emphasis was placed in programs of soil preparation, fertilizer
application, and provision of seeds to induce the recovery of food and export



-2-
crops, The transport programs emphasized reconstruction of roads and
bridges, ports and wharves. Repairs to the power generation and distribution
system were started immediately after the hurricanes to provide services on
an emergency basis, but longer-term reconstruction needs involved mostly
imports of foreign materials to repair generation, transmission and
distribution facilities. The industrial sector required increased credit to
replace inventories and restore working capital.
6.                 Negotiations of the Urgent Imports Requirements loan were
held in Washington on November 15, 1979. The Borrower was the Dominican
Republic, and the Central Bank was the implementing agency. The Borrower was
represented by the Under-Secretary of Finance and the Director of
International Agreements of the Central Bank. No major changes to the loan
documents were made during negotiations. Nevertheless, the Bank wanted to
ensure that only goods necessary for reconstruction would be eligible for
reimbursement under the loan, but did not wish to elaborate a detailed list
of exemptions, since it was impossible to forsee all possible items not
eligible. It was agreed that the Loan Agreement would include a sentence to
indicate that final consumption goods would not be financed by loan proceeds.
7.                 Loan effectiveness was delayed until August 20, 1980,
because the Dominican Congress did not ratify the Loan Agreement until July
3, 1980, and the required Congressional Resolution and Legal opinion were
not received by the Bank until mid-August. Immediately after the loan was
declared effective, the Central Bank submitted the documentation required for
disbursement, and the total proceeds of the loan (US$25 million) were
disbursed on August 25, 1980.
Loan Objectives and Description
8.                 The US$25 million loan was equivalent to about 7 percent of
the value of imports during 1978 in the eligible Brussels Tariff Nomenclature
sections, covering a range of imports required for hurricane reconstruction.
Disbursement was made on the basis of evidence of entry of the goods into the
country and release of foreign exchange by the Central Bank.  Customs
warrants and invoices provided evidence of entry and of classification and
value of imports while copies of drafts provided evidence of payment to
suppliers. The loan also made available RD$25 million of local currency
resources to the Government to finance reconstruction and development
projects in the public sector, in the light of diminished current revenues in
1979, and slower revenue growth in 1980.
II. UTILIZATION OF THE LOAN
9.                 As indicated in para.  7, effectiveness of the loan was
delayed for ten months, and so were disbursements. The Central Bank had been
ready with the required reimbursement documentation for submission to the
Bank since December 1979. Full disbursement of the loan was requested on
August 20, 1980. The Central Bank selected imports which entered the
country after October 1, 1979 falling within the following sections of the
BTN:

VII -           Manufacture of plastic and
rubber, natural and synthetic        .2               .8
XV -           Base Metals and manufactures

electrical                         6.7              26.8
Only invoices valued in excess of US$2,000 were considered for reimbursement.
10.                The proceeds of the loan were credited to the reserves of
the Central Bank, and an equivalent amount in Dominican Pesos (determined at
the official foreign exchange rate) was deposited in a special account at the
Central Bank in the name of the Government for purposes of counterpart
financing of reconstruction and development projects.
11.                On August 7, 1980 when the Dominican Congress ratified the
loan, it also resolved to allow CDE full use of the local currency
equivalent of the loan to assist it in meeting its reconstruction and
investment needs. As a result, CDE submitted to the Central Bank for
approval and submission to the Bank, a schedule of counterpart requirements
for a total of RD$25 million. RD$10 million were to be used for the purchase
of an emergency thermal generation plant to be installed in Puerto Plata in
April 1980, and the remaining RD$15 million to be disbursed over a period of
one year (September 1980-August 1981), upon presentation of documentation on
expenditures incurred by CDE, as follows:
Purpose                                      Amount
(Million RD$)
Haina V Thermal Plant                                      .5

Rehabilitation Jimenoa Dam                                1.3
The above proposal by CDE was approved by the Central Bank with concurrence
by the Bank. The funds were disbursed as scheduled.

12.                The loan Document required tnat the special account be
audited by the Secretariat of Finance six months after the funds were fully
disbursed, and that the Audit Report be submitteed to the Bank. This report
has not yet been submitted to the Bank. The Central Bank has indicated that
the Audit will be carried out in August-September 1982, and that the report
will be submitted to the Bank in October, 1982.
III. CONCLUSIONS
13.                The objectives of the loan were to assist in the
reconstruction efforts undertaken by the Dominican government to restore
production capacity and growth, which the provision of imports of essential
building materials and replacement of inventories, facilitated. These
objectives were fully met, although with some delay. From a balance of
payment support view, the loan provided financing for twenty percent of the
increase in the deficit of goods and services during 1980, when the major
impact of the hurricanes was felt. Moreover, with the provision of local
currency, the loan financed 7-8 percent of the public sector deficit. The
loan also contributed substantially to government efforts to restore and
expand electricity services, which were essential for the country to resume
production.
