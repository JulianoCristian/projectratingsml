BURMA
I.   THE TELECOM]MUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma covers an area of
nearly 263,000 square miles and has a population of about 33 million. The
Burmese economy depends primarily on the agricultural and forestry sectors,
although minerals and oil resources are also being exploited. Substantial
economic activity is concerned with itrade and movement of primary products.
The economy is presently operating below its potential. Improved performance
requires not only a higher level of investment in the productive sectors of
the economy, but also better managemesnt at all levels in all sectors. The
inadequacy of the present telecommun:ications network is a constraint on
output of the productive sectors and prevents the efficient use of the
limited transport capacity. Because of this and the contribution that tele-
communications can make to national administration, Government places high
priority on improved telecommunication services.
1.02      Burma's public telecommunication facilities are state-owned.
Government control of the sector is vested in the Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MTC).  The development and operation of domestic and inter-
national postal, telephone, telegraph, and telex services in the country were
the responsibility of a department in the Ministry until May 1975 when MTC
established the Posts and TelecommuniLcations Corporation (PTC) which assumed
these responsibilities.
1.03      A small Posts and Telecommunications Department (PTD) under a
Director General has been retained in the Ministry of Transport and Com-
munications (MTC) to provide liaison with international bodies such as the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), for the general regulation
and licensing of radio equipment and for advice to the Minister on national
telecommunications policy. The defense services and civil aviation authori-
ties maintain telecommunication facilities for their own specialized needs.
At the present time Burma does not have any industries manufacturing tele-
communications equipment.   However, PTC has its own workshop which repairs
telecommunication equipment and assembles manual telephone switchboards of
various sizes. Basic data on existing facilities are given in Annex 1 and a
description of these facilities is in Annex 2.
Access to Service
1.04      Burma's telephone density ]/ of 0.1 per 100 population is among
the lowest in the world. A comparison with nearby countries as of January
1978 shows Nepal and Bangladesh, 0.1;; India and Pakistan, 0.4; Sri Lanka,
0.5; and Thailand, 0.8. The average for Asia excluding Japan is 1.0, while
the world average is 10.4. The density for North America is 72.5 (Annex 3).
1/   Telephone density is defined as the number of telephones per 100 popula-
tion.



1.05      Telephone densities in both urban and rural areas in Burma are
extremely low (Annex 4), as shown below:
As of March 31, 1979                Urban 1/      Rural       Total
Population (thousands)                7,772      24,198      31,970
Number of telephones                 34,209          83      34,292
Telephones per 100 population          0.44      negli-        0.11
gible
1.06      Access to telephone service in rural villages is almost non-
existent. Even in the townships 2/ with administrative headquarters, only
173 out of the total of 314 in Burma have telephone exchanges and 34 have
only public call offices (PCOs) (Annexes 5 and 6 and table below).
Access to Telephones                Townships 3/        Villages

Total          314   100.0      12,845  100.0
1.07      Due to a long period of stagnation in investment, in 1977, regi-
stered telephone availability 3/ was about 61%. By March 1979, the number of
waiting applications had increased to about 24,000, which was nearly 90% of
the number of existing connections. Hence telephone availability had declined
to an even more inadequate 52%. The extent to which the demand for telephones
has grown more rapidly than supply over the 1977 to 1979 period is shown
below:
Registered            Telephone
March 31 of Year      DELs        Waiting Lists        Availability (%)
1977           24,557          15,545                 61.2
1978           25,076          21,108                 54.3
1979           26,662          24,150                 52.4
1/   Urban areas include Rangoon, Mandalay and other provincial cities.
2/   Townships as used in this report refer to administrative units of the
states and divisions of Burma, and do not relate necessarily to urban
centers.
3/   Telephone availability is defined as a percentage of direct exchange
lines (DELs) to the sum of DELs and waiting applications.



- 3 -
Current unsatisfied demand is undoubtedly much higher than the officially
registered 24,150 waiting applications since waiting lists are not kept in
towns and rural area,s wberc  telephone service does not yet exist and because
the long waiting periods tend to discourage many potential subscribers from
registering at all (paragraph 1.11). Most existing applicants in Burma
currently have no chance of getting a telephone until new installations
under the first and second projects are completed.
Usage of Service
1.08      Overall statistics relating to the usage of telephones by classi-
fication of user type are not available in Burma, partially because tariffs
are not differentiated among business, government, and residential consumers.
A recent survey in the Rangoon area, however, indicated that business and
government subscribers represent approximately 61% of the total. A major
portion of the telephones located in residential premises are also used
primarily for government or business purposes. PTC estimates that in Rangoon
approximately 98% of all calls made during peak business hours, and hence
those which determine system capacity costs, are business and government
related. In the provincial towns and smaller cities, almost 100% of the
subscribers are government or business related establishments.
Quality of Service
1.09      The quality of local telephone service is poor.  In Rangoon, during
business hours telephones are in use a high proportion of the time due prima-
rily to the low penetration. Hence called party busy conditions and repeat
call attempts seriously overload central exchanges. The system needs
urgent rehabilitation. Outside of Rangoon where at the present time only
manual exchange service is available, old and obsolete equipment and the
inherent delays in manual operations result in poor service. The time re-
quired to clear technical faults is relatively long and complaints are
numerous.
1.10      The present domestic long distance service is deficient with delays
of as much as 12 to 18 hours on som-e routes on ordinary calls. The quality
of speech is in most cases unsatisfactory, due to poor transmission on open
wire lines. The quality of the international telephone service has improved
from March 1979 with the commissioning of an earth station in Rangoon.
The international telegraph and telex services are satisfactory.
Demand for Service
1.11      As a result of the lack of investment in the sector over a long
period, and the inadequacy of regist:ered demand and waiting lists which have
not been systematically maintained, it is difficult to accurately forecast
the demand for telecommunication services in Burma (paragraph 1.07). To the
extent that they are available, current and historical records do not give
the picture since (a) experience in other countries suggests that as quality
of service improves, demand increases rapidly since the telephone becomes the



- 4 -
least cost means of communications for an increasing variety of productive
uses, and (b) the increasing pace of new applications in a recently installed
exchange in Rangoon and some new provincial exchanges suggests that even
current updated waiting lists do not reflect a large amount of latent demand
for telephone connections. Given these limitations, PTC has estimated
that the demand for telephone connections, the sum of direct exchange linr_
(DELs) and waiting lists, will grow at about 10% per annum and will increase
from about 51,000 in early 1978 to about 90,000 in 1985 (Annexes 7 and 8).
This forecast is conservative but acceptable.
1.12      The demand for telex services is also difficult to forecast.  Cur-
rently, Burma is served with a manual telex service with 41 subscribers and
has a pending registered waiting list of 40 applicants. This is likely to
increase significantly when automatic telex service is established in 1980.
It is estimated that the number of subscribers will increase from about 80
in 1980 to 400 by 1985. This is in line with experience in similar develop-
ing countries.
Sector Goals
1.13      The broad sector objectives are to improve the quality of tele-
communication services to existing subscribers, provide access to new sub-
scribers in existing service areas, and to extend communications to the more
important urban and rural areas currently without service. In addition,
priority will be given to the establishment of essential telecommunication
services needed to facilitate the more efficient use of limited transport
capacity. The quality and availability of telecommunication services also
will be improved by providing additional facilities, reducing congestion, and
replacing old and obsolete equipment. The main strategy for achieving these
objectives is to obtain financing for and to implement a balanced and inte-
grated development program in the sector, to carry out basic institution
building in order to continue improvement in organization, development and
operation of the sector, and to improve productivity through training and the
introduction of modern facilities.
1.14      With this end in view, the Government has approved a high priority
investment program, of which the proposed second project is an integral part,
to install about 40,000 additional lines of telephone exchange equipment with
associated local and long distance networks. This program includes installa-
tion of small telephone exchanges in 54 of the 107 township centers currently
without service and public call offices at 13 currently unserved villages. In
addition, it provides for the installation of maritime and radio telephone
systems for serving transportation and remote access areas. As can be seen
from the following table, the program, which includes the proposed new project
and part of the ongoing project, will be appreciably larger than any under-
taken in the past, both in terms of investment and physical installations.

Sector Constraints
1.15      The major constraint which has impeded progress in the telecom-
munications sector has been the lack of adequate investment. Prior to 1976,
investment in the sector was insignificant. However, the growth in invest-
ment has increased through IDA's support under the first project (FYs76-80).
Improvements have also been effected in PTC's financial, accounting and
project execution areas, although PTC still suffers from low productivity and
currently lacks adequate capability for long-term planning. These issues are
addressed in detail in Chapter IV.
IDA's Role
1.16      IDA has so far been the main source of recent financing for telecom-
munications development. Credit 551-BA for US$21 million provided in 1975 to
support PTC's FYs76-79 development program was the first Bank Group lending to
this sector in Burma. This program allowed for the installation of about



-6-
17,000 lines of local exchange equipment and associated local and long
distance network to partially meet the demand for new telephone connections.
To meet a cost increase on cables and switching equipment due to higher than
expected price levels, additional financing was arranged with OPEC Fund for
US$3.14 million in October 1977. Procurement of a few items such as open wire
carrier systems and a billing processor was deferred to the second project
(paragraph 2.03). A further cost increase of about US$3.5 million is antici-
pated due to recent exchange variations between the Japanese yen and the US
dollar which took place after award of contracts in 1977. This is proposed to
be met from the second credit (paragraph 2.02).
1.17      After initial delays resulting mainly from longer than expected
time taken in preparation of specifications, procurement, and contracting,
and from delays in civil works, the first project is now proceeding satisfac-
torily. The credit was fully disbursed by September 1979. The project is
expected to be completed by mid-1980. Improvement in the local and long
distance and international services is expected as a result of the ongoing
works. Some progress has been achieved in the organization with the intro-
duction of a new Development Project Department (paragraph 4.03) and a tariff
increase in FY77 has improved PTC's financial position, (paragraph 5.04).
Other institutional reforms in areas of training (paragraph 4.06) and account-
ing (paragraphs 4.07 and 4.08) are also proceeding satisfactorily. The
covenants of the Credit Agreement are being met, except the submission of
audited financial statements within six months after the end of fiscal year;
PTC expects in future to comply with this covenant with the improved account-
ing procedures and the use of data processing equipment (paragraphs 4.09 and
4.14).
1.18      A credit is now proposed for a second telecommunications project to
support Burma's FYs81-85 development program. In so doing, IDA will continue
to act as a catalyst in securing and coordinating other external sources of
financing and will continue institution building efforts to improve the
organization, planning, and productivity of PTC (paragraphs 4.03 and 4.04).
IDA's continued support in training and technical assistance is also vital to
the least cost development of the sector.
II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
2.01      PTC's development program for the period FYs81-85 has been set
out in detail in Annex 9 and includes the following:
(a) the ongoing program including the works of the first IDA
project (under Credit 551-BA) to be completed in 1980;
(b) the proposed second project (paragraph 2.04);



- 7 -
(c) PTC's minor works program; and
(d) preliminary works needed for expansion of facilities from
1984 onwards.
This program is estimated to cost about K 1,140 (US$170.0) million with
a foreign component of about K 543.6 (US$84.0) million (Annex 11). The
program is adequately designed to meet the highest priority needs for improve-
ment and expansion of telecommunications services within the anticipated
financial, physical and managerial capability of PTC.
2.02      Under the first IDA Credit 551-BA, two major contracts worth about
3.9 billion Japanese yen were awarded under ICB to Japanese firms for tele-
phone switching and microwave equipment. Due to the subsequent substantial
appreciation of Japanese yen with respect to US dollar, a cost increase of
about US$3.5 million is estimated at the current exchange rate. In view of
Burma's limited foreign exchange reserves and to enable the proper completion
of the project, it is proposed that this amount, which is required due to
currency exchange rate variation, be provided as part of the proposed credit
(paragraphs 2.04 and 2.08).
Project Concept
2.03      The proposed project consists of the most essential works in Burma's
current investment program (FYs81-85) constituting a balanced and integrated
high priority package. It also includes a few items such as open wire carrier
systems and a billing processor, which were deferred from the first project
and the cost increase on existing contracts caused by currency exchange rate
variations (paragraphs 1.16 and 2.02). The project is conceived in such a way
as to insure the provision of an essential extension of telecommunication
facilities to important urban and rural centers presently without such service
(paragraph 3.06).
The Project
2.04      The project provides for:
(a) installation of about 31,200 lines of telephone exchange
equipment (including about 7,200 lines for replacing
existing obsolete systems) together with the associated
external networks and subscribers equipment including
PABXs;
(b) extension of telecommunication facilities to 54 townships
and 13 villages by installation of small telephone exchanges
and public call offices connected to the national system;
(c) extension of the long distance network by expanding existing
trunk exchanges by 1,800 lines, adding multiplex equipment
in existing microwave routes and providing new microwave



systems for Pegu-Meiktila, Meiktila-Taunggyi and Mandalay-
Lashio routes together with 11 VHF/UHF systems and about
26 open wire three and twelve channel carrier systems for
spur routes along with multiplex equipment;
(d) installation of maritime radio telephone equipment at
the three main ports and mobile radio telephone systems
for transportation and remote access on the main national
routes;
(e) expansion of telex and gentex systems;
(f) miscellaneous equipment and materials including the instal-
lation of billing processor and the improvement of storage
and transportation facilities; and for urgent rehabilitation
of the Rangoon telephone system;
(g) consulting services; and
(h) completion of the ongoing works of the project under
Credit 551-BA on existing contracts (paragraph 2.02).
Project Costs
2.05      The estimated cost of the project excluding the cost increase in
the first project (paragraph 2.02) is about K 623.2 (US$93.0) million with
a foreign exchange component of about K 284.2 (US$42.4) million. The local
costs are estimated at about K 339.0 (US$50.6) million which include customs
duties and commodity taxes payable by PTC on its imported equipment estimated
at about K 153.9 (US$23.0) million. The cost details are given in Annex 12

2.06      The cost estimates are based. on PTC's recent experience for imported

which cover most of the imports. The local costs are based on prevalent costs
of civil works and include the customs; duties on imported equipment averaging
about 23%, a recently imposed commodity tax of 30% and other fees amounting to
2% of the CIF values.
Contingencies
2.07      A physical contingency of 4% has been provided in the foreign and
local costs; this provision is adequate. Price contingencies have been



- 10 -
applied for all equipment based on an annual price escalation of 6.5% in
foreign costs and 7% for local costs between FYs79-84 on all items except
building construction on which 10% has been provided. These are also con-
sidered adequate. The resulting estimated overall price contingency amounts
to about 17% of the estimated base cost plus physical contingencies. Details
of the contingency provisions are given in Annex 13.
Project Financing
2.08      The proposed IDA credit of US$35.0 million includes US$3.5 million
towards cost increases on the first project (due to currency exchange rate
variations) and the balance of US$31.5 million which would meet 74% of the
US$42.4 million of total foreign exchange cost of the second project. The
balance of about US$11 million is to be financed from Japan (paragraphs 2.10
and 5.08). The exchange of formal notes between the Governments of Japan
and Burma, firmly committing this loan, will be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed credit. The local cost of the project of US$50.6 million
will be financed by PTC and Government (paragraph 5.08).
Items for IDA Financing
2.09      The items for IDA financing in the second project have been set
out in detail in Annex 14. They comprise:
US$ million
(a)  Local telephone network with exchange
equipment cables and subscriber equipment             17.25
(b)  Long distance network with microwave
UHF/VHF systems and open wire lines                    6.50
(c)  Rural telecommunications with open wire
and radio system                                       2.85
(d)  Transportation/remote access radio telephone
and maritime radio communication services              1.80
(e)  Miscellaneous equipment including material
for Rangoon telephone system rehabilitation,
billing processors, teleprinters, etc.                 1.40
(f)  Consultants                                            0.20

Items for Co-financing
2.10      The items proposed for co-financing from OECE Japan in the amount of
about US$11 million have been indicated in Annex 14.
Project Implementation
2.11      PTC will prepare the specifications and bidding documents for the
telephone switching equipment, cable networks, microwave VHF/UHF radio equip-
ment, open wire carrier systems and rural network materials. PTC will employ
consultants to study and prepare the bidding documents for the transportation
and remote access radio system. Civil works for construction of buildings and
access roads will be carried out by Government's Construction Corporation. In
view of the delays that occurred in the first project, the schedule of con-
struction of civil works was discussed during negotiations to ensure that
their execution will conform to the implementation schedule (Annex 15). PTC
will lay and joint the cables and install the subscriber facilities. PTC will
assist the contractors who will supply and install the telephone exchanges and
microwave and VHF/UHF radio equipment. PTC will employ consultants to provide
expert assistance for the supervision of installation and acceptance testing
of telephone switching and microwave systems. For this purpose, PTC has
sought assistance from UNDP to provide the experts from ITU. It was confirmed
during negotiations that the Government and PTC will secure the necessary
assistance. A provision has been made in the project for consultancy services
support of about 36 man-months for the radio services and for other technical
assistance. PTC's Director of Development Projects Department (paragraph
4.03) will monitor the execution of the works. These arrangements for project
execution are satisfactory. A schedule of construction of major works of the
project is given in Annex 15. This was discussed during negotiations and
found satisfactory.
Procurement
2.12      All equipment to be financed by the proposed credit will be procured
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB), except for a few small items
costing a total of about US$1.0 million (about 3% of the proposed credit).
The items excluded from ICB and proposed for negotiated purchase on grounds of
standardization, savings on spare inventories and ease of maintenance are:
(a) a 400 line extension of the liathawaddy tandem exchange in
Rangoon;
(b)  the addition of inter-working equipment in existing
Rangoon exchanges;
(c)  rehabilitation of existing Rangoon telephone exchange
equipment; and
(d) cabinet and distribution boxes and accessories.



- 12 -
These will be procured from L.M. Ericsson of Sweden on the basis of prices on
other recent contracts which are reasonable. About US$0.2 million is being
provided for 30% of ex-factory costs to meet the foreign costs of imported
components for manual switchboards which are being assembled in the workshop
of PTC (paragraph 1.03). The items to be financed under the proposed Japanese
credit will consist of extensions to existing local and long distance exchanges
and microwave systems. The original systems financed under the first project
were supplied from Japan under ICB and the proposed extension by similar
equipment is necessary for standardization.  These items proposed for financing
from Japan will be procured in accordance with the procurement guidelines of
OECF (Japan).
Disbursement
2.13      The proposed IDA credit will be disbursed against 100% of foreign
expenditures for imported equipment and 30% of ex-factory prices of locally
assembled manual telephone switchboards. A schedule of disbursements is
in Annex 16. It is expected that about US$2.0 million will be required to be
financed retroactively against disbursements made by Government on ongoing
contracts of the first credit 551-BA (paragraph 2.02). The project is
expected to be completed by December 31, 1983 and the credit is expected to
be fully disbursed by December 31, 1984.
Performance Indicators
2.14      Performance indicators to help monitor PTC's project implementation
and operational and financial performance are given in Annex 17. These were
discussed during negotiations and will be included in PTC's project progress
reports to be sent to IDA.
III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The economic analysis relates to PTC's total investment program of
which the proposed project is an integral part.
Telecommunications and Development
3.02      The overall telecommunications development program in Burma is
specifically designed to support Government's economic development program,
as outlined in the Second Four-Year Plan (FYs75-78) and the current Third
Four Year Plan (FYs79-82). Given a lack of adequate investment in the tele-
communications sector, most population centers in the country have no access
to even basic public call office (PCO) facilities. Furthermore, demand for
new connections has not been met in areas which presently have service, and
the quality of service to existing subscribers has fallen below acceptable
levels.



- 13 --
3.03      The registered demand for telephone connections is conservatively
expected to increase from about 51,000 in early 1979 to about 90,000 in 1985
(paragraph 1.11 and Annex 7). The proposed investment program is expected
to meet only part of this demand with about 68,000 DELs connected after the
completion of the first and second telecommunication projects. This will
leave an unsatisfied registered demand of about 22,000 in 1985, and a much
larger actual unsatisfied demand (including unregistered).
3.04      The proposed telecommunications sector investment program will have
a significant impact on the development of government administration, public
sector corporations, and private businesses by facilitating communications
related efficiency increases. In Burma, telecommunications is increasingly
becoming the least cost means of communication for a wide variety of economic
and social welfare activities. In particular, the transportation sector
including railways, roads, and river navigation systems, should achieve a
significantly better utilization of existing facilities with accompanying
lower costs in the collection and distribution of goods and faster repair and
turnaround.
3.05      PTC's investment program also provides for long distance microwave
systems which are designed primarily for telephone service but have the
additional capability of carrying television transmission channels at low
additional cost.
The Distribution of Benefits
3.06      Not only will the general population benefit through increased gov-
ernment and business efficiency and the resulting lower costs for goods and
services, but the program, and particu:Larly the second telecommunications
project, will make a significant impactL on access to telecommunication
services in currently unserved smaller urban and important rural communities.
Fifty-four small township administrative centers and thirteen villages with
a total population of about half a milLion, will gain local access to tele-
phone service for the first time through the introduction of small manual
exchanges and public call offices. Th-irty larger regional centers (other
than Rangoon and Mandalay) with populations of between 4,000 and 180,000
will receive expanded and upgraded service. Given this significantly in-
creased communication access in both market and administrative centers, and
in provincial areas, it is expected that all segments of the population in
Burma will benefit from the proposed telecommunications development program.
3.07      Finally, PTC has a much wider impact on the economy of Burma than
is apparent from telephone statistics. Government receives a significant
amount of revenue from PTC by means of duties and taxes, and by using tele-
phone tariffs partially as a means of taxation. Over the period FYs8O-85
the net flow of funds to Government which can be made available for other
general development projects will be about US$15 million. The details are
given in Annex 21 and summarized below:

Net Funds to Government                          99.5         14.8
Tariff Policies
3.08      Given the scarcity of resources available to the telecommunications
sector in Burma, tariffs are one means to finance sector costs as well as
focus the benefits on priority users. Currently, there is a large unsatisfied
demand for telephone and telex services (paragraphs 1.11 and 1.12). Tariff
increases, as from April 1, 1980, averaging 35% were, therefore, approved
by the Burmese Cabinet in the expectation that higher tariffs might (a) better
ration access and usage to the business and government consumers who make
the most productive use of telephones and telex, and who can pay higher
prices, and (b) generate additional resources from project beneficiaries
partly to increase the self-financing of sector expansion (paragraphs 5.08 and
5.14). Current tariffs, and as from FY81 approved tariffs, are outlined in
Annex 19. The tariff increases as from FY81 encompass increased rental and
call fees and telegraph and telex charges. The new tariffs will enable PTC to
achieve a rate of return of at least 9% of its fixed assets in operation
through FY85.
3.09      To complement Government's policies for promoting regional economic
development and integrating remote parts of the country, long distance tele-
phone rates will be increased more for shorter distances than longer distances
as from FY81. This is also supported by economic efficiency considerations
based on relative costs of corresponding investments. On social equity
grounds, the basic tariffs planned for domestic telegraph will be increased
only about 20% as from FY81, since telegraph services are widely used by the
lower-income portion of the population.
Least Cost Solution
3.10      The basic decision determining Burma's telecommunications network
was taken in 1975 by PTC with the assistance of telecommunication experts



from ITU.  The first project supported by IDA Credit 551-BA was formed as
the initial stage in t3he execution of these fundamental plans. The proposed
second project eorist es a further stage in this process.  A substantial
part of the second project (about 46% of the costs) constitutes expansion
of the existing local and long distance networks consisting of automatic
telephone exchanges and microwave systems, and has logically followed the
engineering applied to the initial installations. The decision to install
automatic exchanges for new systems except the very small exchanges in rural
areas is based on the definite advantages of automatic telephone systems,
considering initial and ongoing capital and labor requirements together with
expected traffic levels and the quality of service necessary to permit full
integration with the national system. Considering the nature of the terrain
and logistical problems, microwave offers the least cost solution on the new
routes from Mandalay-Lashio, Pegu-Meiktila and Meiktila-Taunggyi. For exten-
sion to rural areas both radio and cpen wire systems have been chosen depend-
ing upon the least cost solution in each case.
Rate of Return
3.11      Using the official exchange rate of K 6.7IUS$1, the internal finan-
cial rate of return on the telecommunications investment program would be
about 9% if tariffs were maintained at FY79 levels during the program period.
With the approved 35% higher tariffs as from FY81 (paragraph 3.08 and Annex
19), the internal rate of return would be about 16% (Annex 22).
3.12      Applying a shadow wage rate of 80% of nominal wages, a standard
conversion factor of .56 and quantifying a small portion of the consumer
surplus from data gathered for subsc.ribers in the Rangoon area (Annex 22),
provide a minimum estimate of the internal economic rate of return of 11%.
This rate of return underestimates the total economic benefits to be derived
from the proposed investment program for several reasons. First, it does not
include a complete tabulation of the consumer surplus which telephone sub-
scribers and other callers receive. Some limited evidence of the existence of
a substantial consumer surplus for telephone access was found in Rangoon
where, until recently, an unauthorized private market existed on which tele-
phones were bought and sold. In 1977, PTC made an effort to trace unauthor-
ized connections, and found 517 cases in which telephones had been transferred
at private market prices averaging US$1,486. PTC fined these unauthorized
subscribers US$358 each, but allowed them to keep their telephones if in
addition to the fine, they agreed to pay the official connection and other
charges. When word of the legalizing of the connections spread, 467 more
subscribers turned themselves involtntarily, paid the US$358 fines and
the US$67 connection fee, and had their telephone status legalized. During
this period, over 15,500 potential subscribers without telephones were on
official telephone waiting lists demonstrating a willingness to at least pay
the official PTC connection charge of US$67.
3.13      The quantifiable rate of return also understates total program
benefits since it does not include a complete estimate of the value of travel



- 16 -
and call time which will be saved through an increased proportion of success-
ful calls, and of all benefits incurred by receivers of calls and by existing
subscribers when new subscribers join the system.  Further, no quantification
of benefits is made relating to those who benefit indirectly through the
'--ter administration of tourism, regional development, health, transport
energy and agricultural programs, and increased urban and regional busiae>_
and government efficiency.
3.14      Finally, the quantified benefit stream is underestimated because
the capital expenditures included in calculating the internal rate of return
are those for extending and upgrading the network as well as for providing new
facilities now. The available capacity of various components of the installed
equipment, expecially long distance, telex and international facilities, will
only be fully utilized when additional investment is made in the future.
Thus, the expenditures incurred during the FYs78-85 period will generate
additional untabulated benefits long after that period.
Risk
3.15      There are no major risks in project execution.  This telecommunica-
tion project comprises a large number of technically independent works, and
delays in completion of any specific facilities will not generally delay
completion of other facilities or prevent utilization of these facilities when
completed. The major cause of any delays would probably be in the execution
of civil works, and assurances were obtained from Government for giving
priority to their execution (paragraph 2.11). A sensitivity analysis of the
internal financial rate of return shows that a combination of 10% increase in
capital and operating expenditures and 10% decrease in revenues would give a
rate of return not less than 12% (Annex 22). A delay in project execution
would delay the benefits for the users. The rate of return would not be
affected in any major way, however, as incremental expenditures and revenues
would be postponed in roughly the same proportion.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.16      No significant adverse environmental or health effects are expected
from the project; the construction works are normal and will have negligible
effects on the ecology of the regions concerned. As the project will provide
better telephone and telex services, the growth in vehicular traffic congestion
during business hours in urban areas is expected to be reduced, particularly in
Rangoon, accompanied by a beneficial effect on atmospheric pollution. Further-
more, better communication networks should result in faster utilization of
transport for movement of medicine and health care, and for dealing with
emergency situations.

IV.  THE Il'LEMENTING AGENCY
Organization and Management
4.01      Under Section 9 of the Law of 1963, the Ministry of Transport and
Communications issued an order on June 6, 1975, establishing the Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) to take over the major functions of the
Posts and Telecommunications Department (PTD) of the Ministry. As a Govern-
ment corporation, PTC's development plans, personnel, administrative and
financial policies are required to conform to the directives of the Council of
Ministers. The Government is responsible for the approval of tariffs and new
investment.  PTC is required to use the services of the Government's Construc-
tion Corporation for its major civil works (paragraph 2.11). Although PTC's
budget forms a part of the Government's budget, PTC's Charter, which is
similar to that of other Government corporations, provides adequate autonomy
in day-to-day operations and PTC is required to operate telecommunication
services on a commercial basis, and to maintain a commercial accounting
system.
4.02      PTC is headed by a managing director appointed by the Minister of
Transport and Communications.  The managing director and the principal officers
are quite competent. PTC's present organizational structure is summarized in
Annex 18. PTC's headquarters operat:es and controls facilities and equipment
which are called "direct elements"; these are primarily major microwave
systems and radio stations of national importance. PTC's divisional managers
in the 14 divisions and states are responsible for the local telecommunication
services in their areas. These managers operate under the administrative
control of Divisional Councils with respect to "divisional elements" which
comprise local telecommunication systems in the area. In addition, at the
administrative level of townships, there are local communication centers
administered under the Township Councils. These arrangements were introduced
as a general policy of Government for decentralization of administration in
the various national sectors including telecommunications, and a few years
experience is needed to evaluate its results.
4.03      In April 1978, an improvement in organization was made through the
creation of a special Development Project Department which is responsible for
all works in PTC's development program. PTC's department for planning and
operations is not organized at present to carry out adequate and effective
planning activities. PTC is aware of this deficiency and, to overcome this,
has proposed to create a separate planning and training department with
effect from April 1, 1980. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that PTC will strengthen its planning unit in this department. The unit will
be responsible for carrying out studies of demand, determining least cost
technical solutions, and preparing (12 to 20 years) and short term (4 to 6
years) telecommunications development programs. The unit will work closely
with the Ministry of Planning and FLnance.

Staff and Training
4.04      PTC has about 4,030 employees engaged in providing telecommunica-
tion services giving a ratio of 118 employees per 1,000 telephones. While
this is relatively high, the existing nature of the telecommunication networks
and services, with widely dispersed open wire systems and numerous manual
exchanges, are contributing factors. With the substantial automatization of
the local and long distance networks, the introduction of microwave systems,
and adequate staff training (paragraph 4.06), productivity should be improved.
By 1985, it is expected that PTC should be able to achieve a ratio of about 87
employees per 1,000 telephones. This target is achievable over the period by
normal attrition and limited additions of staff.
4.05      During negotiations, PTC presented the preliminary results of a man-
power and training study. Based on this study, feasible targets to improve
productivity were agreed on and assurances were obtained that measures will
be taken promptly to meet these targets.
4.06      Under a Project Agreement of December 1976, UNDP is providing
assistance in setting up a postal and telecommunications training center in
Rangoon. A new building for this center is under construction and is expected
to be completed in 1980. A project manager and three training experts have
been in Burma since mid-1978 and have arranged and completed courses in
external plant, telephone switching and microwave fields. During FY1978-1979
about 364 technicians and junior engineers have taken these courses. PTC has
also made arrangements with various equipment suppliers for special assistance
in training on the new switching, microwave, and satellite communication sys-
tems. The present UNDP project terminates in June 1980 and PTC has requested
an extension. Government is negotiating an expansion and continuation of
training support under a proposed second phase Telecommunications and Postal
training project, which is expected to be agreed upon by December 1979. These
training arrangements should prove adequate to meet PTC's needs under the
project. During negotiations assuraces were obtained that Government will
cause PTC to carry out a staff training program satisfactory to IDA until
December 1984.
Accounting System
4.07      Since 1972, PTC's accounting system, which separates its postal and
telecommunication operations, has been on an accrual basis. The system is
basically an adaptation of a cash accounting system used prior to FY72. In
FY77, PTC somewhat modified the system, but was still not able to produce
timely and accurate commercially-based financial statements.  With the expan-
sion of operations under the first and proposed second project, further
improvement of the system was necessary.
4.08      PTC, well aware of the need for improving its accounting system,
recently prepared a new system with a revised commercial chart of accounts



- 19 -
which was put in service during FY79. The new system provides for maintenance
of accounts on a cash basis at regional offices, and for the decentralization
of billing at the regional level. The regional accounts are then converted to
accrual accounts at PTC headquarters in Rangoon. These arrangements required
training accounting staff in the regLons and is expected to reduce the billing
time until billing is mechanized (paragraph 4.10). All regions now prepare
accounts under the new system. As from FY79, a new unit for accounting
organization and methods was also created under the chief accounts officer to
supervise the working of the new system. These arrangements are satisfactory.
4.09      Under the first IDA project, PTC was required to submit audited
financial statements within six montlas of the end of the fiscal year. Due to
delays in the collection of accounting data from the regions, however, PTC
has not been able to comply with this requirement. With the arrangements
described above, PTC expects to complete and forward its financial statements
within the stipulated time. To facilitate early review, PTC has agreed to
provide IDA with a set of unaudited financial statements at the same time
these are sent to the auditors (paragraph 4.14).
Billing and Collection
4.10      Bills are prepared manually on a quarterly basis except for rentals
which are billed yearly in advance. Billing has been centralized in Rangoon,
although two regions started billing locally in October 1977. As from July
1979, seven regions billed locally and by September 1979 ten regions (out
of a total of 14) are expected to prepare their own bills. The decentraliza-
tion of billing is being introduced only as an interim solution. Considera-
tion is being given for the recentralization of billing at a later date
after the subscriber trunk dialling (STD) system is installed and the automatic
billing processor is in use (paragraphs 4.11 and 4.12). Both the interim and
the longer term solutions should reduce the time required for billing, which
at present takes about two months.
4.11      Under the proposed project, the STD system will be put into opera-
tion in April 1980 and billing data will be automatically recorded on magnetic
tapes. A billing processor is provided in the project to read and process
these tapes and will be installed and ready for service by April 1982. Until
then, PTC will read and process the tapes, to obtain information for manual
billing, through the University Computer Center, Rangoon.
4.12      The installation of the billing processor at the headquarters in
Rangoon will enable PTC to bill monthly, reduce the time necessary to process
bills and permit a more efficient cc,ntrol of collection. The current equiv-
alent of about four months of billing in outstanding bills is therefore ex-
pected to be reduced to about two months.
4.13      For PTC's private subscribers, a reminder is sent only three to four
months after payment is due and service is disconnected if the bill is not paid
within three days after the reminder. This is expected to improve with the
decentralization of billing to the regions under the present manual system,



- 20 -
and the introduction of monthly billing with the billing processor. For
Government subscribers, the procedures for collection of bills need improve-
ment; most of the PTC's uncollected bills relate to Government (Annex 20).
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that existing government arrears
will be paid by March 31, 1981, and that procedures satisfactory to IDA will
be introduced to insure that current bills will be paid within two months
after billing as from FY81.
Audit
4.14      External audit of all government corporations is required under
the constitution and since 1974, has been performed by the Central Accounts
Department supervised by an inspection committee, whose five members are
elected by Parliament. The Central Accounts Department employs qualified
accountants with experience in commercial audits. These auditors are located
in all divisions, regions and townships in which PTC operates, and some are
permanently assigned to audit PTC's accounts. These audit arrangements are
satisfactory and should be continued under the proposed project. Assurances
were obtained that the audited financial statements and the auditor's opinion
should be transmitted to IDA within six months after the close of the fiscal
year.
4.15      PTC's internal checks and controls are satisfactory despite the
absence of an internal audit department. The present arrangement is accept-
able, given the thoroughness and continuity of the external audit.
Insurance
4.16      In view of the high cost of insurance and the dispersion of PTC's
assets, which limits the maximum loss in case of an accident, PTC has not con-
sidered it necessary to insure against fire and other loss or damage. This
is in line with the policy adopted by many telecommunications administrations
and is acceptable.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Postal and Other Operations
5.01      In addition to telecommunications services, PTC is also responsible
for the postal service (paragraph 1.02) which was operated at a loss during
FY76 through FY79. PTC is currently considering an increase in postal rates
as from April 1980. Up to the present, however, the cash deficit on PTC's
postal operations has been funded by the Government and has not affected its
telecommunication operations. Therefore, PTC has complied with the covenant
in Credit 551-BA which stipulates that funds from PTC's telecommunication
services will not be used for other operations until all requirements for
telecommunications have been met. This covenant will be repeated under the



- 21 -
proposed credit. Eurthermore, assurances were obtained during negotiations,
that PTC will charge rates for all its services in accordance with sound
commercial practices, in case PTC provides new services.
Taxes, Custom Duties and Contribution to Government
5.02      In FY77, Government changed its tax system and required all State
Economic Enterprise (SEE), including PTC, to pay a contribution of 20%
instead of 50% of their net income as previously required. As from FY79, the
contribution was increased to 30%. However, under the tax system introduced
in FY79, PTC is also required to pay a commodity tax, in addition to custom
duties, on imported equipment and materials. These import taxes/duties are
currently estimated at about 55% of the CIF values of imports.
Past Performances
5.03      PTC's income statements for FYs77-79 are presented in Annex 23.
A summary is given below:
(K millions)
Years ending March 31:    1977    1978        1979
Operating revenues         47.9    49.4       50.9

/a   Before tax/contribution and extraordinary items.
/b   After tax/contribution but before extraordinary
items; on historically valued assets.
5.04      PTC increased its tariffs about 30% as from April 1976, which,
together with the reduction in required contributions to Government (see
paragraph 5.02), resulted in a sharp increase in the FY77 rate of return on
PTC's net fixed assets in operation. The net value of these assets was low,
as they were substantially depreciated (paragraph 5.06). In FYs78-79, however,
PTC's rate base increased substantialy as assets from the first project were
brought into operation. Higher import taxes (see paragraph 5.02), which are
capitalized, contributed to an increase in rate base and annual depreciation.
This situation explains the sharp drop in the rate of return. Even so, PTC
realized a rate of return of 17% in EY79.



- 22 -
Present Financial Position
5.05      Prior to FY76, PTC was required to deposit all receipts from oper-
ations in the Union Government Consolidated Fund (UGC Fund) and received from
Government the necessary funds for operation and expansion. As from FY76,
PTC has been permitted to use its own funds. Since FY77 and FY78, the UGC
Fund was used only for payments of certain debt services to Government
and for adjustments of governmental accounts receivable. PTC has suggested to
Government that the UGC Fund should be deducted from governmental loans to
PTC, but Government has not made any decision yet. In PTC's financial state-
ments, the UGC Fund is included under current assets and governmental loans
under long-term debt. This classification of the UGC Fund and governmental
loans distorts both the current ratio and the debt/ equity ratio. To correct
this distortion, PTC's FY79 balance in the UGC Fund (K 38.6 million) has been
separated from current assets and deducted from governmental loans in the
financial projections of this report. A summary of PTC's financial position
in FY79 is given below:
FY 79 -

1/ Unaudited.
2/ Including current portion of long-term debt, K 8.2 million.



In the above table, plant under construction (K 231.0 million) consists mainly
of equipment under the first IDA project, the first part of which will be put
in operation in FY80. Current assets mainly consist of cash on hand and in
banks (K 7.6 million), receivables (K 15.3 million), and inventories (K 11.2
million). The current ratio without the UGC Fund of 1.9 times and the debt/
equity ratio of 59/41 are considered satisfactory.
Valuation of Assets
5.06      PTC has made no effort to establish the effect of inflation on the
value of its fixed assets and IDA did not ask for any revaluation under the
first project. In June 1979, PTC finished an inventory of its fixed assets.
In addition to providing more accurate book values (discriminating between the
postal and telecommunications services), this inventory provides a suitable
basis for future revaluations. With the exception of the telephone plant in
Rangoon, most of PTC's assets are obsolete and will be replaced under the IDA
projects. Furthermore, PTC's depreciation charges were low with a composite
rate of depreciation of about 3.2% up to FY76. 1/ For these reasons, it is
considered that PTC's existing assets as of March 1979, are not significantly
undervalued and the current net value of fixed assets in operation is accept-
able. Any difference between FY79 book values and their actual replacement
costs would produce a minimal distortion of the rate of return at the end of
the project period as new assets are added massively starting from FY79. The
net value of PTC's FY79 fixed assets in operation will be less than 5% of
total net fixed assets in operation in FY85, when the second IDA project is
finished. However, to avoid any distortion in future asset value, assurances
were obtained during negotiations, that PTC will undertake and complete a
study of the value of its fixed assets by April 1, 1980, and will review the
value of its plant and equipment annually starting as from FY81. If the
changes in foreign prices and/or local inflation are more than 10% since the
previous revaluation, PTC will revalue its fixed assets in operation in
accordance with methods agreed on with IDA for the purpose of calculating the
rate of return.
5.07      For the forecast period, PTC's fixed assets have been revalued about
4% per annum as from FY79 according to the expected average increase in cost
of telecommunications plant and equipment (Annex 27).
Financing Plan
5.08      PTC's forecast funds flow statements for FYs8O-85 are presented in
Annex 25. A summary of the requirements during the project period (FYs8l-85)
and the sources from which they would be met is given below:
1/   PTC's depreciation provisions were increased to about 4.5% in FY77
at IDA's recommendation.

/a   This is the last disbursement in FY81 to cover the cost increase
of US$3.5 million due to exchange variations affecting the dis-
bursements of existing contracts under Credit 551-BA from Japanese
suppliers.
/b   This does not include the amount of US$3.5 million which is shown
separately under Credit 551-BA to finance the cost increase (see
note /a above). Part of this amount is expected to be disbursed
in FY80.
As shown in the above table, PTC's cash generation plus subscribers' deposits
are expected to contribute about 29% of total requirements during the project
period. This contribution will be supplemented by governmental funding of
local capital expenditures (45.2% of total requirements). The governmental
funding, however, should be evaluated in the context that the large financial
contribution which PTC is making to Government over the project period sig-
nificantly exceeds government's funds to PTC (paragraph 3.07 and Annex 21).
Hence, PTC's contribution of 29% to its total capital outlays is acceptable.
Remaining requirements during the period will be financed by IDA Credit
551-BA, 0.8%; OPEC Loan 54P, 0.3%; the proposed IDA credit, 18.2%; and pro-
posed co-financing from Japan, 6.3%.



5.09      The OECF Loan will be passed on to PTC on the same terms as received
by the Government: repayment over 30 years, including ten years of grace,
at an interest of 2.25%. The proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit will be
relent to PTC for 24 years, including five years of grace, with interest at
8.5% p.a. 1/.
The conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to IDA between
Government and PTC to relend the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit and
arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, for a firm commitment of the DECF loan,
would be conditions of effectiveness.
Projected Financial Performance
5.10      Forecast financial statements for FYs8O-85 are given in Annexes 23
to 26. Notes and assumptions on the statements are given in Annex 27. A
summary of PTC's Projected financial performance is given below:

/a   After contribution to Government.
5.11      The expected improvement in financial performance is mainly the
result of thne planned increase in tariffs as from April 1980 (paragraph 3.08),
and a substantial increase in traffic volume caused by the introduction of an
earth satellite station for internat-ional communications, automatic long
distance dialing (STD) and expanded and improved telephone and telex services.
1/   In the three-year period 1976-78, the average of the accumulated increase
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Rangoon was only 4% per annum, and
the trend of the increase was decreasing: 22% in 1976 and a deflation of
about 1% in 1977, and a further drop of 6% in 1978. The projection in
this report use an average annual inflation of 6%. On PTC's recommenda-
tion, the current average interest rate of 5% per annum for governmental
lending has been used for projections. The current interest rates for
governmental loans for working capital and investment purposes range from
5% to 8%.



- 26 -
5.12      PTC's future finances over the project period are expected to be
satisfctory. The operating ratio will improve from 56% in PY80 to 47% in FY85;
the current ratio will be not less than 2.2 times; and the debt service cover-
age ratio will improve from 1.4 times in FY80 to 2.3 times at the end of FY85.
5.13      The customs duties and taxes on PTC's imported goods (55% of CIF
values) inflate PTC's capital outlays and create the need for substantial
Government funding of the local cost component of PTC's development program
(paragraph 5.08). In addition, PTCs' contributions to Government (30% of net
income) and projected debt service wil produce a net fiscal surplus from PTC
to Government.  In FYs8O-85, Government is expected to receive about US$104.0
million from PTC in the form of taxes and duties while giving back about
US$89.2 million in the form of loans (paragraph 3.07 and Annex 21).
5.14      Taking into account the changes in PTC's import taxes and contribu-
tion to Government (paragraph 5.02), the resulting impact on the rate of
return and also the proposed tariff increases (paragraphs 3.08, 5.04), the
present forecasts indicate that a 9% rate of return on revalued assets would
be adequate to meet PTC's financial requirements. It is therefore recommended
that the 10% rate of return requirement under IDA Credit 551-BA be changed to
9%. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that PTC's tariffs will be
set at levels sufficient to achieve at least 9% rate of return on revalued
average net fixed asets in operation.
5.15      The debt limitation covenant under Credit 551-BA should be con-
tinued for the proposed IDA credit. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from Government that PTC will not incur any debt without prior
approval by IDA, unless PTC's internal cash generation in the preceeding 12
months would cover maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times.
5.16      Although future additions to the development program may be justi-
fied, it is equally important that the financial viability of PTC should be
assured. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that any investment
in addition to the FYs8O-84 program, exceeding US$1.0 million equivalent in
any one fiscal year, will not be undertaken until IDA is afforded an opportu-
nity to comment on such additional investment.
VI. AGREEMENTS DURING NEGOTIATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government
that it will:
(a)  secure necessary co-financing to the extent of about US$11
million (paragraphs 2.08 and 5.09);
(b)  employ consultants for assistance in preparation of speci-
fications and supervision of installations (paragraph 2.11);
(c)  strengthen the technical planning unit in PTC (paragraph
4.03);



_ 7
(d) improve productivity with agreed feasible targets on the
basis of the manpower study (paragraphs 4.04 and 4.05);
(e) secure the required training assistance to PTC beyond 1980
(paragraph 4.06);
(f) settle existing government arrears by March 31, 1981, and
as from FY81 introduce procedures to insure payments of
current bills within two months of billing (paragraph 4.13);
(g) provide IDA with a set of unaudited financial statements
when they are sent for auditing, and the final audited
financial statements together with auditor's reports within
six months from the end of each fiscal year (paragraphs 4.09
and 4.14);
(h)  undertake and complete a study to establish the value of
PTC's fixed assets by April 1980 and, as from FY81, revalue
its assets according to a revaluation method agreed on with
IDA (paragragh 5.06);
(i) set and maintain PTC's tariffs at levels sufficient to
achieve at least 9% rate of return on revalued average
net fixed assets in operation (paragraph 5.14);
(j) not incur long-term debt without prior approval by IDA,
unless PTC's internal cash generation in the preceding 12
months would cover maximum future debt service at least
1.5 times (paragraph 5.15); and
(k) not undertake any investment in addition to the FYs81-85
program, exceeding US$1.0 million equivalent in any one
fiscal year, until IDA is afforded an opportunity to comment
(paragraph 5. 16).
6.02      Arrangements satisfactory to IDA for:  (a) a firm commitment of the
OECF loan and (b) the conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between
Government and PTC to relend the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit would, be
conditions of effectiveness of the credit (paragraphs 2.08, 5.08 and 5.09).
6.03      Provided that the above conditions are met, the proposed project
along with the increase of US$3.5 million under existing Credit 551-BA,
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$35.0 million equivalent.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Description of Existing Telecommunications Facilities
A. Local Teleohone Services
1.        At the end of FY79, Burma had 152 telephone exchanges serving
a total of 26,662 direct exchange lines (DELs); the total number of tele-
phones was 34,292. There were six automatic exchanges in the country, the
five major ones located in Rangoon and a small rural type of 400 lines
recently installed in Maymyo. There are central battery exchanges of 1,500
lines at Mandalay and 550 lines at Moulmein and the rest of the exchanges
are magneto type in sizes ranging from 10 to 300 lines. The total number
of automatic DELs is 17,509 and manual 9,153.
2.        Telephone service in the city of Rangoon is relatively reliable
with the four L.M. Ericsson ARF type crossbar exchanges installed between
1954 and 1961 and one NEC NC23 type crossbar exchange installed in 1978.
The two large manual exchanges at Mandalay and Moulmein are In poor con-
dition having outlived their useful life and are being replaced by modern
automatic exchanges under the first telecommunications project. The
magneto telephone exchanges are in relatively better condition due to
satisfactory arrangements being available for their repair, and replace-
ment by PTC's workshop.
3.        In Rangoon, the subscribers' distribution networks make use of
paper insulated and lead-sheathed cables in conduits in the city, armoured
ones laid directly in the ground in the suburbs with self-supporting aerial
cables and open wires together with distribution cabinets and pillars. In
other cities, most of the outside plant network is built with some under-
ground and aerial cable but mostly open-wire lines on pole routes are used
and fault incidence is high especially in the wet season. Open-wire on
pole routes for distribution is the only method used in the small exchanges.
B. Long Distance Telephone Services
4.        At present, there is a 24--channel 2GHz valve type microwave sys-
tem connecting Rangoon with Bassein with repeaters located at Twante,
Maubin, Wakema and Myaungma. This is almost life expired and is being
replaced by a modern solid state microwave system with 960 channel capacity
in the first project. All other existing long distance facilities are at
present on open-wire pole routes carrying copper or copperweld pairs with,

ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 2 pages
in some cases, 3, 4 and 12 channel carrier systems. Some major routes
are also being replaced by modern microwave systems under the first project.
The total number of trunk circuits working is 334.
5.        Trunk calls are at present handled manually and due to lack of
circuits and faults in the open-wire routes, calls are delayed and speech
quality is poor. Under the first project, installation of automatic trunk
exchanges has been provided for which will improve connections on major
routes and centers.
C. Telegraph and Telex Services
6.        Rangoon and Mandalay are provided with teleprinters for the public
telegraph service. Other cities are equipped with manual morse circuits.
7.        A standard "B" satellite earth station was commissioned in
February 1979 and one telephone circuit each to Tokyo, Hongkong, London and
Singapore are working through the Intelsat System. This has improved the
quality of service immensely.   PTC has in addition four H.F. radio tele-
phone circuits operating part time to Shanghai, Calcutta, Bangkok and Poona.
The service quality on these circuits is poor.
8.        PTC operates telegraph service through satellite to Hongkong and
Tokyo on a 24-hour basis and still using H.F.circuits to Colomibo, Calcutta,
Manila, Shanghai, Bangkok, Karachi, Dacca, Prague and Pyongyang. At
Rangoon there is a manual telex exchange which handles international telex traffic
via Hongkong and Tokyo. The international telegraph and telex services are
satisfactory.

7. Price contingency as percentage of base
costs plus physical contingency (%)      20.96     13.20      17.30
1/ Local and foreign costs are primarily based on PTC's recent contracts,
the prevalent costs of civil works, and the fiscal charges on imported
goods that PTC is required to pay to the Government.
2/ A physical contingency of 4% has been provided on all items on local
and foreign costs.
3/ Price contingency is based on annual price escalation of 6.5% between
1979-84 in foreign costs and 7% in local costs on all items except
10% in local costs on buildings which are expected to be completed in
the first two years of the program. The provision of 10%. escalation
per annum is considered reasonable by the Construction Corporation for
this period.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investment
1.        PTC's FYs8l-85 program includes the proposed second project as
well as a part of the first project which is expected to be finished in
FY82. The overlapping of the first and second project and the close
relationship between equipment installed under the two projects and the
total telecommunications investment program make any attempt to separate
incremental costs and revenues for the second project very arbitrary.
The rate of return calculated in this annex, therefore, is for PTC's total
FYs78-85 investment program. Specification of incremental costs and benefits
starts from FY78, when the first capital outlays under the first project were
made, and finishes in FY87, when most benefits directly related to the expen-
ditures made under the second project will have materialized.
2.        The Rangoon Consumer Price Index rose to an average of 12% per
year in FYs75-77, (but declined in FY77). Provisional data for FY78
indicate no major change during that year. For the rate of return calcu-
lations, the nominal values of all incremental costs and revenues have
been deflated by an accumulated 6% per annum as from FY79 to reflect
values held constant in FY78 real terms.
Benefit Period
3.        The benefit period of the program extends from FY1978 to FY2005
when on average the equipment provided under the program is expected to
have substantially completed its useful life.
Capital Expenditure
4.        Capital expenditures are for PTC's ongoing FYs78-85 investment
program. Taxes and duties (55% on the CIF-value of imports) and prein-
vestments in FYs83 and 85 for future program are excluded.
Incremental Operating Costs and Revenues
5.        As from FY87, operating costs and revenues related to the FYs78-85
program are assumed to remain constant in real terms. Incremental revenues
are based on expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and traffic
brought about by the program. Subscribers' deposits have been treated as



- 55 -
ANNEX 22
Page 2 of 3 pages
revenues when collected. Operating costs are based on additional assets
and traffic generated under the program, exlcuding depreciation, interest,
and contributions to Government. Incremental revenues and costs for the
replaced DELs under the first and second projects have been taken into
account.
6.        No residual values of fixed assets or repayment of subscribers'
deposits at the end of the benefit period have been taken into account as
the discounted real value of these would be minimal in FY78.
7.        A summary of the cost and revenue streams at FY78 price levels
is given below in millions of Kyats:
Capital         Operating       Net Benefit

1981      0.84         116.0           3.6     53.4          (66.2)
1982      0.79         153.4          4.7      66.8          (91.3)
1983      0.75         143.8           6.5     85.7          (64.6)
1984      0.70          23.2           8.3    104.2           72.7
1985      0.67           6.2           9.7    122.1          106.2
1986      0.63             0         11.2    139.2           128.0

The net benefit stream above results in a rate of return of 15.6%.
8.        A sensitivity analysis was performed with the following results:
10% increase in capital expenditures        14.1%
10% increase in operating costs             15.4%
10% decrease in revenues                    13.8%
Combination of all. above                   12.4%
Partial Estimate of Consumer Surplus
9.        In Burma, a significant number of telephone subscribers have
revealed a willingness to pay a price to acquire a telephone which far
exceeds the official price listed. in the tariff schedule. In Rangoon in
particular, a private market recently existed on which telephones were
bought and sold. In 1977 PTC made an effort to trace unauthorized con-
nections, and found 517 cases in which telephones had been transferred
at private market prices averaging K 10,000. PTC fined these unauthorized
subscribers K 2,400 each, but allowed them to keep their telephones. When
word of the legalizing of the connections spread, 467 more subscribers
turned themselves in, paid the K 2,400 fines, and had their telephone status
legalized.



- 56 -
ANNEX 22
Page 3 of 3 pages
10.       Given this information and the knowledge that in 1977, 15,545
potential subscribers without telephones were registered on waiting lists
demonstrating a willingness to at least pay the official connection
charge of K 450, an estimate of the consumer surplus associated with
obtaining a telephone in Burma was made using the following assumptions:
(a) The demand curve for telephone connections is downward
sloping and is shaped in such a way that a relatively
small proportion of the total population is willing and
able to pay high fees to obtain a telephone, while the
majority of potential subscribers is willing and able to
pay only relatively lower fees. Hence, the demand curve
for telephone connections is represented as being convex
to the origin of the price and quantity axis.l/
(b) Two points on that demand curve are--1,522 telephone con-
nections (the number of legalized telephones in Rangoon in
FY77 plus the estimated number which will be legalized in a
forthcoming drive against unauthorized connections in places
other than Rangoon at a price of K 12,850 (K 10,000 private
market price plus K 2,400 fine plus K 450 connection fee),
and 17,067 telephones (1,522 plus the 15,545 waiting appli-
cations in Burma as of March 31, 1977) at the most common
official telephone connection fee of K 450 (US$61).
11.       Calculating the area under the demand curve above the connection
fee of K 450 and below K 12,850 and between the quantities zero and 17,067
and dividing that by 17,067 gives an average consumer surplus of K 2,119
per telephone connection. Hence, for purposes of benefit estimation, the
value of acquiring a telephone in Burma may be taken to be an average of
the connection fee of K 450 plus the consumer surplus of 2,119.
12.       With a revised benefits stream including the partial estimate of
consumer surplus for obtaining a telephone, labor shadow priced at 80% of
nominal cost and a standard conversion factor of .56, the internal rate of
return becomes 11%.
1/ Mathematically, the demand curve has been assumed to have the shape of a
rectangular hyperbola with an elasticity of one. Empirical estimates of
the price elasticity of demand for telephones are generally significantly
less than one (more inelastic).

BURMA
POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (PTC)
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
Income Statements
1.        Local telephone revenues include installation charges, yearly
rental and local call charges. Projections are based on current and
future tariffs (see Annex 19) and the expected number of subscribers
each fiscal year. Average traffic per subscriber is assumed to be
constant during the project period.
2.        Long distance revenues.  Traffic in FYs 79-80 is limited by lack
of facilities. In FY81, when automatic long distance dialing is introduced,
traffic is expected to double (in addition to a tariff increase averaging
42%). As from FY82, traffic is expected to grow about 20% per year.
3.        International revenues.  Traffic is expected to increase by
500% in FY80, when the earth satellite station is put in service, and by
about 25% per annum as from FY81. Revenues also include income on leased
circuits.
4.        Telegraph revenues.  International traffic is expected to increase
100% in FY80, when the earth satellite station is put in service. From
FY81 all telegraph traffic is expsected to remain constant, as the telex
service is expanded. A tariff increase as from FY81 of 20% on local service
is included.
5.        Telex revenues are mainLy for international service.  Current
average traffic per now connected subscribers is expected to increase 50%
in FY80 due to the earth satellite station. New subscribers connected under
the program are expected to produce half of the average traffic per sub-
scriber as compared with subscribers connected before FY80.
6.        Other revenues include radio licencing fees, rent from staff,
advertisement charges for the telephone book, fines (FY77) etc. A one time
increase of 35% in FY81, in addition to annual increases of 20% as from FY79,
is assumed.
7.        Costs of operation include wages and other allowances for tele-
phonists and other staff to operate the system, office material, insurance,
etc. Costs are expected to decline as a percentage of total revenues, as



- 62 -
ANNEX 27
Page 2 of 3 pages
new automatic equipment installed under the proposed project requires less
manpower. Costs are, therefore, expected to remain constant in FYs80-81,
when long distance traffic is automatized, and increase 10% per year there-
after.
8.        Maintenance and repairs includes wages, material, travel, etc.
New equipment installed under the program will require less maintenance
than existing equipment. Costs are, therefore, expected to increase an
average 10% per year as from FY81.
9.        Administrative costs mainly consist of wages.  An increase of
10% per year is assumed (6% in wages and 4% in number of staff).
10.       Depreciation has been calculated at a compound rate of 4.5% on
average gross fixed assets in operation. Depreciation on revaluation
adjustments has been given separately.
11.       Income tax/contribution.  In FY76 the tax was 50% of net income.
As from FY77, this tax was replaced by a contribution to the Government of
20% of net income, which was increased to 30% as from FY79.
12.       Extraordinary items.  Pending taxes were cancelled in FY77 as a
result of the change in the tax system. PTC consequently wrote off the
existing tax provisions.
Balance Sheet
13.       Fixed assets are based on PTC's construction program.  The revalua-
tion adjustments are based on the following assumptions:
(a) FY79 book values of fixed assets reasonably reflects the
current value (see para. 5.06);
(b) 80% of the cost of total fixed assets is related to imported
equipment. The cost of half of this equipment is expected
to increase 6% per year as from FY80. The cost of the other
half is not expected to increase due to technological changes
and economies of scale; and
(c) 20% of the cost of total fixed assets is considered civil
works and is expected to increase 7% per year as from FY80.
With these assumptions the average yearly revaluation adjustment would be
about 4% per year as from FY80.
14.       Work in progress has been estimated as 100% of current year's
capital expenditures plus 50% of preceeding year's capital expenditures.

ANNEX 27

15.       Cash and banks.  K 10.0 million per year is considered a proper
cash balance for PTC during the project period.
16.       Accounts receivable are expected to equal about three months of
billing in FY80 and improve to about two months as from FY84 because the
billing processor installed is expected to reduce the time required for
billing.
17.       Inventories are expected to increase only 15% per year as from
FY80 since new equipment installed under the program will require less
spare parts than existing equipment.
18.       Union of Government Consolidated Fund (UGCF) has been deducted
from governmental long-term loans in the projections (see para. 5.05).
19.       Other current assets (advances, suspense accounts, deposits) have
been increased 10% per year.
20.       Equity.  Increases are only expected through retained earnings
and revaluation adjustments.
21.       Long-term debt (see separate debt statements).  The OECF loan is
expected to be repaid over 30 years, including 10 years of grace, with an
interest of 2.25%. Relending terms on IDA Credit 551-BA, proposed IDA
Credit, and OPEC loan are assumed to be similar to existing ones (8.5%
interest, repaid over 24 years including 4 years of grace except proposed
credit with 5 years of grace), loans from Government carry an interest of
5%. The amortization schedule for governmental loans will be defined in such
a way that PTC's financial situation permits repayment.
22.       Subscribers' deposits are based on expected number of connected
telephone and telex subscribers per year and the corresponding tariff (see
Annex 19).
23.       Current liabilities have been increased 10% per year.  Retention
fees for installed equipment under the program is also included.
