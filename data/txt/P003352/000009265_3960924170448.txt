BURMA
SECOND TELECOMMUNICXTIONS PROJECT (CREDIT 958-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        In July 1977, the Government of Burma requested IDA support to
finance a Second Telecommaunications Project to be implemented during
1980-84 under the Government's fourth and fifth four-year National Economic
Plans. This followed the First Telecommunications Project (1975-80) which
was supported by an IDA credit of US$21 million.
2.        The Second Projent aimed at improving the quality of service to
existing subscribers, providing access in existing and new service areas to
meet part of the unsatisfied demand for service, establishing serv4ces to
facilitate the aore efficient use of limited transport capacity and
improving the organization and productivity of the Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation thFough basic institution building.
3.        The original estimatedicost of the project was US$93.0 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$42.4 million.  In
addition to the IDA financing of US$31.5 millionL/, cofinancing from OECF
Japan was obtained to bridge the project's foreign exchange cost gap of
about US$10.9 million. Due to cost increases, the scope of the project was
reduced during execution, eliminating some components with lower priority.
The actual cost of this revised project was about USS80.3 million
equivalent, about 1% higber than its estimated cost in dollar terms (para
3.06).
4.        There was a delay of over three years in completion of the
project.  While several factors contributed to the delay, the principal
factors were: (a) the slow start-up in PTC due to discontinuity in project
management, (b) delay in establishing a dedicated project control unit, and
(c) the considerable delay in securing the services of an expert to
prepare technical specifications for digital switching systems, following
PTC's decision, after appraisal, to procure state-of-the-art systems.
Delays in acquiring suitable sites for the new exchange buildings in
Rangoon was another contributing factor. In retrospect, the project
implementation schedule was tight and had no provision or slack for delays
occasioned by unforeseen circumstances.
The total IDA credit was $US35.0 million, of which $US3.5 million was
applied to cover the foreign cost overrun of the First
Telecommunications Project.



- vil -
5.         The project achieved the targetted Increase of 80.5X ln the
number of subscriber connections though with a delay of about three years.
Telecommunicatiois facilities were extended to 34 new townships.
Subscriber trunk dialing (STD) was extended to 20 major provincial centers
and operator trunk dialing introduced in 54 towns. Telephone bill
processing was isproved by establishing a computerized billing facility
under the project.
6.        PTC achieved rates of return as covenanted and, except for the
delay in submission of the audited financial statements and the continuing
arrears on Government accounts, met other covenants substantially. The
verall financial performance of PTC was satisfactory with the exception of
the accounts receivable.
7.        PTC was able to achieve productivity targets by decreasing the
overall staff-telephone ratio from 118/1,000 in 1979 to 83/1,000 in 1987.
PTC also strengthened its planninxg and training capabilities although in
the planning area further intensive effprts are needed.
8.        Thus, except for the delay in physical implementation mainly due
to initial start-up delays (para. 4), the project was a success as it
achieved all its physical, financial and institutional objectives.
9.        IDA was considering a third follow-up telecommunications
operation in 1986 but this was postponed as the Government decided to
utilize its scarce foreign resources in other higher priority sectors.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (CREDIT 958-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      All public telecommunicat -~z services in Burma are provided and
operated by the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) under the
Ministry of Transport and Communications. Tha Managing Director of the PTC
is appointed by the Council of State of Burma. A small Posts and
Telecommunications Department (PTD) under the Ministry is responsible for
the control of the radio frequency spectrum, frequency regulations and
liaison with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). PTC provides
substantial support in all these areas to the PTD.
1.02      IDA has been associated with the telecommunications sector in
Burma since 1974 through two credits. The first Credit 551-BA of
US$21.0 million was declared effective in July 1975 and closed in June
1980. In November 1979, IDA approved a second Credit 958-BA of
US$35.0 million for the second telecommunications project. This was closed
on December 31,19851/ and is the subject of this completion report.
1I. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01      In July 1977, the Government of Burma (GOB) requested IDA
assistance in financing the foreign exchange cost of the second
telecommunications project to be implemented during 1980-84 under the
Government's third and fourth four-year National Economic Plans (1978-1982
and 1983-1986 respectively). The project was appraised in June 1978.
During appraisal, need was identified for external financing of about
US$10.9 million equivalent, in addition to the US$35.0 million IDA Credit,
to meet the full foreign exchange cost of the project. Following assurance
received in April 1979 that financing from OECF Japan would be available to
bridge this gap, an updating mission visited Burma in July 1979.
Negotiations were held September 12-17, 1979 in Washington and the credit
was approved by IDA's Executive Board on November 27, 1979. The credit of
US$35.0 million included US$3.5 million to cover the foreign cost overrun
of the first project due to appreciation of the Japanese yen. The Credit
Agreement was signed on December 18, 1979 and the credit became effective
on March 3, 1980.
Proiect Objectives
2.02      The objectives of the project were the following:
1/ IDA honored withdrawal applications received upto June 30, 1986
-   (para 3.07).

(a)  improve the quality of service to existing subscribers;
(b)  provide-access to new subscribers in existing service
areas;
(c)  extend telecommunicatiots facilities to the more
important urban and rural areas without service;
(d)  establish essential telecommunications services needed
to facilitate the more efficient use of limited
transport capacity; and
(e)  carry out basic institution building, improving the
organization of PTC and its productivity through
training.
Project Description
2.03      The project consisted of the high p1iority works in PTC's
telecommunications development program (1981-85) and also included items
such as open wire carrier systems and a billing processor which had been
deferred from the first project. Specifically it provided for:
(a)  installation of 31,20b lines of telephone exchange
equipment (including 7,200 lines to replace existing
obsolete systems), together with the associated external
cable networks and subscriber terminal equipment to
connect 29,636 new subscribers;
(b)  extension of telecommunications facilities to 54
townships and 13 villages by installation of small
telephone exchanges and public call offices connected to
the national network;
(c)  extension of the long distance network by expanding
existing trunk exchanges by 1,800 lines, adding
multiplex equipment on existing microwave routes and
providing new microwave systems for the Pegu-Meiktila-
Taunggyi and Mandalay-Lashio routes, together with 11
VHF/UHF systems, 26 3-and-12 channel open-wire carrier
systems for spur routes, and associated multiplex
equipment;

(f) miscellaneous equipment and materials, including the
installation of a billinig processor, improvement of
storage-end transportation facilities, and the urgent
rehabilitation of Rangoon's telephone system;
(g) consulting services;
(h) completion of ongoing works of the first project
(Credit 551-BA).
Project Cost Estimate
2.04      The cost of the project was estimated at Kyats 623.2 million
(US$93.0 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of Kyate
284.2 million (US$42.4 million equivalent).  Of this component, IDA was to
finance US$31.5 million and OECF tthe balance of about US$10.9 million. The
local costs estimated at Kyats 339.0 million (US$50.6 million equivalent)
were to be financed by PTC.
Covenants
2.05      In addition to the IDA/Bank's standard covenants on procurement,
management and reporting, the main covenants in the Credit Agreement
provided that Government shall cause PTC to:
(a)  employ engineering snd telecomunications consultants
whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to IDA;
(b) strengthen its technical planning unit in a manner
satisfactory to IDA;
(c) meet productivity targets agreed to by the Borrower, PTC
and IDA:
(d) carry out a staff training program satisfactory to IDA;
(e) furnish unaudited financial statements as soon as
available and, not later than six months after the end
of each year, the certified copies of audited financial
statements and reports;
(f) review the value of PTC's fixed assets and, beginning
FY1981, revalue its fixed assets for purposes of
calculating the rate of return;
(g) produce an annual rate of return of not less than 92;
(h) not incur any additional borrowing unless debt service
is covered by net revenue by at least 1.5 times;



-4 -
(1)  not make any additional investment in any fiscal year
over US$1 million equivalent unless IDA is given an
opportunity to comment;
(j)  not apply funds arising out of its telecommunications
operations for other purposes unless such funds are in
excess of its telecommunications operational and
investment requirements;
(k)  charge rates for all of its telecommunication services
in accordance with sound commercial principles.
Government also undertook to ensure that all charges for telecommunications
services to Government subscribers from 1980 would be paid promptly and all
accounts in arrears would be settled by March 31, 1981.
2.06      The status of compliance with these covenants is indicated in
Annex 1.  PTC has generally complied with the covenants except for (a)
delays in the submission of audited financial statements and reports;
(b) inadequate support to the planning unit, and (c) drop in productivity
targets in some years. There have also been delays in Government's payment
for telecommunications services.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Credit Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      The Credit Agreement specified March 20, 1980 as the terminal
date for effectiveness of the Credit.   In addition to the standard
conditions, the special conditions of effectiveness for this credit were:
(a)  execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOB and
PTC, duly ratified by all necessary corporate and
government actions; and
(b)  arrangements by GOB, satisfactory to IDA, for obtaining
a firm commitment of the OECF loan.
The subsidiary loan agreement between GOB and PTC was signed on January 29,
1980, and the loan agreement between GOB and OECF was signed on
December 24, 1979. After review of these two agreements and all other
conditions of effectiveness having been met, IDA declared the credit
effective as of March 3, 1980.
3.02      Initial start-up action for procurement, except for the billing
processor, was slow, mainly due to (a) the absence of a dedicated project
control unit, similar to the one which contributed largely to the smooth
execution of the first project, and (b) discontinuity in development
project management with change of Managing Director and transfer of the
Deputy Project Manager who was in charge of the first project. Establish-
ment of the project control unitswas approved by GOB in April 1981 but it
took considerable time thereafter to function effectively.



-5-
Project Revision
3.03      Once procurement action started, it became apparent that the
project faced a cost overrun due to the higher than estimated prices for
the transmission and switching equipment (para 3.06). Due to difficulties
in securing other sources of foreign funds and the need to keep within the
limit of available funds, PTC decided to postpone lower priority items
which did not affect the project's overall financial viability. The radio
communication systems for maritime services were dropped as the maritime
radio needs were met partly by facilities provided by the Burma Ports
Corporation. The radio facilities for transportation/remote access were
postponed, eliminating the need for the consultancy services provided for
this component. The number of townships to which telecommunications
facilities were to be extended was reduced and the long distance microwave
link between Mandalay and Lashio was excluded. There were also some minor
changes in the scope of the local switching equipment. IDA and GOB
mutually agreed in September 1984 to a revision of the project description
and the reallocation of proceeds of the credit (para 3.08). Annex 2 gives
a description of the revised project. Earlier, due to the higher-thanr-
estimated price for the computer equipment, PTC decided to purchase a
computer jointly with the Burma Ports Corporation to keep its share of the
costs down without reducing the offered facilities.
Implementation Schedule
3.04      At appraisal, the project was expected to be completed by
December 31, 1983. Although the IDA credit was completely disbursed by
July 3, 1986, physical completion of the project was delayed until
March 1987, about 39 months behind appraisal estimate. Whilst delay in
initial start-up (para 3.02) was partly responsible, the greatest delay in
project execution occurred in telephone exchange installations. Subsequent
to appraisal, PTC decided, with the concurrence of IDA, to procure
state-of-the-art digital switching systems instead of electromechanical
*       systems for the Rangoon exchanges.  As in-house expertise was not
available, consultant assistance was required for preparation of the
technical specifications. The process of identifying and getting e
suitable consultant through the ITO, as PTC preferred, took considerable
time. Thus, a call for bids for switching equipment for the Rangoon and
provincial exchanges was delayed until January 1983. Bids were opened in
May 1983 and contracts signed in May 1984. Delays in acquisition of land,
particularly for the Rangoon exchanges, also added to the overall delay.
The project was completed in March 1987 with the cutting into service of
the Rangoon exchanges and connection of the targetted number of subscriber
lines.
Cofinancing
3.05      The need for cofinancing, to meet the full foreign exchange costs
of an integrated viable project, was foreseen at the time of appraisal.
The financing gap was estimated at about US$10.9 million (para 2.01).
Government, In consultation with IDA, identified the OECF Japan as an



- 6-
appropriate source for this cofinancing. Vigorous efforts were made during
1978 and early 1979 to secure a firm commitment from the OECF; this was
also made a condition for effectiveness of the IDA credit (para 3.01). The
OECF loan agreement was signed on December 24, 1979. The loan of
Yen 2.2 billion (about US$11 million) was used for financing telex
equipment, extension of automatic telephone exchanges iln 13 towns and
expansion of long distance microwave systems installed under the first
telecommunications project.
Project Costs
3.06      As indicated in paragraph 3.03, the original project was revised,
with deletion of some components and modifications to others. Annex 3
details the estimated and actual costs in kyats of the revised project.
The estimated costo are based on appraisal estimates for the cost of the
project components retained in the revised project. The local, foreign and
total costs of the revised project in equivalent US dollars using the
exchange rates at appraisal and As actually prevailing during project
execution are snmmarized in Table 3.1:
Table 3.1 - Estimated and Actual Costs of Revised Project
Appraisal Estimates             Actual Costs
Local  Foreign    Total  Local   Foreign    Total

USS milliona/   43.95    35.76.   79.71    37.99    42.33    80.32
a/ The exchange rate for the Kyat at appraisal was US$1 - Kyats 6.7;
the annual exchange rate variations have been taken into account in
determining the actual costs in US dollars. This results in a
proforma rate of US$1 - Kyats 7.7 during the project period.
The above table indicates that there was a savings of about 1% in local
costs (in kyate) and an increase of about 18% in foreign costs (in
dollars). The overall cost of the project in equivalent dollars increased
by about 1%, although in terms of kyats there was a cost increase of about
152. The major reason for the 18% increase in foreign costs was the
underestimation by nearly 752 (in dollar terms) in the costs of long
distance equipment.

Credit Allocation
3.08      The original credit allocation and the project description
(para 3.03) were revised in September 1984, to reflect the cost increases
in the long distance and local telephone ne-tworks (Categories 1 and 2), the
deletion of project components under Categories 3 and 5 (para 3.03) and the
availability of UNDP/ITU technical assistance (Category 7 and para 3.11).
The final allocation reflecting actual disbursements under the various
categories differs only slightly from the allocation revised in 1984.
Table 3.3 indicates the original, revised and final allocation of the
credit proceeds.

Reporting
3.09      PTC submitted regular quarterly reports on the physical progress
of the project and operations. However, the audited financial statements
were received on an average 14 months after the close of the financial year
against the covenanted six months due to delayed response by the Auditor
General.
Procurement
3.10      No major problems were encountered during procurement except for
the delay in initial start-up of procurement action, and the delay in
securing the services of a consultant for preparation of the technical
specifications of the digital switching systems (para 3.04).

Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers
3.11      Exclusion of the remote access radio systems component from the
revised project eliminated the need for consultancy services provided for
this component (para 3.03). PTC obtaitizd technical assistance for other
components of the project through a UNDP/ITU technical assistance program.
Under this program, ITU provided experts for the preparation of technical
specifications for the digital switching systems and PCM transmission
systems and for the test and acceptance of the PCM and microwave
transmission systems. The performance of these experts was satisfactory.
The performance of all the suppliers and contractors was satisfactory.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      At appraisal PTC was expected to increase the capacity of the
main exchanges from 31,530 lines (on March 31, 1979) to 76,190 lines (by
December 31, 1983) and the DELs from 26,662 to 56,298. These and other
project objectives were realistic and achievable, but the project
implementation schedule as proposed did not have any allowance for delays
due to unforeseen circumstances. The project objectives were achieved by
March 31, 1987, that is after a delay of three years due to initial project
start-up delay occasioned by: (a) delay in establishment of a dedicated
project management unit; (b) discontinuity of senior levels of the project
management; (c) delay in securing services of an expert for preparation of
digital switching specification; and (d) acquisition of exchange sites for
digital exchanges in Rangoon. Annex 4 gives details of project
implementation.
4.02      Telephone service was extended to 34 new townships over the
project period. In addition, service in 10 provincial towns was
automatized raising the percentage of lines with access to automatic
telephone service from 66% to about 89%.
4.03      The long distance services in the country were extended by
bringing 20 major provincial centers serving about 84% of the provincial
telephones into the national subscriber trunk dialing (STD) network and by
introducing operator trunk dialing (OTD) service in another 54 towns.
4.04      The quality of the local telephone service in Rangoon city
improved with the partial rehabilitation of the Rangoon telephone system
under the project. The service in the provinces also improved with
installation of automatic telephone exchanges and reliable transmission
links.

- 11 - 
5.02      PTC's financial performance was good over the project period.
Operating revenues increased in 1981 and 1982 as anticipated during project
appraisal as a result of (a) a tariff increase averaging 35% in fiscal year
1981, (b) increased international traffic following installation of the
satellite B earth station and (c) a sharp increase in long distance traffic
with the introduction of STD dialing. While revenue/DEL exceeded expected
levels, gross revenues were below levels projected at appraisal due to
slower than expected growth in DELs. The number of DELs increased at 9.4%
per annum over the project period, in contrast to the 17% per annum growth
expected. PTC consistently maintained its rate of return above the
covenanted rate of 9%. The rate fell substantially in 1986 as assets from
the second project were placed in service. Nevertheless, the rate of 13%
in FY86 was still well above covenanted level.
Financial Position
5.03      With the exception of accounts receivable, PTC's financial
position has very been satisfactory. Plant in operation increased sharply
in FY86 as a large portion of equipment acquired under the second project
was placed in service. Work in progress at March 31, 1986 of Kyats 266
million will be placed into service during FY87 and FY88.
5.04      Levels of subscriber accounts receivable in 1986 at the end of
the project period were lower than levels in 1981 but the target of 58 days
revenues at end 1985 was not realized (see table 5.1). Difficulties with
both billing and collection resulted in a poorer than expected performance
in this area (see paras 6.06, 6.07). Since 1983, international inpayments
has become a significant percentage of accounts receivable; the level of
accounts receivable shown on the balance sheet has therefore been adjusted
whilst reviewing PTC's pertormance with respect to subscriber accounts
receivable.
5.05      In all other areas, PTC's performance was in line with or better
than expected at appraisal. The current ratio while below appraisal
estimates in 1981 exceeded projections for the remainder of the period.
The debt/equity ratio was consistently below appraisal estimates
particularly as surplus local funds were used to prepay existing loans.
Sources and Applications of Funds
5.06      PTC's funds flow statements, actual and projected, are summarized
in Table 5.2 below. Annual cash requirements, and thus total borrowings,
were less than expected due to slower implementation of the five-year
investment program and postponment of future investments. Higher than
expected traffic per line increased internally generated funds over
appraisal estimates despite the slow growth in DELs. External financing
was provided by IDA (32%), government (30%) and OECF (9%). Subscriber
deposits provided 2% of total financing.

5.06      PTC's operattons contributed substantially to government
funding. PTC is required to pay commodity taxes and customs duties on all
equipment and materials, the total of which is estimated as approximately
equal to 75Z of the CIF value of imports. Additionally, PTC pays an annual
contribution to government. currently 30% of net income. All loans are
repaid at commercial interest rates including those provided to government
on concessionary terms. Over the project period, total net transfers to
government increased from K 4.4 million in 1981 to K 135.9 million in
1986.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01      PTC's management strLcture has remained unchanged since 1975.
PTC is administered by a Board of Directors, chaired by the Managing
Director who is appointed by the Council of State. The Managing Director
conducts the day-to-day affairs assisted by headquarters staff headed by a
General Manager. The urganization at headquarters underwent some changes
since 1980. The Planning and Operations Department, under a Deputy General
Manager, was converted to an Operations and Inspections Department; a
Planning and Training Department was created under a new Deputy General
Manager. As agreed with IDA, a planning unit was established in 1982 in
this Department. However, due to shortage of experienced high level staff,
the unit is understaffed and planning work continues to be done by
experienced staff from other operational units. The trainint, --ing of the
Department oversees the local and overseas training programs as well as the
activities of the postal and telecommunications training center established
under UNDP funding. The dedicated unit for monitoring the implementation
of development works which functioned efficiently through the First
Telecommunications Project was terminated in 1980 at its conclusion. A
similar unit for monitoring the Second Telecommunications Project was
created in 1981, but without the full complement of staff. This
discontinuity adversely affected the initial implementation of the second
project (para 3.04). However, the situation improved considerably in the
later stages of project execution.
6.02      Management of PTC was stable throughout the 1980-86 period.  In
1986 a new Managing Director was appointed. Other changes in the principal
officers were new appointments due to the retirement of the General Manager
and the transfer of the Chief Accounts Officer in 1984.
Staff Recruitment, Training and Development
6.03      On March 31, 1979 the total telecommunications staff was 4,030
giving a ratio of 118 employees per 1,000 telephones. The credit agreement
called for an increase in productivity to 87 employees per 1,000 telephones
by 1985. PTC maintained a modest growth of staff at an average rate of
about 5Z per annum and at the end of March 31, 1987 the total staff was
5,780. By March 1987, PTC attained a staff ratio of 83 per 1,000
telephones which exceeded the covenantled productivity target of 87 staff
per 1,000 telephones. Table 6.1 indicates the projected and actual staff
ratio per 1,000 telephones over the project implementation period.

6.04     With technical assistance from UNDP/ITU, PTC established a
training center for telecommunications and postal staff; these facilities
were upgraded and expanded under subsequent phases of the technical
assistance program. In addition to training newly appointed staff, the
center provides refresher courses and has been conducting seminars for
higher level staff. From 1979 until 1986 the PTC training center conducted
about 200 courses and trained 3,400 employees. The quality of training is
satisfactory.
Accounting
6.05      PTC's branch offices at states and divisions maintain their
accounts on cash basis. These cash accounts are converted to accrual
accounts monthly at PTC head office.  Accounting is centralized at PTC
headquarters in Rangoon. Most accounting processes are performed
manually. While subscriber billing is computerized, it still requires
substantial manual support (see para 6.06), consequently delaying issue of
bills and availability of financial data. Despite the inefficiencies in
PTC's system, it produces relatively accurate information and has adequate
internal controls. Significant improvement in the timeliness of financial
information is unlikely without further computerization of accounting
functions. Improving PTC's financial and accounting systems was one of the
objectives of the deferred third telecomunications project.
Billing and Collection
6.06      PTC's arrangements for billing were expected to improve with the
installation of the automatic billing processor which was put into service
in April 1982. The billing processor did result in some improvements,
allowing PTC to produce monthly bills and reducing the time required for
processing bills from four to three months. Nevertheless, both billing and
collection procedures continued to be weak areas in PTC. Technical
malfunctions in the automatic data recorders at exchanges and difficulties
in obtaining foreign exchange release for needed spares made it necessary
in 1984/1985 to introduce extensive manual verification procedures before
issue of bills. The substantial time required to process the manual



- 15 -
portions of the monthly bill also made it difficult to achieve further
reductions in the billing cycle. One of the objectives of the proposed
third project which was deferred was improvement of PTC's computer
facilities to allow further computerization of billing and other accounting
functions.
6.07      It was recognized during project appraisal that the procedures
for collection of bills from government subscribers needed improvement.
The Credit Agreement provided that government (a) would settle all its
accounts in arrears not later than March 1981; and (b) would promptly pay
all bills not later than 60 days after their submission by PTC. The record
of settlement of government as well as private accounts has not been
satisfactory despite PTC's efforts. Telephone accounts rece4vable in days
increased from 74 in 1982 to 104/107 in FY 1984 and FY 1985. Government
accounts represented about 50% of this total. While collection in general
was better for private subscribers, the fact that the corporation was
prohibited for almost a year during FY Z&185 from disconnecting private
subscribers for nonpayment contributed to the generally poor collection
performance. Significant improvement wai made in government accounts in
1985 (telex and telegraph) and in 19b< /telephone) through special effort
by PTC. Collection of Government Accounts is likely to continue to be a
problem area.
Audit
6.08      PTC's accounts are audited by the Auditor General.  It takes PTC
about five months to reconcile accounts and to prepare financial
statements. The Auditor General requires a further three to five months on
average to complete the annual audit. Thus PTC was unable to meet the
covenanted requirement of submission of audit reports within six months
which were received in the Bank, on an average, 14 months after the close
of the financial year due to delayed response of the Auditor General.
However, to assist IDA supervision, unaudited financial statements were
submitted to IDA as soon as they were available; generally within six
uaonths of the close of the fiscal year.
Tariffs
6.09      PTC's telephone tariffs were increased from April 1, 1980 by an
average of 35% and its telegraph tariffs by an average of 20%. This was in
line with IDA's recommendations. In October 1984, another small increase
in tariffs was made. Annual rentals on telephone connections were
increased by about 12-1/2% and installation charges by about 20%. These
measures increased telephone revenue by about K 3.9 million or 32 in 1985.
A summary of tariff changes is given in the table at Annex 8.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.01      The project achieved the basic objectives which were to improve
the quality of existing service, to provide access to new subscribers, and



-16-
to increase the efficiency and productivity of the organization. However,
with regard to access, only 38 new townships were connected to the network
instead of the planned 54 townships and 13 villages.
Project Spin-off
7.02      The project provided support to the indigenous industries
manufacturing concrete cable ducts and steel poles for overhead line
construction.
Least Cost Solution
7.03      The project design at appraisal represented the least cost
solution. During implementation, the only major change was in the
procurement of digital telephone switching equipment instead of the
electro-mechanical systems envisaged at appraisal.  The adoption of this
technology is in keeping with the times ead the positive results of studies
and experience in other countries and is also appropriate for the Burmese
National Network.
Rate of Return
7.04      Given the difficulty in separating the economic benefits of the
first aud second telecommunications projects, the economic rate of return
was calculated for PTC's FY'8 to FY87 investment program which encompasses
both projects. The overall rate of return was 13.8% (see Annex 9). The
rate estimated at appraisal for the 1978 to 1985 program was 15.6%. The
actual economic rate of return is better than the calculated rate since it
understates the overall economic benefit of the project such as the
consumer surplus and the network deterioration in the system which would
have resulted if the project was not implemented.
VIII. IDA'S PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance
8.01      In retrospect, IDA's assessment of the project size was
appropriate. However, the schedule of implementation, though realizable
under the circumstances prevailing at time of appraisal, did not have much
slack for delays due to changed conditions. Although electromechanical
iystems were envisaged at the time of appraisal for the new local and long
distance telephone exchanges, PTC decided, at implementation stage, to
adopt the modern state-of-the-art digital switching systems which, by then,
had been field-proven. This was in line with the trend in other developing
countries. IDA supported the change, even though it resulted in delays in
procurement. Other factors leading to delay (see Highlights para 4.0)
could not have been foreseen. Cost of the long distance equipment was
under-estimated by 75%, necessitating change in project scope. IDA
provided substantial support and assistance in the establishment of the
computerized billing equipment and its operations.



17
8.02      IDA played an active role 4n obtaining cofinancing for the
project from the OECF Japan through its field missions and the Resident
Mission in Tokyo. Good coordination was established with the ITU and the
UNDP Resident Mission in Burma to facilitate the technical assistance and
training support fez PTC for the project. IDA performance on the whole has
been satisfactory.
Supervision
8.03      IDA's supervisory effort on the project was adequate and there
were regular annual supervision missions.
Working Relationship
8.04      IDA maintained good working relationship with the Government and
PTC. PTC made all relevant information readily available to IDA staff and
the response to enquiries was always prompt and adequate.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The project achieved its major objectives.  The basic
infrastructure of a modern national telecommunications network, established
under the first project was further consolidated and expanded with modern
digital switching systems.  The growth of subscribers at 9.4X average,
although short of the 17% anticipated at appraisal, was comparable with
that in most developing countries. The overall productivity of the staff
-        improved substantially from 118 staff/1,000 DELs in 1979 to 83/1,000 In
1987. PTC has strengthened its planning and training capabilities,
although further efforts are needed in the planning area. PTC has been
able to consistently achieve an adequate rate of return and, despite a
history of poor billing collection has exhibited good overall financial
performance. The record indicates that the Second Project was a success.
9.02      With regard to lessons learnt, while the appraisal team could not
have foreseen discontinuity in project managers or PTC's decision to
change-over to digital switching systems, it could have required a Project
Management Unit to be established before IDA approval of the credit. Also,
some allowance could have been made in the otherwise tight implementation
schedule for delays due to unforeseen circumstances.
9.03      A follow-on Third Telecommunications Project was considered
appropriate and would have continued the basic improvements and access to
service. It would have followed through the institution-building measures
initiated under the First and Second Telecommunications Projects, with
particular emphasis on planning capability and improved financial
management and control.  However, it was deferred because of other higher
priority demands on the country's available foreign resources.

BURNA
SECOND TELECOHMUNICATIONS PROJECT (CREDIT 958-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Return On Investments
1.        The benefit period of the project extends from FY1986 to FY2006
when on average the equipment provided under the project would have
b exceeded its useful life. PTC's FY81-86 program included parts of the
first project which were completed in FY1982.  The overlapping of the first
and second projects and the close _elationship between equipment installed
under the two projects and the total telecommunications investment program
make any attempt to separate incremental costs and revenues for the second
project very arbitrary. The rate of return calculated in this annex,
therefore, is for PTC's total FYs78-86 investment program. Specification
of incremental costs and benefits starts from FY78, when the first capital
outlays under the first project were made, and finishes in FY88, when most
benefits directly related to the expenditures made under the second project
would have materialized.
2.        All costs and benefits streams have been expressed in 1978
