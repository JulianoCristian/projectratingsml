None of them is located in\n            occupied territories. Military traffic constitutes an\n            insignificant fraction of total movement on the project\n            roads and has not been taken into account in estimating\n            traffic on them. The largest single project item is the\n            first phase of the Ayalon expressway, designed as a\n            collector for interurban traffic and a distributor for\n            traffic through the main east-west arteries of Tel-Aviv. The\n            other works, most of which are situated in the densely\n            inhabited central part of the country, have been selected to\n            eliminate bottlenecks, reduce travel distances and permit\n            faster travel speeds. The loan would also finance some\n            additional equipment for the Central Roads Laboratory of PWD\n            for the testing of materials and soils, as well as weighing\n            devices for a proposed axle-load study and for the\n            enforcement of regulations regarding vehicle weights."}, "docdt": "1971-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
