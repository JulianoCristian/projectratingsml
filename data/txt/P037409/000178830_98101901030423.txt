PROJECT COMPLETrION REPORT
ISRAEL: SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 781-IS)
PREFACE
1.       The Second Highway Project, for which Loan 781-IS for US$30 million
was approved in July 1971, had two main objectives:
(i)    the improvement of the inter-urban network; and
(ii)   the improvement of the intra-urban road network in Tel Aviv,
particularly in the Central Business District (CBD) and to
the international Ben Gurion airport. Both these objectives
were consistent with the aims of Israel's 1971-75 highway
development program.
2.       The loan was closed in June 1981 after cancellation of US$80,000.
3.       A copy of the Project Completion Report (PCR) was sent to the
Borrower on January 24, 1983, for review. The Government deemed the PCR
satisfactory and had no other comments to make (see Annex I to the PCR).

HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The main highlight was the reduction of the project scope to
counteract unexpected changes in Israel's economic situation, which brought
about high inflation and compensatory continuous devaluation (see paras.
1.05, 4.01 and 4.11).
2.       The main truncation of the project was the reduction of the scope of
works on the Ayalon component in the CBD of Tel Aviv. The Government remains
committed to the completion of the whole Ayalon project as envisaged at
appraisal and negotiations, although the construction period will be extended
to 1985/86, at which time a supplementary PCR is recommended (see para. 6.11).
3.        Implementation was slower than expected due to budgetary constraints,
delays in land acquisition and shortage of manpower and construction equip-
ment during the 1973 hostilities and its aftermath (see para. 4.08).
4.       Although the construction expenditures in Israeli pounds increased
considerably, the US$ equivalent of the truncated project decreased, indicat-
ing that the progressive devaluation of Israeli currency offset the effects
of inflation (see paras. 4.13 and 7.04).
5.       The quality of construction is of a high standard.     The complex
Ayalon component, involving highways, bridges, canals and railways within a
very busy central business district, was commendably executed with the
interference to existing traffic conditions minimized (see para. 4.18).






I. Introduction
1.01     The first of three Bank loans for the transport sector involved
US$27.5 million equivalent (265-IS) financial assistance beginning in 1960 for
the construction of the port of Ashdod.
1.02     The second transport sector loan (Loan 323-IS--First Highway Project)
of US$22 million equivalent was made in 1962 for the construction and improve-
ment of 611 km of main and district roads and 460 km of feeder roads and also
for the transport survey carried out by foreign consultants during 1964 and
1965 which became the starting point for national transportation planning in
Israel, and which, in turn, generated the basis for the Second Highway
Project, which is the subject of this report.
1.03     In 1969 the State of Israel requested the Bank to help finance the
Israeli 1971-75 highway development program, which had been developed from the
outputs of the 1964-65 consultants' transport survey undertaken in the First
Highway Project. The Bank responded to this request by sending pre-appraisal
and appraisal missions to Israel in 1969 and December 1970, the outcome of
which resulted in the Second Highway Project being presented to the Board on
July 14, 1971, signed on July 14, 1971 and becoming effective on
August 16, 1971.
1.04     The 1971-75 highway development program was designed with two main
objectives. The first was the widening and improvement of the main inter-
urban network to support the development of new agricultural areas, the
creation of new towns, the expansion of industry and its dispersal over the
country and the increasing utilization of the port of Ashdod and Ben Gurion
airport. The second was the improvement of the intra-urban road network in
the large cities. The Second Highway Loan provided foreign exchange support
for some of the key components (para. 3.02) of this program.
1.05     During the process of implementation very substantial cost overruns
occurred due to major unexpected changes in Israel's economic situation,
energy crises, 1973 war and its aftermath. The Israeli Government approached
the Bank for a reduction in the project component. The reduction was mainly
justified on the grounds of general savings measures applied by the Government
to combat unusually high inflation. All public spending was reduced and
restricted to what were considered highest priority projects. The Bank agreed
with this policy from an overall economic point of view. Since the Second
Highway Project consisted of several economically self-reliant subprojects,
the project content could be reduced (paras. 4.01 and 4.10) without affecting
the project character (see Map 3155R1(PCR)).

II. Sector Background
2.01     Israel with an area of about 21,000 sq. km has a well developed and
evenly distributed transportation network (Map 3155R1(PCR)) that provides
access to all major centers of economic activity. The transportation network
includes about 12,000 km of roads, about 500 km of main railway lines, three
major sea ports and a pipeline network for crude and refined petroleum
products.
2.02     Highways are the main mode of transport for passengers and freight in
Israel, carrying about 98% of the passenger and 80% of inland freight traffic.
The railways primarily carry freight and only about 20% of their revenue is
from passenger traffic. Israel is heavily dependent on sea and air transport
for foreign trade.
2.03     The growth in traffic has generally been higher than the rate of
growth in the economy. The motor vehicle fleet has grown from about 51,000 in
1960 to about 470,000 in 1980 (average 11.7% per year). As a result many sec-
tions of the highway network became congested. The Tel Aviv metropolitan
area, comprising seven municipalities, is Israel's largest conglomeration. It
is in this highly populated central area of the country that rapidly growing
traffic volumes required a substantial increase in highway network capacity.
The currently completed highway project was designed to provide additional
capacity necessary on some of these important road sections to meet the
increasing demands of a growing economy.
2.04     The present national highway network is basically capable of satisfy-
ing the transportation demands of the economy and its condition is not
inhibiting the development of the various economic sectors. Highway mainte-
nance is good.
2.05     In general, transport is well planned and co-ordinated.    There is no
obvious conflict between modes. There are no restrictions on choice of mode
by shippers and the transport industry is fully competitive.

III.  Project Preparation and Appraisal
3.01     A comprehensive transport study of the Tel Aviv metropolitan
area was carried out by consultants between 1966 and 1968 and formed the
basis for the inclusion of the Ayalon Expressway in the project.
3.02     During the preparation of the national transportation plan
(para. 1.02) by the Government, aided by consultants, Bank missions first
identified a group of prima facie project components for further study
for inclusion in a Bank project. Later, as the five-year program pro-
gressed, Bank missions refined the original prima facie selections on the
basis of economic feasibilities to 12 high-priority components (see Map
3155R1(PCR)) whose total proposed costs at that time represented about
63% of the proposed expenditure on highways from 1971 to 1975. Nine of
the proposed project components were situated in and around Tel Aviv,
with the Ayalon Expressway for that city being the largest single
component.
3.03     The Government agreed with the selection of project components
by rankings in economic feasibilities.
3.04     The major loan covenants originated from agreements between the
Borrower and the Bank during negotiations to recognize the needs for:
(a) investigation of vehicle dimensions and axle loads to
determine to what extent these conformed to existing traffic
regulations;
(b) amendment of existing traffic regulations if the results of
the investigation of vehicle dimensions and axle loads
demonstrated the need therefor; and
(c) complementary investments in improvements to Tel Aviv City
streets to improve traffic flows to and from the Ayalon
Expressway, the major project component.
3.05     The seven-month period (December 1970 to July 1971) between
appraisal and Board presentation was adequate. Loan effectiveness in
August 1971 was appropriately timed with the project cycle as work on the
first of a series of construction contracts began in January 1972.
3.06     The stages of the loan processing from Borrower's request
through identification, preparation, appraisal, Board presentation and
signature to effectiveness proceeded efficiently.

IV. Project Implementation and Cost
A. General
4.01     The orginal project, as envisaged at appraisal and negotiations,
had to be reduced in scope and cost in 1975 (see paras. 1.05, 4.10 and
4.11) when assessment by the Borrower and the Bank revealed that the
effects of:
(i)    earlier hostilities;
(ii)   high inflation;
(iii)  continuous devaluation of the Israeli currency;
(iv)   construction materials price increases; and
(v)    limitations of Government funds for the project
would raise and extend the original cost and construction duration
estimates beyond acceptable, practical limits and diminish the effective-
ness of the Bank's participation.
4.02     Physical progress of construction was much slower than expected
at appraisal and negotiations (see Chart 1). Despite truncation of the
original project, completion of the revised project was only achieved in
June 1981, or five-and-a-half years later than the expected completion of
the original project mainly because of severe budgetary constraints (see
also paras. 4.08 and 4.09).
4.03     The original Closing Date of the loan, June 30, 1976, was
extended three times by the Bank at the request of the Borrower:

4.04     The final cost of the truncated project was IE 1,235.3 million
(US$81.4 million equivalent) compared to the estimated cost of the
original project of IE319.5 million (US$91.3 million equivalent). Reim-
bursements totalling US$29.92 million equivalent were made by the Bank
and the undisbursed balance of the loan at the completion of the trun-
cated project, US$0.08 million, was cancelled (see Chart 2).
B. Execution of Civil Works
4.05     The Government accepted the principle of international competi-
tive bidding (ICB) for the Second Highway Project because, since the
First Highway Project in 1962, the local contracting industry had



-5-
developed experience and capacity to undertake large highway construction
projects at home and overseas and some foreign contractors had expressed
interest in bidding for contracts in Israel. Although at the time of
appraisal in December 1970, 14 firms (eight local and six foreign) had
been prequalified to bid, only local contract rs responded to invitations
to bid except in one case. For the nine MA T and the Ayalon project
components reimbursable under the loan, contracts were awarded to local
contractors as follows:

1979                        1
4.06     The SAR reported the schedule for procurement of construction
works spread over a four-year period, 1971-75. The first group of con-
tracts for the MAZ components was expected to be awarded in early 1972
and to be followed by a second group later in that year. For the Ayalon
construction component, which was to be split into three contracts with
contractors having the option to bid on any combination thereof, con-
struction was expected to start in mid-1972 after earlier finalization of
land acquisition and be completed by the end of 1975. Please refer to
Chart 1 and Table 1.
4.07     Although three of the MAZ construction components were started
in 1972 the remainder were delayed by budgetary constraints and the last
component to be started, Geha Interchange, did not begin until May 1979.
Despite extensions of time for extra work and inclement weather, delays
in completion ranged from 4 to 34 months (Azur Interchange, where land
acquisition was mainly responsible) with an average of 13 months (see
Chart 1).
4.08     Apart from budgetary constraints which affected the timing of
contract starts, the two main general reasons for delays in specified
construction periods were:
(i) physical obstructions, generally encountered at the start
of construction, such as relocation of water mains,
telephone cables, electricity lines and maintenance of
railway track operation near one project; and
1/ Public Works Department of the Ministry of Construction and Housing.



-6-
(ii) land acquisition particularly at Azur Interchange and on
the Ayalon component.
Two other contributing reasons for delays in constructions were:
(iii)  the shortage of manpower and construction equipment
during the 1973 hostilities and in its aftermath; and
(iv)  the enforcement of the maximum axle load in August 1977
which retarded the rate of extraction and haulage of
borrow excavation, sub-base, base and pavement materials
during the second half of 1977.
4.09     The causes of delays in particular contracts, additional to
those mentioned above, are given in the following subparagraphs:
(a)    Beit Kama - Beer Sheba Road - Extra agricultural overpass
and box culverts required.
(b)    Shefaram - Nazareth Road - Work standstill caused by
discovery of antiquities. Increase in earthwork, sub-
base and base course materials because bearing capacity
of subgrade was below design expectations.
(c)    Bat Shlomo - Missaf Arakim Road - Change of source of
base course materials and quantity increases for
earthworks, box culverts and asphalt wearing course.
(d)    Netanya Interchange - Drainage problems near electrified
railway track, control of existing traffic during
construction and design change for road-over-rail bridge.
(e)    Abir Interchange - Access difficulties to nearby brewery,
ramp design changes and increases in earthworks, culverts
and lighting.
(f)    Ben Gurion Airport - Lod Interchange - Net increases in
earthworks, bridgeworks and day work.
(g)    Azur Interchange - Budget restrictions necessitated a
reduction of bridge width, diversion of manpower and
equipment to a nearby higher priority road section and
the rainy winter of 1978/79.
(h)    Ganot - Lod Expressway - Increases in earthworks and base
course on some sections, increased fill due to reduction
of embankment side slopes and a month long engineers
strike.



-7-
(i)    Geha Interchange - Difficulties with installation of
underground drainage and removal of a section of the
national water carrier pipeline.
(j)    Ayalon Component - Design change for part of the canal
works from reinforced concrete to stone-filled gabion
type.
4.10     Three other MAZ project components (Beit Dagan-Ramleh, Rishon-
Rehovoth and Ra'anana-Beit Lid) were directly financed by the Government
as works were carried out by force account to avoid the higher costs that
the Government expected would have been included in contractor's bids for
construction under unrestricted traffic conditions.
4.11     The truncation of the project to- take account of the factors
mentioned in para. 4.01 above was achieved in October 1975 by mutual
agreement of the Government and the Bank to the following (please see
Map 3156R(PCR)):
(a)    Reimbursements for the MAZ component Ayalon (end of
Jerusalem Extension)--Ganot-Lod-Ramleh being restricted
to the works up to Lod only. The construction work
between Lod and Ramleh was directly Government-financed;
and
(b)    Reducing the elements of the Ayalon component qualified
for reimbursements from the loan by:
(i)   reducing 7 km of four-lane expressway to 3 km of
the four-lane Jerusalem extension;
(ii) reducing bridges from seven to three (Kibutz
Galuyot, Hashalom and Petah Tikvah); and
(iii) confining canal works for regulating the Ayalon
river to about 2.5 km and changing about 1.2 km of
canal from reinforced concrete to stone-filled
gabion type.
In order to maximize the benefits from the limited financial resources
available, the Government examined the comparative attractiveness of
several alternative forms of truncation and the most beneficial alterna-
tive was chosen.
C. Costs
4.12     In the SAR, foreign exchange costs were assessed at
US$37.5 million (July 1970 prices). on the assumptions that:
(a)    project components 1, 2, & 3 (Ayalon Expressway,
Ayalon-Ganot-Lod-Ramleh and Beit Dagan-Ramleh) would
involve equal participation by foreign and local
contractors and that all other components would be
constructed by local contractors only, resulting in the
foreign exchange component of construction being 42%;
foreign exchange components of construction costs were
51% and 37.5% for foreign and local contractors
respectively.



-8-
(b)    physical contingencies would be 10;
(c)    annual escalation of foreign and local prices would be 5%;
(d)    25% of consultants' services would be foreign costs; and
(e)    equipment for materials and research testing would be
100% foreign costs.
The loan amount of US¢30 million therefore represented 80% of the esti-
mated foreign exchange cost of the project and the Bank participation in
the construction component was set at 33% (or 80% of the foreign exchange
component). However, a proviso, introduced in the SAR (para. 4.12) and
incorporated in the Loan Agreement (Schedule 1, Section 5(a)), allowed
for an increase in the Bank participation to a maximum of 42% in the
event that total construction expenditures should decrease so that the
Borrower could withdraw at an even rate the full balance of the amount
then remaining allocated to the construction category of the loan.
4.13      Although the construction expenditures in Israel pounds increased
considerably, particularly due to high, continuous devaiuation of Israeli
currency, the US$ equivalent cost of the truncated project decreased from
US$85.9 million equivalent at July 1970 prices to US$81.4 million at
current prices (Tables 2, 3 and 4).
4.14      The Government therefore proposed and the Bank agreed in April
1978 to invoke the provisions of Schedule 1, Section 5(a) of the Loan
Agreement whereby an effective even rate of Bank participation at 42% of
construction expenditures was reimbursed.
4.15      Prior to July 1978, withdrawal applications had been made at 33%
of total expenditures. To adjust these previous disbursements at a 33%
rate to an effective even rate of 42% overall, withdrawal applications
received by the Bank between July 1978 and December 1979 were disbursed
at 95% of total expenditures; thereafter disbursements were continued to
the end of the project at 42% (see below and Chart 2).

-9-
4.16     Towards the end of 1977, the exchange rate of the Israeli pound,
already 180% lower the rate at appraisal in December 1970, fell a further
190% and continued to decline sharply (see Table 5). Although high
inflationary construction price increases were mostly offset by the fal-
ling exchange rate, the reduction of exchange parity during the period
between actual construction and submission of withdrawal applications to
the Bank, exacerbated the rate of disbursements from the loan account.
Eventually, when the final Closing Date of the loan was reached,
US$0.08 million were cancelled because the US dollar equivalent of the
last eligible reimbursement claims for the truncated project, as earlier
defined plus an additional Ayalon bridge which was reinstated as part of
the project, was insufficient to raise disbursements to the US$30 million
level of the original loan amount.
4.17     Hence, on closing the loan account, the effective overall dis-
bursement rate was 36.7% of total expenditures, not the 42% intended (see
para. 4.14). Please refer to Tables 1 to 12 and Charts 1 & 2 for cumula-
tive expenditures for civil works and comparison of disbursement profiles
at SAR and on completion of the project.
D. Quality of the Completed Works
4.18     The quality of the completed works was consistently good for
bridges and roads alike and their performance under traffic has been
satisfactory. The largest bridge on the Ayalon component at Petah Tikva
deserves special mention for the aesthestics of its design, both of the
superstructure when viewed from the overpass and the super and substruc-
tures when seen from the underpass roads along the Ayalon canal banks.
E. Equipment Procurement
4.19     The project included procurement of materials testing equipment
and mobile weighing devices totalling US$100,000, whereas only US$48,370
was disbursed for a highway skid resistance system, moisture/density soil
gauge, engineering seismograph, road meter, axle weight analyser system,
soil shear tests apparatus and a laboratory precision balance. The
balance of US$51,630 was part of the US$78,324.27 cancelled at the end of
the project.
F. Consulting Services
4.20     The allocation of US$1.2 million to Category II, Consultants'
Services for construction supervision was reduced to nil in two stages by
reallocation to Category I, Civil Works, since no foreign expenditures
were involved in the supervision services for the Ayalon component which
were satisfactorily carried out by local consultants.
G. Loan Covenants
4.21     All general loan covenants were complied with satisfactorily by
the Borrower as were the five specific covenants relating to:



-10-
(i)   collection of highway planning data;
(ii)   consistency of vehicle dimensions and axle loads with
traffic regulations;
(iii) the undertaking of a study on traffic regulations;
(iv)   provision of adequate staff for planning, construction
and maintenance of the Ayalon component; and
(v)   the provision of resources for complementary investments
in Tel Aviv city streets, although budget constraints
resulted in the investment period becoming longer than
expected at appraisal.



-11-
V. Institutional Development
5.01     Using as a basis the results of a transport survey carried out by
consultants in 1964 and 1965 under the First Highway Project, the appropriate
agencies of the Government formulated a transportation investment plan which
included components of the Second Highway Project. The Government agencies
were efficient in adaptation of the project implementation to react to budget
restraints, high cost escalation and severe currency devaluation. Both MAZ
and the Ayalon Highways Co. consistently and effectively collaborated with the
Bank in all aspects of the project from preparation through procurement and
supervision to completion. The Government agencies developed and sustained an
efficient and effective project management system.
5.02     The first Bank highway project was undertaken by force account sup-
plemented by contracting small works or materials supply with local contrac-
tors. With Bank's encouragement there has been a growing trend since 1967 to
contracting road works. There are now a number of sizable local firms, some
of whom are active overseas. The growth of the contracting industry has also
helped to modernize the local industry. The Israeli authorities who were
reluctant to accept international competitive bidding (ICB) for civil works in
the first highway loan agreed to accepting ICB in accordance with the Bank
guidelines for the second highway project. The domestic contracting industry
which was by that time capable, highly competitive and sufficiently aggres-
sive, won all the contracts for civil works in the Second Highway Project.



-12-
VI. Economic Justification
A. General
6.01     The main objectives of the project were to reduce the cost of
transport and relieve congestion by eliminating some important transport
bottlenecks, reducing travel distances, and accelerating travel speeds. As
the Israeli economy grows and produces more perishable agricultural and
higher value industrial goods for export, more efficient transport services
between producing areas and principal export outlets are expected to bring
significant benefits to the economy. A substantial part of the completed
project would help provide this.
6.02     The largest single project item is the first phase of the Ayalon
Expressway, designed as a north-south collector for inter-urban traffic and a
distributor for traffic through the main east-west arteries of Tel Aviv. The
Ayalon Expressway together with the Ganot-Lod expressway improves connection
between Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion airport and the eastern part of the country.
Because of the unexpected changes in Israel's economic situation due to heavy
inflationary pressures, energy crises, 1973 war and its aftermath, the
Government of Israel in consultation with the Bank decided to reduce the
construction program of the first phase of the Ayalon Expressway (paras. 4.01
and 4.11). Even after this truncation, two sub-projects, Ayalon Expressway
(Jerusalem extension) and Ganot-Lod Expressway, which are inter-linked, are
the two principal components of the entire project and together account for
more than 60% of the total construction costs.
B. Traffic
6.03     The average daily traffic volumes on the project road sections as
estimated at appraisal and from actual counts and latest estimates are shown
in Table 13.
Ayalon Expressway (Jerusalem Extension) and Ganot-Lod Expressway
6.04     The appraisal estimate of the traffic assignment to the Ayalon-
Ganot-Lod road assumed the construction of the Ayalon Expressway, and the
above two sub-projects have, therefore, been studied together in this ex-post
evaluation for a valid comparison. Average annual daily traffic (AADT) on
the two expressways is substantially lower than the appraisal forecast. This
is mainly because the presently completed portion of the Ayalon Expressway
(Jerusalem extension) forms only a part of the Ayalon Expressway originally
appraised and, therefore, is not able to attract at this stage a sizeable
portion of the traffic presently using eastern Tel Aviv Bypass to avoid
congested city streets. The utilization of these two sections will improve
significantly as further stages of the Ayalon Expressway are completed and
come into service. The percentage of trucks and buses is about 10% of the
total AADT and compares favorably with the appraisal estimate.



-13-
Azur, Geha, Abir and Netanya Interchanges
6.05     The average daily traffic on all the four-grade separated inter-
changes is high and the actual traffic in 1980 is quite close to appraisal
estimates for Azur and Geha interchanges but is about 40% lower than the
appraisal estimates for Abir and Netanya interchanges.. Apparently, the
appraisal assessment of the prospect of traffic for these two latter inter-
changes was somewhat optimistic. However, it is difficult to determine to
what extent the over-estimation of traffic could have been avoided. At
appraisal, the trend of growth of traffic on these intersections for the
preceeding few years exceeded 15% per annum as the intersections were located
in the highly populated central area in Israel and traffic was expected to
continue to grow. Thus, the appraisal forecast of about 10% traffic growth
per annum for the succeeding period during the seventies and thereafter a
declining rate to less than 5% per annum in the nineties, would not seem
unreasonable. However, the traffic on these two interchanges is expected to
increase sharply with the completion of the next stage of Ayalon Expressway
by 1985 and the subsequent diversion of traffic from the roads east of
Tel Aviv.
Shefar Am-Nazareth, Bat Shlomo-Missaf Amakim,
and Beit Kama-Beer Sheba Road Sections
6.06     Average daily traffic (1980) on Shefar Am-Nazareth and Beit Kama-
Beer Sheba sections is lower than the estimated volume by about 25%, though
the Beit Kama-Beer Sheba section had a surge of traffic in 1974 seemingly
caused as a result of war.   On Bat Shlomo-Missaf Amakim section, overall
traffic (1980) was close to the appraisal estimates.
C. Economic Costs and Benefits
6.07     Savings in the congestion costs are the main benefits from the
construction of Ayalon Expressway (Jerusalem extension) and Ayalon-Ganot-Lod
Expressway. They are the difference between the costs which are (or will be)
incurred by the users of the expressways and those costs which would have
been incurred by the same users on the Tel-Aviv street network without the
expressways. The costs and benefits of the Ayalon Expressway and Ganot-Lod
Expressway have been considered for three cases: Case I, in addition to the
construction costs of Jerusalem extension and Ganot-Lod Expressway, the cost
stream also includes all the complementary investments for improvement of
city streets, construction of canal and bridges which do not generate ade-
quate benefits now because the corridor is not yet complete. In this case,
future potential benefits have not been included in the actual benefit stream
for present traffic and projections thereof. In Case II, the complementary
investments mentioned above have been excluded from the cost streams, while
comparing against the same benefit streams. In Case III, the cost streams
include not only the complementary investments, but also the additional
investments that will be necessary to complete the first phase of the Ayalon
Expressway as appraised and the benefit streams include the potential bene-
fits which will be realized on completion.



-14-
6.08     The benefits from the provision of the four grade-separated inter-
changes primarily consist of time savings of professional drivers and
passengers making business trips and avoidance of costs incurred by vehicles
while stopping and starting at traffic-actuated signals. The benefits from
the other three sub-projects accrue from operational cost savings resulting
from faster-moving traffic on improved facilities and reduction of travel
distances. In the case of Beer Sheba-Beit Kama section, about 80% of the
total benefits are due to distance savings alone.
6.09     Vehicle operating costs (including costs of productive drivers' time
and passenger time travelling for business purposes) at various speeds are
shown in Table 14, as estimated at appraisal and as revised on the basis of
updating operational cost information available for the years 1975 and 1980.
The figures show that average vehicle operating costs, and therefore savings,
have increased by about four times from 1970 to 1975 and by another 12 times
from 1975 to 1980. This increase is primarily due to very high rate of
inflation in Israel and partly to the marked producer price increases in
petroleum products.
6.10     The costs in Israeli currency of construction of the project roads,
Shefar Am-Nazareth, Bat Shlomo-Missaf Amakim, Beit Kama-Beer Sheba and the
Abir and Netanya interchanges, all completed before 1976, increased by 1.5 to
3 times compared to the appraisal estimates at current prices. Furthermore,
the costs (at current prices) in Israeli currency of the sub-projects Ganot-
Lod Expressway, Azur interchange, Geha interchange and Ayalon Expressway,
which started late and continued up to late seventies or early eighties,
increased five to eight fold, except Geha where the cost increased to 45
times the appraisal estimate. Abnormally high inflation rates (more than
100% per year for several years) and unexpected implementation delays are an
integral part of the causes of most of the cost increases. But the increases
in the value of the operational cost savings due to high inflation compounded
with the marked producers price increase in petroleum products have more than
compensated the combined effect of cost overruns and traffic underruns in
most cases. However, in the ex-post economic justification, actual project
costs and estimated benefits in current prices of each year have been
adjusted to eliminate the likely effect of inflation.
D. Economic Return
6.11     The economic returns (ERs) and the first-year benefit ratios (FYBRs)
of the project road sections and interchanges, as estimated at appraisal and
as revised on the basis of up-dated traffic, construction and vehicle operat-
ing cost information, are shown in Table 15. The Annex shows that the
revised estimated ERs vary between 14 and 33 percent. The results show that
ex-post calculated rates of return are fully satisfactory and generally in
line with those calculated ex-ante. Similarly, ex-post estimates of the
FYBRs are always 10% or higher confirming clearly the overall economic
justification of all the sub-projects. However, to derive optimum benefits
from the Ayalon Expressway and the Ganot-Lod Expressway sub-project, the
Goverment should complete the balance of the work as expeditiously as pos-
sible, given their budgetary constraints. The Goverment has stated that



-15-
it remains committed to the completion of the whole Ayalon project, albeit
over a longer period than originally envisaged. This is perhaps a special
case when a further review around 1985/86 could be sufficiently rewarding.



-16-
VII. Conclusions
7.01     The project objectives of the inter-urban highway components managed
by MAZ have been achieved and the economic rates of return are fully satis-
factory. Reimbursements for construction were limited on the original Ganot-
Lod-Ramleh road up to Lod only but the section to Ramleh was directly financed
by the Government, as were three other MAZ components constructed by force
account.
7.02     The project objectives of the Ayalon project component have not yet
been fully achieved as the scope of works eligible for reimbursement was cur-
tailed (see Section IV) and construction scheduling hampered by budgetary
constraints. Nevertheless, the truncated project remains economically viable
and its viability will further improve with the completion of the subsequent
stages of Ayalon Expressway. The ultimate achievement of the Ayalon objec-
tive of traffic congestion relief in the centre of Tel Aviv is assured as the
Government has committed itself to complete the Ayalon component during the
next four to five years by progressively constructing the highways northward
along the canal banks from the end of the Jerusalem Extension in the south to
join the Haifa road on the northern side of Tel Aviv. This progressive con-
struction along the Banks of the Ayalon canal will gradually unify the canal,
bridge and city street investments already made under the project and by
direct-financing into a comprehensive and efficient urban traffic distribu-
tion network.
7.03     The appraisal estimate of project implementation was optimistic
although budget constraints and other delaying factors, could not have been
foreseen at the time of appraisal.
7.04     Progressive devaluation of Israeli currency against the US dollar
have largely offset the effects of high domestic inflation and the US dollar
costs of project components compare satisfactorily with appraisal estimates
after taking authorised construction variations into consideration.
7.05     Devaluations of Israeli currency which occurred between the time of
certification of payments to contractors and submission of withdrawal appli-
cations to the Bank retarded the rate of disbursement and effectively reduced
the Bank participation rate for US dollar equivalents of work values. How-
ever, at appraisal the Bank loan of US$30 million was expected to finance
about 80% of the foreign exchange cost of the project, but because of trunca-
tion of the project, the amount disbursed (US$29.9 million) covered about 95%
of the foreign exchange cost (Table 17).
7.06     With hindsight, it seems that, in the face of the deteriorating
financial situation, the energy crisis and unusually high inflation, the Bank
and the Borrower have demonstrated a great flexibility and understanding when
examining high priority components of the project for the comparative attrac-
tiveness of several alternative forms of truncation. One lesson to be drawn
is that in such a situation substantial benefits will accrue to such truncat-
ed project in future on completion of the subsequent stages and a further
review at a later stage could be rewarding (Paras 1.05, 4.01 and 4.11).



-17-
7.07     The project included both inter-city roads (PWD components) and also
intra-city roads with the Ayalon Expressway (under the Netivey Ayalon Ltd)
for the Tel Aviv metropolitan city being the largest single component. Many
of these roads were interlinked and called for effective coordination. In
particular, construction of the four-lane connection between the central
business district of Tel Aviv and Ganot had to proceed in planned synchroni-
zation with that of the contiguous PWD managed project component and provide
a new main connection between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Effective supervision
and excellent collaboration between the implementing agencies and the Bank in
all aspects of the project from preparation through procurement to completion
paid rich dividend (paras. 1.04, 5.01).
7.08     The project also provided an example of how aesthestical aspects can
be suitably integrated in major bridge design (see para. 4.18).
