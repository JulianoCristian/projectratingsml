economic activity to expand while the\n            reform program is implemented. The policy package includes a\n            major exchange rate devaluation, monetary and fiscal\n            policies including the restructuring of the public\n            investment program and of loss-making public enterprises. It\n            also includes price liberalization and an incentive package\n            to facilitate private initiative. The structural adjustment\n            program will improve the growth prospects of the economy\n            through better incentives, an adequate supply of producer\n            and consumer goods, more efficient allocation of foreign\n            exchange and concentration of investment in the productive\n            sectors. Also, it will help to create an environment\n            favorable to private initiative and investment."}, "docdt": "1987-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
