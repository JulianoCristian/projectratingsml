The project builds on the lessons\n            learned from earlier involvement in public administration\n            reform in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Specifically, the\n            project recognizes that sustaining reforms in public\n            administration, and particularly as they relate to public\n            sector employment practices, takes time. The project is\n            comprised of three components designed to strengthen civil\n            service organization and management, including: 1)\n            organizational reforms in line ministries which will provide\n            support to a number of core ministries to improve service\n            delivery through restructuring organization to meet\n            functions; directed by a ministry-determined process; 2)\n            merit based human resource management policies and practices\n            which will support the establishment and implementation\n            across government of modem merit based HR policies and\n            practices; and 3) PAR Oversight and Monitoring which will\n            support the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil\n            Service Commission (IARCSC) in carrying out its stewardship\n            role under the Civil Service Law to lead, regulate,\n            formulate and implement structure policies of the public\n            administration system. Under this project the Government\n            should have in place a fully funded, regularly monitored and\n            well coordinated and communicated Civil Service Reform program."}, "docdt": "2007-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
