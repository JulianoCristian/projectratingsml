{"cdata!": "The project would represent a first step\n            in the long-term development of Sudan's livestock\n            industry and would help to relieve some of the major\n            constraints which have hampered the expansion of national\n            livestock production. Over a six-year period, the project\n            would support the creation of an organized, national\n            livestock marketing system through the improvement of both\n            market and transport infrastructure and the provision of\n            staff and supporting services for the Livestock and Meat\n            Marketing Corporation (LMMC) established in 1976. The\n            project would permit an increased marketed offtake,\n            resulting in increased supplies of meat and livestock\n            products for local consumers and for export. The project\n            would finance livestock transport, especially locomotives\n            and wagons for livestock block trains; establishment of\n            livestock holding, transit and terminal yards along the\n            railway line; improvement or establishment of primary,\n            secondary and terminal markets; construction of LMMC\n            headquarters, vehicles and equipment for LMMC and a\n            contribution to LMMC's operating costs for an initial\n            period; technical assistance, training and studies. The\n            project would be executed by LMMC, the Department of Animal\n            Resources and the Sudan Railways Corporation (SRC)."}, "docdt": "1978-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
