NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
General Conditions; Definitions
Section 1.01. The parties to this Agreement accept all
the provisions of the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and


﻿-2-
Guarantee Agreements of the Bank, dated March 15, 1974, with
the same force and effect as if they were fully set forth here-
in, subject, however, to the modifications thereof set forth in
Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement (said General Conditions
Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements, as so modified,
being hereinafter called the General Conditions).
Section 1.02. Wherever used in this Agreement, unless the
context otherwise requires, the several terms defined in the
General Conditions and in the Preamble to, and Section 1.02 of,
the Loan Agreement have the respective meanings therein set
forth.
ARTICLE II
Guarantee
Section 2.01. Without limitation or restriction upon any
of its other obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, the
Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor
and not as surety merely, the due and punctual payment of the
principal of, and interest and other charges on, the Loan, and
the premium, if any, on the prepayment of the Loan, all as set
forth in the Loan Agreement.
ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek,
in normal circumstances, specific security from the member con-
cerned but to ensure that no other external debt shall have
priority over its loans in the allocation, realization or dis-
tribution of foreign exchange held under the control or for the
benefit of such member. To that end, if any lien shall be
created on any public assets (as hereinafter defined), as
security for any external debt, which will or might result in a
priority for the benefit of the creditor of such external debt
in the allocation, realization or distribution of foreign
exchange, such lien shall, unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, ipso facto, and at no cost to the Bank, equally and
ratably secure the principal of, and interest and other charges
on, the Loan, and the Guarantor, in creating or permitting the
creation of such lien, shall make express provision to that


﻿effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional or
other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect to
any lien created on assets of any of its political or adminis-
trative subdivisions, the Guarantor shall promptly and at no
cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other
charges on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public
assets satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i)
any lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof,
solely as security for payment of the purchase price of such
property; and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of
banking transactions and securing a debt maturing not more
than one year after its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means
assets of the Guarantor, of any political or administrative
subdivision thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by,
or operating for the account or benefit of, the Guarantor or any
such subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange
assets held by any institution performiing the functions of a
central bank or exchange stabilization fund, or similar functions,
for the Guarantor.
Section 3.02. The Guarantor covenants that it will not
take, or cause or permit to be taken, any action which would
prevent or interfere with the performance by any of the Borrowers
or the CRO of their obligations contained in the Loan Agreement
and that, within the limits of its constitutional power, it will
take or cause to be taken all reasonable action necessary or
appropriate to enable the Borrowers and the CRO to perform such
obligations.
Section 3.03. The Guarantor shall exercise its powers with
respect to all public roads so as to ensure: (i) that such roads
will be adequately maintained and repaired in accordance with
sound engineering and financial practices; (ii) that the system-
atic collection and recording of the data necessary for the proper
planning and maintenance, improvements and extension of such roads
will be continued; and (iii) that the dimensions and axle-loads of
vehicles using such roads shall not exceed the limits as are
appropriate to their design standards.
