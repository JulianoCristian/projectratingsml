Trans-Yugoslav Highway\n            (TYH)--Yugoslavia's main highway artery--and will\n            comprise: the construction of six sections totalling 163.8\n            km, procurement of road maintenance and load monitoring\n            equipment, technical assistance (related to the operation\n            and maintenance of specialized equipment) and a highway\n            safety program. The benefits of the project, including\n            relief of mounting congestion and reduction of losses to the\n            economy from the current high accident toll on life and\n            property, will permeate the entire Yugoslav economy;\n            institutional planning and coordination will be strengthened\n            and Yugoslavia's access to international capital\n            markets improved. No special risks are expected in the\n            execution of the project."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
