Program and address key\n            restraints on Guinea's medium-term growth potential.\n            The major elements of the program are: (1) improvements in\n            public finance management, (2) further restructuring of the\n            public enterprise sector, (3) measures to enhance the\n            participation of the poor in future growth and alleviation\n            of the transitory costs of adjustment, and (4) creation of a\n            better managed and more effective civil service. The\n            Governmment will further reinforce the incentive system to\n            favor the private sector through appropriately flexible and\n            realistic, exchange and interest rate policies within a\n            market oriented price and trade regime. Lastly, the external\n            debt management will be strengthened."}, "docdt": "1988-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
