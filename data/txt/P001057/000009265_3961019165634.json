Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project for Guinea was marginally\n            unsatisfactory. The project achieved a few of its\n            objectives, institutional development was negligible,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was marginally satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, SACs can be\n            powerful instruments for supporting policy reforms. Second,\n            the reforms supported must be properly sequenced and must be\n            achievable within the time frame of the program. Third, the\n            development of the reform program should be based on solid\n            economic and sector work to, among other things, help define\n            tranche release conditions in terms of outcomes rather than\n            in terms of promulgation of legal measures. Finally, by\n            offering alternative sources of quick disbursements,\n            concurrent adjustment operations can seriously affect the\n            implementation of a reform program."}, "docdt": "1995-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
