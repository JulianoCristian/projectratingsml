Some lessons learned included:\n            future operations should consider a Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) system critical for planning and also\n            as an early-warning system for management. As previously\n            mentioned, this Project's ecological monitoring system\n            was delayed and unable to fully inform management decisions.\n            The artificial regeneration studies also show some trends\n            that can be of use in the consideration for the planting of\n            the species. Lessons learnt from these studies have been\n            applied on the Lichenya Plateau where seedlings planted\n            under canopy have shown a 95 percent rate of survival. Local\n            community involvement was a critical element in ensuring\n            progress toward achieving the Project's Global\n            Environmental Objectives (GEOs). Provision of viable\n            livelihood alternatives, coupled with pro-active engagement\n            of local communities in Reserve management work and mountain\n            conservation activities were essential ingredients affording\n            Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust (MMCT) and Forest\n            Department (FD) the success witnessed in several of the\n            Project's investments."}, "docdt": "2009-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
