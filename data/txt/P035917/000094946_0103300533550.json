The components\n            include: 1) establishment of the Trust Administration Unit\n            (TAU), within the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust\n            (MMCT), to develop the program content for biodiversity\n            conservation, research/monitoring, environmental education,\n            and, forest co-management, in collaboration with the FD, and\n            nongovernmental organizations. The capacity building element\n            will relate to the coordinating functions of MMCT, including\n            training, inter alia, in Trust accounts, reporting\n            requirements, and procurement; 2) activities to support a\n            biodiversity baseline survey, and monitoring; capacity\n            building for biodiversity protection, management, and\n            monitoring; direct operational conservation activities, and\n            equipment; and, research on biodiversity conservation; 3)\n            assessment of local primary/secondary schools'\n            involvement in promoting environmental awareness, and,\n            participatory planning, and design of program activities for\n            the development of environmental education; 4) forest\n            co-management, and sustainable livelihoods, emphasizing\n            linkages between economic benefits, indigenous biodiversity,\n            and natural ecosystems; and, 5) establishment of the\n            Conservation Trust Fund, through the MMCT, to sustain\n            biodiversity conservation within an ecological sustainable context."}, "docdt": "2001-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
