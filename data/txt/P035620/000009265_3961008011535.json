2)\n            strengthening banking regulation and supervision; 3)\n            improving the payments mechanism especially in rural areas;\n            4) promoting and supporting comprehensive parastatal\n            reforms, including privatization, of state owned\n            enterprises; 5) developing a market for Government\n            securities; 6) establishing a regulatory structure for\n            securities and insurance markets; and 7) developing a\n            corporate securities market. In this context, the primary\n            objectives of the Financial Institutions Development Project\n            are to develop a market oriented financial system and to\n            ensure the orderly and gradual evolution of capital markets.\n            The project will include the following components: 1)\n            restructuring and privatization of National Bank of Commerce\n            and People's Bank of Zanzibar within an agreed\n            timetable; 2) strengthening of Bank of Tanzania's\n            Supervision Directorate; 3) developing a mechanism for\n            regulating the insurance industry; 4) studies on possible\n            improvements to the payments system and the feasibility of a\n            private credit information bureau; and 5) technical\n            assistance to develop an appropriate mechanism for\n            regulating and overseeing the evolution of a capital market."}, "docdt": "1995-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
