Several\n            lessons are drawn from the project: 1) Political agendas may\n            hinder the operation of state-owned commercial banks, since\n            publicly appointed Boards of Directors may advocate\n            increased services, without regards to the growth of\n            profits, maximized by the Government's implicit\n            guarantee of deposits in state-owned banks. 2) Nonetheless,\n            the Government's commitment to, and ownership of the\n            reform program becomes paramount to successful reforms,\n            championed by both local, or external technical expertise,\n            through appropriately planned public relations programs to\n            attract the population's support. 3) The strategy to be\n            followed in the privatization of state-owned banks, requires\n            long-term, and resources to build consensus among key\n            decision-makers and the public at large, and, likewise,\n            capacity building in the Central Bank, is a long-term\n            exercise in the achievement of the financial system\n            supervision. 4) Both the Government, and the Central Bank\n            should be in full agreement on the final output from\n            management contracts for distressed state-owned banks, and\n            this includes the willingness to enforce compliance with\n            business plans targets, and effective oversight of the\n            performance of the management contractor. Technical\n            expertise is suggested for banks performance evaluation."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
