Memorandum and Recommendation of the President
of the International Development Association
to the Executive Directors
on a Proposed Credit to the United Republic of Tanzania
for a Financial Institutions Development Project
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for SDR 7.5 million
(US$10.9 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help
finance a project for financial institutions development.
2.    Country and Sector Background. In 1991, the Government of Tanzania initiated
its financial sector reform program with support from an IDA credit for financial sector
adjustment (FSAC). The program's major aim was to deregulate and liberalize the
banking system. Consequently, in addition to three Government owned banks, six private
commercial banks have been licensed. The remainder of the sector consists of three
developmental financial institutions -- of which two are state owned and the other owned
by foreign developmental financial institutions -- and five other nonbank financial
institutions of which only one is private. As part of the reform program, the three
Government owned financial institutions were recapitalized and portions of their non-
performing assets were transferred to the specially created Loans and Advances
Realization Trust (LART).
3.    Despite the recapitalizations, the state owned banks remain insolvent partly due to
delays with the Government's program to reform parastatals, cooperatives and marketing
boards which are all major clients of the state-owned banks. Although the financial sector
has been opened to private participants, the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) still
dominates, in that it accounts for roughly 82% of the deposit base. The new banks have
been very cautious and have been limiting their activities in terms of deposit mobilization
and lending. Hence, the overall financial sector is still very weak and the reform agenda is
large. The payments system remains very rudimentary and inefficient, there are no
financial instruments and markets to satisfy the demand for term financing, and there is no
capital market. On the regulatory side, although there have been improvements in Bank
Supervision, this function remains weak and incapable of overseeing the complex bank
restructuring programs as well as the expansion of the sector.
4.    Banks Restructuring.  NBC.  Overall macroeconomic performance suffered a
severe setback in FY93 and the first half of FY94. This was due, in part, to leakages
through the financial system as an illiquid NBC extended credit to agricultural
cooperatives and increased its overdraft with the Bank of Tanzania (BOT). A short term
action plan to curtail losses and to begin preparations for a more radical restructuring of
NBC was adopted in February, 1994. A ceiling on outstanding loans was imposed at the
level of January 31, 1994. NBC also was directed to cease lending to non-performing



2
borrowers. Available data indicate that NBC is complying with the ceiling, which will
continue until a new and professional management team in key areas in NBC has prepared
and begun implementation of a new business plan.  The Board of Directors was
reconstituted at the end of March, 1994, and 800 staff were retrenched in April. The NBC
Act was amended in August, 1994 to provide for private shareholding. Three detailed
portfolio reviews were completed during 1994 and the early part of 1995 of which two
comprised part of a diagnostic evaluation of the bank. The evaluation will firm up the
details of the Government's privatization strategy for NBC.
5.    The portfolio review confirmed that roughly 77%  of NBC's portfolio is non-
performing, i.e. classified sub-standard or worse. NBC's management and staff are
making substantial efforts to deal with the significant non-performing portfolio.
Measurement of loan collection results has been introduced across the bank, from the
board to the smallest branch. Staff are fully aware of the new priority and their success in
collection is being strictly monitored and will impact the personnel appraisal system. A
new loan recovery unit has been established to deal with the largest and toughest credits.
A detailed loan recovery plan for the largest 50 credits is under implementation and this
coupled with evidence of tangible collection results is a precondition for appraisal of the
proposed Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC). However, despite these diligent efforts to
restructure and strengthen its operations, the bank again is insolvent and is imposing an
increasing burden on Tanzania's real sectors. It is urgent and essential that NBC is far
more fundamentally restructured than what has been envisaged to date. As an initial step,
the Board of NBC has agreed to make sizable adjustments to the bank's financial
statements to improve the credibility of the bank's accounts.
6.    Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (CRDBJ. From July, 1992 through
June, 1993 the net worth of CRDB, the other major previously state-owned commercial
bank, deteriorated substantially. Since July, 1993 the management has moved aggressively
to implement a restructuring plan. A new organizational structure for headquarters, zonal
and branch offices was prepared and, as a result, a total of 600 staff members were
retrenched; loan recovery and deposit mobilization efforts were strengthened; and a
privatization program was completed in January, 1995 with the sale of 41% of shares to
the public, 29% to a Trust capitalized by DANIDA, and 30% to cooperatives and
corporations. However, the capital adequacy of the bank remains in question until an
external audit is completed, the level of recovery, provisioning and write-off of impaired
assets is finalized, and the statements are approved by BOT. A freeze on lending imposed
by BOT will be removed and CRDB will be fully licensed only when these issues have
been resolved and all prudential requirements have been met.
7.    People's Bank of Zanzibar (PBZ). PBZ is the principal commercial banking
institution in Zanzibar but accounts for less than 1% of all deposits in Tanzania. It has
traditionally included in its activities quasi-central banking operations for the Government
of Zanzibar. The last examination of PBZ in 1994 revealed that the bank was insolvent
and that roughly 70% of its portfolio was rated substandard, doubtful or loss. The main
reasons for its poor financial status are non-commercial credit practices, a failure to



3
recognize non-performing assets (including continued interest accrual on such assets), and
failure to establish sufficient provisions for uncollectible loans.  The Government's
strategy for PBZ is to restructure the bank so that it operates on strictly commercial
principles under the management of professional bankers. A detailed restructuring plan
for the People's Bank of Zanzibar, the remaining state-owned bank, will be finalized
following the recruitment of a private management team.
8.    Bank Supervision.   The Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1991
strengthened BOT's bank supervision authority and, in November 1992, banking
supervision was elevated to the status of a Directorate and staffing levels were increased.
Since then, the Directorate has begun to develop most of the basic skills necessary to
conduct banking examinations and has conducted a series of on-site examinations. The
role of the Directorate is all the more critical and complex given the severe problems
within Tanzania's financial institutions. Gross errors in basic loan approval systems and
accounting techniques continue. Over the next few months the Directorate will have to
devote more attention to the problem banks, even as new banks enter the market. This
will severely strain the Directorate's capacity, test the skills of its staff, and curtail its
ability to conduct new on-site examinations.
9.    Project Objectives. The Government has implemented a short term program to
stem the losses in the financial sector and now wishes to regain the momentum for
financial sector reform by implementing a strategy which would address the fundamental
weaknesses in the sector while building the foundation for the diversification of financial
instruments. The main elements of the strategy are: i) encouraging competition in the
commercial banking sector; ii) strengthening banking regulation and supervision; iii)
improving the payments mechanism; iv) promoting and supporting comprehensive
parastatal reforms, including privatization, of state owned enterprises; v) developing a
market for Government securities; vi) establishing a regulatory structure for insurance and
securities markets; and vii) developing a corporate securities market. In this context, the
primary objectives of the project, which are articulated in the Government's Letter of
Financial Policy, are to develop a market oriented financial system and to ensure the
orderly and gradual evolution of capital markets in Tanzania while supporting the
privatization process.
10.   Project Description.  The project would provide technical support for three
components: the downsizing and restructuring of the Government owned banks including
the National Bank of Commerce and the People's Bank of Zanzibar (DANIDA is
providing technical assistance for CRDB's restructuring); the strengthening of Bank
Supervision and, more generally, the supporting financial infrastructure; and
implementation of a strategy to promote the gradual evolution of a capital market.
11.   Banks Restructuring. ($5.6 million)  NBC. In normal circumstances, the
appropriate prudential response to NBC's current financial position would be to stop it
from lending or taking new deposits, pending rapid action to recapitalize the bank or
liquidate it. In light of recent experience, new injections of capital into NBC by the



4
Government would be inappropriate. Given the dominance of NBC in the financial sector,
and the consequent macro-economic effects of its demise (NBC, with its extensive rural
presence, is in effect the country's payments system), liquidation is not practical at this
time. The strategy therefore is to aggressively downsize NBC while greatly constraining
its activities until such time as it can meet prudential requirements and be fully privatized.
12.   Details of the strategy would be defined by an ongoing diagnostic evaluation of
NBC. However, its broad elements entail: (a) the divestiture of at least one profitable
urban branch network (consisting of 8 to 10 NBC branches) while retaining within a
partially privatized NBC a national presence in urban areas and a rural branch network; (b)
the potential establishment of a joint venture subsidiary of NBC (in partnership with a
strong private bank with an international network) to focus on corporate and international
transactions; and (c) the restructuring of the retained NBC with new line managers in key
areas.
13.   The Government has provided a schedule of activities which constitutes the broad
elements of the strategy. First, the diagnostic evaluation, including an updated portfolio
review, would define the strategy for restructuring NBC including recommendations for
divestiture and the disposition of the impaired assets. The Government also has recruited
three senior, experienced commercial bankers as Deputy Managing Director/Chief
Operating Officer, Director of Finance and Credit Manager in NBC. Second, a review of
the features of the strategy would occur during the early phases of the diagnostic
evaluation so that the remainder of the diagnostic evaluation could concentrate on: (a)
analyses of the implementation implications for NBC; (b) rapidly outlining a strategy that
will maxirnize the value of the branch network(s) sale and maximize the benefit of NBC's
downsizing on the financial sector overall; and (c) getting the joint venture underway.
Third, the pro formas for the entities and/or facilities to be offered for sale would be
finalized and agreed by the Government and NBC. This would likely include the removal
of some portion of the non-performing loans to a recovery unit that would be moved to a
subsidiary for collection. The residual NBC, after charging off the loans, would be a
smaller organization and would add some urgency to the tasks of reducing head office
administrative costs and rationalizing the rural branch network.  Fourth, terms and
conditions for the sale of urban branch network(s) and the joint venture
international/corporate subsidiary would be prepared. Sales memoranda, authority to
disclose terms and contact particular buyers would be agreed. The schedule calls for the
opening of the urban network(s) under new ownership and for the joint venture to begin
operations by October, 1995.
14.   The project would finance the technical assistance required for the implementation
of the strategy including the senior management team in NBC. The team is assisting NBC
with the preparation of a business plan acceptable to IDA. The plan would: (i) provide for
continued credit restraint as NBC is restructured; (ii) address the significant portfolio of
non-performing assets; and (iii) aim to restructure the remaining bank into a self sustaining
and viable going concern. The plan would consist of time-bound performance targets
including targets for the reductions in the ratio of operating costs to average total assets,



5
increases on the return on average total assets, reductions in the percentage of non-
performing loans in the portfolio, establishment of an appropriate loan to deposit ratio,
increases on the ratio of loan collections to scheduled collections and the adequate
diversification of credit risk. These ratios, among others, would be defined to ensure that
aggregate lending could only increase if there is a substantial strengthening of profitability
and the quality of the asset portfolio. The plan also would serve as a yardstick for
prudential supervision until such time as NBC meets prudential requirements.
15.   PBZ.  The credit would finance the remuneration of two experts as General
Manager and Financial Controller of PBZ for three years. Their main responsibilities
would be to oversee the restructuring of the bank. Specifically, this would include the
preparation of a business plan, the formulation of appropriate policies and operating
procedures, installation of effective internal control, the design of a marketing strategy,
and the introduction of new financial services.
16.   Ministry of Finance.   The credit would also finance periodic services of
consultants to provide advice to the Ministries of Finance on the mainland and in Zanzibar,
as well as to the Boards of the Government-owned banks, on the progress of the
respective restructuring plans.
17.   Financial Infrastructure Strengthening ($4.9 million). Bank Supervision. The IMF
is providing a Bank Supervision Advisor to BOT. The project would complement the
IMF's technical assistance by providing focused technical assistance to the Bank
Supervision Directorate for the supervision of problem institutions, on site examinations,
methodology development, and training. Technical assistance for the supervision of
problem institutions would include consultancies to: (1) monitor the restructuring of the
three state-owned banks; (2) advise on the progress of the respective restructuring plans;
(3) assist with problem institution supervision of NBFIs and foreign exchange bureaus;
and (4) direct the design and delivery of the Problem Institution Management (PIM)
training course for all the examination staff of Banking Supervision. Assistance for On-
Site Examination would include support for up to two years to bring the skills of the Bank
Supervision Directorate up to an adequate level in all high risk areas. The main focus will
be on the development of the on-site methodology pertaining to the internal control
environment. Emphasis will be placed on the role of the Board, as well as on the treasury
and systems areas, including wire payments and the detection of money laundering.
Technical assistance for Methodology Development would include the design and
documentation of methodology in three crucial areas:  off-site examination, on-site
examination and ladders of compliance. Finally, the component would finance a series of
in-house training courses which, in part, would aim to introduce the examination modules
resulting from the development of the new methodology. These courses would be
strongly promoted to the financial system at large to encourage widespread participation
of financial institution personnel.
18.   Insurance Adviser.   A new Insurance Act was recently drafted and is scheduled
for presentation to Parliament during the first quarter of 1995. The Act provides the



6
framework for the entry of private participants into the Tanzanian insurance market, based
on objective, minimal but prudent requirements. In addition, for the first time, the
legislation provides for prudent regulation of the industry to promote on-going confidence
in the system. The Government intends to establish a supervisory authority (an Insurance
Commission). The Commission would develop a supervisory methodology and policy
framework, including the drafting of regulatory guidelines and the supporting accounting
principles and standards to be adopted by the industry to meet the legislative requirements.
This component would finance a technical advisor for a period of up to two years. The
advisor would be required to draft prudential regulations for licensing, regulating and
supervising insurance companies. The regulations would establish prudential controls and
limits, such as exposure limits, capital adequacy guidelines, and controls on related parties
and enforce corrective measures with specific guidance on dealing with troubled
institutions.
19.   Studies Fund The project would finance studies for the development of a national
payments system and a Credit Infornation Bureau. Studies on the national payments
system would be undertaken in two phases. The first phase would collect and analyze data
about the payment traffic in Tanzania, assess the related institutional, legal and financial
infrastructure, estimate the costs of transactions, and generate realistic projections of the
transacting environment 5 years hence. The second phase would be the design of
improvements to the national payments system including an assessment of the feasibility of
the electronic exchange of data. This component also would finance a feasibility study to
determine: (i) if there is a potential market for a credit information bureau in Tanzania; and
(ii) if so, whether it could become self-sustaining within a three year time frame.
Specifically, the study would be undertaken in two phases. The first phase would assess
the readiness of private and state-owned companies and financial institutions to participate
in such an agency on a structured fee basis, assess whether there is enough capacity in the
market to support such an agency, and review the potential ownership/membership
structures. The second phase would be contingent upon the outcome of the feasibility
study and would entail the preparation of a detailed five year business plan including a
recommendation for the ownership structure.
20.   Capital Market Development ($2.1 million). The project would provide technical
assistance to promote the development of a capital market keeping in mind the
Government's preference for a simple and evolutionary approach. Specifically, assistance
would be provided for: (a) the drafting and completion of a core set of enabling
regulations; (b) an advisor to provide assistance over the course of two years to the
Authority on a wide variety of regulatory and market development matters; (c) basic
training of would-be stock brokers; (d) basic publicity and educational program for the
general public, including nationwide distribution of information; (e) technical assistance
to include completion of a first public issue including design of distribution procedures,
determination of offer prices, determination of allotment procedures, provision of short
1-2 hour training sessions for personnel nationwide on how to handle the public issue,
and supervision of the allotment processing; (f) the preparation of a stock exchange
blueprint and item-by-item action plan together with donor funding requests for start-up



7
costs. This component would also provide funding for the establishment and management
of the first three years of a Privatization Trust Fund (PTF). The Government intends to
establish the PTF mainly to broaden local participation in privatization while maximizing
the financial benefits of the sale of privatized assets. The Government would offer its
retained shares of privatized parastatals to the Trust in exchange for a deferred payment
upon successful disposition.
21.   Project Costs and Financing. The project cost is estimated at US$13.4 million
(Tsh7.4 billion) which includes project management costs and contingencies. The foreign
exchange component of the program is estimated at 66% of the total cost. The proposed
IDA credit of US$10.9 million would finance 90% of project costs net of duties and taxes.
The Government's local contribution would be for an estimated US$1.2 million. In
addition, the Government would finance the payment of taxes and duties amounting to
roughly US$1.4 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, disbursements and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. The key processing events are shown in Schedule C
and the status of Bank Group operations is shown in Schedule D. The Staff Appraisal
Report (13713-TA) is being distributed separately.
22.   Project Implementation. The project would be implemented by the Bank of
Tanzania. The Director of the Financial Markets Directorate in the Bank of Tanzania
would be responsible for: (i) administering project funding and procurement processing
(including the employment of consultants) and managing the Project Accounts and the
Special Account; (ii) overseeing project implementation activities by various institutions
and coordinating activities; (iii) following up on the agreed conditionalities and financial
provisions and proposing any necessary adjustments and amendments to implementation:
(iv) providing periodic project progress reports; and (v) acting as the focal point of
contacts between the Government of Tanzania and IDA during the project implementation
period.
23.   Although BOT would assume day to day responsibility for implementation, the
Ministries of Finance for the United Republic and Zanzibar, as the sole shareholders of the
Government owned banks, will bear ultimate responsibility for the restructuring of both
institutions. Given the complexity of the issues involved, experienced commercial bankers
will be recruited to advise the Ministries on the overall progress of the program. Issues
raised by the Advisors would then be discussed during meetings of the Boards of
Directors. The Advisors would be expected to liaise with the Parastatal Sector Reform
Commission. They would not be expected to reside in Tanzania but would be contracted
to visit three times per year.  This arrangement will be reviewed as the project is
supervised and will be amended if necessary. A mid-term review is proposed for March
1997.
24.   Project Sustainability. The project would address a major market imperfection
by supporting a strategy for aggressively reducing the market share of the Government
owned banks and enhancing competition in the banking sector. The strategy, which is



8
embodied in the Government's Letter of Financial Policy, recognizes that increased
competition, in an appropriately regulated environment, would increase efficiency,
profitability and sustainability both in the financial and capital markets.  Also, the
development of a credit information bureau should substantially lower the risk profile of
Tanzania's businesses and, accordingly, reduce lending costs. Finally, the development of
the capital markets and the insurance sector would provide additional savings to finance
Tanzania's investment needs.
25.   Lessons from Previous IDA Experience. Although the program supported by
FSAC (1992) legally deregulated and liberalized the banking system, it failed to
accomplish the intended restructuring of NBC for the following reasons:  first, the
program assumed that the emergence of competitive private banks would gradually erode
NBC's market share. Although there has been some erosion, future expansion by the
private banks is constrained by their limited Dar es Salaam branch networks and their
strategic targeting of relatively narrow niches. As a result, NBC remains dominant. The
proposed project supports a more aggressive strategy to reduce NBC's market share.
Second, FSAC financed advisers to NBC's management. However, there was no incentive
for NBC's management practices to change and the experts were not held accountable for
performance. The proposed project includes professional bankers in line management
positions who would be evaluated, in part, on the basis of NBC's financial performance.
Third, FSAC did not include timebound performance targets against which NBC's
performance could be judged. The proposed project includes dated monitorable targets.
IDA's overall experience with financial sector operations has influenced the proposed
project in that the design is very selective with a strong emphasis on the restructuring of
the Government owned banks and improving the regulatory environment for the financial
sector. The project also is front-loaded in that most of the critical actions are required
either upfront or very early in the project's implementation.
26.   Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank's country assistance strategy,
which was discussed by the Executive Directors on April 7, 1994, is to assist the
Government to reduce poverty through an acceleration in the pace of structural reform
and the provision of infrastructure and social services (especially targeted to the poor),
while ensuring an environmentally sustainable development path. Specific criteria for
determining Tanzania's eligibility for substantial IDA support and continued adjustment
lending included improvements in the operation of public sector banks through strong
measures to stem losses and increase the quality of their portfolios, and the introduction of
private management with eventual divestiture as an objective. The proposed Financial
Institutions Development project seeks to support this strategy and, more broadly,
improve the access of the private sector to the banking system in general and to capital
markets. The project would provide technical assistance to implement the policy reforms
in the financial sector supported by the proposed SAC which is under preparation. IDA
also is assisting the Government with the formulation of a strategy for the development of
rural banking.
27.   Agreed Actions. The following are the conditions for Credit Effectiveness: (a)
completion of the diagnostic evaluation of NBC and a timebound action plan (including an



9
interim business plan and a recovery plan for NBC's top fifty non-performing loans),
satisfactory to IDA, for the downsizing and restructuring of NBC; (b) appointment of a
consulting firn/investment bank acceptable to IDA to implement the divestiture strategy
on the basis of terms of reference acceptable to IDA; and (c) appointment of Banking
Advisors under terms of reference acceptable to IDA.
28.   The following assurances were received during negotiations: (1) Government
would implement the program described in the Letter of Financial Policy; (2) NBC: (a)
implementation of agreed actions under NBC's divestiture strategy as a result of the
diagnostic review, including the divestiture of an urban branch network(s) and the
identification of a joint venture partner for the corporate subsidiary by October 31, 1995;
(b) the submission of annual audited accounts within six months of the end of NBC's
financial year and that appropriate adjustments will be made and all loans classified as loss
will be written-off prior to the finalization of the accounts; (c) the submission to IDA of
the finalized business plan by October 31, 1995; thereafter, NBC would take actions to
meet the plan's performance targets. NBC's overall lending as well as lending to
parastatals and cooperatives would be within agreed ceilings until the plan is implemented;
(d) NBC will submit monthly reports to BOT on outstanding loans to large borrowers.
(3) PBZ (a) a General Manager and Financial Controller, acceptable to IDA, would be
appointed by October 31, 1995; (b) the submission of annual audited accounts within six
months of the end of PBZ's financial year and that appropriate adjustments will be made
and all loans classified as loss will be written-off prior to the finalization of the accounts;
(c) a restructuring plan, acceptable to the Borrower and IDA, would be adopted for PBZ.
(4) Bank Supervision (a) the annual work program for 1995/1996 for the Bank
Supervision Directorate, including terms of reference and work program for the
consultants required for this component, would be submitted for IDA's approval by
October 31, 1995; (b) the annual work programs for the following years (beginning with
1996) will be submitted for IDA's approval by September 30 of the preceding year; (c) the
submission by October 31, 1995, for IDA's review and comments, of a report on the
status of all financial institutions with action plans for the problem institutions; and an
annual report on the status of all financial institutions by September 30 in each year
commencing 1996 with action plans for problem institutions. The action plans would
include a timetable, acceptable to IDA, for reaching regulatory targets. (5) Insurance the
submission for IDA's approval, by December 31, 1995 of the work plan for the
establishment of the Commission, including details of the resource requirements (e.g, size,
scope, staffing, technology, etc.) (6) CaDital Markets (a) agreement on the 1996 annual
work program and budget for the Authority by October 31, 1995. The annual work
programs beginning with 1996 will be submitted for IDA's approval three months prior to
the end of the preceding year; and (b) maintenance of a CEO under TOR acceptable to
IDA during the term of the project. (7) PTI Draft management contract and the
selection of a management team acceptable to IDA by December 31, 1995.
29.   Environmental Impact. The project's environmental category is C. There would
be no adverse environmental impact.



lo
30.   Program  Objective Categories.  The primary emphasis is private sector
development through improvements in financial intermediation and the divestiture of
CRDB and parts of NBC to private investors. The secondary emphasis is on economic
management.
31.   Participatory Approach. The project was prepared by BOT's Financial Markets
and Banking Supervision Directorates with IDA's support. The project stemmed from a
request by the Government for IDA's assistance with the development of Tanzania's
insurance and capital markets. However, during project preparation the Government
changed the emphasis to the restructuring of the banking system as NBC's poor financial
status became more apparent and critical.
32.   Project Benefits. Increased competition in the financial sector would improve the
quality of banking services and lower the costs of financial intermediation.  The
elimination of losses by NBC and PBZ would contribute to fiscal and monetary
stabilization and improve overall macroeconomic performance. Also, strengthened bank
supervision will help build public confidence and mobilize savings. The capital market
component would help to address the Government's concern about the need for broad
based participation in the privatization effort.
33.   Project Risks. The project is designed to mitigate the major risk to NBC's
successful restructuring: a possible reversal of Government's stated commitment to the
bank's commercialization and privatization. Consequently, the actions required for the
significant downsizing of NBC are all either upfront or very early in the project's
implementation. Conversely, the aggressive downsizing of NBC could result in the rapid
entry of new banks to fill the void and could stretch the limited capacity of Bank
Supervision. The extensive amount of technical assistance provided under the credit to
Bank Supervision is meant to reduce this risk. Another risk stems from the rapid opening
up of Tanzania's capital market in the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework.
The project would support the gradual evolution of the capital market while putting in
place an appropriate regulatory framework
34.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
