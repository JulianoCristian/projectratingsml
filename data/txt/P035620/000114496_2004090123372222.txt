Dear Sir:
           Credit No. 2771-TA (Financial Institutions Development Project)
           Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the above-mentioned
Project, dated October 27, 1995, between United Republic of Tanzania (the
Borrower) and International Development Association (the Association), as
amended to date. We also refer to discussions with supervision missions of
the Association on the need to provide retroactive financing as a result
of the delay in presenting the Project to the Board.
     We are pleased to inform you that the Association agrees to provide
retroactive financing and proposes that paragraph 3 (a) of Schedule 1 to
the Development Credit Agreement is amended to read as follows:
     "(a) payments made for expenditures prior to the date of this
Agreement except that withdrawals in an aggregate amount not exceeding
SDR 600,000, may be made in respect of Categories (1), (2) and (3) on
account of payments made for expenditures before that date but after May
31, 1995;"
     All provisions of the Development Credit Agreement, except as amended
herein, shall remain in full force and effect.
     Kindly countersign, date and return to us the enclosed copy of this
letter. These amendments shall be effective as of the date of counter-
signature by your authorized representative.
Sincerely,
James W. Adams
