Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: (a) systematic\n            land adjudication remains the most effective approach to\n            accelerated land titling under Thai conditions; (b) targets\n            for land titling under the systematic land adjudication\n            approach must consider constraints such as unclear\n            boundaries with forestry, areas undergoing land reform, and\n            lack of clear ownership evidence. A titling rate of 80\n            percent of parcels identified by the adjudication teams\n            appears to be a realistic target; and (c) sustainable\n            institutional changes require a long-term framework and\n            sustained efforts, often beyond the time horizon of one project."}, "docdt": "1997-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
