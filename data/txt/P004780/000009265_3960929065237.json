The principal project objective is to grant\n            secure, documented tenure to rural landholders, thereby\n            facilitating their access to institutional credit, improving\n            investments in the land, and increasing agricultural\n            productivity and family incomes.  This objective addresses\n            the key issues of rural poverty and underemployment. Project\n            components consist of the following : a) accelerated\n            cadastral mapping of 155,00 sq km of rural land; b) the\n            issuance of full titles for undocumented lands and lands\n            held under various types of pre-ownership certificates; c)\n            improved land administration through decentralization of the\n            land register; d) strengthening of the Central Valuation\n            Authority; e) strengthening the Department of Lands; and f)\n            provision of project related technical assistance, training\n            and studies."}, "docdt": "1990-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
