     Accelerated National Cadastral Mapping and Land Titling\n            Program. The principal project objective is to grant secure,\n            documented tenure to rural landholders, thereby facilitating\n            their access to institutional credit, improving investments\n            in the land, and increasing agricultural productivity and\n            family incomes. This objective addresses the key issues of\n            rural poverty and underemployment. Project components\n            consist of the following : a) accelerated cadastral mapping\n            of 155,00 sq km of rural land; b) the issuance of full\n            titles for undocumented lands and lands held under various\n            types of pre-ownership certificates; c) improved land\n            administration through decentralization of the land\n            register; d) strengthening of the Central Valuation\n            Authority; e) strengthening the Department of Lands; and f)\n            provision of project related technical assistance, training\n            and studies."}, "docdt": "1990-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
