satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, though only modest\n            institutional development impacts. The main lessons suggest:\n            1) procurement arrangements need to be in line with the\n            nature of the business processes used by projects. The\n            project failed to recognize that the business processes used\n            by community kitchens were completely different from those\n            used for the activities originally financed by the\n            participatory social investment fund - FOPAR - grants.\n            During the discussion of the reorientation of the project,\n            no review was undertaken of the commercial practices of the\n            community kitchens, in part because of the emergency\n            context. In retrospect, this situation should have led to\n            different procurement arrangements; 2) although necessary,\n            it can be difficult to implement an exit strategy for\n            interventions that support emergency programs, even after\n            the crisis subsides. In responding to a crisis situation, it\n            is difficult for ministries and implementing agencies to\n            focus on medium- term strategies for addressing poverty, as\n            opposed to emergency programs; 3) it would be preferable\n            that projects involving a high number of small, simple\n            transactions (food purchases) be disbursed according to\n            results (outputs or outcomes), rather than inputs. This\n            would imply certification that implementing agencies have\n            the managerial ability and processes to deliver the services\n            involved, complemented by audits; and, 4) when technical\n            assistance components are part of a larger project, it can\n            be difficult to ensure sufficient focus and attention by the\n            Bank and the Government. Technical assistance projects,\n            especially if the Bank is to add value by transferring\n            technical skills and methodologies, require close\n            supervision and access to qualified staff."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
