       Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project for Modova were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: High level government support\n            is key to success. Building a tradition of interagency\n            communication and information sharing as well as building\n            the mechanisms on which such communication can be based,\n            needs a high-level government commitment and ideally a\n            champion. Such a person/agency needs to be able to direct\n            concerns to the highest levels of management in the\n            ministries responsible for the agencies engaged in border\n            control. This implies knowledge of the national political\n            system and the power to navigate through that system.\n            Private sector/user involvement is an essential part of\n            trade facilitation. Such involvement enables an adequate\n            analysis of the trade patterns to find the main bottlenecks\n            and identify optimal measures for improvements. Also, it\n            must be ensured that the capacity building and modernization\n            of the private sector is analog to the reforms in customs,\n            so as to ensure that introduced reforms are applied in\n            private operations. The Contribution of the United States\n            (US) as a parallel financier contributed significantly to\n            the success of the project."}, "docdt": "2007-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
