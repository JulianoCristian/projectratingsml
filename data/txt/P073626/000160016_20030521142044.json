There\n            are five main project components besides project management.\n            Component 1 improves operations at pilot sites by assisting\n            in preparing automated procedures to collect management data\n            in order to monitor performance indicators, establishing\n            programs to implement new border processing procedures and\n            practices, and providing technical assistance and training;\n            re-engineers procedures by providing technical assistance to\n            MDC to improve control over goods in transit (reinforcing\n            the border, automating data exchange between customs\n            locations, integrating trade and transit data, and\n            interagency coordination), streamlining declaration and\n            transit procedures, and strengthening valuation and\n            post-release activities. Component 2 installs and implements\n            an ASYCUDA (Automated System for Customs Data) clearance\n            system and supports technical assistance and training,\n            finances training equipment, and computerizes the Moldovan\n            Department of Customs. Component 3 implements a transit and\n            inland control system through mobile intervention squads.\n            Component 4 improves border crossing facilities including\n            procurement of small equipment, supporting minor repairs,\n            and setting up secondary inspection areas. Component 5\n            facilitated trade by strengthening the private-public\n            partnership and improving performance of trade facilitation agents."}, "docdt": "2003-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
