RURAL WATEZ SUPPLY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:         People's Republic of China
Amount:            SDR 82.1 million ($80.0 million equivalent)
Terms:             Standard
Relending Terms:  From the Government to provinces:  25 years including 10
years of grace, and zero interest.
From province to villages: 10 to 15 years including two to
four years of grace, and zero interest.
Project
Description:    The objectives of the project are to build water supply
facilities and to develop and strengthen systems, insti-
tutions and technology for the implementation of China's
rural water supply program. The project would provide safe
drinking water to some six million people in 4,650 villages
of 25 counties located in the provinces of Liaoning,
Shaanxi, Sichuan and Zhejiang and the municipality of
Beijing. The beneficiary villages are selected because
their present water supply is inadequate, contaminated or
too distant. The types of water systems range from hand-
pumps and rainwater storage tanks to pumped and piped
systems (including some with treatment) with standpives or
house connections, dependent upon environmental and economic
conditions. The institutional componenc of the project
includes: (i) the development of management and monitoring
systems and regulations for revolving funds, construction
and operations; (ii) the preparation of design, construction
and operation manuals; and (iii) a training program for
trainers, planners, engineers, technicians and operators at
the national, provincial, county and village levels.
Revolving funds would be established in the beneficiary
provinces which would be used to provide safe water in other
villages, thereby more than doubling the initial number of
beneficiaries during the 25 year period that funds remain
with the provinces. The credit is consequently levered so
that $7 of credit funds provides safe water to one person.
Cofinancing by the Federal Republic of Germany will fund the
foreign cost of training ($1.5 million), and the World Food
Program is to provide food aid (equivalent to $10.5 million)
to the participating counties in the provinces of Liaoning
and Shaanxi.

The principal risk relates to the ability of the project
management organization, a new entity, to direct the project
appropriately. The risk is mitigated by the policies and
procedures developed during the preparation of the project,
the recent strengthening of project office staff, and the
good project implementation experience which exists at the
county level where the bulk of the impLementation work will
be done.

I. THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      The lives of China's 800 million rural inhabitants have improved
markedly in modern times. There have been major gains in health, houfsng,
agricultural productivity and, more recently, in economic conditions._
Health improvements have resulted largely from health education campaigns,
improved nutrition and sanitation, better maternal and child care, immuniz-
ation, and modest improvements in drinking water facilities. But about 40% of
the rural population -- some 300 million people -- still have critical water
supply needs: the supply for 45 million people has excessive fluoride concen-
tration; 63 million drink saline or alkaline water; 150 million use untreated
surface water contaminated by domestic /industrial or agrochemical wastes and
42 million live in water scarce areas.-
1.02      Traditionally rural water supply has been obtained from individual
or household systems such as bucket wells, hand pump wells, and rainwater
collection tanks, or is fetched from rivers, springs or ponds. Most people
are still served in this manner. Drinking water is generally boiled and this
helps control bacterial infections though it does not prevent illness caused
by chemical substances, found naturally or introduced by agricultural or
industrial discharges. With rising incomes, rural people are demanding and
can increasingly afford improvements in housing, education and public
services. Many have come to expect and are willing to pay for piped systems
purveying safe and convenient water, sometimes by public standpipes but more
commonly to the house or courtyard. Wascewater management in ruraL areas is
generally not a problem. Flush vilets are not used. Excreta is collected,
frequently treated by digestion - and used as fertilizer. Sullage water is
used to water animals or for irrigation, or aLlowed to drain away in rainwater
channels or seepage pits.
1/   Rural incomes have increased by an average of 12% per year from 1978 to
1982, and an additional 14X in 1983.
2/   Excessive fluoride causes mottled teeth and skeletal deformities,
excessive salinity makes the water unpalatable and may cause hyper-
tension. Water scarce areas are where people have to walk more than one
kilometer, or climb more than 100 meters, to fetch water.
3/   Treatment is often in a biogas generator, which provides heat energy for
household use as a byproduct.



-2-
Sector Organization
1.03      The water supply sector is organized separately for urban and rural
areas.  For both urban and rural, local initiatives and finance are 4he prime
movers for development.  In urban areas, the municipal governments -  are
largely responsible for financing, designing, and building water and waste
systems; this is usually done by the municipal finance, design, and construc-
tion bureaus. All urban water supply projects have to be reported to the
Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction and Environnental Protection but
approval is not needed unless the project has a capacity in excess of
100,000 tons per day or central government financial assistance is sought. If
a project extends beyond the city, such as the water supply for Tianjin City
which involves the diversion of a river, it is classified as a national
project and this may make it eligible for central government participation.
Where a project is estimated to cost more than Y 10 million, approval by the
State Planning Commission is required and for very large projects costing over
Y 100 million and where foreign loans are involved further approval by the
State Council is necessary.
1.04      For rural areas, China's policy of self reliance has resulted in the
villages being largely responsible for sector development and for providing
their own water supply. The initiative for planning, financing and operating
water systems originates at the village level with a substantial part of the
funds - usually 90% - coming from individuals and collectives. Plans for
waterworks are submitted for approval to the county, which helps in the design
and purchase of material, and decides on the need for subsidies. The
provincial government in turn compiles pLans submitted by the counties and may
provide some financing. The central government has only recently become more
active in providing guidance and coordination, and provides financing only in
exceptional cases.
1.05      Most waterworks in rural areas are owned, managed and operated by
the villages. But in some areas collectively owned water companies have been
established under the guidance of townships or counties, especially where
several villages can be served more efficiently by a common system. Water
companies are more likely to be found in industrialized provinces where there
is suitable managerial and technical expertise.
1.06      Prior to China's endorsement of the UN Drinking Water and Sanitation
Decade Program in 1980, no single agency was responsible for the rural sector.
Planning and programming were done primarily at the local level. In 1981, the
State Council designated the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee
(CPHCC) as the unit responsible for organizing Decade activities. The
Minister of Public Health, who is concurrently one of the deputy chairmen of
the CPHCC, was designated Chairman of the National Executive Committee for
4/   Municipalities generally have populations in excess of 100,000; there are
289 in China. Towns have populations ranging upwards to 100,000, and
there are 3,200 in China. The 800 million rural Chinese live in some
718,000 villages.



-3-
Decade activities. The actual work was delegated to the CPHCC's executive
office. CPHCC has thus become responsible for development of the rural water
supply sector, although its responsibilities are not confined to this sector.
It- has taken this assignment seriously and water supply improvement has become
its primdry current concern.
1.07      The CPHCC has as members senior officials from some thirty minis-
tries and agencies active in health, water and environmental matters including
the State Planning Commission and the Ministries of Public Health, Urban and
Rural Construction and Environmental Protection, Finance, Water Conservancy
and Machine Building.  The Committee's objectives are healp  promotion and
disease prevention (e.g., elimination of "the four pests")_' through education
and organized mass participation in health and environmental activities.  The
membership structure of the committee is repeated at the provincial, county,
and village Levels, that is, each has its health campaign committee which, in
turn, has members such as the local health, finance, construction and water
conservancy bureaus. The local committees are responsible for implementing
the Central Committee's policies and priorities and their presence has
resulted in successful implementation of the Central Committee's objectives.
Many of China's rural health gains can be attributed to the work of this
Committee and its ability to command and coordinate the activities of its
members.
Rural Water Supply Program
1.08      A national rural water supply program was initiated in 1981.
Although some physical works have been constructed at local levels as Decade
activities, to date the program has concentrated on information dissemination,
training and project preparation. This has been done by the CPHCC and its
National Project Office (NPO), with the technical assistance of UNDP, WHO, the
German Coverrment and IDA. (IDA technical assistance, described more fully in
para. 3.03, in particular has been targeted at the NPO, which competently used
and disseminated it to other central agencies and the provinces, counties and
villages). The project for which this credit is recommended is the first
rural water supply program which is coordinated, managed and partially
financed at national and provincial levels. National, provincial and county
project offices have been established for the project and these will serve as
models for water supply improvement offices in nonproject provinces and
counties.
Sector Financing
1.09      The virtual absence of central government financing for rural water
supply distinguishes China from most other developing countries. Local
governments and entities are expected to provide financing for capital costs
and rural and urban consumers almost always pay the recurrent costs: in
5/   The four pests were originally flies, mosquitos, rats and sparrows.  When
the elimination of sparrows threatened to produce ecological problems,
bedbugs and sometimes lice and cockroaches were substituted.



villages householders share the costs with funds derived from communal activi-
ties. Water charges normally cover the cost of operations and maintenance,
and occasionally some depreciation. Metering is increasingly common in urban
areas but in rural areas peer pressure is commonly used to control wasteful
consumption.
Sectoral Issues
1.10      Water Supply Targets and Programs.  In 1981 China set a tentative
target to provide safe drinking water for all by 1990, the goal of the Drink-
ing Water and Sanitation Decade, but soon realized that this could not be
achieved because of financial, organizational, and technical constraint<. The
current target is to have 80% of the rural population adequately served by
1990. This would be achieved largeLy by the villages constructing water
systems under their own initiatives, but with increasing guidance and support
from the provinces and counties. In general terms, the CPHCC has divided
Decade activities into three phases: 1981 - 83 for preparation; 1984 - 86 for
popularization; 1987 - 90 for implementation on a national scale. But there
is no concrete national plan, nor a compilation of provincial plans for rural
water suppLy improvements. During the current period of popularization, a
major activity for the CPHCC is to implement the proposed project so that it
can serve as a model for water supply improvements throughout China.
1.11      Because of the size and relative autonomy of the provinces, rural
water supply and sanitation sector planning is best done at the provincial
level. A Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Technical Advisory Center (TAC)
has been established in the existing National Institute of Health, and this
center, with financial support from the NPO, is currently surveying rural
water conditions throughout China which will provide the basis for rational
sector planning. The NPO, with support from TAC and IDA, will assist the
provinces in analyzing institutional and financial arrangements and developing
plans for the sector. Two or three provinces will be selected initially as
prototypes for this work.
1.12      Financing Sources and Arrangements.  To meet rural water supply and
sanitation targets the Government estimates that about Y 15-20 billion would
be required. Although rural incomes have increased significantly in recent
years, without seed capital and appropriate financing mechanisms, sector
advancement will be slow. Government will continue - appropriately, we
believe - to require virtually full cost recovery, but within that context it
is considering options for financing facilities and revolving funds. An
assessment is needed of the participation required of the village, county,
province and central government and of how revolving funds can best be set up
and operated. The experience gained while implementing the proposed project
will help in this assessment and in the development of policies.
1.13      Institutional Framework.  The Government policy of self reliance has
placed the responsibility for rural water development on the township and the
village. These communities, however. often lack the administrative, financial
and technical skills required to plan, construct and maintain the more elabo-
rate piped and pumped water systems, especially where water treatment is
required. Assistance in these areas is sometimes provided by the county or



-5
the province, but capabilities, methods and procedures vary from place to
place and are often ad-hoc. The Government is forming a structure and mecha-
aism under the direction of the CPHCC for providing technical assistance
nationwide, to county and provincial leveLs of government, to support the
villages. Through improved organization, standardized methods and better
staffing, the national and provincial project offices are also being strength-
ened in their ability to plan and organize sector programs and carry out
projects. And the CPHCC is designing with Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)
financing and technical assistance, provincial and county-level training
programs for planners, designers and water system managers and operators. IDA
staff have been assisting this effort and will continue to do so under the
project.
1.14      Technical Considerations.  The technical capabilities of the
provinces and counties vary greatly across China, but generally are more
advanced in the industralized regions. Poor capability in non-industrialized
areas is partly due to China's previous isolation, the setback in education in
the 1960s and poor communications among provinces. As a result designs are
sometimes inappropriate and inefficient. Since subprojects are to be designed
in great numbers at the county level with only selective checking at the
provincial and central level, it is necessary to find some means to ensure
planning and design quality. To this end, as a part of the preparation of the
proposed project, a rural water supply planning manual was prepared and
introduced in 1984 under the direction of the CPHCC and with IDA assistance.
The manual, 19,000 copies of which have been distributed throughouc China,
guides technicians through key planning steps such as comparing alternatives,
selecting water sources, and designing distribution systems. Provincial and
county staff are presently being trained in its use. Periodic updating of the
manual is envisaged and the Government has given an assurance to this effect.
Additional manuals will be prepared (with corresponding training courses) for
design, construction and operation and maintenance, thereby increasing the
productivity of technical and operations manpower.
1.15      Water Pollution.  The growing population and industrialization of
Cu,aa has caused widespread air, water and land pollution, often contaminating
drinking water supplies. In some regions more distant water sources must be
tapped, or, where chemical pollutants are involved, specialized water treat-
ment is required. The effectiveness of these specialized treatment methods
are a matter of controversy in the waterworks industry, and their use imposes
additional costs on the water consumer. In 1979, China enacted an 6nviron-

charged or penalized for discharging wastes, with funds so derived used for
pollution abatement measures or facilities. The overall approach is sound but
the process will require time and steady vigilance and funding. The Bank is
providing some assistance in this field through a proposed project to improve
Shanghai's environment (see para. 1.17).
Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.16      IDA's experience with programs in other countries enables it to
assist China in many aspects of implementing a rural water supply and sanita-
tion program on a national scale. The more important of these as related to
the rural water supply sector and project development are: (a) overall
planning, to develop realistic service targets and programs to achieve those
targets; (b) organizational arrangements and institutional development, to
improve the capabilities at the national, provincial, county and village level
for project planning, implementation and operations; (c) staff development;
(d) financial analysis and funding arrangements for rural water supply (such
as revolving funds, cost sharing, payback terms, cross subsidies and afford-
ability); and (e) planning and design of projects and individual subprojects
to ensure that project organizations and resources are coordinated and that
subprojects are technically appropriate and cost effective. IDA will also
assist the NPO and TAC in guiding the provinces with developing sectOr plans
and strategies for rural water supply (para. 1.11), and will guide preparation
of future rural water supply projects which could be supported by the Bank and
other donors.
1.17      For the urban sector the Bank is involved in planning for Shanghai's
urban development under a cofinancing arrangement with Australia. This is a
consequence of the Bank's 1982 urban sector memorandum on Shanghai which
recommended a concentrated planning effort in the areas of wastewater manage-
ment, housing, traffic and transport. Bank staff are presently assisting
Shanghai and Australian technical teams working on these and the effort is
expected to lead to projects in environmental improvement and housing
upgrading. The Shanghai studies are being monitored by urban development
specialists in the central government and other major cities, and may be used
by them as a guide for their own planning.
II. POPULATION AND DEMAND
Project Area
2.01      The project area includes some 4,650 7yillages in 25 counties which
are distributed in the Municipality of Beijing-  and the Provinces of
Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Zhejiang, hereinafter referred to as the
7/   Beijing is classified as a municipality but 3.6 million (40%) of its 9
million people live in suburban and rural areas. Its status is
equivalent to that of a province.

rroject provinces. The project provinces contain more than 400 counties with
some 170,000 villages. The locations of the project provinces and counties
are shown in IBRD Map 18496. A description of the physical features of the
project provinces is in Annex 1.
Present Situation
2.02      The project provinces have a total population of 213 million and a
rural population of 172 million. Sixty eight percent of the rural population
(117 million people) have inadequate water supplies, ranging from 42% for
Liaoning Province to 84% for Zhejiang Province. Inadequate water supply is.
defined as being scarce, too distant (more than 1 km away) or contaminated by
human, agricultural or industrial wastes or natural substances such as
flouride and salts. Of the 55 million people with adequate water in the
project provinces, 21Z are served by piped systems and 79X by individual
systems such as wells with hand pumps or rainwater catchment tanks. Table 2.1
below details the situation.
2.03      Government applies the principle of self reliance for the provision
of water in rural areas. While the counties provide technical and organiza-
tional assistance, the motivation and most of the physical effort and financ-
ing come from the individuals and villages. Despite substantial investments
and progress made in recent years, these efforts have not been able to fulfill
the vast needs of the rural population. Nor is it likely that these needs can
be met in the future unless substantially more resources are made available
for water supply improvement, and better methods for planning and implementing
projects are found. Future problems will also be more difficult to solve
because the more simple and cheaper solutions are generally implemented
first. Nonetheless, safe water is a basic need and is eagerly sought by the
rural people as they, because of growth in incomes, become increasingly able
LO afford improvements.
Population to be Served
2.04      The 25 counties participating in the project include 11,827 villages
and a rural population of 13.9 million, generally concentrated in small
villages surrounded by cultivated fields. Almost 80% of this population lack
adequate water supply. The average population per village is about 1,200
persons, but in some places it is as low as 600 persons. Most of the village
incomes are derived from agriculture, although sideline and cottage industries
have sprung up in recent years because of Government's liberalizing policies.
2.05      The project would provide safe water supply to about 40% of the
villages in the beneficiary counties. The villages were selected because:
Ci) their present water supply is inadequate; (ii) they want and are willing
to pay for improved water supply; (iii) they are geographically diverse and
provide opportunities for a variety of technical solutions for demonstration
purposes; and (iv) they are relatively poor. Fifty-two percent of the project
villages are presently using polluted and untreated water, for another 32% the
water is scarce or too distant; 11% are using water with excessive fluoride
and 5Z with excessive salinity (Annex 2). Under the project 84% of the
beneficiary villages will receive piped water systems, 1O% will have handpumps
and 6% will be provided with rain water catchment tanks.

2.06      The project would benefit 5.9 million persons (1982 population).
Some 5.1 million people would receive piped water, 79% of which would be by
house connections and the remainder would be on public standpipes. About 0.6
million people would be served with hand pumps and 0.2 million with rainwater
catchment tanks (Annex 2). The facilities to be constructed would have the
capacity to serve the population of year 2,000, estimated at 7.1 million
people. The revolving funds to be established under this project would
finance safe water supplies to an additional 8.5 million people over the
20-year period they operate (para. 5.08).
Service Standards
2.07      Although the water to be provided is mainly for domestic use,
allowances have been included for schools, health centers, small enterprises
and, where feasible, domestic animals. To help keep costs down, the design
volume of water provided per person is low, and in some instances the service
will be intermittent, concentrated in a 6-8 hour period when the population is
at home. Where necessary because of cost and affordability considerations,
the population would continue to use existing water sources for nonpotable
purposes. Service standards are discussed further in paras. 3.04 and 3.05.
I'I. THE PROJECT
Origin
3.01      In 1981 a UN mission of UNDP, WHO and World Bank Group representa-
tives v yited China to survey the water supply and sanitation situation. Its
report,- while recognizing the significant strides made in the sector since
1949, drew attention to critical needs in water supply in both urban and rural
areas. Consequently, UNDP funded the WHO-executed water supply and sanitation
technical assistance project which provided training, information exchange,
specialist services and support for the preparation of water supply projects.
In 1983, China asked the Bank Group to consider a rural water supply lending
operation.  A mission in August 1983 identified a project and provided guid-
ance for its preparation.9/  The Government initially proposed a project for
13 of China's provinces covering 5,000 villages in 21 counties. Since much of
the preparation and implementation is done at the provincial level, and the
provinces require guidance and instruction, the number of provinces was
reduced to four, plus the Municipality of Beijing, to keep the project manage-
able and to help ensure its success. Rural water supply improvements in other

provinces and counties are proceeding in parallel with traditional methods and
arrangements for funding. The project was appraised in September 1984.
Objectives
3.02      The physical objective of the project is to provide safe and
adequate potable water supply to some six million people who now are drinking
contaminated water, have an inadequate supply or must travel an excessive
distance to obtain it. The institutional objectives of the project are to
develop national and provincial planning capability in the sector, improve the
cost-effectiveness of and financial arrangements for projects, and ensure
smooth project implementation and effective water system operation. The
strategies to achieve this are to: (i) improve the organizational arrange-
ments foc preparing and implementing broad-scoped projects; (ii) i.troduce
economic and affordability considerations in project planning: (iii) upgrade
design and equipment technology and improve construction quality: (i ) intro-
duce revolving funds as new financing mechanisms; (v) train manpower in plan-
ning, design and construction and in water system management and operation;
and (vi) assist in developing sector plans and strategies.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
3.03      IDA's experience with rural water supply programs in many other
countries has been helpful in assisting China to plan for a project of this
scope - covering many villages in diverse locations - and with wide institu-
tional objectives. During project preparation, which was done with minimum
foreign consultant participation, IDA staff provided guidance on: project
organization, staffing and management; subproject planning and design with
emphasis on economic analysis; the preparation of a planning manual
(para. 1.14 ); the concept of and regulations for revolving funds; and pro-
cedures and regulations for construction and system management and opera-
tions. IDA's participation in this project has also been helpful in attract-
ing other foreign donors to participate: consultants funded by the FRG have
assisted in preparing a training program (and the FRG is expected to fund the
foreign costs of training) and the World Food Program will provide food aid
for village labor in two of the beneficiary provinces (para. 3.10). Continued
IDA involvement will focus on measures to ensure a successful project:
methods for reviewing and improving subproject design; competitive methods for
the procurement of goods and civil works; adequate quality control for manu-
factured goods and construction; the operation of revolving funds; and the
implementation of the training program. IDA would also assist in preparing
manuals for design, construction and operations and guide in preparing sector
plans.
Scope and Planning
3.04       Planning is done in consultation with the villagers by persons who
are trained in the use of the planning manual and can apply economic, finan-
cial and affordability criteria in the process. The types of waterworks would
range from handpumps and rainwater storage tanks to pumped and piped systems
with ground water or surface water sources (including some with treatment) and
with standpipes or house connections. (Physical, climatic and economic



- 11 -
conditions vary widely, hence technical solutions also vary.) To achieve
economies of scale, particularly where very deep wells or complex water treat-
ment are required; combined systems serving several villages are used where
feasible. The largest combined system is in Pucheng County of Shaanxi
Province, which would serve 182 villages. Because of the combined systems a
total of 3,902 subprojects will be required to serve the 4,650 villages.
Table 3.1 shows the numbers of villages to be served by the various system
types and a detailed description of the project is in Annex 1. The water pro-
duced would generally meet China's drinking water standards, and woyld be
monitored by county health bureaus in Line with current practice.1°   About
80Z of the services from piped systems would be by house connections, and the
balance by standpipes, with the type of service dependent upon climatic
conditions, the preference of the beneficiaries and their ability to afford
the service.
3.05      Systems are designed for a 15-year time horizon with capacities
based upon the per capita demand figures recommended in the planning manual:
45 to 80 liters per capita per day for house connections, and 20 to 40 lcd for
standpipes. Daily and hourly variations (with ratios ranging from 1.3 to 4.0
respectively) will be regulated by storage tanks located on high ground, ele-
vated storage tankp, or pneumatic tanks. Pipe networks will be designed as
branched systems 1 and surface waters will be treated by conventional
methods of coagulation, sedimentation and filtration. Chlorine will be used
for disinfection where necessary. The technical assistance component is for
providing short-term technical specialists. Technical assistance financed by
the Credit is supplemented by the Government team of experts and by training
specialists funded by the FRG. The project does not explicitly include
wastewater facilities because wastewater is not expected to be a problem (see
para. 1.02); where problems are anticipated they will be handled at the
village level by commonly used and appropriate methods. Implementation of the
project began in mid-1984 with the preparation of plans, designs and specifi-
cations. Construction would begin in mid-1985 and the project would be
completed by June 2990.
Cost Estimates
3.06      The project is estimated to cost $208.2 million of which some
$83.7 million (40%) is foreign exchange. The base costs are in January 1985
prices to which is added a physical contingency of 10%. Expected price
increases amount to 18.2% (when calculated in US dollars) and 7.4% (when

presently under review by Government and a new edition will be issued in
1985. Tables 1 and 2 in Annex 1 contain a comparison of China's stand-
ards with those of the WHO and other countries and the project file
contains a note on water quality.

calculated in yuan) cf the base cost plus physical contingencies. For the
calculation of price contingencies, it is assumed that exchange rate
adjustments will, on average, be made to maintain "purchasing power parity"
during the project implementation period. On this basis, price escalation for
both foreign and local costs is based on: (a) expected international
inflation rates of 8% in 1985, 9% in 1986-88, and 7.5% in 1989, when costs are
expressed in US dollars; and (b) expected domestic inflation rate of 3% in
1985-89, when costs are expressed in yuan. The estimates are based on repre-
sentative subproject designs and judgments as to the numbers of each type of
subproject to be included in the project. Civil works, labor and local
materials costs are estimated at current domestic prices; international prices
are used to estimate the costs of materials which are to be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding. A project cost summary is in Table 3.2 and
details are in Annex 3.
Financing Plan
3.07      The total financing of $210.2 million would be used to defray total
physical project costs ($208.2 million) plus $2.0 million for initial working
capital for the provincial revolving funds. IDA would finance $80.0 million
(38.1%); the Government, $1.7 million (0.8%); the provinces, $16.2 million
(7.7%); the counties, $18.3 million (8.7%); the villages, $46.4 million
(22.1%); and the individuals, $35.6 million (16.9%). The FRG would finance
the foreign cost of trainirig, equivalent to $1.5 million (0.7Z); and the WFP
would contribute $10.5 million (5.0%) in the form of food as payment to
workers (para. 3.10). IDA financing would cover 96% of the foreign exchange
cost of $83.7 million; the Government and the provinces would provide
$2.2 million in foreign exchange costs. Details of the financing plan are in
Table 3.3. Assurances have been obtained from the Government and the
provinces that: (a) they would provide on time their financial contributions
to the project; and (b) they would ensure that the counties, collectives and
individuals would make their respective contributions to the project in a
timely manncr. Understandings have been reached with: (a) the Government
that if the financial assistance by the FRG for the training component of the
project were not to materialize, it would finance the foreign costs of this
component; and (b) the provinces of Liaoning and Shaanxi that should the WFP
decide not to participate in the project, they would provide, or cause the
respective counties, collectives or individuals to provide, the equivalent of
the amount of the WFP financing.
Onlending Terms
3.08      The proposed IDA credit would be made to the People's Republic of
China.  A Credic Agreement would be signed between IDA and the PRC, and one
Project Agreement would be signed with the Provinces of Liaoning, Shanxi,
Sichuan and Zhejiang and the Municipality of Beijing. The Borrower, through
the Ministry of Finance and the CPECC, would in turn sign a subsidiary Loan
Agreement with the Provinces. The IDA Credit to the PRC would be on standard
IDA terms. Service charges would be borne by the subproject entities. The
foreign exchange risk would be borne by the province and would not be passed
to the subproject entity. The signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of credit

effec .yeness. The credit proceeds will be Loaned to the subproject enti-
ties _ in two steps, first from the Government to the provinces (for 25
years, including 10 years grace at zero interest rate), then from the
provinces through the counties to the subproject entities (for 10 to 15 years,
including 2 to 4 years grace at zero interest rate). A pro-forma subloan
agreement between a province and a subproject entity has been prepared in
consultation with Government and is shown in Annex 4. Assurances have been
obtained from the Provinces on the above onlending terms to the subproject
entities.
3.09      The onlending terms to the subproject entities are appropriate
because of the sociaL nature of the projects. Furthermore, the beneficiaries
bear a large proportion of the cost of the subprojects: they would provide
up-front more than 40% of the subproject construction cost; they would also
repay loans extended to them by the provinces for another 40% of the estimated
subproject cost; and once the subprojects become operational, they would pay
the full costs of operation and maintenance. Such a high level of cost
recovery (about 80%, not considering interest) is unusual in rural water
supply; the majority of rural systems in other countries are largely financed
as grants. The longer payback and grace period of the loans to the provinces
will generate financing for the provincial revolving funds (para. 5.08) which
would be used for additional rural water supply development. Subsequent
beneficiaries of the revolving funds would receive the same onLending terms as
the original subproject entities.
World Food Program Participation
3.10      The provinces of Liaoning and Shaanxi, who are net importers of
wheat, have requested World Food Program (WFP) participation in their proj-
ects. Under this component, WFP would provide food aid in the form of wheat
to partly pay villagers for their work in the project. The beneficiary
counties have relatively low incomes and the food will help to reduce the
financial ccntributions by the villagers to the investment costs of the
project. The value of the food provided, at prevailing prices in the benefi-
ciary provinces, is $4.7 million for Liaoning and $5.8 million for Shaanxi.
The grain will be delivered to the nearest port and the provinces will arrange
and finance off-loading, storage and transportation to the project counties.
The program will be administered by the relevant project offices, the Ministry
of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisherv, the Ministry of Forestry, and
various food bureaus and food supply centers which have good experience with
handling WFP donations in other projects. Annex 5 contains further details.
12/ A subproject entity may be a village or group of villages, a township, a
water company, or a county, depending on .he ownership structure of the
proposed waterworks.

Training
3.11      Training is a major priority for the Government.  Over the past
several years training activities for water supply personnel have intensified
because of funding made avaiLable through the UNDP/WHO Water Supply and Sani-
tation Project (EHE/CHE/BSM/001), the FRC and the IDA Technical Cooperation
Credit 1412-CHA. There have been numerous seminars, study tours and foreign
expert visits conducted on subjects of management, water quality control,
engineering, sanitation and training. This exchange of information has been
particularly beneficial because China's water supply sector personnel have
been secluded for a long time from sector developments elsewhere. Training
will be intensified under the project and extended to lower level staff and
waterworks operators.
3.12      During project preparation the NPO, its training advisors and
foreign training specialists financed by the FRG developed a proposal for a
training program which, while inicially oriented toward the beneficiary prov-
inces, sets the framework for a national program. The total cost of the
program is estimated at $2.4 million; the government would finance the local
costs and the FRC is expected to provide a grant of $1.5 million for the
foreign cost. The training component would: (a) establish, equip and staff
training units at the National Project Office (NPO of CPHCC), five provincial
project offices, 25 county project offices, and two national training centers
Cone in Liaoning and one in Hebei); (b) establish two county-level practical
skills training sites for water plant operators in each of the five project
provinces; (c) train a core group of about 15 human resources development
officers who will guide the development of the training system and train
trainers to staff the national, provincial, and county-level training insti-
tutions; (d) develop a series of training materials, training manuals, and
training curricula for the national, provincial, and county water supply
training institutions; and (e) train water supply project personnel - 580 at
the national level, 1,174 at the provincial level, and 3,500 at the county and
village levels.
3.13      The training component inputs include:  (a) commodities such as
facilities, vehicles, laboratory equipment, computers and audio-visual equip-
ment; (b) 14 man-months of technical assistance consisting of training
specialists, technical specialists for curriculum review, and computer
training specialists; (c) training activities including the provision of
instructors, trainee travel, lodging, training management and training
sessions; and (d) overseas training to develop the ability of trainers and
human resource development officers. The training would be carried out as
follows: (a) the NPO Training Unit would provide overall management; estab-
lish apex training activities, set up and accredit national and provincial
training centers, organize the training of trainers program and coordinate the
commodity and technical assistance inputs and overseas training; (b) the
National Training Centers would train staff from the NPO, PPO's, and selected
individuals from the CPO's and water plant operator trainers; (c) the PPO
Training Units would organize, manage and coordinate provincial training
resources and guide and supervise the establishment of the provincial training
centers; and (d) the CPO Training Officers would develop training plans for
village-leveL water system operators and manage county training sites and

training programs. The training program is described more fully in Annex 6
and in training reports contained in the project file.
IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
Organization for Project Implementation
4.01      The CPHCC (para. 1.07) has overall responsibility for the project.
To cope with the large number of subprojects and the wide dispersion and
diversity of conditions in the project villages, the CPHCC has set up a
project management organization with project offices at three different
levels. A National Projecc Office (NPO) for rural water supply improvement, a
part of the CPHCC, was established in 1981 in response to the recommendations
of the UN mission (para. 3.01). It has been designated to be responsible for
overall project direction, coordination and control; liaison with external
assistance agencies and with central governmenc ministries and banks; regula-
tions and guidelines for various aspects of project implementation; develop-
ment and coordination of the training program; technical assistance; and
international procurement of goods and equipment. Five Provincial Project
Offices (PPOs), one for each project province, were established in 1983 by the
provincial governments and will be responsible for the execution of work in
the respective provinces as well as arranging transportation and distribution
of procured goods, institutional development, arranging provincial level
training and administration of the provincial revolving funds (para. 5.08).
The work of the PPOs will be overseen by the NPO. Twenty-five County Project
Offices (CPOs), one for each project county, have also been created to lead
and direct planning, design and construction of subprojects within the respec-
tive project counties, the training of water works personnel, and actions to
ensure proper operation of the subprojects upon completion of construction.
The organizational set-up is shown in Annex 7.
4.02      The role of the project offices will principally be one of manage-
ment, coordination, oversight and approval. Subproject planning, detailed
engineering design and construction supervision work will largely be con-
tracted out to other organizations or work units, such as design construction
and materials bureaus, who possess the required expertise and experience. A
system of prequalifyin- these organizations and work units has been proposed
by the NPO and is satisfactory to IDA.
4.03      Thie staffing levels for the various project offices have been agreed
upon during appraisal and are shown in Annex 7. Prior to appraisal IDA staff
were concerned about the numbers and qualifications of NPO staff. The CPHCC
leadership responded by appointing an experienced administrator as a deputy
project manager, assigning a team of six leading water supply experts to work
as advisors to the NPO, and sending two persons to IDA headquarters for one
month to work with IDA staff on project preparation. About 90% of the NPO
positions are now filled, including important engineering positions hired from
recently retired engineering specialists on a contractual basis. Assurances
have been obtained that: (a) the Government would maintain the NPO with
competent staff in adequate numbers and with functions and responsibilities



- 19 -
acceptable to IDA; and (b) the provinces would maintain the PPOs and CPOs witt.
functions and levels of staff satisfactory to IDA. Understandings have been
reached on the levels of staffing, the continuation in service of the NPO's
team of consultants, and arrangements and staffing at the CPOs for adequate
construction supervision.
Subproject Preparation and Design
4.04      Some 500 subprojects were prepared by the time of appraisal in
accordance with the standard designs and procedures of each province or
county. The standards, as well as representative subproject designs, were
studied by foreign experts, earlier IDA missions, and the appraisal team. The
specialists found the work to be generally satisfactory and provided guidance
in the areas of planning, materials and equipment selection, and physical
configurations which would reduce costs and simplify operation. The measures
recommended will be adopted in subproject preparation aLong with the
procedures and criteria prescribed in the planning manual (para. 1.14), which
are summarized in Annex 8.  A draft design manual, which would be finalized by
June 1985, contains a practical set of guidelines which can be used for design
of rural water supply systems throughout the country. To ensure the conti-
nuity of good practice, assurances were obtained that subproject planning and
design would be in accordance with criteria contained in the planning manual
(Annex 8). The PPOs and CPOs would like to carry out the project in three
years (which may be optimistic because of the logistics of procuring and
delivering goods and equipment) and they have geared their design organiza-
tions and work schedules accordingly. Design work is in progress and all
first year subprojects have been designed. Concurrently documents for the
procurement of equipment (through ICB) and civil works are being prepared by
the NPO and specialists assigned from other design bureaus. Overall the
progress on project preparation is satisfactory and the schedule for the
project as set forth in para. 3.05 is realistic.
4.05      The NPO will also prepare manuals to guide construction and
operation of rural supply water systems. These manuals, now in the conceptual
stage, would address such subjects as procurement and contracting procedures,
construction techniques, construction supervision, measurements and payments,
takeover and commissioning, operational routines, repair and maintenance,
revenue collection and accounting. Understandings have been reached with
Government that the NPO would compLete the design, construction and operation
manuals by June 30, 1985; December 31, 1985; and June 30, 1986, respectively,
and that it would update the planning manual by June 30, 1987.
Subproject Review
4.06      A key control activity in the project is the review of subprojects
to ensure that the proposed designs offer the best technical and economic
solutions and can be afforded by the subproject entities. To this end
designers will prepare a report for each subproject which will provide popula-
tion and water consumer data, describe the present water supply situation and
problems, describe alternative solutions and costs, present estimates of
capitaL and operating costs and a financing plan for the selected alternative,
and analyze costs as a percentage of incomes. All subproject reports would be



- 20 -
reviewed by the CPO's, and reports selected on the basis of threshold criteria
(for total capital costs, per capita capital costs and per capita recurrent
costs as a percentage of consumer income) would be reviewed by the correspond-
ing PPO. IDA staff would also review reports at random, about one report
annually per county. Under the proposal, all remaining subprojects (about
3,400 in number) would be reviewed by the CPO's, about 13% of these would be
reviewed by the PPOs, and 3Z (with a value of about 25% of the total construc-
tion cost of the project) would be reviewed by the NPO and IDA. The format
for the design reports and the review and approval criteria have been
discussed with the NPO and provincial staff. Assurances have been obtained
that subprojects would be appraised and approved in accordance with criteria
and procedures acceptable to IDA. The review and approval criteria have been
agreed at negotiations and are contained in Schedule 4 to the Credit Agreement
and in Annex 8 of this report. Understandings were reached on the format for
the design reports, a sample of which is in the Project File.
Procurement
4.07      ICB will be used for the procurement of major materials and equip-
ment totalling $78.8 million in value (two contracts for steel reinforcement
and steel for other structural use, two contracts for steel and cast iron
pipes, two contracts for plastic pipes, two contracts for cement, and a
contract each for water pumps, timber, power transformers and vehicles.) A
margin of preference equal to 15Z of the c.i.f. price or the prevailing
customs duties, whichever is less, will be allowed for domestic manufacturers
in bid evaluation. Microcomputers and miscellaneous office and laboratory
equipment with a total value of about $0.7 million will be purchased through
shopping by inviting quotations from at least three eligible suppliers.
Documents for all IDA-financed contracts estimated to be worth $150,000 or
more will be subject to prior review by IDA. The remaining materials,
equipment and civil works will be procured and financed locally. Materials
such as sand, gravel, stone and bricks (valued at $15.4 million) will be
procured from selected local suppliers or included as part of civil works
contracts. Other kinds of materials and equipment which are required in small
quantities by each of the over 3,900 subprojects will be procured at adminis-
tered prices or through competitive bidding under local procedures at the
county level. Civil works will be carried out by a combination of labor under
force account where work does not exceed $200,000 in value, and contracting by
competitive bidding under local procedures for larger civil works or works
which require special construction skills. Technical assistance totalling
$0.5 million will be for individual experts hired as short-term consultants in
accordance with IDA Guidelines for specific tasks. Procurement arrangements
and their estimated values are shown below, and are detailed in Annex 9.

Note: Figures in parenthesis are the respective amounts financed by the IDA

4.08      IDA is providing ongoing assistance to China for the development of
competitive civil works procurement and this will be the first time that
competitive bidding will be used in some of the beneficiary counties for small
civil works. China is in the early stages of reforming practices for the
procurement of goods and civil works and the procedures to be used under the
project represent a marked advance toward increasing competition, reducing
costs and enhancing quality.
Transportation of Procured Goods
4.09      Imported materials and equipment, labeled with the destination port
and county, will be delivered c.i.f. by the suppliers. The goods will be
received by the provincial materials bureaus as assigned by the PPOs, and the
bureaus will arrange the land transportation to the counties. The goods will
be received by the county materials bureaus who wiLl verify their quantity and
condition and arrange for storage and subsequent transportation to the
subproject sites. For local goods the county or provincial materials bureaus,
depending on whether the goods are ordered at county or higher level, will
receive the goods from the supplying factory, verify their quantity and condi-
tion and arrange for storage and subsequent transportation to the subproject
sites. The county materials bureaus will also be responsible for inventory
accounting and will submit periodic reports on this to the CPOs. The



- 22 -
provincial and county materials bureaus have broad experience with handling
large quantities of goods and the above arrangement should not pose any prob-
lem. The costs of the services to be provided by the materials bureaus and of
land transportation of procured goods have been allowed for in the project.
Construction Supervision
4.10      In China construction supervision of rural works (including water
supply) is not usually considered a separate activity. Quality and progress
control is normally done by the unit carrying out the work under an agreement
between the owner and the work unit. Upon completion of work a technical
committee nominated by the owner would inspect the finished work and approve
takeover. This arrangement is not entirely satisfactory and, as the project
involves a number of rather large subprojects, the NPO agreed that the use of
a third party for construction supervision would be desirable. Construction
supervision would be carried out by staff of the CPO supplemented by indi-
viduals or engineering units who would be engaged on a contractual basis, and
would include the monitoring of quality and progress, the control of materials
and equipment issued to contractors, the resolution of site problems, and the
certification of measurements and payments. These procedures would be set
forth in the construction manual. Understandings have been reached on
arrangements and staffing to help ensure satisfactory construction
supervision.
Disbursement
4.11      Tne credit would be disbursed at 100% of foreign expenditures for
imported equipment and goods and 100% of local expenditures for ex-factory
costs of locally manufactured equipment and goods procured under ICB ($78.8
million) or shopping ($0.7 million), and at 100% of expenditures for technical
assistance ($0.5 million). An IDA Special Account with an authorized alloca-
tion of US dollar equivalent of SDR 2.1 million would be established to
facilitate disbursements for the above expenditures. Replenishment would be
made on a monthly basis or whenever the special account is drawn to 50% of its
initial deposit value. Disbursement would normally be made against full
documentation except for contracts valued at less than $50,000, reimbursements
would be made on the basis of statement of expenditures (SOE) to be certified
by the NPO. Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by NPO and made
available for inspection by IDA supervision missions. The disbursement period
will be from 1985 to 1990. The schedule of disbursements (Annex 10) is based
on estimates of when withdrawals will be made for the special account and for
internationally procured contracts. Because the Bank's involvement in China
is recent, a disbursement profile for China is not avaiLable for reference.
The proposed disbursement schedule is somewhat shorter than the IDA/IBRD dis-
bursement profile for water supply projects elsewhere. This is reasonable
because IDA disbursement will be only for the procurement of materials and
equipment under ICB, which normally takes less time than and has to precede
civil works. Moreover the procurement documents are being prepared with the
assistance of CNTIC, the institution entrusted and experienced with ICB
procurement. The Credit closing date will be December 31, 1990.

Project Monitoring
4.12      A system for monitoring project progress, reporting, reviewing, and
taking corrective actions has been set up to ensure successful project imple-
mentation. Monthly progress reports originating at the subproject sites would
be compiled by the CPOs and flow to the PPOs and thence to the NPO. The
formats would become more condensed with each step, but progress on activities
carried out by project offices at higher levels, such as procurement and
training, would be added en-route. The NPO would prepare progress reports
that would be sent to IDA semiannually beginning August 31, 1985. The reports
would concentrate on five key indicators which are to be monitored throughout
the project.  These are:  (a) subprojects completed and additional population
served; (b) status of ICB procurement; (c) status of civil works construction;
(d) status of staffing of the various project offices; and (e) training.
Understandings on key indicators, the reporting formats and the submission of
semi-annual progress reports to IDA (Annex 11) have been reached and are
recorded in the minutes of negotiations.
Organization of Village Waterworks
4.13      Rural water supply systems in China usually serve and are owned and
operated by individual villages. Townships (consisting of a market town and a
group of 6-12 villages) and counties provide oversight, training and technical
and material assistance wh'n needs exceed village capabilities.  Systems are
usuaLly simple and can be operated by one or two persons who are usually from,
and selected by, the village.  In some cases part-time operators are suffi-
cient.  Repairs are done by village workers up to their level of competence,
and more demanding work is done by township or county technicians. Systems
which serve several villages are organized by the township or county, and then
frequently a company is set up which has separate divisions for operations,
finance and administration. Water quality is controlled first at the water-
works level, with subsequent monitoring and control by the township and
county. Townships and counties are also repositories of materials and parts,
thereby simplifying and reducing the cost of maintaining inventories. The
cost of services provided by counties is partly recovered through charges to
the villages.
4.14      New systems constructed in the project are expected to be operated
in the same way existing systems are, and operational entities will he set up
for each subproject. Under the project the organizational structures will be
formalized with the issuance of county and provincial regulations that define
the duties and responsibilities of the waterworks entities and the support
they will receive from the villages, the townships and the counties. The NPO
has drafted guideline regulations which have been reviewed by IDA staff.
Understanding has been reached with the Government that the guideline regula-
tions would be finalized and issued in time to allow county and provincial
regulations to be prepared and promulgated as the subprojects come into opera-
tion. The operating manual to be prepared by the NPO (para. 4.05) will
provide guidance to system operators and managers on general operational
requirements, and supplemental operating manuals will be tailored for each
system. Operator-designates will take part in constructing the system and at
the same time will receive training and certification from the county.

V. FINANCE
Operation of Existing Waterworks
5.01      Capital and operating costs of rural water supply systems in China
are considerably lower than those in other developing countries because the
facilities usually provide small volumes of water, villagers contribute labor
and materials, wages and other expenses are low and waterworks operations are
integrated with other village activities. Based upon limited data, capital
costs per person range on average from Y 40 (for piped spring water or hand-
pumps) to Y 80 (for piped surface water with treatment). Operating costs
range from Y 0.14 per cu m for treated surface water to Y 0.09 per cu m for
wells and Y 0.07 per cu m for spring water systems (Annex 12, Tables I and
2). The main operating expenses for piped water systems are power, (which
represents 30-40% of the cost), and materials and maintenance (20-30%). Labor
represents less than 20% of the cost. The remaining expenses are for
chemicals and administration.
5.02      For village waterworks systems the village accountant, working part-
time, keeps records of receipts, payments and inventories on behalf of the
waterworks entity. For larger systems serving several villages, accounts are
kept at the waterworks office by full-time accountants. The accounting system
is reasonable, with the information generally used for determining annual fund
requirements and the payment of bonuses to workers.
5.03      The methods of charging for water in rural water supply systems
vary. Where the systems have metered household connections, which is rather
rare, villagers pay individually for the water used at per cubic meter rates
decided by the village (or the county or township). The rates are normally
progressive, increasing with usage, and higher for commercial and industrial
uses. For unmetered service (public standpipes or unmetered house connec-
tions) a monthly rate per household or person is normally charged. Such
charges may be collected from the individuals,by the rural waterworks, or more
commonly paid for out of the collective funds22I of the village. In general
the amounts collected cover the costs of operation and maintenance and,
sometimes, a small amount is set aside for depreciation.
Tariffs and Affordability
5.04      In line with the self-reliance principles in China, tariff practices
require the user to pay the full costs of the service. Typically a village
would be expected to pay 90% to 100% of the capital cost of the system as the
costs are incurred, and the full cost of operations. These stringent terms
undoubtedly inhibit rural water supply development and explain in part why so
many people are inadequately served. Under this project longer-term financing
13/ These funds come from und-istributed earnings of agricultural and business
activities of the village retained for the purpose of meeting the costs
of common social activities and projects.



- 25 -
(10 to 15 years) is provided, thereby making improved water supply available
to a consumer group which has not yet been reached. Moreover, the basic
principles of cost recovery would be continuied: water charges would be set at
a level sufficient to cover (a) operation and maintenance costs and debt
service, and (b) operation and maintenance costs and depreciation after loans
have been amortized. These conditions have been agreed to at negotiations and
would be incorporated in the Project Agreement, in the loan agreements between
the provinces and subproject entities, and in the regulations for the prov-
incial revolving funds to be issued by the provinces (para. 5.08).
5.05      To ensure that the facilities to be constructed under the project
could be afforded under the proposed cost recovery policy, simulations were
carried out under varying assumptions for village income, capital costs and
operating costs (Annex 1X}.  These show that on average affordability will not
be a problem. Using 3Z_ of income as appropriate expenditure level for
water supply, the simulations flag only very low income villages (with annual
per capita incomes of about Y 100) as having potential problems if they were
to finance higher cost schemes such as surface water with treatment. For
villages at these income levels lower cost options, such as hand pumps and
rainwater catchment systems, are well within financial reach. Were 4% used as
an appropriate expenditure level, on average even the poorest of villages
would be considered able to afford piped well water. Since system costs vary
from place to place, affordability will be tested for each subproject,
reported in the design report, and be a parameter wh ch would trigger reviews
by PPOs and the NPO (para. 4.06). Where affordability is in doubt, systems
would be redesigned to provide a lower level of service, or the normal loan
repayment period of 10 years would be extended as necessary, but not to exceed
15 years.
Financing Arrangements
5.06      Because the proposed IDA Credit to the Government would be disbursed
against the purchase of internationally procured goods (except for $0.5 mil-
lion for technical assistance) the proceeds of the subsidiary loans to be
relent from the Credit to the provinces and thence to the counties and
subproject entities will be in goods. Each subproject entity will receive 40%
of the estimated or actual construction cost as loan, with the total amount of
the loans equal to the credit amount less the amount earmarked for technical
assistance. However, as the amount of internationally procured goods required
by each subproject varies, it is necessary for subproject entities that
require goods with a value greater than their determined loan amounts to pay
for the excess in equivalent local funds, and these would be used to balance
the loans for subprojects that require less imported goods. This reconcilia-
tion process will be done at both the county and provincial levels: the CPOs
would ensure that all subproject entities in each county receive the rightful
amount for construction cost in loan, and the PPOs would ensure that all
project counties receive as loan the same percentage of construction cost
14/ Three, four and sometimes five percent are values commonly used worldwide
to test if consumers can afford water supply service.



- 26 -
within their respective province. Details of the workings of the proposed
system are in the Project File.
5.07      Prior to the start of construction, each CPO would collect part of
the agreed financial contributions from the respective province, county and
subproject entity, i.e., the villages and individuals. The remaining parts of
the financial contributions will be collected in stages during subproject con-
struction. These funds would be deposited in a county project account, which
would be used exclusively for the payment of subproject capital expenditures.
The value of goods procured by Credit funds and allocated to each county would
also be entered into this account. To encourage least-cost subproject design
and to help ensure that the loan funds would be used appropriately, rules to
determine the rightful amount of loan for each subproject have been estab-
lished. Each subproject design would be reviewed by the CPO or higher
authority (para. 4.06) to ensure that the design is for least cost. A loan
amount equivalent to 40% of the estimated subproject cost would be committed
and allocated to each subproject entity at the time the subproject is
approved. This allocation will not be subject to increase even if actual
project costs exceeded the estimated cost. Upon compLetion of a subproject,
the actual subproject construction cost would be established, and the amounts
in cash and equipment or material provided by the loan (para. 5.06) would be
verified. The final loan amount for each subproject would then, as determined
by each province, be set at 40% of the estimated cost at the time of approval,
or 40Z of the actual cost of the subproject. Loan savings in the latter case,
if any, would be refunded by the subproject entity to the county project
account. Ccst overruns will be borne by the subproject entity. At the end of
each year, the total investment and financing for each county would be
reviewed by the PPO. Excesses or shortfalls on the agreed loan amounts on-
lent from the Credit would be collected from or paid to the county's project
account. Understandings on the flow of funds are recorded in the minutes of
negotiations.
Provincial Revolving Funds
5.08      While self-finance by villagers for rural water supply improvement
in the past few years has produced significant results, it is clear that with-
out external financing assistance and improved financial mechanisms, progress
in rural water supply would be unacceptably slow. Government concern prompted
its request to IDA financing of this project, yet the impact will be small
compared to the need. To increase the financial resources for rural water
supply and to broaden the impact of the Credit, provincial revolving funds
(PRF) would be created in each project province. The difference in the repay-
ment terms of the provincial loans tc the villages (10 years with 2 years
grace) and the Government loans to the provinces (25 years with 10 years
grace) wilL generate funds to build up the revolving funds, the PRF's would
then be used to finance additional subprojects. Pro-forma projections of the
PRF indicate that the repayment from the beneficiaries of the proposed project
would generate sufficient funds to provide service to an additional 8.5 mil-
lion people in the 20-year period that the PRF finances subprojects (Annex
13). It is expected that the Government would make additional contributions
to the PRF after the proposed project is underway. Projections show that two
additional inputs from the Government to the beneficiary provinces, each of



- 27 -
the same magnitude as this Credit ($80 million) together with village and
county inputs of the same magnitude as in the period 1980-1984, would be
sufficient to provide the entire underserved rural population of these
provinces (104 million people) with safe potable water by the turn of the
century. The PRF would be administered by the PPO but the disbursement and
collection of funds would be done by the Agricultural Bank of China, for which
the provinces will pay a fee of about 1%. The subprojects to be financed by
the PRF would be subjected to the same review and approval procedure as those
financed by the Credit, except that IDA would not participate. Lending from
the PRF would be on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA and the provinces;
these would be the same as the original subloans under the project.  The
procedure for the operation of the PRFs has been discussed and agreed with the
Government and is in the Project File. Because of the importance of the PRFs
to the project, the issuance of regulations for and the establishment of the
PRFs are conditions of Credit effectiveness.
Accounting and Auditing
5.09      A simplified system for flow of funds and accounting for project
expenditures during construction has been developed during project prepara-
tion. The system, described more fully in the Project File, provides for:
(a) the accounting of local expenditures at the village level and consolida-
tion at county, provincial and national levels; (b) the flow of funds from
IDA, the provinces, counties and villages; and (c) the allocation of goods and
expenditures for ICB equipment and materials to the respective provinces,
counties and villages. Basic accounting for all the project villages during
the construction period would be done at the county level. A system has also
been agreed to record revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities of the
waterworks after they become operational. Accounting for systems would
normally be done part-time by the village accountant, or, for larger systems,
the waterworks accountants.
5.10      The auditing of project expenditures would be complex because
counties in several provinces are involved, many different sources of funds
are used and each of the thousands of subprojects would have several contracts
for materials, equipment and civil works. But the audit of expenditures
involving IDA funds would be relatively simple because expenditures are all
managed by the NPO and the funds would be used only for internationally pro-
cured goods and for technical assistance. Understandings on the audit
arrangements have been reached with the China State Audit Administration (SAA)
and the NPO. They are as follows: the expenditures of the villages would be
consolidated by the CPO and certified by the County Audit Bureau; a consoli-
dated account of the project expenditures would then be-prepared by the PPO,
certified by the provincial auditors and sent to the NPO and the SAA (prov-
incial audit reports are also subject to review by IDA); finally the SAA would
prepare a comprehensive audit report and a copy of this would be forwarded to
IDA annually.
5.11      The constitution ratified by the National People's Congress in
December 1982 provided for the establishment of the SM, which was done in
September 1983. The SAA has the status of a ministry and reports directly to
the State Council. The SAA and audit bureaus at provincial and county levels



- 28 -
are in the process of consolidation. Because the SAA is still developing as
an institution, it has a very large workload, and as the audit process for
this project is complex, it is not expected that the SAM will be able to
produce thorough audit reports until mid-1987. Before such time suitable
transitional arrangements will be made by Government and the SAA for annual
audits along more traditional lines. Accordingly, assurances have been
obtained from the Government and the Provinces that (a) procedures satisfac-
tory to IDA would be used to account for project expenditures and financing
and (b) the consolidated project cost accounts would be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA and audit reports would be submitted within six
months after the end of each financial year.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Justification
6.01      While health, quaLity of Life and other benefits from the project
are apparent, they cannot be directly quantified. Also because of the absence
of metering, which is not economical in the context of rural China, revenues
from water sales cannot be used as a proxy for the measurement of economic
benefits. It is therefore not possible to compute an accurate economic rate
of return for the project. However, given the seriously inadequate state of
the present water supplies - contaminated water giving rise to poor health
conditions, excessive fluoride content causing skeletal deformities, and
difficult access occupying free time and inflicting hardship on water carriers
- the project almost certainly will have a significant positive impact. The
importance of improved water supply is demonstrated by the villagers' support
of the project, their participation in the planning, and their willingness to
contribute financially to meet the costs of the project. In previous water
supply projects in the project provinces, villagers have demonstrated willing-
ness to pay by financing nearly all costs of the improvements. The project
will in addition provide water of improved quality for livestock and indus-
trial activities promoted under the "production responsibility system." The
planning and design process adopted for individual subprojects would ensure
that the systems proposed are least cost and within the villagers' ability to
pay. The institutional development and project implementation measures of
this project are potential benefits to future projects in this sector. In
particular the revolving fund mechanism could be used elsewnere in China to
help extend coverage and attain the water surply targets.
Subproject Sustainability
6.02      The Government and IDA staff are confident that the facilities
constructed under the project will operate for a long time because the
villages pay for the bulk of the capital cost; villagers participate in the
planning process; safe and reliable water is highly valued in China; and there
is a keen sense of upkeep and pride at the village level. Many existing
systems were observed in China by IDA staff, and all were well-maintained and
well-operated.



- 29 -
Poverty Impact
6.03      Most of the six million persons benefitting directly from the
project live in areas with water shortages and earn lower than average incomes
(Annex 2). It is estimated that 3.6 million (about 60%) of the beneficiaries
had incomes in 1982 below the rural relative poverty threshold of Y 195 per
person. Because water provided for industrial or commercial use under the
project is limited, and the water provided is distributed relatively uniformly
between the inhabitants of any given village, it is estimated that about 60%
of the project cost will directly benefit those below the poverty threshold.
Environmental Aspects
6.04      By providing safe and adequate water the project provides major
quality-of-life benefits for household environmen B7  Present excreta manage-
ment practices, which are generally satisfactory,- would not be adversely
affected. Sullage water would be handled in traditional, acceptable ways.
The impact of wastewater from the proposed water treatment plants would not be
significant given the smalL volume and relative inertness of the wastes.
There would be some environmental disruption during construction but this will
have minimal immediate and no long-term impact on people, animals, plants,
land, air or water.
Risk
6.05      Although the project is not technically complex, the number and
dispersion of subprojects, the involvement of numerous provinces and counties,
and the introduction of international procurement, will impose a heavy burden
of project management on the newly formed NPO. This and the fact that the
capacities of the project offices have not been tested on a major project,
suggest that project implementation may be slower than anticipated and that
this may deLay project completion. In anticipation, IDA has had extensive
discussions and has reached agreements with the PO on staffing. The team of
advisors will be continued in service to help the NPO, PPOs and CPOs; and the
staffing situation and project progress will be monitored to ensure that
corrective actions are taken if necessary. Because all levels of government
are committed to rapidly completing the project and day-to-day activities of
design and construction will be managed by PPOs and CPOs who have experienced
staff, the measures agreed with the Government on staffing, consultants and
progress monitoring make the risk acceptable.
15/ The CPHCC recognizes that excreta management in some rural areas could be
improved.- To this end it has an ongoing education campaign and seeks to
introduce the use of biogas generators which help to make the wastes
safer.

CHINA
RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
The Project Area and Project Technical Details
1.        The project will provide improved water supply to 4,650 villages
located in 25 counties within the Municipality of Beijing and the provinces of
Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Zhejiang. A brief description of the provinces
and the works in each province follows. A summary of the existing water
supply conditions and the proposed methods to improve water supply is given in
Annex 2, Tables 1 to 4. The viLlages have been selected to represent a
variety of physical and economic conditions with due consideration given to
the need for water supply improvement, the eagerness of the villages to have
the work done and the affordability of 'he villages to pay operating and
maintenance costs and debt service.
Municipality of Beijing
2.         Beijing Municipality, with an area of 16,800 sq km, is located at
the northern tip of the North China Plains about 80 km inland from the Bok Sea
Coast. It has 9 million people, 40% of whom live in rural areas. The land is
relatively flat broken by hills in the north and west. The climate is
continental with warm summers and cold winters. Annual rainfall averages a
little over 600 mm. The five project counties are located on relatively flat
t2rrain around the nation's capital city of Beijing. Population in the
project villages are presently using groundwater from the shallow aquifer
through hand-dug wells or handpumps. The water is either heavily polluted
from industrial waste or has high fluoride content. During the crop growing
season with heavy irrigation water use, the groundwater level is often drawn
so far down that the existing domestic wel's dry out. The project will
construct for each of 665 villages (1982 population of 658,000) a tube well
system to tap water from the deep aquifer (water level about 20 m below
ground). The water will be pumped and distributed through a piped network
system, with connections to individual houses.
Liaoning Province
3.        Liaoning Province is the southernmost of the three north-east
provinces of China which used to form Manchuria. The province has a popula-
tion of 36 million and an area of some 145,700 sq km witi- coastlines along the
Bok Sea and the Yellow Sea and borders with the People's Republic of Korea.
The province is traversed by some 360 rivers. The general terrain is not
extreme with elevations ranging from sea level to a litt.e over 1,000 m.
Winters are cold and summers are mild. Annual rainfall ranges from 400 to
1,200 mm p.a. with the drier regions in the western parts and along the
coast. The province is one of the most highly industrialized regions in the
country. Of the five project counties four are located along the coast. The
other lies in the center part of the province. The project villages are
presently using untreated surface water or water from shallow aquifers through



-33-                              ANNEX 1
Page 2
wells or handpumps. These sources are now heavily poLLuted from domestic and
industrial waste discharges. In one project county, the shallow groundwater
has also a fluoride content reaching 16 mg/liter (far exceeding the World
Health Organization (WHO) recommended safe drinking water standard limit of
1.5 mg/liter) and the population suffer skeletal deformities. The project
will provide 667 villages (1982 population of 1,163,000) with a safe
groundwater supply from the deep aquifer by the construction of 560 tube
wells. In generaL well depths will be about 50 to 300 m but under exceptional
circumstances depths of 1,000 m or more may be drilled. The technology for
deep well drilling is well advanced in this province because of extensive
developments in the oil and gas industries. Treated water from rivers and
canals will be provided to another 37 villages (1982 population of 89,000).
All project villages will be served through piped network systems with
individual house connections.
Sichuan Province
4.        Sichuan is China's most populous province with more than 100 million
people. It is located in the southwest of China and has a land area of
567,000 sq km of which over 50% are mountainous terrain. Ground elevations
within the province range from 300 to over 3,000 meters above sea level
(highest peak about 4,800 m). The winters are mild with hot summers.
Average annual rainfall is from 900 to 1,200 mm. Over 1,000 rivers, most of
which are tributaries to the Chang Jiang (YangTze River) traverse the
province. The main stream of the Changjiang flows through the eastern part of
the province and Leaves the province in rapids through deep gorges, the
spectacular scenaries of which are well known throughout the country. Four of
the five project counties are located near the provincial capital Chengdu in
the center of the province, and the fifth county lies in the eastern part.
The population in the project villages are presently using polluted water from
rivers, canals and ponds. Some villages are not able to obtain even an
adequate suppLy from these sources. The project will provide 463 villages
(1982 population of 844,000) with a safe groundwater supply through the
construction of 461 well systems. In another 11 villages (1982 population of
29,000) surface water after treatment will be used. These sources will serve
about 60% of the project villages and will be supplied through piped network
systems with connections to individual houses. For the remaining 479 villages
(1982 population of 608,00), some 95,300 handpumps will be constructed to
extract groundwater from the shallow aquifer. The handpump service is of two
types. Handpumps with shallow small bore tube wells (about 88,300 in number)
will be installed for individual houses (each serving about 5 persons). In
some areas shallow wells (about 7,000 in number) will be dug and handpumps
will be installed into the wells. Each such well generaLly serves about 4 to
5 families (20 persons).
Shaanxi Province
5.        Shaanxi Province, with 29 million people, is located in the northern
part of Central China. The province spreads some 860 km from north to south
and 430 km from east to west covering a land area of 205,600 sq km. Of the
total land area over 80 percent are highlands and mountainous terrain. The
large variation in topography and the wide spread in latitude account for big



-34 -                               ANNEX 1
Page 3
climatic differences wichin the province. The northern region of the province
is a loess plateau merging into the de_ert regions of Inner Mongolia to the
north. The climate is typified by cold winters and scanty rainfall (300 mm
p.a. or Less). The southern part of the province is mountainous with annual
rainfall approaching 1,000 mm. The central region constituting the Guanzong
river plains receive only moderate rainfall. Four of the project counties are
located in these plains and the fifth county is at the north-West corner of
the loess plateau on the fringes of the Maowusu Desert. The latter county and
another also in the province are the tw.m lowest per capita income counties in
the project. Because of substantial variations in climate and topography
within the province, drinking water problems are diverse in nature. Problems
in the project viLlages range from use of polluted surface water, groundwater
of high salinity and/or high fluoride content, general water scarcity
requiring inhabitants to travel over 1 kilometer or down gullies which are
often over 200 meters deep to obtain water of doubtful quality. The project
will construct 165 rapid sand filtration type water treatment plants to treat
surface water for supply to 212 viLlages (1982 population of 535,000), tap
spring water to serve 46 villages (1982 population of 42,000) and construct
294 tube well systems to suppLy safe water to 421 villages (1982 popuLation of
647,000). These sources which will serve about 90% of the project villages
will be distributed through piped network systems. Because of the relative
shortage of water sources of acceptable quality in the province, the costs of
developing sources and of transmicting the water to the demand centers are
very high. To cut down water supply costs so that they can be within the
affordability of the population served, the water will generally be supplied
through public standpipes. Only 17% of the villages supplied (1982 population
of 203,000) will be provided with individual house connections. Underground
water cellars (22,430 in number) will be constructed in 174 villages (1982
population of 145,000) to collect rainwater for drinking purposes. In one
village (1982 population of 800) 150 handpumps will be constructed.
Zhejiang Province
6.        Zhejiang Province has 39 million people and is located on the China
Sea coast around the 30 degrees north latitude. The province has a total land
area of 102,000 sq km. Ground elevations within the province vary from sea
level to almost 2,000 m with the higher grounds in the south and southwest.
Seven major river systems drain the province, flowing separately into the
China Sea. In addition an extensive canal system interlaced with the rivers
covers a large area of the northern plains. This system is used widely for
water transport within the Tai Lake area and is built around the Grand Canal
system which at one time used to extend some 1,500 km from Hangzhou, the
provincial capital, to Beijing and served to transporL grain from the south to
the nation's capital. The climate in the province ranges from subtropical to
temperate with hot summers and mild winters. RainfalL is abundant in the
south (1,200 to 2,200 mn per year) tapering off sharply to the north,
particularly along the coast. Most of the project viLlages in the province
are located in areas where the surface water sources have become heavily
polluted. The remaining villages are located along coastal areas where
potable surface water sources are distant and groundwater is generally very
saline. The project will construct 335 treatment plants to treat surface
water for supply to 735 villages with a 1982 population of 691,000 people.

Page 4
Spring water sources vill be tapped to provide water to 114 villages (1982
population of 87,000 people).  Shallow and deep well systems totalling 450 in
number will be constructed to serve 497 villages (1982 population of 314,000).
These supplies will be distributed through piped network systems with
individual house connections. For the coastal villages, 2,580 tanks, each 3.5
cu m in size for the use of one family, will be constructed to collect
rainwater for drinking purposes. A total of 104 villages (1982 pcpulation of
82,000) will be served in this way.
Selection of Systems and Design Criteria
7.        The systems proposed in the project have been selected as the Least
cost solutions from alternative solutions considered. Account has also been
taken of possible economies from use of alternative materials, funding
constraints and affordability of the consumers. The design criteria used are
basically in accordance with the recommendations of the Planning Manual
prepared in 1984 by the Office of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign
Committee. Standard designs for water structures have aLready been completed
by the various Design Offices of the Provinces and these will be generally
used. A design horizon of 15 years is adopted. The average popularion growth
in rural communities in China is 1.2Z p.a., but due to differences in social
and economic conditions, the projected rural population growth rate in the
project provinces ranges from 1.0 to 1.455 p.a. Per capita demand figures
vary somewhat between provinces largely due to climatic differences, and are
generally as follows:
Domestic:  House connections              45-80 l.c.d.
Public standpipes             20-40 l.c.d.
Provision is made to provide water for livestock and for some small agro-based
rural industries. Daily and hourly peak factors of 1.3-1.5 and 3.0-4.0
respectively are used.
Description of Typical Systems
Surface water
8.        Surface sources are generaLly from ponds, rivers or canals.  Where
the yield of the source is expected to fall below che water supply needs
during certain times of the year, ponds are usually constructed for raw water
storage. The water is treated either by using conventional rapid gravity sand
filters (flocculation, sedimentation and filtration) or with pressure filter
units, chlorinated (usually with sodium hypochlorite or bleaching powder) and
pumped to supply through a water distribution pipe network.
Spring water
9.        Spring water sources are usually of good quality and no treatment is
normally required. The source is protected from contamination by constructing
surrounding barriers and the water is collected in covered tanks constructed
of brick or concrete. From there the water is pumped to a water distribution
pipe network.

Page 5
Groundwater
10.       Where the shaLlow groundwater (water level not below 10 meters from
ground surface) is of acceptable quality, this source is preferred and used.
Shallow wells are commonly hand dug and are about 1.5 to 3 meters in
diameter. In aquifers with less permeability perforated pipes are extended
radially from the well wall into the aquifer to increase groundwater inflow.
To tap deeper aquifers, tube wells are normally used. Well diameters are
normally 100 to 200 mm in diameter. Casings may be of concrete, plastic, cast
iron or steel with screens of similar material. (The screens presently used
in China are inefficient and this increases operating costs. Under the
project modern screen technology will be introduced). Three types of pumps
are used. All are electrically driven. Horizontal centrifugal pumps are used
where the suction lift (difference in elevation between water level and pump)
does not exceed 6 meters. To extract deeper water deep well turbine pumps or
submersible pumps are used. In the former type the electric motor is mounted
at ground level and this drives a pump located under water in the well through
a long shaft. The latter type consists of a sealed unit comprising a motor
and a pump. The unit is powered by electricity and is completely submerged in
the well water. From the pumping line water is then distributed through a
distribution pipe network. Where water quality is of doubtful quality, a
sterilizing reagent such as sodium hypochlorite solution or gaseous chlorine
is injected into the pumping line.
Piped Distribution Networks
11.       Pipe distribution networks are normally designed as branched systems
with working pressures generally not exceeding 4 kglsq cm. Distribution pipes
of 200 mm or smaller in diameter will generally be of plastic material.
Currently the plastic pipes for water supply used in China are of polyethylene
(for diameters below 50 mm) and polypropyLene. The Chinese Authorities are
now considering including polyvinyl chloride pipes, hitherto used only for
sanitary sewers, also for water supply. Smaller diameter pipes of galvanized
steel are also used. These pipes are much more expensive than plastic pipes
and their use is generally limited to exposed parts of house plumbing work,
public standpipes, hydrants, or in very rocky soil where it is more economical
to lay the pipe above ground. Larger pipes are normally of cast iron or
ductile iron with lead or mechanical joints. Storage tanks on high ground or
elevated water towers are built within the distribution system to regulate
flows. In small pumped systems, instead of a storage tank or water tower, an
air pressure tank on the pumping line is often used, which maintains steady
pressure in the system through an automatic pressure activated switch
controlling the running of the pump. While the use of an air pressure tank
results in greater fluctuation in system pressure and does not provide storage
for continuation of service during pump breakdowns, it does offer substantial
savings in capital cost.
12.       About 80% of the project population who are served by piped distri-
bution systems (equivalent to 68% of the total project population) will have
house connections. Where plumbing does not exist in the house, which will be
the majority of the cases, the connection will be given to a tap located in
the yard. The cost of constructing this tap is also included in the



-37-                               ANNEX 1
Page 6
project. Because of the high additional cost of metering (capital as well as
maintenance, meter reading and billing costs), the connections will not be
metered. It is believed that the lack of plumbing facilities and the peer
pressure that exists in a village would be sufficient to keep water usage
under control, although the Chinese have indicated that significant
differences in per capita water consumption have been observed between
villages where house connections are metered and those where they are not.
Individual metering may therefore have to be considered for the future and
officials are prepared to introduce it where necessary. Where a system serves
several villages, a bulk supply meter will be installed for each village for
the purpose of determining how water charges are to be distributed.
13.       The remaining 20% of the project population on piped distribution
systems (about 17Z of the total project population) will receive their supply
from public standpipes. Each standpipe will be designed to serve about 200
persons and will have a concrete basin with proper drainage for laundering
use. Again the standpipes will not be individually metered, but the supply
line to each village in a multi-village system will have bulk supply meters.
Handpumps
14.       Handpumps are used in communities where the population is scattered
and where the shallow groundwater is of acceptable quality. Various designs
of handpumps are available. The ones commonly used in China are made of cast
iron and have a lever type handle which activates a piston in a cylinder with
a foot valve, and draw water from a small bore tube well. The well pipe may
be of mild steel or plastic. Where it is not possible to sink bore wells
because of the rocky nature of the subsoil, shallow wells are dug and hand-
pumps are installed to extract water from the well for use. Each such well
will normally serve 4 to 5 families (about 20 people). The use of deep-set
handpumps for deep aquifers has only recently been introduced in China so out
of caution these are used in the project on a pilot basis only.
Rainwater Collection Systems
15.       In areas where both surface and groundwater sources cannot be made
available economically, rainwater from house roofs and backyards are collected
through a system of open channels and stored in underground tanks for domestic
use. The design of the storage structures depends on local practice. In
Zhejiang rectangular tanks constructed of brick or concrete are used. In
Shaanxi the structure (called a water cellar) takes the shape of a large
bottle which is dug out by hand in the ground. The sides of the structure are
then lined with cement or lime mortar. A sedimentation chamber to remove
solid particles from the collected rainwater, and sometimes a small roughing
filter are constructed at the end of the collection channels in the newer
designs to ensure that the water entering the storage chamber is clear. The
water is drawn out of the water tank or cellar with buckets through an opening
at the top which is kept small to reduce evaporation.

Page 7
Drinking Water Standards
16.       The facilities constructed under the project would be designed where
feasible to produce water which meets China's drinking water standards. These
are given in Table 1, and are compared with WHO standards and those of the USA
and India in Table 2. China's standards are a bit more stringent than
WHO's. The standards apply to water purveyed to the consumer, with or without
treatment. The setting of standards is a complex task. Safe contaminant
levels are generally not known with certainty, and drinking water is usually
not the only source of the constituent for which a standard is set. China is
in the processes of reviewing its standards and new ones would be issued in
1985. The project file contains a paper written by Professor D. A. Okun on
the subject of drinking water standards in China.
Water Treatment
17.       Water treatment is expensive and the use of water requiring treat-
ment is only done in rural water supply when other solutions are not feasi-
ble. The more common form of treatment is the removal of suspended matter in
the water. This form of treatment is normally required when surface water
sources are used and generally consists of flocculation with a chemical
coagulant, settling the water in sedimentation tanks and then passing the
water through rapid gravity sand filters. The structures are constructed of
concrete or brick. In small systems where the turbidity of the water is not
very high sealed filter units called pressure filters are sometimes used.
These consist essentially of a cylindrical tank made of mild steel inside
which the filter medium is placed. Since the unit is closed it can be
operated under pressure. The advantage of using such units is that standard
units can be mass produced in factories, they can be transported easily to the
site, and they can be installed with relative ease.
18.       In general, treatment to remove undesirable dissolved inorganic
matter in water is more difficult. Such problems are normally associated with
groundwater sources. Common undesirable chemicals present in rural water
supply include (a) iron and manganese salts which cause coloring in water,
(b) fluoride compounds, the presence of which in excessive quantities in
drinking water causes discoloring of the teeth and in severe cases skeletal
deformities; (c) calcium and magnesium salts which cause hardness in water and
affects its use for washing purposes; and (d) sodium chloride which causes
salinity in water affecting taste and its use by patients suffering from
coronary diseases. The removal of dissolved chemicals in rural water supply
is seldom economically feasible. In most cases it may be better to go to
another water source. In other cases where the problem does not seriously
affect health such as hardness in water and a moderate degree of salinity no
treatment is generally recommended.
19.       Where iron and manganese are present in large quantities and no
alternative feasible water source is available, removable of iron and
manganese is done. The process involves aerating the water by spraying or
dripping down aeration towers to oxidize the iron and manganese. The
precipitated iron and manganese oxides are then removed by sedimentation and
filtration. In certain waters the acidity in the water can be raised by the



39 -                                 ANNEX 1
Page 8
chemical reaction and lime has to be added to reduce acidity and to aid
precipitation.
20.       Removal of fluoride for water supply is still in an experimental
stage. Although a number of processes are known that can remove fluoride
effectively, the cost of such processes is too high to allow application for
treatment in small rural water supply systems or of Large quantities of water
such as that needed for municipal water supply. Processes which have been
successful in removing fluorides are of two types: (a) the surface adsorption
process, and (b) the chemical precipitation process. In the former process
the water is passed through a bed of activated alumina (or calcium phosphate,
activated carbon, bone black), and the fluoride compound is adsorbed on the
surface of the activated alumina particles. As the activated alumina loses
its adsorption power with use it is re-activated by washing with a strong
solution of aluminum sulphate. The second process involves the precipitation
of the fluoride by the addition of aluminum chLoride, aluminum sulphate or
other appropriate chemical reagents.
21.       A low-priced household unit using the surface adsorption process has
recently been developed in China to remove fluoride for small quantities of
water. The unit is made of plastic and together with the activated alumina is
priced at Y 60 (US$24), and will be adequate to supply fluoride-free drinking
water for a family of four (high fluoride water can be used for other house-
hold purposes without affecting health). An additional cost of Y 6 (US$2.40)
per month will be needed for the purchase of aluminum sulphate required to re-
activate the alumina.  A major concern of the Institute of Health in Beijing
which is responsible for testing and approving these units is the proper use
and maintenance of these units by the rural population. Without proper care
the resulting water from these units may turn out to be more deleterious than
the untreated water.  An effective means for educating the user in the proper
use of the unit has still to be worked out.
Energy Supply
22.       Eighty six percent of the rural areas of China have electricity as
do all of the villages in the project. But the supply to about 30X of the
villages is not adequate to cope with the additional loads from the proposed
treatment plants or pumping stations. Additional transmission lines will have
to be constructed for these villages from the power grid systems in the
provinces. To obtain a power supply the villages are required to pay to the
power authority a capacity charge the rate for which varies from province to
province. This charge, which is intended to cover the cost of the system
capacity required to meet the new load, has been included in the project
cost. The various provincial and county offices will advise the power
authority early of their power requirements so that steps can be taken for the
power demands of the various subprojects to be met when the plants are ready
for commissioning.

Page 9
Sanitation
23.       Human excreta in rural communities is normally disposed of in on-
site facilities. Commonly used facilities are dry latrines or bucket
latrines. With the latter facilities the excreta is normally collected and
emptied, together with animal and poultry waste, into digestion pools or
biogas generators. The digested sludge is applied to the fields as fertiLizer
and the generated gas is used for cooking and lighting. For houses located
close to a fish pond outhouses overhanging the pond are often constructed at
the pond's edge, and fresh excreta is then allowed to drop directly into the
pond and used as feed for fish. The arrangements for exreta disposal are
generally satisfactory for rural communities in China, although some improve-
ments can be made to these facilities to reduce odor and insect problems.
24.       Rural wastewater consists mainly of kitchen, bath and laundry water,
and is therefore classified as suLlage or grey water. Kitchen water is often
used for watering animals. Where water use is small, as in the case of public
standpipe service, bath and wash water can be adequateLy disposed of by appli-
cations to garden plots or simply spreading over soil in front or back
yards. Where water usage is higher the sullage water is allowed to drain
through open channels to a soakaway pit or to street drains outside the house
to be conveyed to the fields for final disposal. This arrangement appears at
present to be satisfactory.

RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Role of WFP Food Aid and Justification of WFP Involvement
1.        The World Food Program (WFP) is expected to participate in the
proposed rural water supply project in a significant manner by providing food
aid in the form of wheat to the two provinces of Liaoning and Shaanxi. The
provinces of Liaoning and Shaanxi requested food aid to pay for part of the
costs of labor in the construction of rural water supply systems and comple-
mentary activities, in particular, tree planting and road construction, which
would help the general ecology and protect water sources (in the case of
trees) and provide access to water works and promote other community economic
activities (in the case of roads).
2.        WFP food rations will be given as assistance to the participating
rural workers who would be asked to provide the required labor and to addi-
tional workers from outside these villages. WFP contributions would also
serve to reduce the monetary contributions by individuals to the total invest-
ment costs on constructing waterworks thereby making the water systems easier
to afford. WFP contributions of $10.53 million would be equivalent to about
10% of the costs of the projects in Liaoning and Shaanxi (para. 5), were
calculated according to normal WFP methodology (para. 6), and would reduce
individuals contributions to the project by about 50% from $21.01 million to
$10.48 million (para. 9).
3.        Because of WFP's overall resource constraints and because of the
Covernment's desire to implement other food-for-work projects elsewhere in
China, only two of the five project provinces included in the IDA funded rural
water supply project would receive WFP assistance. These provinces were given
priority for the following reasons:
(a) The five project counties in Shaanxi province have the lowest
average net annual income per capita among all the rural co0 m ities
included in the IDA funded project, receiving Y L65.2 ($66.3)- as
compared with the average of Y 224.8 ($89.9) of the project counties
in the other provinces;
(b) The costs of water supply systems per capita for the project
counties in Liaoning were the highest of all counties because of the
need to sink very deep wells in certain areas to obtain water of
satisfactory quality. The per capita investment for the project
villages in Liaoning has been estimated at Y 74.0 ($29.5) compared
with a per capita investment of Y 64.4 ($25.8) in other project
villages of the provinces; and
1/   In this Annex an exchange rate of US$1 = Y 2.5 is used.

ANNEX 5
Page 2
(c) All of the project counties of Liaoning and Shaanxi are short of
basic grains, and have had to resort to importing grains, an average
of 63,000 tons per year for the counties in Liaoning and 49,000 tons
per year for the counties in Shaanxi for the period 1975-83.
4.        The water supply systems in the Liaoning and Shaanxi would benefit a
total of 2.62 million persons (or 44% of the total number of persons who will
benefit from the IDA-funded project). The total number of participating
villages would be 1,582 (out of a total of 4,650 villages in the entire
project) in 10 project counties.
Project Cost Estimates
5.        The estimated cost for water supply works for the two provinces has
been calculated at $97.3 million (or 46.7Z of total project cost for the
entire RWS project). The cost for Liaoning is estimated at $48.0 miLlion and
for Shaanxi at $49.4 million, respectively (see Annex 3 for detailed Project
cost.)
World Food Program
6.        WFP food aid for China will provide 3.25 kg. of grain per manday of
work. Based on the official prices of wheat of Y 0.34/kg in Liaoning and
Y 0.33/kg in Shaanxi, the WFP daily food ration has a value of Y1.105 for
Liaoning and Y1.073 for Shaanxi, respectively. This would imply that the food
allowance would constitute 55% of the average daily wage for unskilled labor
of Y 2.02 in Liaoning and 68% of the average wage of Y 1.57 in Shaanxi.
Manday rates for specific work activities have been determined by each of the
provinces according to work norms for construction projects in the provinces
and these work norms have been found acceptable by WFP. Detailed estimates of
nandays are presented in Attachment 1, and the following table summarizes the
total number of workdays for Liaoning and Shaanxi, respectively. The mandays
would imply 35,024.3 tons of wheat for Liaoning and 43,708.3 tons of wheat for
Shaanxi.

7.        Food aid would be administered jointly by the Ministry of Agricul-
ture, Forestry, Fishery, and Animal Husbandry; the National Project Office and
the County Project Offices; the local food bureaus; and the food supply cen-
ters at the village level. The Wheat is provided to the provinces by WFP free
of charge at the ports of entry, Dalian for Liaoning and Lianyun for Shaanxi.
Loading and unloading, transportation, storage, and distribution, and manage-
ment costs are paid for by the provincial and county governments. Details of
implementation for WFP food aid are included in Attachment 2.
Financing Plan and Impact of WFP Assistance
B.        Proposed WFP contributions of $10.53 million equivalent would
provide about 10.8% of the total cost of project works in Liaoning and
Shaanxi, and would reduce individuals' monetary contributions from 23.4% and
19.7%, respectively, to 13.5Z and 8.0%, respectively, of the cost of project
works in the two provinces. The financing plan would be as follows:

RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Role of WFP Food Aid and Justification of WFP Involvement
Implementation Arrangements for World Food Program (WFP) Food Aid
L.        In requesting for food aid, each of the Provincial Project Offices
of the Provinces of Liaoning and Shaanxi has prepared a "Plan to Receive Food
Donated by WFP in the Rural Water Supply Project". This plan sets out the
names of the project counties in the Province, and the amounts in the years
1985, 1986, and 1987, during which the food is to be distributed, based on the
estimated progress of the water systems in the Province construction. Copies
of this plan are provided to the National Project Office (NPO), the Provincial
Food Bureau (PFB), and the County Project Offices (CPOs).
2.        WFP provides food (in the form of wheat to the Provinces) free of
charge at the ports of entry, Dalian for Liaoning and Lianyun for Shaanxi.
When the food aid arrives at a province or a county, the food bureaus at the
provinciai or the county levels are notified of the food arrival, and the food
bureaus are responsible and bear the costs for the receiving, storing and
managing, and transportation of the food. They are also responsible for
distributing the food to the food centers at the next lower level, i.e. to the
county food bureaus (for the provincial food bureau) and to the village food
centers (for the county food bureaus). During the process of distributing
food, each of the provincial food bureaus would keep track of food distributed
to the counties and the county food bureaus would keep track of food
distributed to the village food centers. Copies of reports on how food is
distributed as follows:
one copy to the next higher level project office, one copy to the same
level project office, and one copy to the project county food bureau or
the village food center.
3.        The units responsible for construction at the village level would
draw up a list of names of the food beneficiaries, and the amount of food each
beneficiary would be entitled to based on established work norms and actual
work accomplished. Three copies of this list are provided to the CPO for
subsequent audit by the CPU. After the audit, the CPO retains one copy, sends
one copy to the construction unit, and one to the village food distribution
center to authorize it to distribute food.
4.        While drawing up the list of proposed food beneficiaries, the
construction unit also issues food cards to the village workers. The villages
would use the card as identification to claim food from the village food
centers. At the back of card, the amount of food distributed and received is
attested to by the food center and the recipient by affixing their name chops
when food is actually distributed.

5.        Simultaneously, when distributing food, the village food center
records how much food is distributed to whom based on how much work is
completed, over which time period, and the recipient of food aid signs his
name, signifying that he has received the food. A copy of this record is sent
to the CPO.
6.        Each food distribution center will prepare a report on how food is
distributed. Each county project office collects and aggregates the reports
of the villages, and prepares a report for the province. The Provincial
Project Office (PPO) aggregates county information and sends it to the NPO and
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and Animal Husbandry
(MAFFAH), The NPO aggregates the information from the two provinces and sends
the information to WFP and the MAFFAH. IDA would require that this report
also be sent as part of the six-monthly progress report for the IDA-funded
project.

Training Program
Rationale and Purpose
1.        The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee (CPHCC) is the
coordinating body for the UN Drinking Water Decade activities in China.
China's tentative target is to supply about 80% of its rural population with
safe water by 1990. This target would be met in large part by programs
organized at the province and county levels, with major financial and
organizational inputs by the villages.
2.        As the institutional structure for the water supply program is
developed key elements need to be in place. The most important of these is
trained manpower to design, develop, construct, operate and maintain water
systems. China must develop this manpower and the training structure and also
institutions if it is to meet its goals. CurrentLy, training institutions
with specific programs and curricula designed to meec the needs of water-
supply development do not exist in China.
3.        The training component's strategy would be to first set up a
project-specific training system to meet the immediate training needs for the
project and to develop key personnel and essential curricula, training
materials and training procedures. At the same time, it would form the basis
for future expansion to additional counties, provinces, and peopLe, in
training (in terms of numbers) and to strengthen and influence the future
direction of sector training. In the initial five project provinces, sector-
related training institutions (such as technical institutes) would be used
extensively to form a part of the initial project training system.
Major Objectives
4.        The major goals of the training component are:
(a) establishing, equipping, and staffing training units at the National
Project Office (NPO of CPHCC), five provincial project offices
(PPOs), and 25 county project offices (CPOs);
(b) establishing, equipping, and staffing two national training centers,
one in Liaoning and one in Hebei;
(c) establishing two county-level practical skills training sites for
water plant operators in each of the five project provinces;
(d) training and establishing a core group of 15 human resources
development officers (HRDs), who will guide the development of the
training system;

Page 2
(e)  training trainers who will staff the national provincial, and
county-level training institutions in practicaL training methods;
(f) developing a series of training materials, training manuals, and
training curricula for national, provincial, and county water supply
training institutions; and
(g)  training water supply project personnel:  580 at the national level,
1,174 at the provincial level, and 3,500 at the county level during
the first two years of the training.
Inputs/Activities
5.        In order to achieve the purposes of the training component, a series
of project inputs would be needed. These inputs are divided into: (1)
project commodities (training equipment, training support materials, training
facilities, and vehicles); (2) technical assistance; (3) training activlties
(conducting craining classes, trainee travel and per diem, lodging, instruc-
tors, training management); and (4) overseas training.
(a)  Training Commodities:  The training equipment lists (faciLities
needed, vehicles, laboratory equipment) have been drawn up, and
Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) procurement procedures, wouLd be
used for the procurement of equipment using FRG financing. These
procedures wouLd be specified in the project agreement between the
FRG and PRC for the training component. All equipment purchased
wouLd require locally available service facilities. The computers
purchased for the national training centers would be required to be
of the same type and with software compatible to the computers which
are procured for use in the project offices using funds from other
donors or lenders. In general, investment for training buildings,
facilities and furniture would be made by local contribution;
payment for new laboratory equipment, computers, training audio-
visual equipment, and vehicles would be made by foreign
contribution.
(b) Technical Assistance. Technical assistance would consist of
training specialists, technical specialist for curriculum review,
and a computer training specialist. The total time for technical
assistance would consist of 14 man-months over the two-year period
as follows:

(c) Training Activities. Training activities inc.ude provision of
instructor, trainee travel, lodging, training management and
conducting of training sessions.
Cd) Overseas Training. Overseas training is intended to further develop
the ability of trainers and HRD officers to understand recent trends
in water supply project engineering, administration, water quality
control, operations and maintenance, and training technology, and
would consist of: (a) either a four week study tour (four study
tours are scheduled for the first year during implementation of the
Eraining component and five for the second year); or (b) a one year
internship (two internships are scheduled for the first year and two
for second year). Individuals selected for the one year internships
are required to speak enough of the foreign language of the selected
country (or English if this is an acceptable second language of the
country) to be able to learn. To this end the FRG would concur in
candidate selection, and the FRC would arrange study tours and
internships.
Organization and Implementation
6.        Training would be carried out by the NPO Training Unit, the 'ational
Training Centers, the PPO Training Centers, and the CPO Training Centers, as
follows:
(a) NPO Training Unit. Overall management of project implementation is
under the guidance of the training unit of the liPO.  This unit,
headed by a chief training officer, is responsible for establishment
and oversight of all project activi:ies, including setting up and
accreditation of national and provincial training centers,
organizing the training of trainers program, coordination of the
materials development program and project commodity and technical
assistance inputs. This unit would also coordinate overseas
training, and be resp^nsible for project budget management and
reporting to IDA and the FRG.



-63 -                           ANNEX 6
Page 4
(b) The National Training Centers. The two national training centers
would be responsible for training staff from the NPO, the PPOs, and
selected individuals from the CPOs and water plant operators from
large water plants. They would be responsible for curriculum
development for national-level training and provide leadership to
the provincial training centers in training trainers and materials
development. They would coordinate with the training unit of the
NPO to organize technology transfer to other educational institu-
tions in the sector.
(c) The PPO Training Units. These units would organize, manage, and
coordinate provincial training resources and guide and supervise the
establishment of the provincial training centers. They would be
responsible for training the staff, trainers and HRD officers from
the county project offices.
(d) The CPO Training Officers. They would develop training plans, under
the supervision of the PPO training units, for village-level water
plant operators and manage the county training sites and training
programs. They would be responsible for selecting carnidates for
training from water projects in communities and oversight of plant
operator certification.
7.        The implementation schedule for the training component contains a
start-up phase of approximately six months. These start-up activities are
intended to take place in mid 1985. All other activities are for a two year
training component cycle and corresp3nd to major outputs and inputs of the
training component.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements
8.        The training unit of the NPO would be responsible for collecting
project data and summarizing it for project reports. A progress report would
be submitted to the FRC and IDA every six months beginning December 1985 which
details: (a) disbursements for the training component; (b) number of persons
trained at the various levels; (c) major events, successes and problems of the
craining component. During the last six monchs of the second year of the
project, the German Government will conduct an evaluation of the training
component and initiate phase II training component design process with the
CPHCC.
Budget Summary
9.        The total cost of the training component has been estimated to be
$3,926,000 equivalent. Of the total project costs, the contribution by PRC is
projected to be $2,426,357 equivalent. This represents 62% of total costs of
the training component. The request for funding from the FRG for the training
component is $1,500,000 equivalent. This represents 38Z of total project
costs. Cost estimates are based upon current catalogue prices for equipment
and current local costs for commodities, travel, per diem, etc. Overseas
training is based upon current WHO estimates for internships. External
assistance is based upon current international rates per man-month. The
budget summary is presented in the Table below.

CHINA
RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Subproject Planning, Criteria for Subproject Review and Approval
(to be used to prepare Schedule to Project Agreement)
1.        Subprojects will be planned in accordance with the Rural Water
SuppLy Planning Manual of June 1984. Particular attention will be given to:
-    consulting with village leadership when planning subprojects,
and informing them of the expected capital and recurrent costs,
and their obLigations with regards to finance, construction and
operations;
-    generally using the per-capita water use estimates for the
design of system capacities as given in the Planning Manual,
but with deviations where justified by special circumstances;
-    designing systems to serve more than one village where
technically feasible and economical;
-    considering ground water as the generally preferred source
thereby minimizing operational difficulties and costs of water
treatment; and
-    the use of standard designs where feasible.
2.        The Planning Manual will be revised and updated in consultation with
IDA by June 1987 in light of experience.
3.        A design report!/ will be prepared for each subproject which will:
-    provide population and water consumer data;
-    describe the present water supply situation and problems;
-    describe viable alternatives and compare their life cycle
costs;
-    present detailed estimates of capital and operating costs for
the least cost, technically suitable alternative;
-    present a financing plan and schedule;
-    contain a bill of quantities and construction schedule; and
1/   For a sample design report, see Attachment 1 to this Annex.  Attachment 1
would not be included in the Schedule to the Project Agreement.



- 69-                             ANNEX 8
Page 2
-    analyze per capita cost and capital cost as a percentage of net
per capita income.
4.        Before the construction of any subproject can start the design
report would be reviewed. Construction is authorized if the report has demon-
strated appropriate source selection, least cost design, adequate financing,
and affordability. Otherwise the subproject would have to be redesigned. The
procedures for approval will 7e as described in the regulations of the Provin-
cial and Central Governments2 . All subprojects would be reviewed by the
County Project Office. Additional reviews would be conducted:
(a) by the competent PPO and its advisers as necessary if:
-    capital costs exceed Y 200,000 for Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan,
Zhe,iang; or
-    capital cost exceeds Y 80 per person for Liaoning, Shaanxi and
Zhejiang or Y 90 for Beijing and Sichuan; or
-    per capita recurrent (operation, maintenance and debt service)
costs exceed 3% of net per capita income for Beijing or 4% for
the other provinces.
(b) by the NPO (or its consultants) and IDA31if:
capital costs exceed Y 500,000; or
-    capital cost exceed Y 100 per person; or
=    per capital recurrent costs exceed 5  of net per capital
income.
5.        Subprojects whose capital costs exceed Y 120 per person, or where
per capita recurrent costs exceed 6% of net per capita income, will only be
constructed under exceptional circumstances which have to be justified.
6.        The criteria of paras. 4 and 5 will be reviewed from time to time in
consultation with IDA and may be revised in light of experience.
7.        The Provincial and County Project Offices will keep a file of design
reports for all projects in their jurisdiction, whether or not the subproject
is subject to review. NPO and IDA will have the right to review these
reports.
2/   Drafts of these regulations have been reviewed by the IDA Appraisal
mission, which has provided comments. The regulations are being revised
by government and would be discussed further during the next mission.
3/   IDA will also review procurement documents as set forth in the
Procurement Schedule.

8.        Each subproject entity will enter into a subloan agreement-  with
the province which will contain:
A.   The commitments of the subproject entity to:
-    repay the loan in 10 years including 2 years grace (except
where these loan repayment terms would not be affordable,
in which case the repayment period may be extended for a
period not to exceed 15 years);
-    provide its share of the capitaL funding as stipulated;
-    provide Labor for construction as stipulated;
-    keep adequate accounting records and submit to periodic
audits;
-    satisfactorily operate and maintain the facilities;
-    appoint suitably qualified operators and managers and have
them participate in appropriate training courses; and
-    provide or generate funds sufficient to cover operations
and maintenance costs and to repay the loan.
B.   The commitment of the province to:
-    provide its share (and ensure that the county would
provide its share) of the capital funding as stipulated;
and
-    provide training for operators and managers.
9.        Subprojects which are to be financed by the provincial revolving
funds would be subjected to the same procedures and conditions described in
paras. 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, with the exception that IDA woLLd not review the
subproject reports.
4/   For a sample subloan agreement, see Annex 4.

RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Monitoring Indicators
1.        The project entails a large number of subprojects (about 3,900) of
diverse systems and varying complexity spread over a Large geographical
area. To ensure successful project iv')lementation, both the National Project
Office (NPO) and IDA would require a good set of indicators to monitor the
progress of project implementation. Moreover, due to the sectoral nature of
the project, the development of institutional capabilities is critical to the
project's success. IDA has deveLoped five key monicoring indicators, as
follows: (a) physical progress reports. both for piped systems and for
individual syscems; (b) status of internationally competitively bid (ICB)
contracts, and since IDA funds will be used almost exclusively co .und !CB
procured goods, this would also indicate the status of use of IDA funds; (c)
status of civil works contracts; (d) total staffing strengths of the project
offices at the national, provincial, and county levels; and (e) training.
These key monitoring indicators will be reported to IDA by NPO beginning
August 31, 1985, as part of the semi-annual reporting requiremencs for the
project. The formats for these semi-annual progress reports will be agreed
during negotiations.
2.        The monitoring indicators and their format are attached in che
following Tables. Table l would report on the physical progress of piped
water systems and for individual systems as of reporting date, as follows:

CHINA
RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Typical Costs ant Affordability
1.        Tariff Policy.  The tariff policy in China for rural water supply is
that users have to pay for the water they get at a rate that will fully cover
operating and maintenance costs, in addition to debt service while the loan is
being repaid or reasonable depreciation of fixed assets after the loan has
been repaid. The tariffs would be paid directly by the households, or by the
collective or work unit through deductions from the share of collective income
scheduled to be distributed to the households, or a combinatior of the two.
2.        Construction Costs.  There are a variety of rural water supply
systems in the project, ranging from piped water systems, using surface water,
spring water or well water as sources, to individual systems using handpumps
or rainwater collection systems. The construction costs vary from county to
county and are dependent on the type of water systems constructed. The
average per capita construction costs range from Y41 in the case of spring
water piped systems (without treatment) to Y75 in the case of surface water
piped systems (with treatment) (see Table 1).
3.        Operating Costs.  The typical average operating expenses for the
different systems vary from a high of YO.135 per ton of water for piped
surface to YO.02 per ton of water for handpumps and water cellars. Detail
operating expenses for typical water systems in the various provinces are
shown in Table 2.
4.        Affordability.  The systems that will be selected for the various
villages would be chosen so that the villages would be able to pay for both
the construction and operating costs of their water systems. If a proposed
system is found during planning to be not affordable, then the system design
would be changed or the normal loan repayment period would be extended so that
the affordability criterion would be met. The typical designs would be t'e
least cost alte-native, based on the planning and design manuals.
5.        There is little quantifiable information regarding willingness to
pay for water in rural areas in China. However, in China people have come to
expect to pay the full costs of the facilities. In the five project provinces
there have been numerous improvements undertaken, especially since 1979, and
for these the beneficiaries typically paid about 90% of the capital costs as
they were incurred. Under this project the people will participate in the
planning, including the financial planning, for their tubproject. They will
know in advance what their financial obligations will be, and will have the
power of veto, requesting redesign for lower cost or requesting a longer loan
payment period.
6.        To ensure that the facilities to be constructed under the project
could be afforded under the proposed tariff policy simulations were carried
out under varying assumptions for village income, capital costs and operating

costs (Table 3). These show that on average affordability will not be a
problem. Using 3Z (3, 4 and sometimes 5% are values commonly used worldwide
to test if consumers can afford water supply service) of income as appropriate
expenditure level for water supply, the simuLations flag only very low income
villages (with annual per capita incomes of about Y 100) as having potential
problems if they were to finance higher cost schemes such as surface water
with treatment. eor villages at these income levels lower cost options, such
as hand pumps and rainwater catchment systems, are well within financial
reach. Were 4% used as an appropriate expenditure level, even the poorest of
villages would be considered able to afford piped well water.
7.        Since system costs vary from place to place, affordability will be
tested for each subproject, reported in the design report, and be a parameter
which wouLd trigger reviews by provincial level committees and the NPO.
