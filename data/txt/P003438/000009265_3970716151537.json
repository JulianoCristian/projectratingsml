objectives of the Rural Water Supply\n            Project are to build water supply facilities and to develop\n            and strengthen systems, institutions and technology for the\n            implementation of China's rural water supply program.\n            The project will provide safe drinking water to some six\n            million people in 4,650 villages of 25 counties located in\n            the provinces of Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Zhejiang and\n            the municipality of Beijing.  The types of water systems\n            range from handpumps and rainwater storage tanks to pumped\n            and piped systems (including some with treatment) with\n            standpipes or house connections, dependent upon\n            environmental and economic conditions.  The institutional\n            component of the project includes:  (i) the development of\n            management and monitoring systems as well as regulations for\n            revolving funds, construction and operations.  This\n            component further involves; (ii) the preparation of design,\n            construction and operation manuals; and (iii) a training\n            program for trainers, planners, engineers, technicians and\n            operators at the national, provincial, county and village levels."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
