OED rates the outcome of the\n            Bank's assistance, moderately satisfactory, with\n            sustainability likely because of strong government support.\n            Institutional development impact is rated modest. Both Bank\n            and Borrower performances are considered satisfactory. The\n            report makes these six recommendations: 1) Demand management\n            should always precede supply increases and investments in\n            wastewater treatment. 2) Set tariffs to reflect future total\n            costs and create incentives for billing and collecting those\n            higher tariffs. 3) Build and support autonomous utilities.\n            4) Enhance the level of self-financing. 5) Mitigate risk and\n            improve efficiency through regulation. 6) Enable greater\n            private sector participation."}, "docdt": "2002-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
