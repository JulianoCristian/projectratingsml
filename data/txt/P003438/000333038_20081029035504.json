The RWS\n            program consisted of four successive projects (Rural Water\n            Supply Project, National Rural Supply Project, National\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and Forth Rural Water\n            and Sanitation Project) that lasted over the last 17 years.\n            The total World Bank investment in these four projects was\n            US$628 million. The program succeeded at serving about 25\n            million people in 18 provinces and developed a very\n            effective cost recovery policy where the users finance up to\n            75 percent of the capital investment as well as the full\n            operation and maintenance (O&M) cost. With the World\n            Bank assistance, the RWS programs were designed to increase\n            rural access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation.\n            The first project was not specifically targeted at the poor\n            or based completely in rural areas, but both these policies\n            changed in succeeding projects. Within the selected\n            counties, denser areas were chosen to make the cost of\n            supplying piped water economically viable, and within the\n            selected villages, the network aimed to cover all economic\n            sections of the community. For the more remote and less\n            densely populated areas of the project provinces, the\n            approach was to provide hand pumps, rainwater collection\n            systems and small tube wells."}, "docdt": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
