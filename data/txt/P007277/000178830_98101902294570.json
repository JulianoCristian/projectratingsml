{"cdata!": "The project would: (a) continue and\n            expand the Association's assistance in support of\n            Haiti's efforts to correct inequalities in access to\n            primary education, and to improve its relevance and internal\n            efficiency, and (b) increase the supply of skilled and\n            semi-skilled industrial workers, agricultural extension\n            agents and rural community development agents. On\n            completion, the project would provide physical facilities\n            for about 19,500 primary school students and would improve\n            the quality of primary education for more than 300,000\n            children in grades 1-4 in public schools. A UNDP grant of\n            about US$0.5 million would help finance part of the\n            technical assistance component. Project risks concerning\n            financing of recurrent costs generated by the project would\n            be minimized by proposed assurances providing for the\n            allocation of sufficient funds for maintenance and operating\n            costs, adoption of improved conditions of teacher service\n            and reforms in the fiscal sector. Improved conditions of\n            teacher service would help to attract and retain qualified teachers."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
