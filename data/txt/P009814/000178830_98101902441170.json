        will complete the Periyar Vaigai Irrigation Project (Cr.\n            720-IN), extend its irrigable area (73,600 ha) by another\n            7,500 ha and maximize crop production and farmers'\n            incomes in the 81,100 ha project area through better water\n            utilization. To achieve these objectives, the project will:\n            (i) improve an equitable and reliable water supply in the\n            command area; and (ii) improve water distribution among\n            farmers below the 10 ha block outlets and promote better\n            water management on the farm. This will require a number of\n            complementary activities, including strengthening of the\n            project organization for operation and maintenance, on-farm\n            development, introduction of rotational water supply below\n            the block outlet, establishment of farmer organizations, and\n            training of project staff and farmers in new management\n            practices. As this is an integral part of a continuing\n            project the risks are considered less than average for\n            irrigation projects of similar size and scope. Cost\n            estimates are firm as they are based on the experience of\n            the on-going project. Projections of yields are conservative\n            and are well within the reach of the average farmer's capability."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
