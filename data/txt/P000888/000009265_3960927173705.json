        investment, and raise national savings. The\n            Government's Letter of Development Policy and its\n            accompanying matrix of policy actions outlines a program of\n            actions designed to achieve these targets. These actions\n            focus on trade and exchange rate policy, tax policies and\n            administration, specific private sector development\n            initiatives, public expenditure management, State-owned\n            enterprise reforms, and civil service reforms. The proceeds\n            of the loan will be used exclusively to finance the foreign\n            exchange cost of eligible imports through the foreign\n            exchange auction in the Bank of Ghana (BOG). Except for a\n            few exclusions such as defense items, any imports will be\n            eligible for financing."}, "docdt": "1989-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
