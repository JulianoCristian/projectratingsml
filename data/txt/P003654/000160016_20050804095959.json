sustainability is likely; institutional\n            development impact is substantial; Bank performance is\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            Several lessons were gleaned from this project including: 1)\n            The experience of this project is that preparation of a\n            bi-provincial highway project consumes about the same\n            resources (in terms of staff weeks and budget) as two\n            separate one-province highway projects. Coordination between\n            Guangdong and Hunan was complicated because Hunan was a\n            first time Bank highway borrower, while for Guangdong it was\n            the second experience. Better information exchanges between\n            provinces could have accelerated the Hunan procurement of\n            electrical and mechanical equipment. 2) With hindsight, the\n            project was approved with insufficient attention paid to\n            surveys and design. 3) While improvements in overweight\n            enforcement will limit the degree of overloading, there are\n            additional measures that should in the future be implemented\n            at the design stage to improve the safety of new roads.\n            Working with the Ministry of Communications to update design\n            standards, improving training of designers, and implementing\n            proper design safety audits would significantly improve the\n            safety situation on similar projects. 4) There was pressure\n            to complete work, which led to the project specifying very\n            tight schedules in its contracts, often necessitating\n            extensions. It also affected quality. It is important to\n            adopt sensible schedules for construction, especially when\n            the terrain is complex. 5) Lastly, it is necessary to\n            carefully review the class and designs of the\n            interconnecting roads to ensure that they are sufficient to\n            meet the likely traffic demand from the expressway."}, "docdt": "2005-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
