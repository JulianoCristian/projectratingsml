presents an environmental\n            assessment of the Second National Highway Project of China.\n            The section under environmental impact analysis is a\n            four-lane, 169km total access controlled expressway linking\n            the towns of Xiangtan and Leiyang, which is to be\n            constructed between 1996 and 1999.  The three phases of\n            project implementation are design, construction, and\n            operation.  For each of these phases the potential impacts\n            on the environment have been examined, with special\n            consideration paid to the areas of ecological protection,\n            soil erosion, leakage of hazardous materials, flood control,\n            maintenance of drainage systems, waste management, vehicle\n            management, land occupation, resettlement of occupants,\n            cultural relic preservation, and noise, water and\n            atmospheric pollution.  Mitigation measures have been\n            developed to prevent and combat potential adverse\n            environmental effects of the project.  These are included in\n            plans of environmental management, supervision, monitoring,\n            and action, which will require the participation of both the\n            government and the public.  It has been concluded by this\n            environmental assessment that the environment will suffer no\n            serious consequences as a result of the project.  It states\n            that all adverse impacts can be mitigated or eliminated by\n            implementing the environmental protection measures."}, "docdt": "1995-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
