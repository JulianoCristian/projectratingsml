Lessons emphasize that for a project to\n            succeed, government support is required, through new\n            transparent regulations, and as in this case, through\n            revision, and approval of forest management plans, and\n            technical assistance provision. The Government still needs\n            to create an enabling environment, with the proviso that\n            commercial decisions on fuel-wood arrangements be left to\n            private economic agents. Also essential is project ownership\n            by the communities, to be achieved by involving local\n            participants in most aspects of the project : currently,\n            villagers are not only encouraged to actively participate in\n            the sustained use of forest areas, but are given exclusive\n            user rights over the land. Furthermore, project support\n            should provide basic management, and accounting training, so\n            that villagers become responsible for dispute settlements\n            regarding ownership rights of forest areas. This may also\n            induce villagers to establish rural markets, for only if\n            benefits are clear to them, will they do so. Institutional\n            capacity to enforce tax collection should be enhanced,\n            suggested to be collected at the village level, by a private\n            subcontractor, while distorted fiscal incentives should be removed."}, "docdt": "2001-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
