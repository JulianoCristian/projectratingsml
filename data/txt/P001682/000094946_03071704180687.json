Project sustainability is\n            non-evaluable at this stage. Bank performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory because project design had significant\n            shortcomings despite the long preparation period, and\n            supervision was also wanting on several fronts. Borrower\n            performance is rated satisfactory. This project offeres\n            several lessons for similar interventions in Mali and\n            elsewhere, among them: 1) The importance of budgeting\n            adequate time and resources in a follow-on project to\n            consolidate the achievements and overcome the challenges of\n            the predecessor project cannot be overemphasized. 2) It is\n            important that appropriate incentives be provided to Bank\n            and Borrower project teams so that they design performance\n            indicators that monitor outcomes. Only then can effective\n            results be achieved. 3) Given the poverty alleviation\n            mandate of the Bank, in a Program of Targeted Intervention\n            it is important that development objectives be framed partly\n            in terms of poverty reduction. This should be done in a way\n            that is monitorable and should be backed up in a design by a\n            monitoring and evaluation system capable of measuring\n            poverty impact."}, "docdt": "2003-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
