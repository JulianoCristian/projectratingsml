          the Household Energy Project are the reduction of CO2\n            emissions, the abatement of forest resources depletion and\n            the increased participation of the private sector in the\n            management of household energy sector. The implementation\n            objectives of the project are to promote popular\n            participation in household energy activities, rational use\n            of household energy resources and improved end-use of\n            household fuels. Specific objectives are: 1) to create an\n            enabling regulatory and policy environment for project\n            implementation; 2) to provide technical assistance and\n            training to peasants, charcoal makers, producers and sellers\n            of stoves as well as urban consumers to respectively\n            efficiently harvest and carbonize fuelwood, to manage the\n            natural forest in a sustainable manner, to effectively\n            market new energy end-use equipment and to rationally use\n            improved biomass and kerosene stoves. The basic principle\n            underpinning this project is that the Government establishes\n            the policy environment, but commercial decisions are left to\n            private economic agents. The project will consist of two\n            main components covering demand and woodfuel supply of\n            household energy. The woodfuel supply component consists of\n            the following interventions: 1) design of woodfuel supply\n            master plans for the main towns and determine the maximum\n            annual sustainable wood supply in the catchment areas of the\n            towns concerned; 2) preparation of and assistance to\n            implement village forest management plans; 3)\n            identificaiton, design and implementation of an improved\n            carbonization program for local charcoalers; 4) provision of\n            institutional support for central and local government\n            authorities to help with project management and assist rural\n            communities in implementing their forest management plans;\n            and 5) launching of a comprehensive training, client\n            consultation, and Information, Education and Communication\n            (IEC) program on forest management. The demand side\n            component will consist of the following: 1) provision of\n            institutional support to help with project management and\n            private sector production; 2) identification, design and\n            assistance to implement a marketing program for the sale of\n            these improved biomass and kerosene stoves; 3) support for a\n            comprehensive IEC program and systematic consumer\n            consultation, executed by private sector operators, on the\n            importance of the rational use of energy through the\n            purchase and proper use of the improved stoves."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
