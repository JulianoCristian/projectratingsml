objective of the Economic Management\n            Capacity Building Project for Ghana is to support the\n            recipient to perform its role as a facilitator for economic\n            development through: (i) implementation by Ministries,\n            Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of a reform initiative for\n            improved public sector management and service delivery; and\n            (ii) strengthening of the governance and competitiveness of\n            the financial sector. This paper seeks approval from the\n            Country Director for a second-order restructuring plan for\n            the project based on the results of the midterm review\n            conducted in August 2009, and the slower than anticipated\n            implementation pace thereafter. The restructuring will allow\n            refocusing the activities on outstanding priorities, and\n            improving overall project implementation performance. The\n            closing date of the project, originally set for June 30,\n            2011, will be extended by 18 months, until December 30, 2012."}, "docdt": "2011-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
