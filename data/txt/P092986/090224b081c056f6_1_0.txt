                         approved on November 15, 2005 for USD25 million. The project attained effectiveness on March 27, 2006. The Project Development Objective has two key elements: (i)
                         implementation of a reform initiative for improved public sector management and service delivery; and (ii) strengthening of the governance and competitiveness of the financial sector.
                         Progress towards achievement of the PDO is rated as MODERATELY SATISFACTORY.

                         RELEVANCE: Improving the management and service delivery capacity of the public service, and the governance and competitiveness of the financial sector were key priorities for
                         the Government and the Bank at project commencement. On the public sector reform front, the Government signaled a new approach in 2004 with the release of the strategy
                         document "Towards a New Public Service for Ghana: a Working Document," with the new position of Minister of State for Public Sector Reform established and later converted into a
                         full Ministry. With regard to the financial sector, Cabinet approved the Financial Sector Strategic Plan in 2003. While significant progress had also been made in implementing the
                         recommendations of the 2001 FSAP and 2003 FSAP update, many identified weaknesses remained by the time of project launch. The importance of these issues was also
                         recognized at the time by both Government and Development Partners by the inclusion of key policy actions for both public sector and financial sector reform within the Multi-Donor
                         Budget Support Framework - as the Country Assistance Strategy outlined, the EMCB project was needed to support these objectives with targeted capacity building assistance.

                         In May 2008 Additional Financing of USD10m was approved in support of a more ambitious program of pensions sector and civil service reform. A Level II restructuring of the project
                         was approved in June 2011, extending the project by 18 months, with a view to closing the Public Sector Reform Component, and refocusing activities around priority areas identified
                         by the 2010 FSAP. Subsequently, significant delays were experienced with regard to confirming that the Government had met its obligations for the retrenchment program under the
                         PSR component. This led in October 2012 to an additional Level II restructuring and the approval of a further five month project extension. Key areas of focus were to undertake
                         preparatory activities in support of the new Financial Sector Strategic Plan II; bond market development; and preparation and launch of the Capital Market Working Committee.

                         EFFICACY: All four of the PDO indicators were met or exceeded: a new pay range was established for the public service, the percentage growth in the number of deposit accounts at
                         Rural and Community Banks and commercial banks was almost 50% higher than targeted (14.5% vs 10% target for 2012); the percentage increase in private sector savings/GDP
                         ratio was more than double the targeted increase at project close (54.3% vs 22%); and the percentage increase in private sector credit (including bonds)/GDP ratio at project close
                         was over 40% more than targeted (38.6% vs 27% target). Nevertheless, the degree to which these indicators, together with the intermediate indicators, adequately track achievement
                         of the PDO ('implementation of a reform initiative for improved public sector management and service delivery" and "strengthening of the governance and competitiveness of the
                         financial sector") is questionable - hence the moderately satisfactory rating. At the level of intermediate indicators, outcomes were mixed. For the Public Sector Reform component,
                         key achievements included the establishment of enhanced structure and strategy to drive the public sector reform program; the successful retrenchment of staff from 4 subvented
                         agencies; the submission of a revised Civil Service law to Cabinet; almost 100% of public servants remunerated on the basis of a unified national pay spine; and the publishing by
                         122 MDAs of service standards. For the Financial Sector Reform Component, the framework for pension reform was designed and promulgated, and is now in operation;
                         dematerialized trading has commenced on the Ghana Stock Exchange; and the percentage of banks and NBFIs supervised based upon an agreed template rose to 100%.

                         PROJECT DISBURSEMENTS: At the time of the final ISR just over $2m of the total $42.6m project funds remained undisbursed. Of this, $209,958 is due to be refunded to SECO
                         after the closure of the SECO Trust Fund on April 30. Changes in staffing within the Ministry of Finance in early 2013 required changes in project signatories - these were delayed,
                         causing a backlog of invoices to be paid. This has now been rectified, and a further $500,000 in payments currently with the PIU will be disbursed. Completion of additional activities
                         prior to project close should see the undisbursed balance fall substantially below $1m by project close.

                         FIDUCIARY MANAGEMENT: Generally, and throughout implementation, the FM arrangements were considered adequate and met the minimum requirements of IDA. The projects
                         financial management arrangements over the years have been a combination of using country systems and also recruiting a Financial Management Consultant to support the
                         government staff. This arrangement has proved satisfactory since it allowed for the use of country systems where reliable and the flexibility of improving the system through using the
                         consultant. Overall the FM arrangement has improved significantly and consistently in recent years has been rated as Satisfactory and the Financial Management Risk, rated as
                         moderate. The satisfactory rating is due to the following, a good internal control environment, and competence of the accounting staff and the oversight role of the Ministry of Finance.

                         PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT: Project implementation is mainstreamed into the operations of the Financial Sector Division and the Public Sector Reform Secretariat.
                         Consequently, existing staff at the respective agencies have been assigned the responsibilities for the day to day project implementation. FSD-MOEFP has recruited a procurement
                         specialist to coordinate and supervise all procurement activities at the respective implementing agencies. Thus procurement under the project is handled by the various Implementing
                         Agencies, with supervision from the Procurement Specialist at the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) at the MOFEP. All documentation are submitted to the PIU who does Quality
                         control measures before forwarding these documents to the World Bank for its No objection if applicable. During the current period, the Post Procurement Review carried out in

                         December 2012 had the overall risk rating as SUBSTANTIAL, with Risk Rating of Procurement System being Moderate; Procurement Processes being Substantial; and Contract
                         Administration being Substantial. The mission indicated that the issues raised in the PPR, and the recommendations thereof, with regards to Procurement Planning, Bidding Records
                         Keeping, Evaluation, Awards and Contract implementation do not seem to be adequately and promptly addressed. Key shortfalls identified in procurement administration related
                         mainly to procurement processes (bidding, evaluation, and award) and contract management (non-compliance with contractual delivery schedules, output reporting schedules,

                         payment conditions). The mission had expected an improvement in procurement reporting, given that the project closure will require a thorough complete narration by the PS of the
                         procurement regime during the project life, and the rating has been downgraded as a consequence.

                         Overall Procurement Rating: Given that during the period under review, only a couple substantial prior review procurement had occurred couple with the above commentary it is
                         recommended that the overall procurement risk rating be MODERATE while the Procurement Performance rating is MODERATELY SATISFACTORY (MS).
