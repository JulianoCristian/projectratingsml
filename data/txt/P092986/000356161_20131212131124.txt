F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The proposed project aims at supporting the government to define and perform its role as
a facilitator for economic development. The project seeks to establish a level playing
field in the finance sector focusing upon outcomes rather than establishing new
institutions, together with a clear policy to improve the efficiency of public sector
management for an enhanced service delivery. The project, through support to FINSSP,
will seek to catalyze the allocation of capital to Ghanaians and improve competitiveness
and governance of long term savings institutions and markets. The project also aims to
strengthen the Public Sector Reform Strategy through providing a framework for
prioritization, consensus building and budgeting and to translate the strategy into detailed
action plans supported by a thorough monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The
objective of the Public Sector Reform component would be to facilitate a reform
initiative in the public sector which would be comparable to that achieved through
FINSSP in the financial sector in recent years. While this project component might
support future implementation of selected activities under some of these action plans
through collaboration with Development Partners, any more substantive engagement by
the World Bank would be covered through a supplemental financing under this project. It
is proposed to design this project component with an open architecture to maximize the
involvement of interested Development Partners (DPs).

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
To support the Borrower to perform its role as a facilitator for economic development
through: (i) implementation by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of a
reform initiative for improved public sector management and service delivery; and
(ii) strengthening the governance and competitiveness of the financial sector.

1.        Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
1.1       Context at Appraisal

1.       Country background: Ghana’s economy was poised to accelerate in 2004 after years of
efforts in restoring macroeconomic stability and executing fiscal policy reforms. Real GDP grew
by 5.8 percent, the highest since 1992. The stronger economic growth was driven mainly by the
favorable terms of trade for cocoa and gold exports, and increases in private remittances.
Foreign exchange reserves reached closer to four months of imports. Progress made in public
expenditure management enabled Ghana to achieve seven out of sixteen HIPC PEM benchmarks.
The authorities started to use more market-based instruments (e.g. Monetary Policy Committee
and prime rate). Improved macroeconomic management led to a sharp drop in inflation, from 40
percent in 2000 to 11.8 percent in 2004. The peaceful presidential election in December 2004
enhanced a positive economic outlook in the short to medium term. The World Economic
Forum rated Ghana as an “ascending competitive” country in Africa.

2.      Economic structural change, however, did not progress well and the country remained
vulnerable to external shocks (e.g. worsening of terms of trade). The economy relied heavily on
the exports of a few primary commodities: cocoa, gold and timber accounted for more than 70
percent of total export earnings. The size of the government was large, with the State involved
extensively in utilities, enterprises and banking. Government’s wages and debt interest payments
accounted for 69 percent of total budgetary revenues (including grants), leaving little room for
increased allocation for basic education, public health and infrastructure investment. Business
environment was far from conducive to private sector development, due to high regulatory and
administrative cost, inadequate infrastructure, shortage of skilled labor, and difficulties in access
to affordable or longer-term financing. Foreign direct investment (inflows) went down from an
annual average of US$140 million in 1994 - 1999 to that of US$124 million in 2000 – 2005. 1

3.      Public sector: Ghana underwent rounds of public sector reforms (in particular civil
service reforms) supported by several development partner projects since mid-1990s. The results
achieved were regarded as insignificant. At appraisal the main issues identified for the purpose
of the EMCB Project included: (i) weak policy and implementation coordination among different
agencies and between central and local governments; (ii) lack of proper training and
compensation; and (iii) inadequate governance. Other problems identified related to equipment
and resources allocation, record keeping and information management, and the public service
pension system (modest coverage but costly).

4.     Financial sector: Ghana’s financial sector at the time of project appraisal was
characterized by limited financial intermediation, predominance of four commercial banks, high
exposure to the public sector, weak performance of state-influenced institutions, and dominance
of the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) in the insurance and pension

following table.

5.     Banks were profitable thanks to the comfortable interest margin, but the banking system
was vulnerable because of loan concentration and high level of past-due loans. SSNIT was a
large owner of a number of banks but its financial position was undermined by weak governance
and extensive government interference in funding management and investment decisions. The
compliance of Bank of Ghana (BOG) with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision (BCPs) was considered as of relatively high level at the appraisal time. Main
shortcomings were found in supervisor autonomy, enforcement, consolidated supervision and
information sharing. BOG was a leader in implementing many financial sector reforms, but in
needs of institutional capacity building and upgrading of payments and operational systems. All
regulators of Ghana’s financial markets including the BOG and those mentioned in the following
paragraphs were said to have suffered from scarce resources and inadequate training.

6.      The insurance industry was small (9.2 percent of GDP) and was regulated by the
National Insurance Commission (NIC). Observance of the International Association of
Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) Core Principles was assessed as low, despite improvements of
NIC’s regulatory capacity. At appraisal, a new Insurance Law was drafted, and was expected to
strength NIC’s mandate and remove the monopoly by the State Insurance Company and the
Ghana Re. 2 This would entail further challenges to NIC’s capacity in maintaining stability of the
sector while fostering competition and growth of the industry.

7.     Ghana’s securities market was regulated by the Ghana Securities and Exchange
Commission (GSEC). The GSEC updated a number of regulations but was not yet fully
compliant with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Objectives


2
    The draft eventually became the 2006 Insurance Act.

and Principles. Main weaknesses were found in Quality and adequacy of disclosure,
Management of conflict of interest, Rulemaking, and Shareholder redress.

8.      Ghana’s microfinance landscape was populated by hundreds of small institutions. The
formal institutions included Rural and Community Banks (RCBs), Savings & Loans and Credit
Unions. Those institutions were regulated by the BOG. The supervision of RCBs took up nearly
70 percent of BOG’s supervision resources due to those institutions’ large number (123) and
their geographical spread (countrywide). The capital markets were small and shallow, although
Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) saw a spectacular rise in new listings/issues and secondary market
transactions in 2004.

9.      Government strategy: The Government of Ghana recognized those development
challenges and adopted a Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 2004 - 2007) in February
2003. The GPRS targeted at accelerated economic growth over the medium to long term by
maintaining macroeconomic stability, tackling impediments to private sector led growth, and
fostering new sources of growth. Improvement of public sector management was another
strategic priority.

10.     Public sector reform strategy: In May 2005, the Government established the Ministry of
Public Sector Reform (MOPRS) as the leader for the preparation and implementation of public
sector reforms. A Public Sector Reform (PSR) strategy in the form of a Comprehensive Work
Program was adopted three months later. The PSR strategy aimed to improve effectiveness,
efficiency and accountability of the public sector. Particular attentions were given to the
appointment and remuneration of the civil service leadership; the mandate and structure of the
civil service; human resource management and compensation policies; financial management; as
well as operational procedures and uses of information technology.

11.      Financial sector reform strategy: The Government also adopted a Financial Sector
Strategic Plan (FINSSP) in 2003 to address the constraints to access to finance over a period of
eight to ten years. FINSSP contained 98 core tasks to be implemented through 500 detailed
activities and incorporated various recommendations from the 2001 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) and the FSAP Update of 2003. By 2004 – 2005, 90 detailed activities were
completed, such as the passing by the Parliament of four important laws. 3 The strategy was
strongly owned by both the market participants and the Government. It was envisioned that the
planned reforms under FINSSP would enable Ghana’s financial sector to become “efficient in
the mobilization and allocation of funds, fully integrated with the global financial system and
supported by a regulatory system that promotes a high degree of confidence.” 4

12.    Bank strategy: To support the GPRS objectives, the Bank’s 2004 – 2007 Country
Assistance Strategy aimed to achieve accelerated economic growth and employment generation
through managing macroeconomic stability, removing constraints to private sector investment,
and harnessing the sources of growth. The Bank strategy also highlighted the importance of

improved and decentralized public sector management for better service delivery. While a main
instrument for achieving those and other CAS objectives was the budget supporting Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series, non-lending activities were planned to support the
implementation of the recommendations of the 2003 IMF-World Bank FSAP Update. Topics to
be covered in particular included development of an efficient financial intermediation system,
creation of a market for financial assets transfer, and anti-money laundering assessment. Support
to the public sector management reforms included analytical work on decentralization and
capacity building. The Bank strategy also recognized the need for targeted capacity building
operations to support the implementation of the Government poverty reduction and sectoral
reform strategies.

13.     Development partnership: Donor coordination was strengthened when the Government
implemented the Multi-donor Budget Support framework (MDBS) in 2003. The CAS was
developed within the MDBS, with the PRSC series as the main instrument for joint development
partner programs. Nine development partners (DPs, including the Bank) also agreed to re-orient
their support at the sector level towards programmatic lending and multi-donor funding.

14.    EMCB Project: Against the above background, the Bank at the request of the MOPSR
and the MOFEP approved the Ghana Economic Management and Capacity Building Project
(EMCB or the Project) in November 2005 to support the development and implementation of
government strategies on public sector reform (PSR) and financial sector reform (FSR). The
Project was originally financed by an IDA credit of USD25 million equivalent and GOG
counterpart funding of USD8.7 million. During project implementation, the Bank provided an
Additional Financing of USD10 million equivalent to mainly finance the up-scaled PSR
component. In addition, the UK Government’s Department for International Development
(DFID) provided a grant of USD5.2 million equivalent 5 and the Switzerland Government’ State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) USD2.4 million to co-finance the FSR components.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

15.     The original PDO as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was: “The
proposed project aims at supporting the government to define and perform its role as a facilitator
for economic development. The project seeks to establish a level playing field in the finance
sector focusing upon outcomes rather than establishing new institutions, together with a clear
policy to improve the efficiency of public sector management for an enhanced service delivery.
The project, through support to FINSSP, will seek to catalyze the allocation of capital to
Ghanaians and improve competitiveness and governance of long term savings institutions and
markets. The project also aims to strengthen the Public Sector Reform Strategy through
providing a framework for prioritization, consensus building and budgeting and to translate the
strategy into detailed action plans supported by a thorough monitoring and evaluation
mechanism. The objective of the Public Sector Reform component would be to facilitate a
reform initiative in the public sector which would be comparable to that achieved through
FINSSP in the financial sector in recent years. While this project component might support

 At the windup of the DFID grant in June 2011, USD2.7 million had been utilized by the Project and the rest of the
DFID funding was cancelled.

                                                        4
future implementation of selected activities under some of these action plans through
collaboration with Development Partners, any more substantive engagement by the World Bank
would be covered through a supplemental financing under this project. It is proposed to design
this project component with an open architecture to maximize the involvement of interested
Development Partners (DPs).”

16.      The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) of the Project streamlined the PDO as
follows: “The objective of the Project is to support the Borrower to perform its role as a
facilitator for economic development through: (i) facilitating a reform initiative for improved
public sector management and service delivery; and (ii) strengthening the governance and
competitiveness of the financial sector.”

17.     The original outcome indicators (i.e. the key indicators) as stated in the PAD were:

  (i)   Enhanced structure, strategy and responsibility within government for public sector
        reform by end 2006

  (ii) 20 percent increase in private sector credit (including bonds)/GDP by closing date

 (iii) 20 percent increase in private sector savings/GDP

 (iv) Increase in access to finance since project implementation.

18.     The DCA contained the same indicators with minor wording variations, except for the
fourth indicator which was not included.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

19.      The original PDO was revised in the December 2007 project restructuring, mainly to
reflect the extended scope of the Public Sector Reform (PSR) part of the Project. The revised
PDO was: “To support the Borrower to perform its role as a facilitator for economic
development through: (i) implementation by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of a
reform initiative for improved public sector management and service delivery; and
(ii) strengthening the governance and competitiveness of the financial sector.”

20.     The outcome indicators in particular those of the PSR part of the project were revised,
added or cancelled by the December 2007 and the June 2011 project restructurings. The key
indicators as of the project closing date (May 2013) were:

  (i)   Establishment of new pay range structure to guide pay awards by 2011 (PSR objective);

  (ii) Private sector credit (including bonds)/GDP ratio increases by 27 percent by end-2012
       (FSR objective, which is the gross banking credits to private corporations as a
       percentage of GDP per BOG definition); and



                                                 5
    (iii) Private sector savings/GDP ratio increases by 22 percent by end-2012 (FSR objective,
          which is the gross deposits by private sector enterprises at banks as a percentage of GDP
          per BOG definition).

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

21.    No specific direct beneficiaries or primary target groups were identified at appraisal.
Based on the project design it appears that the EMCB was intended to directly target the public
administration and the financial service regulators. The ICR review of the lists of implementing
agency (cum beneficiaries) by the closing dates of the PSR part (June 2011) and the FSR part
(May 2013) indicates that the PSR part had ten beneficiaries (e.g. Public Service Commission
and Office of Head of Civil Service). Under the FSR part, there were also ten direct
beneficiaries (e.g. Bank of Ghana, Ghana Securities and Exchange Commission, Ghana
Insurance Commission, Ghana Pension Regulatory Authority, and Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning). 6

1.5       Original Components (as approved)

22.    Seven components were designed to achieve the project objectives. Each component in
turn consisted of several subcomponents and some of them were further split up. Altogether
there were 12 areas for PSR support and 31 subcomponents/main activities for FSR support.
Those components and subcomponents as approved are summarized below.

23.     Component One – Public Sector Reform (Part A): This component was to support the
development of a framework for prioritization, consensus building and budgeting of public
sector reform objectives. It would also support the development of action plans with monitoring
and evaluation strategies for the planned reforms, and implementation of reform initiatives in
Ministries/Departments/Agencies (MDAs). The component was originally managed and
implemented by the MOPSR.7 No specific or main activities were designed for the development
of the said framework at appraisal, although the legal documents indicated that specific activities
of this part of the Project would be agreed upon between the Government and the participating
Development Partners through a Memorandum of Understanding (eventually signed off in
March 2006). The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) indicated the following 12 broad areas as
candidates for project support. 8

    (i)   Civil Service training program

    (ii) Service delivery improvement (customer service standard programs)

    (iii) Public Sector Pay Policy and Pension Reform

  The MOPSR was said to have been established for the sole purpose of developing and implementing a PSR
strategy. The ministry was dissolved in early 2009 after the 2008 Presidential election, and the Public Sector
Reform Secretariat (PSR Secretariat) became the successor for project implementation.

24.     Component 2 – Regulation of Financial Markets (Part B): The Component was mainly
to strengthen the Ghana Securities Exchange Commission (GSEC, the implementing agency –
IA). At appraisal, the following five main activities were envisaged for achieving this goal: 9

     (i)   Technology upgrading

    (ii) Technical assistance including capacity building in the areas of supervision, surveillance
         and enforcement

    (iii) Amendment of the 2004 Long-Term Savings Act

    (iv) Development, regulation and supervision of the Long-Term Savings (LTS) Agency

    (v) GSEC’s public education campaign

25.     Component 3 – Banking and NBFI Regulation (Part C): This was a BOG (IA)
strengthening component. The component consisted of the following main activities:

     (i)   Reviews of the structure of the Banking Supervision Department, the fit of various
           departments in the overall organizational structure and the HR salary structure

    (ii) Preparation and drafting of several laws (e.g. Credit Bureaus law)



9
  This is based on the main text of the PAD and the DCA. Annex 4 of the PAD indicated that the component would
also support Commodity Exchange Market and Over-the-Counter Market.

      Bank for the rural community banks (RCBs)

  (v) Strengthening of supervisory and regulatory capacity of BOG, CUA and ARB Apex
      Bank

26.    Component Four – Insurance Regulation and Supervision (Part D): This Component
aimed to support capacity building of the National Insurance Commission (NIC, the IA). The
designed main activities included:

  (i)   Design of curriculum and strategic training plan for the insurance industry at the
        Insurance Industry Training Center (including support to the operation of the center)

  (ii) Development of regulations

 (iii) Insurance supervision capacity building

 (iv) Capacity building of NIC’s research and actuarial units

27.    Component Five – Strengthening of Capital Markets (Part E): This Component was to
support the capacity building of Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE, the IA) which was the
implementing agency. Specifically, the following main activities were to be carried out:

  (i)   Review of GSE rules and regulations

  (ii) Improvement of capacity for management of business and regulatory risks of
       demutualization

 (iii) GSE automation (linking the Central Securities Depository with an automated trading
       and settlement system)

 (iv) Staff training for the GSE and market operators

28.      Component Six – Pension Sector Development (Part F): This Component aimed to
achieve what its title suggested, and the implementing responsibility was assigned to SSNIT at
appraisal (but was transferred to the National Pensions Regulatory Agency in 2009). The main
activities as designed were as follows:

  (i)   Strengthening of legislation for the governance of the pension sector by establishing a
        framework to transfer investment management to external, independent and regulated
        private investment fund managers



                                                 8
     (ii) Designing of a process for the outsourcing of SSNIT’s investment functions

     (iii) Capacity strengthening of SSNIT staff in actuarial simulations against different medium-
           term reform scenarios

     (iv) Strengthening of the timeliness and accuracy of data management at SSNIT

29.     Component Seven – Access to Finance and financial Sector Governance (Part G): This
Component sought to establish a strengthened banking and NBFI system that would provide a
wide range of competitive products. There were multiple implementing agencies including, the
Financial Sector Development Department (FSD), the Aid and Debt Management Unit (ADMU),
and the Microfinance Unit of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFEP), the
Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF), the Presidential Commission on Pension Reform (PCPR),
as well as the BOG. The objective of the Component was to be achieved through the following
main activities:

     (i)   Development of a strategic vision and a governance framework for four State-Influenced
           Financial Institutions (SIFIs, Ghana Commercial Bank, Agricultural Development Bank,
           National Investment Bank and State Insurance Corporation)

     (ii) Preparation and implementation by the FSD of GOG’s financial sector policies and
          oversight of relevant agencies

     (iii) Research by the BOG on cross-border capital flows

     (iv) A FinScope approach survey of demand on access to finance

     (v) Support to increased flow of remittances through improved payment systems (under
         Component Two), a grant facility targeting low income households, and research on
         remittance patterns

     (vi) Establishment of a sound base for the governance and regulation of the VCTF

 (vii) Support of the PCPR’s work program through several major activities 10

 (viii) Amendment of the Long-Term Savings Scheme Act and support of an appropriate tax
        regime for the LTSA initiative




10
   They included: Technical studies on the design of a comprehensive reform program; Provision of qualified
actuaries; Training in a pension reform toolkit and an international core course on pension policy reform; A focused
examination of incentives for voluntary savings by the informal sector; Evaluation of data management
requirements, policy design options and regulation/supervision/oversight of different tiers of pension institutions
consistent with the designed new public pension scheme; and Formulation of legal requirements for the new pension
regime.

     (ix) Debt management strengthening through Segregation of MOFEP borrowing activity from
          the BOG Domestic Debt Desk; Restructuring of the government borrowing patterns
          towards longer term maturities; and Support of long-term debt market development and
          pricing

1.6        Revised Components

30.    There were no formal revisions of components; although there were a number of
readjustments of subcomponents/main activities (see Section 2 below for details).

1.7        Other Significant Changes

31.    The Project was restructured three times which (respectively) expanded the project scope
and scale, modified the Results Framework, reallocated IDA funding between components, and
twice extended the closing date of the financial sector reform components.

32.     First restructuring and Additional Financing (December 2007): 11 An additional IDA
credit of US$10 million equivalent was provided to Component One (Part A), Public Sector
Reform to finance a number of reform initiatives (e.g. the pay reform) and staff severance
payments of four subvented agencies, as well as taxes incurred in eligible expenditures under
both parts of the Project. The restructuring for the first time since project appraisal clearly
identified eight PSR subcomponents. The original Project Development Objective (see Section
1.3) was revised, and a number of PSR Intermediate Results (IR) indicators added. Several FSR
IR indicators were also revised (see Section 2.3 for details).

33.     Second restructuring (June 2011): The closing date of the FSR part (Component Two –
Seven or Part B – G) was extended from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012, to support an
evolving financial sector development agenda as reflected in FINSSP II (June 2011). The
restructuring readjusted the focus of those components in order to better address issues identified
by the 2011 FSAP update. IDA funding was reallocated between the FSR components, mainly
to increase financing for Component Four – Seven (by reducing the funding for Component Two
and Three, and the allocation of the unutilized Project Preparation Advances). The restructuring
also revised the outcome indicators (see Section 1.3) and the intermediate results indicators.

34.   Third restructuring (December 2012): This restructuring extended the closing date of the
FSR components to May 31, 2013 to allow the completion of a few remaining activities of the
FSR components.




11
     The additional financing became effective in April 2008.

2.         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

35.      Project design: In general, project design benefitted from the availability of government
reform programs and improved donor coordination at the sector level. In addition, the regular
FSAP updates and the coordinated consultative process which led to the development and
adoption of the FINSSP provided a favorable micro-environment for the FSR part of the Project:
main hurdles to financial sector development had been identified and the financial sector reform
strategy became owned by the main regulatory stakeholders which were also the project
implementing agencies. However, the Project as designed was overly complex as it housed two
very broad and challenging reform programs. A clear sign of project complexity is the sheer
number of the implementing agencies (20). Commonsense tells us that the span of control of an
institution or task management team is limited. Overstretching that span is a recipe for trouble.

36.      PSR part: Public sector reforms (e.g. streamlining agencies and retrenchment schemes)
are often politically charged with direct consequences for people’s career and/or livelihood.
Affordability of the cost for the government budget is another common challenge. 12 Research
and practices before and around the time of project design show the following success factors are
critical: Strong political will, Broadly-based consensus, and Careful sequencing. The Bank’s
earlier experience in supporting public sector reforms in Ghana was not successful and two
projects in this regard had been rated unsatisfactory. In addition to the absence of the success
factors, a main constraint in Ghana was the lack of government capacity to implement a wide-
scope reform program those projects supported. The design of the PSR part attempted to
incorporate those lessons learnt. Government commitment to public sector reforms was
considered as strong at appraisal, based on the meetings with the Minister of MOPSR, and the
fact that a PSR strategy was adopted. But there was no documentation indicating consultations
with other main stakeholders (e.g. other MDAs). On the other hand, the newly established
Ministry of Public Sector Reform had not been funded by the budget. Various MDAs were
taking the lead in a number of reforms which might not have been fully incorporated into the
MOPSR’s strategy. It appears that inadequate attention was paid to signs of uncertainties in the
ownership of the PSR component, leading to the challenges to ensure buy-ins by the main
stakeholders during project implementation.

37.    To address doubts about the appropriateness of the scope of the PSR component
expressed at the Bank’s internal reviews including a Quality Enhancement Review (QER), the
Project was said to only support the development of a framework for prioritization, consensus
building and budgeting in the initial phase. Implementation of the reforms would be supported
by additional IDA financing. The actual design of the PSR component as recorded in the PAD
did not identify any main activities for the development of the framework with specific costing
of the activities (e.g. diagnostics, research of international experience and sensitization
workshops). Instead, the Appraisal left the Bank support open-ended by listing all the 12 broad



12
     For example the estimated cost of the Ghana Public Sector Reform program was US$409 million at the time.

                                                         11
areas of public sector reform in the MOPSR’s PSR strategy, making it difficult to monitor and
assess implementation progress and project efficiency.

38.     The PSR part was considered as quite risky at the Bank’s internal reviews before project
appraisal. There were also questions on whether the Bank should involve in the public sector
reforms through the EMCB ProjectOn the other hand, DFID strongly advocated Bank
involvement in public sector reforms. At the time the development partner had involved in
supporting the public sector reform agenda in Ghana for two decades. The management decision
for project design was to (a) let DFID take the lead; 13 (b) develop a strategy to either exit or scale
up Bank involvement later during project implementation; and (c) support the strategy with a
series of benchmarks. The decision was made with the knowledge of the previous failure of
Bank operations in the sector. It appears an urge to quickly respond to a government request for
continuous support of public sector reform overruled other equally important concerns (e.g.
development impact and reputational risk). Furthermore, the recommended risk mitigation
measures were not adopted in the eventual project design. 14 If the quality enhancement
recommendations were adopted in project design, complexity (a major hurdle to implementation
and outcomes) might have been reduced.

39.     As early as the QER time questions were raised about synergies between this part of the
Project and the FSR components. The decision to keep the PSR component under the Project
was said to have been based more on internal budget and staffing considerations. At the time
there might not be many options, but it turned out to be a costly decision in terms of project
efficiency and achievement of objectives.

40.     FSR part: The detailed analysis of the 2001 and 2003 FSAP provided feed to the design
of the FSR components. The starting point of the design was clear from the conception phase,
which was to support the implementation of FINSSP. There had been dialogues with the
counterparts and a stakeholder workshop for the conceptualization of the components. Out of
FINSSP’s 119 core tasks (later reduced to 98), the project design attempted to focus on
establishing a common standard for financial sector regulation and institutional efficiency.
Specific main activities were identified and cost of components estimated at appraisal. The
design of this part of the Project enabled the Bank to support, with specific technical assistance
activities, the implementation of its own recommendations in sector assessments and
Government strategy, which is needed to enhance developmental impact.

41.    Lessons learnt from the Bank financed NBFI Assistance Project and the Second
Economic Reform Support Operation Credit were reportedly considered for the design of the
FSR components. The difficulties those projects encountered in implementation were due to the
complicated design and numerous small and unrelated components, which had limited the


13
   DFID was later found to have only achieved mixed results from its support in the PSR area: “Assessing DFIC
Support to Public Sector Reform in Ghana” by Gordon Evans, DFAIT, March 2008. In 2011, DFID Ghana decided
to shift the focus of the country program away from the public sector as well as financial sector reforms to be better
in line with the broader UK government priorities.
14
   No exit option was explored at appraisal. While a scale up (additional financing) was indicated in the PAD, no
benchmarks to anchor a decision on this option were provided. There was no indication of the respective role of
DFID and the Bank under the EMCB Project. No pooled funding was secured.

                                                         12
projects’ capacity to provide in-depth support in those areas critical to the achievement of project
objectives. At the Bank’s internal reviews a more selective approach was recommended for the
design of the FSR parts. In addition, several important technical issues were raised, such as the
need for a gradual approach towards the proposed outsourcing of management of SSNIT
investments, and the merit of giving priority to GSE demutualization given the development
stage of Ghana’s stock market. However, the wide scope of the components was maintained at
appraisal, which included those two and many other stand-alone activities in addition to the
interventions specifically aimed to establish a common standard regulatory framework and
improve institutional efficiency. Synergies (if any) between the components and the
subcomponents were considered only as byproducts of a holistic approach, although this
approach does not necessarily mean one has to deal with all the industries of the whole financial
sector at once. Because of the wide span of control, more attention had to be paid to the conduct
and processing during project implementation, rather than the effectiveness and efficiency of the
activities.

42.      Institutional arrangements: The project design treated the Project as two parallel
projects in terms of institutional arrangement for implementation. The MOPSR and the
FSD/MOFEP were to manage their respective parts of the Project separately as two stand-alone
project management units (PMUs). Steering committees were envisaged for separate sector and
donor coordination. However, there was no single owner to be held accountable for the whole
project; no mechanism for collaboration and coordination between the two parts of the Project;
and no arrangement for the monitoring and evaluation of the whole project. The separated
institutional arrangement for project implementation was a main hurdle to timely responses to
implementation problems based on the monitoring and reporting of the whole Project, as well as
to efficient utilization of the project funding.

43.     PSR part: The design of the institutional arrangement for the public sector reform part of
the Project was at a highly generic level. Principles based on the experience of public sector
reform funds in various countries were cited as the institutional arrangement for this part of the
Project. The only detail available at appraisal was the coordination and technical meeting
schedules, in addition to assigning the responsibility for PSR implementation to the MOPSR.
There was no design on the specific responsibilities and accountabilities for the procurement,
financial management and M&E functions, or analysis of the MOPSR staff capacity in managing
Bank financed investment and technical assistance projects. There was a general mentioning of
MDAs as implementing agencies without specifying which MDAs would be or were likely to be
the implementing agencies. The lack of institutional arrangement was a sign that the design of
the PSR part was inadequate for implementation.

44.     FSR part: The design of the institutional arrangement for the implementation of the
financial sector reform components was much advanced at appraisal. The newly-established
FSD/MOFEP was assigned the overall responsibility for project implementation (including
procurement planning and project financial management), as well as for coordination with the
implementing agencies and the participating development partners. Internal and external
coordination was to be conducted through two steering committees (one for coordination
between the FSD/MOFEP and the IAs, and the other between the FSD/MOFEP and the
participating DPs). The responsibilities and accountabilities of the six main implementing

                                                13
agencies were clearly defined. The institutional arrangement as designed was critical in holding
together the six different components (with at least 31 planned activities at appraisal) for
implementation monitoring.

45.     SWAp approach: The Project was designed to take the SWAp (sector-wide approach
program) approach. The Bank’s 2004 – 2007 Country Assistance Strategy highlighted the use of
the approach and donors had agreed to coordinate sector interventions through similar
approaches (e.g. program-based approach or PBA). At appraisal, this approach was new with a
relatively short history in the World Bank’s portfolio, and in-depth knowledge was not available
on the factors affecting the effectiveness of the approach. According to OPCS guidance
(updated in 2011), a SWAp does not have to be whole sector wide. It could be thematic or sub-
sector wide. OPCS also made it clear early on that the SWA concept could be applied to a
variety of Bank financing instruments (e.g. Adaptable Program Loans and Sector Specific Loans).
An IEG review of health sector SWAps in six countries (including Ghana) in 2009 found the
results of the sector-wide approach were mixed in terms of achieving national program
objectives and realization of the benefits of the approach.15 Some of the relevant lessons learnt
include the need for rigorous appraisal of work programs to ensure minimum quality standards
and better sequencing of efforts to mitigate the risks of implementation delays and weak results
focus. Should there be adequate time for project appraisal to thoroughly digest the lessons
learnt from the earlier Bank operations, the project design could have adopted a more phased-in
approach for achieving the ambitious economy-wide objectives in a more realistic time horizon.

46.     Risk identification and mitigation: The appraisal rated the policy-level risks of the PSR
part as substantial – there were a lack of clarity on the roles and responsibilities between MDAs
for the public sector reform agenda; and a high-level public skepticism towards the PSR agenda.
If implemented, the proposed risk management approach (to focus the Bank intervention first on
prioritizing the reforms and a few achievable quick wins) could have had mitigated the risks
early on in project implementation. With the benefit of hindsight, the PSR part was a high
(rather than substantial) risk intervention and much more should have been done to ensure that
the two main risks mentioned above were adequately addressed before submitting the Project or
the following Additional Financing for Board approval.

47.     Policy-level risks were also identified in the design of the FSR part, and were rated from
low, modest to substantial. The higher risk areas were: (a) demutualization of GSE,
(b) outsourcing of SSNIT investments management, and (c) governance of state-influenced
financial institutions. Proposed mitigations were generic discussions of preemptive or corrective
actions, close monitoring, and/or the good momentum of financial sector reform. No specific
plan was prepared to actually mitigate the risks (e.g. triggers for preemptive actions). Those
risks materialized early in project implementation, and only the third one was addressed by
dropping the relevant subcomponent through the 2007 project restructuring.

48.     No operational level risks (e.g. weak institutional capacity for project management and
the challenges brought by the wide span of control) were identified at appraisal, which turned out
to be major factors affecting timely project implementation and monitoring.

2.2        Implementation

49.      Project implementation took more than seven years but eventually resulted in significant
progress towards achieving the project objectives (see Section 3 for details). In addition to the
issues discussed in Section 2.1 above, the following factors either contributed to the completion
of project implementation, or were responsible for the incompletion of activities and a lack of
results.

50.    PSR part: The 2007 restructuring clearly grouped many project activities into nine
subcomponents, which at least facilitated the monitoring and reporting of project status. The
decision to finance the cost of the retrenchment programs in four subvented agencies enabled the
progress made towards the achievement of the relevant result indicator.

51.     The 2009 Mid-Term Review (MTR) conducted detailed assessment of each PSR
subcomponent. Based on the MTR recommendations, four subcomponents were suspended (de
facto termination) and the financing of the activities under the other subcomponents were
refocused towards those which were already well under way. The cancelled activities suffered
un-clarified objective, unsatisfactory implementation, and/or lack of effective results. The MTR
readjustments significantly re-oriented the PSR component towards achievable results.

52.    The additional financing of US$10 million (see Section 1.7 for details) scaled up Bank
involvement in Ghana’s public sector reform. The decision was made after strong MOPSR
request and based on a general description of good progress made. However, given the 2009
MTR findings, it appears that the goal of the first phase (prioritization and budgeting of, and
consensus building for the PSR strategy) might not have been achieved as of end-2007. This
should not be difficult to foresee since the design of the first phase was said to have followed the
model for developing FINSSP, which was a product of years of joint efforts of the Government,
the main stakeholders and the DPs 16 If the first phase goal were reached, part of the scarce IDA
funding committed under the Additional Financing might have been better utilized for more
achievable results.

53.     The 2007 restructuring expanded the scope of the PSR part. About 18 months later the
MTR report found that some of the planned activities (e.g. reorganization of the Civil Service)
had little chance to be completed due to various political and socio-economic factors. Others
(e.g. decentralization) were led by other government agencies and had already received donor
support outside the EMCB Project. The MTR also recommended an immediate project
restructuring to address the problems encountered under the PSR part including a possible PDO
revision. However, the second restructuring was not conducted until a few weeks before the
original closing date (June 30, 2011) and there was no change in the PDO. It appears that an

     For example, just the adoption of the FINSSP took more than two years.

opportunity was lost to make the scope and objective of the PSR part more realistic sooner (e.g.
in early 2010).

54.    FSR part: During project implementation most of the implementing agencies maintained
a strong ownership of the reform program, and the FSD/MOFEP leadership was committed to
the Project throughout the implementation period. Continuous ownership of implementing
agencies and strong leadership in project management were critical to project implementation
and the achievement of the results.

55.     On the other hand, the following problems show that the implementation difficulties
rising from the ambitious scope of the FSR part was not adequately addressed during project
implementation:

•    Component Six – SSNIT investment portfolio: Limited activities (mainly training) were
     carried out in SSNIT before the implementing agency withdrew from the Project in early
     2009 after the new pension law became effective. The withdrawal of the SSNIT indicates
     that the planned outsourcing of a large part (65 percent) of the stock of the pension
     contributions managed by SSNIT to the private sector for investments management was
     indeed lack of broad-based political support. In contrast, the gradual approach adopted by
     the 2008 law is being implemented. 17

•    Component Seven – Added new activities: The 2011 project restructuring added several new
     activities under this component, such as strengthening of institutional capacity for anti-
     money laundering (AML) purpose and support to the development of rural finance. The
     additions of the activities were quick responses to government requests. Some addition, in
     particular the support to AML achieved good results because the GOG made a high-level
     political commitment with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in late 2010 to address
     strategic AML/CFT deficiencies; and there were adequate resources to support both legal and
     regulatory improvements and institutional development. 18 Other added activities did not
     enjoy those conditions and increased number of activities made the component more
     unwieldy. The component by itself could be a stand-alone and reasonably-sized financial
     sector technical assistance program (USD10.8 million).

56.     Other factors: From the very beginning, DFID was a partner of the FSR part of the
Project, and committed US$5.2 million equivalent to the pooled fund to finance the FSR
components (available after August 2007). 19 SECO became a co-financier of the FSR
components in August 2009 and contributed US$2.44 million equivalent to the FSR pooled fund.
The pooled fund arrangement facilitated the flow of funds from different participating DPs to



17
   The 2008 law establishes a three-tier pension system, and allows private sector funds to manage the investment of
new pension contributions to the second (occupational) and third (individual) tier schemes.
18
   AFTF and SECO provided technical advice and the EMCB project supported setting up of a FIC.
19
   US$2.45 million equivalent of the DFID contribution was cancelled in June 2011. The pooled fund for the PSR
part as planned in the PAD, the DCA and the 2007 Project Paper did not materialize, although there was no
documentation on the main reasons. But this is not a major factor affecting the achievement of the objectives of the
PSR part, as the issue was not a shortfall of funding but a lack of better selectivity and sequencing.

                                                        16
finance the FSR part of the Project. In addition, SECO and GIZ coordinated with the Bank by
providing support to a number of financial sector reform in parallel to the EMCB. Those were
good examples of donor/development partner coordination at the sector level.

57.      The MOUs between the Government and the participating Development Partners (signed
off in March 2006 as an IDA credit effectiveness condition) laid down the coordination and co-
financing mechanisms. The preparation and status review of the annual work plans provided a
good forum for coordination, in particular regarding procurement and financial planning. Early
delays in project implementation could be attributed to the need to acquaint project management
staff of MOPSR and MOFEP with the World Bank procurement guidelines and review
procedures. Over-reliance of consultants at the MOPSR affected implementation of the planned
activities under the PSR component, in particular after the consultants’ contracts were terminated
in early 2009. The Project was once rated as Project at Risk.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

58.     PDO: The statement of the original Project Development Objectives was very broad (see
Section 1.2). The original PDO statement in the PAD was also long and ambiguous about the
Project’s main objectives. The revised PDO statement (See Section 1.3) re-oriented the PSR part
of the objective, but retained the goal of changing the overall government role in economic
management. It would require much more support than the EMCB Project to enable the GOG to
clearly define and effectively perform its role as a facilitator for economic development. The
PDO was improved for the PSR part during project implementation, but still suffered a common
problem of the time: aiming to achieve economy-wide goal for a relatively small development
intervention.

59.     Inferred PDO: Neither the original nor the revised PDO accurately reflected what the
Project was intended to achieve with regard to the FSR components. There was a disconnect
between the intended project objectives and the stated PDO as recorded in the official project
documents. Based on the ICR review of the original project design including the original
allocation of the IDA funding among the project components, and the various statements of
project objectives in the PAD, the main intended objective (inferred PDO) of the FSR part
appears to be to strengthen the regulatory regimes and improve the regulators’ operational
efficiency. 20.

60.      Results framework: The results framework (RF) set up high level targets and not all of
them were pertinent to the planned project interventions. There were many indicators (a total of
41 throughout the implementation period) which in a way mirrored the dispersed nature of
project activities. The RF underwent several rounds of modifications. In general, the
modifications of the targets and indicators for the PSR part improved the attribution between
targets and main activities. Changes for the FSR part were mainly at the component level, but
the attribution problem in the design of the PDO and outcome indicators of the FSR part was not


20
  Allocations for the activities related to regulatory frameworks and institutional efficiency accounted for at least
74% of the IDA funding for the FSR components. Except for Component Seven all the other FSR components
focused on those two themes.

                                                          17
addressed. Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for both parts of the Project was more on
processes and outputs, rather than results and indicators.

61.    PSR part: The Bank’s internal reviews before appraisal recommended further
development of the results framework for this part of the Project. Those recommendations were
not adequately incorporated into the project design. The original outcome indicator (related to
the development of a strategy and organizational structure for the PSR component) appears to be
more of an intermediate-results-level measurement for specific actions. It was probably also
outdated. The MOPSR was established in May 2005 and the PSR strategy was adopted in
August 2005, while the Project was approved in November 2005. The activities financed by the
Project before credit effectiveness (through retroactive financing and the PSR PPF) might be
limited to the staffing cost and the preparation of the PSR MOU between the Government and
the participating Development Partners. There was no intermediate results (IR) indicator to
measure the results of prioritization and consensus building for the PRS strategy, although those
were said to be the main activities of the Bank interventions in the first phase of project
implementation. 21 The original results framework for the PSR part was not ready for
implementation at appraisal.

62.      The shortfalls in design were partially addressed through the 2007 restructuring when the
original outcome indicator was dropped and three new indicators added. Thirteen IR indicators
were adopted for the corresponding subcomponents, which was a reflection of a lack of
prioritization and over-promising of what limited IDA resource could do. The June 2011
restructuring dropped two outcome indicators (related to the recruitment and promotion schemes
of the Civil Service and the reduction in government subvention). The restructuring also re-
developed the subcomponent-level targets. The number of indicators was reduced from 13 to 5
at the intermediate results level. The final results framework was specific and more realistic, but
the changes should have been made immediately after the 2009 MTR, so as to set achievable
targets to guide the implementation of the remaining PSR activities, rather than to retroactively
reflect the 2009 cut-down just before the closure of the PSR part.

63.     During project implementation, the PSR targets were reported as achieved without the
support of specific qualitative and/or quantitative assessment (except for the MTR which
reviewed the status of the PSR part by subcomponent). Despite management advice to promptly
assess the results of the PSR part after it was closed in June 2011, there was only a summary of
the outputs one year later. As the MOPSR was dissolved and the implementation consultants left
the PSR Secretariat, institutional memories were lost and documentation on project
implementation was lacking. The uses of the results framework to monitor and evaluate project
progress under the PSR part were quite weak.

64.    FSR part: There was a more detailed results framework for the financial sector reform
components at appraisal. The outcome indicators were financial deepening metrics (gross
banking credit to private sector and gross deposits which included demand deposits by private


21
  If the Bank interventions were more than the further development of the strategy in the first phase, the design of
the IRs and IR indicators were inadequate. There was only one IR Indicator related to the initiation of a substantive
reform program at a MDA for the indicated 12 areas of Bank support.

                                                         18
sector enterprises at Ghanaian banks as percentages of GDP); rather than measurements of
governance and competitiveness. Some intermediate results indicators were for major reforms
where the EMCB only had limited or no interventions (e.g. the indicators on supervision
coverage and effectiveness; or that on the increases in the number of deposit accounts). Several
other intermediate results-level targets were also set at a high level. For instance, one result
aimed to increase the turnover of the secondary equity market. This market liquidity
measurement is determined by a number of macroeconomic and institutional factors (e.g.
monetary policy and investment decisions by investors) which were beyond the reach of the
Project. During project implementation, two rounds of revisions were made. Target revisions
were mainly upward adjustments (e.g. the target for increase in the gross banking credit to
private sector/GDP was raised from the original 20 percent to 27 percent). There were also
additions, revisions and cancellations of the component level results and the indicators but the
attribution weaknesses remained, reflecting the challenges in fixing congenital defects in the
design of the results framework. Appropriate outcome indicators should have been adopted
either for the stated PDO or the intended objectives. 22 While the FSR RF was specific,
measurable and time-bound, it suffered from weak attribution.

65.     Data for the FSR results framework for the purpose of Bank reporting were provided but
not regularly updated. At least one workshop was held in the last year of project implementation
to highlight the need to enhance the connection between activities and the outcome and result
indicators. However, it appears the results framework did not become an integral part of project
M&E. In other words, it was not used regularly to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks.
There were no in-depth assessments of project status against the RF indicators at the major
milestone dates (e.g. the first two restructurings and the MTR). For instance, when a main
activity was dropped (e.g. strengthening of SIFIs governance), no assessment of the
implementation status was provided. 23 There were also omissions in readjustment. When the
new pension law adopted the gradual approach to enhance the management of additional pension
contributions, the indicator regarding the stock of pension contributions was not removed.
Annual work plans focused more on procurement and financing plans and the status of those
plans. Discussion and finalization of annual plans could have been a good opportunity to
conduct realistic assessment of progress against the RF indicators. Documentation of results
were uneven, with some implementing agencies/beneficiaries (e.g. GSEC, BOG, NIC, VCTF
and DMD/MOFEP) having given much more thoughts to the pathway from activities to the final
results. An internalization of the FSR results framework would have made the project M&E
more results oriented.


22
   For example, if the FSR part were truly about governance strengthening, more relevant governance indicators
should have been adopted, such as “enhanced accountability of the owner and management of financial institutions”,
or “improved regulatory quality”. See the World Bank: Worldwide Governance Indicators.
info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/
23
   The first restructuring kind of cancelled the subcomponent aimed to strengthen the governance of the four SIFIs
by formally dropping the relevant indicator. The cancellation of this subcomponent does not appear to be a main
factor affecting the project outcomes as it was not the main focus.

formally set targets, please refer to Section F of this ICR’s Datasheet.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

67.     Safeguard: No safeguard policies were triggered by the design and implementation of
the Project.

68.    Procurement: Procurement faced challenges and most of the time during project
implementation was rated from moderately unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory. At the
beginning the problems came from the lack of familiarity with Bank guidelines and review
procedures. Later on, when the Bank prior review procedure shifted to the annual work plan
based approach through the second project restructuring, procurement performance gradually
became satisfactory in 2012.     No fiduciary breaches were identified during project
implementation.

69.     Financial management: Project financial management started well in particular with
regard to the PSR part, but gradually deteriorated in 2006 – 2008 partly due to various capacity
related issues such as delays in installing a Bank requirement compatible project accounting
software in the PMU. The dissolve of the MOPSR in early 2009 resulted in staffing and other
continuity difficulties at the project management unit of the PSR part. These challenges were
subsequently addressed. For the FSR component the financial management performance was
satisfactory. Overall, the project FM performance at the closing date was considered as
satisfactory. All the project auditor’s reports were unqualified and no fiduciary breaches were
identified.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

70.    PSR part: The most important result of this part of the Project was the Single Spine Pay
Structure (SSPS). The SSPS has been fully integrated into the civil service pay scheme, and is
expected to be continued. The Fair Wages and Pension Commission (FWPC) is functioning
well. While DFID withdrew from this sector in 2010 – 2011, the Bank’s current Country
Partnership Strategy (FY13 – FY16) continues to attach importance to the public sector reform in
Ghana, although the specific operations to support this reform agenda are currently under
discussion with the GoG.

71.     FSR part: The efficiency gain under this part of the Project appears to start to take roots
in the beneficiary organizations (the regulatory institutions), although a couple of important
operational systems (e.g. NIC’s supervision returns system) were not yet to be launched as of
project closure. One issue that should be paid more attention to is the financial planning for
system maintenance and upgrading. No systems can live up to their full capacity and utility
without regular maintenance. Given the advancement of ICT in today’s world and the
evolutionary nature of the regulators’ operations in Ghana’s financial market, regular system
upgrading in the longer term would lead to further efficiency gains. The same can be said about
compliance with the international standards of financial sector regulation and supervision, as

                                                20
well as institutional capacity building. They are a dynamic process and it is important to budget
well in advance for their continuous strengthening.

72.     The Government has realized the importance of continuous financial sector reform and is
now implementing the FINSSP II (2011 – 2015). The strategy aims to further pursue the six key
objectives of the first phase strategy and contained 26 initiatives and 90 recommendations.
Those recommendations cover the six sub-sectors of the EMCB Project plus specific guidance
on monitoring and evaluation. The Bank is preparing a new technical assistance project (FY14)
to support the implementation of selected FINSSP II recommendations. DFID is no longer
involved in supporting the financial sector reform program, but other donors (e.g. SECO and
GIZ) have ongoing programs to support the financial sector reform and development in Ghana.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

73.     For the purpose of this ICR, Relevance of the Project was assessed in view of
Consistency with the current government and Bank strategies and Complexity as compared to
prioritization needs and existing institutional capacity.

74.    PSR part: The Relevance of this part of the Project is considered as Moderately
Unsatisfactory for the following reasons.

75.     Strategy consistency: Successive governments of Ghana have attached importance to the
role of public sector reform in economic development, and the government strategies have
always assigned priority to the strengthening of public sector capacity, streamlining of
government processes and reduction of the burden of the national budget. Although the new
PSR strategy of the current government (returned to power in December 2012) is not ready for
ICR review, the general direction of the program is not expected to be very different from the
previous reforms. Meanwhile, the 2012 - 2013 Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda
(GSGDA) has anchored on, among other things, the enhancement of transparent and accountable
governance. Public sector reforms are grouped with this strategy pillar. The design and
implementation of the PSR component was in line with the Bank’s country assistance/partner
strategy of 2004 and 2009. Based on the ICR review of the final draft Bank CPS for 2014 –
2018, improving public institutions is an important pillar. The PSR component as designed and
implemented can be considered as consistent with the current government and Bank strategies.

76.     Complexity: The main design and implementation factors discussed in Section 2 also
severely affected the relevance of the PSR part. Analysis on the causes of the past failures in
Ghana’s public sector reform conducted for the preparation of the 2009 government PSR
strategy further support a low rating of the PSR part of EMCB in this regard. Bottom-up reforms
from the line ministry level are found to have a better chance of success. The past experience
also proves that it is critical to build into a PSR program selectivity, focus and clarity. The
design of the PSR part of the Project was off track when evaluated against those benchmarks.
The 2007 project restructuring even further expanded the scope of Bank intervention. The
readjustments of the scope of the PSR part by the MTR made the component more focused in the

                                               21
last 18 months of project implementation, although the changes were only formalized before the
closure of the PSR component (June 2011). The scope of the PSR part of the Project as designed
and implemented in the larger part of the implementation period (first 4 years) was too
ambitious. The range spread out over a wide spectrum of public sector institutions without
securing ownership of the reforms by those institutions.

77.      FSR part: The Relevance of this part of the Project is Moderately Satisfactory.

78.      Strategy consistency: The FINSSP II currently under implementation has similar
objectives as FINSSP I, which include, among other things: (i) strengthening of a more
facilitative regulatory regime; (ii) development of pension and insurance industries and the
capital market; and (iii) diversification of the financial sector for improved access to finance.
Implementation of this strategy is an important policy goal of the current GSGDA. Bank support
to financial sector reforms was an important part of the country assistance/partner strategies of
2004 and 2009. The new CPS plans to continue this support. The FSR part of the Project is
consistent with the current government and Bank strategies.

79.     Complexity: International experience (e.g. Bank of Thailand’s Financial Sector Master
Plan) demonstrates that even in a more developed market with stronger institutional capacity,
sector-wide reforms should be carefully sequenced to be effective. 24 At the design phase of
EMCB the need for synergies between components and subcomponents was overlooked for the
sake of a holistic approach, while synergy in fact is a critical element of holistic approaches. In
addition, the design of the FSR part could have benefited from better sequencing. For instance,
demutualization of stock exchanges and/or other mutual institutions was mainly to expand the
capital base of a mutual. Given the small and inactive equity market, it appears that the
demutualization of GSE was not a priority to support in 2005 or in the later phases of project
implementation. If the reforms were better prioritized and sequenced the complexity of the FSR
part could have been reduced.

80.     Project relevance: Based on the above analysis of each part of the Project and given the
fact that the Project contained two broad sector reform programs; the Relevance of the whole
EMCB is Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating has also taken into consideration that, (i)
consistencies with government and Bank strategies in most of Bank financed projects is a non-
issue but complexity varies greatly between projects; and (ii) putting two completely separated
broad programs under one project was a major factor affecting the EMCB’s efficiency.




24
  The broad reform measures of Bank of Thailand’s FSMP (excluding the capital market reforms which were
addressed separately) were sequenced into three phases: Phase I, took six years (2004 – 2009), Phase II five years
(2010 – 2014) and Phase III will commence after 2014. See R. Ashley Baxter, FED/San Fransesco, Asia Focus,
July 2010

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

81.    The ICR assessment of the achievement of PDOs is based on a review of the progress (or
a lack of it) towards the intermediate (i.e. component level) targets and those results’
contributions to the achievement of the stated PDOs, as well as the inferred objectives for the
FSR part. The assessment is divided by the main milestones: 2007 restructuring which revised
the PDO, closing date of PSR part (June 2011) and closing date of FSR part (May 2013). Annex
2 provides a detailed list of the outputs delivered under the Project.

82.    Component-level results – PSR part: The progress under this part of the Project
towards achieving the intermediate results is Moderately Satisfactory. This rating takes into
account (i) the fulfillment of the original intermediate result indicator, and (ii) the significant
achievement of the revised IR targets. The retroactive nature of the revised IR indicators has
been factored into the rating.

83.      Up to end 2007: The intermediate target as recorded in the PAD and the DCA was
“initiation of a substantive reform program at a MDA (by 2006)”, although different indicators
were used in different project documents (e.g. the supervision mission aide memoirs and the
Implementation Status Reports). 25 Evaluated against the approved IR indicator, the expected
result was achieved, as the pay reform was introduced in several MDAs by December 2007.

84.     Up to mid-2011: The ICR review of this period is split into the years before the
September 2009 MTR recommendations, and those after the MTR. Evaluated against the status
of the 13 intermediate targets set by the 2007 restructuring, the progress towards achieving the
component level results in 2008 – 2009 was limited (see Section F of the Datasheet for details).
This is based on the 2009 MTR findings: even by then many planned activities were not initiated
and the PSR component as a whole was rated moderately unsatisfactory.

85.     Project implementation improved after the readjustment of the PSR part at the MTR time.
Based on the information collected at the ICR review, 14 out of the 35 main activities
(retained/revised/added after the 2007 restructuring) were completed by June 2011, and all this
was achieved after November 2010 (one activity was completed after June 2011). 26 The
completed activities that bear a clear pathway leading to the achievement of the revised PDO
(implementation of reform initiatives by MDAs to improve public sector management and
service delivery for enhanced government role as an economic facilitator) were: Development of
a new pay and pension administration framework; Strengthening of the Fair Wages and Pension




25
   For example, the indicator in the ISR was “detailed action plans for individual operations are in place and &
rigorous M & E is instituted”.
26
   Five activities were suspended in late 2009, and the rest either incomplete or never initiated as of June 2011.

                                                          23
Commission; and Restructuring of a subvented agency (GRATIS). 27 The first two activities are
directly related to the revised outcome indicator (establishment of a new pay range structure).
The last activity and possibly the retrenchments in the other three subvented agencies (GSB,
GFTA and GNPA) reduced government payroll subventions to the four agencies.

86.    Before the closure of this part of the Project, the 13 IR indicators were consolidated into
four component-level targets, which was a retroactive recognition of the 2009 readjustments.
Evaluated against those indicators, the targets were largely achieved:

     •   The 1993 Civil Service Bill was revised and submitted to the Civil Service Council and
         the PSR Secretariat (target was Civil Service Law (1993) is reviewed, finalized and
         resubmitted to Cabinet)

     •   Voluntary Retirement Programs implemented in 4 subvented agencies (target was the
         same)

     •   FWSC implemented the Single Spine Pay Scheme (target was Fair Wages and Salaries
         Commission is strengthened and resourced to implement the New Pay Policy)

     •   GRATS underwent a restructuring exercise (target was a limited subvented agencies
         reforms program is completed)

87.     Component-level results – FSR part: The progress under this part of the Project
towards achieving the component level as well as the stated intermediate results is Moderately
Satisfactory. This rating mainly takes into account (i) the limited progress in project
implementation before the PDO revision in 2007; and (ii) the achievements in 2008 – 2013.

88.     Up to end-2007: Project implementation suffered delays (mainly due to procurement
related problems and only a fraction of the available IDA financing was utilized. Progress
towards component results was limited.

89.     Up to May 2013: Project implementation overcame the earlier delays and achieved
significant results, which were not necessarily measured by the stated intermediate indicators.

90.     Component Two (Regulation and supervision of financial markets): The main results of
this component contributed to the strengthening of the regulatory regime for the securities
markets. The law review led to a new Securities Industry Act (pending cabinet and parliament
approvals) which will enhance GSEC powers in enforcement. The adoption of a web-based
market surveillance system (once launched) is expected to facilitate early detection of market
manipulation and documentation gaps, timely disclosure of public information, and filing of
investor complaints. The GSEC’s offsite surveillance now covers all the financial institutions
regulated by the capital market regulator.


27
  The establishment of the customer service units and call centers should have contributed to the achievement of the
project objective, but the information collected at ICR review suggested that many of the units became dysfunctional
after the MOPSR was dissolved.

                                                        24
91.    Component Three (Banking and NBFI regulation and supervision): The project
interventions resulted in the enhanced operational efficiency of the BOG. The number of days to
clear checks was reduced from three days (within the two main urban centers) or two weeks
(mainly rural areas) to within 24 hours. A permanent monitoring unit now regularly collects data
on the cross-border capital flows. A number of automated systems for central bank operations,
banking supervision, data management, HR management and BOG staff training further
enhanced BOG’s operational efficiency.

92.     Component Four (Insurance regulation and supervision): The interventions under the
component mainly helped lay down the basis for enhancing NIC’s operational efficiency and the
industry training capacity. An automated administrative system (once adapted and launched)
will enable NIC to undertake risk-based off-site surveillance, and the web-based reporting portal
(once launched) to facilitate timely submission and analysis of supervision returns. 28 The support
to the two industry training institutions provided a new curriculum and the Chartered Insurance
Professional course books.

93.    Component Five (Strengthening of capital markets): The component interventions
contributed to the development of capital markets. The Rules for the Alternate Market guide the
operation of the secondary board for SMEs. A South Africa Gold Fund was listed at the GSE
following the issuance of the Rules for the Operation of Exchange Traded Funds.            The
automation of the trading processes together with GSE’s adoption of an automated clearing and
settlement system reduced transaction related risks. A new regulation was developed which
(when implemented) would enhance GSE governing council through a reduction of council
members (from 13 to 9) and clear requirements for members’ qualifications, tenure and
appointment mode.

94.     Component Six (Pension sector development): This component contributed to the
establishment of the new pension schemes and the pension sector regulator. An actuarial review
of the sustainability of the SSNIT fed into the development of the December 2008 new pensions
law. The support to the setting up of the National Pensions Regulatory Agency (NPRA) helped
the regulator to become operational sooner. At the time of ICR review, the NPRA has issued
regulations on the basic national social security (Tier 1 scheme) and the occupational and
personal pension schemes (Tier 2 and 3), as well as licensed many private sector fund managers
for Tier 2 and Tier 3 schemes. Given the products produced by the NPRA, the NPRA has
become operational.

95.     Component Seven (Access to finance and financial sector governance): The technical
assistance provided under this component focused on institutional capacity building for
improved access to finance (e.g. staff training of RCB Apex Bank, GHAMFIN, VCTF and FIC).
In addition, this component achieved several results important to the general financial sector
development:



28
  The system (Vizor MIS) was being tested as of August 2013 using real insurer data submitted in December 2012
and March 2013. Initial test results point to the need of system adaptation to local conditions.

                                                      25
      (i)   Sector strategy development – The assessment of the outcomes of FINSSP I (2003), the
            2010 Finscope demand side survey findings, and the consultation process and the costing
            of reforms feed into the preparation of FINSSP II (2011).

     (ii) Legal and regulatory framework – 15 bills were enacted or passed with the Project
          support and draft guidelines on corporate bond issues and credit rating are now available.

     (iii) Institutional development – The FSD/MOFEP was repositioned as a permanent unit in
           charge of the overall financial sector development. Staffing and equipment support
           helped improve the coverage and quality of RCB inspections by the ARB Apex Bank.
           Training on the uses of an international standard data collection tool enabled GHAMFIN
           to benchmark Ghana’s MFIs and analyze the development trends of the industry. 29 Other
           direct results include the setting up of the Financial Intelligence Center (FIC) and the
           financing of reviews of VCTF’s investment portfolios).

     (iv) Government debt management – The government borrowing operation was separated
          from the BOG. The incorporation of the debt strategy in the annual national budget
          improved debt planning. The automation of the national debt records improved debt
          reporting and information sharing.

96.      In addition to those noticeable results leading to the progress towards strengthened
regulatory regimes and improved regulators’ operational efficiency, most of the FSR components
achieved the formal intermediate targets to various degrees. Some of the achievements may be
directly attributed largely or partially to the project interventions. For instance: (i) the
establishment and implementation of a basic framework for public and private pension design
and regulation (an intermediate result of Component 7 with contributions from Component 1);
(ii) a boom of private investment funds from five in 2005 to a total number of 217 by the end of
2012; and (iii) the dematerialized transactions of GSE. Both the FSD/MOFEP and the
implementing agencies reported good results from a large number of staff/industry training
activities and sensitization/dissemination/public education workshops. Unfortunately there were
no ex-post/follow-up reports on the effect and/or behavioral changes as a result of the capacity
building support. For further details regarding the status of the formal intermediate targets,
please refer to Section F of the Datasheet.

97.      PDO achievement: The project performance up to the end of 2007 in achieving the
original PDO and outcome indicators (as well as the main intended objectives of the FSR part)
was Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating takes into account: (i) a pay reform was initiated in a
number of MDAs; (ii) but the PSR program was not further prioritized and sequenced;
(iii) responsibility among government agencies for public sector reforms were not clarified; and
(iv) implementation suffered serious delays under the FSR part.

98.     The project performance from 2008 to May 2013 in achieving the revised PDO and
outcome indicators (as well as the inferred objectives of the FSR part) was Moderately
Satisfactory. This rating takes into account: (i) the achievement of the revised PSR outcome

(iii) the likely contribution of the project results to the strengthening of financial sector
governance (a formally set PDO) in terms of regulatory quality. Table 2 summarizes the main
outcomes achieved. However, there is a lack of data to report and validate the actual
improvements in service delivery and strengthened enforcement ability of the financial
regulators.

99.      PSR part: The PSR part overcame many design and implementation defects and
achieved the revised outcome indicator. The original project-level target (enhanced structure,
strategy and responsibility within government for public sector reform) might have been more or
less outdated since the bulk of work related to the establishment of the MOPSR and the
development of the PSR strategy had been completed by the time of project approval. Evidence
appeared later shows that the responsibility of the MOPSR was limited and the ministry was
unable to take lead in, or coordinate among, various public sector reform programs managed by
different MDAs. On the other hand, a pay reform had been initiated in several MDAs by the end
of 2007, which could be considered as an important step towards the original PDO of
“facilitating a reform initiative for improved public sector management and service delivery”.

100. The revised outcome indicator was “establishment of a new pay range structure to guide
pay awards”. The Single Spine Pay Structure (SSPS) became effective in June 2010, and by the
end of 2011 the remuneration of 98 percent of the public sector employees was migrated onto the
structure. Before the adoption of the SSPS, Ghana’s civil servants were paid under more than
100 salary structures. The SSPS is a 25-grade structure and the pay level is determined by job
evaluations based on a common job evaluation plan. The SSPS enhanced “equal pay for work of
equal value”, although it is too soon to observe the direct impact of the improved incentives
scheme on the public sector management and service delivery, or the enhancement of the
Government’s role as an economic facilitator.

101. FSR part: Commendable results were achieved under the FSR components after the
project management and implementation agencies overcame the early year delays. Those results
were mainly found in two areas: Strengthening of regulatory regimes and Improvement of
regulators’ operational efficiency. Examples of the first group of results included: (i) the draft
Securities Industry Law (pending cabinet and parliament approvals) which is to remove
regulatory overlaps and enhance GSEC’s enforcement powers; and (ii) the 2008 Pension Act
which establishes a uniform set of rules, regulations and standards for the administration and
payment of pensions in both the public and private sectors. The laws and regulations reviewed
or adopted with the Project’s contributions are said to have improved the conformity of Ghana’s
financial sector regulatory framework with international standards (e.g. IOSCO principles).

102. A good example of the second group of results was BOG’s automated check clearing
system which enables payments to be settled within the day. Faster and safer payments usually
help businesses and public sector institutions to better manage contractual relations, default risk
and cash flows. Another example was the computerized management information system
installed in the NIC. Once launched the submissions of quarterly and annual supervision returns
would reach 100 percent. It would also allow the NIC to pick up early warning signals as the
supervision returns become timely and complete.

103. In addition, the Project contributed to the setting up of the National Pensions Regulatory
Agency, and the Financial Intelligence Center. Those regulatory institutions were in full
operation and their establishment filled in the missing building blocks of the regulatory
framework for Ghana’s financial sector. The establishment and strengthening of a permanent
unit in charge of the financial sector development in the Ministry of Finance and Economic



                                                28
Planning enhanced the government’s role in providing strategic guidance for the financial sector
reform.

104. The ICR review has also made an effort to assess the progress towards the strengthening
of governance and competitiveness (stated PDO targets) by indicators which would better
measure those targets. The indicator that measures governance and reflects what the Project
intended to achieve originally is Regulatory Quality. This is broadly defined by the World Bank
as the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that
permit and promote private sector development.

105. The FSR part contributed to the development and the strengthening of the regulatory
regimes for securities, insurance and pensions industries. The FSR components supported the
establishment of permanent regulatory/oversight institutions, such as the BOG’s capital flow
watchdog, the MOF’s FSD unit and the NPRA. Unfortunately, there was no impact analysis of
the project results on regulatory quality, i.e. the regulators’ ability to enforce the laws and
regulations. Based on the recent IMF review, significant gaps and inconsistencies remain in the
financial sector laws. In addition, the regulation and supervision of foreign banks in Ghana as
well as the much needed restructuring of two weak banks will test the regulatory quality. 30 The
impact of the project interventions on the stated PDO objective of enhanced financial sector
competitiveness is more difficult to verify. According to the same IMF report, Ghana’s banking
system is competitive when assessed against the competitiveness metrics of barriers to entry and
concentration of assets. On the other hand, the playground is tilted towards the State due to the
significant state-ownership of the sector (e.g. by BOG). Given these considerations, the best
effort conclusion of the ICR review is that the FSR part may have contributed to the strengthened
financial sector governance in terms of regulatory quality.

106. Financial deepening in Ghana registered good progress during the lifecycle of the Project.
Assessed against the two gross metrics of the Project (formally set outcome indicators), the gross
banking credit to the private sector grew by 84 percent per annum (old series, 2005 – 2012) or
40 percent per annum (new series, 2006 – 2012). The gross enterprise deposits at banks showed
an even faster growth (2.5 times, old series or 40 percent, new series). 31 Assessed against the
international standard benchmark of financial deepening, the net domestic credit to private sector
as a percentage of GDP also inched up, from 11 percent in 2006 to 16 percent in 2012. Given
the size of Ghana’s GDP (US$40.7 billion, 2012), a number of favorable macroeconomic and
sector-level factors must be at play and would better explain those increases.

3.3        Efficiency

107. PSR part: There was no quantitative analysis at appraisal. At that time it was
determined that a NPV analysis was not appropriate for this Projector. However, a limited cost
effectiveness analysis could have been conducted for the pay reform, the removal of ghost
workers and the subvented agency retrenchment programs. Neither was any qualitative analysis
conducted on project efficiency.

     Data on the two gross metrics are based on the Bank of Ghana statistics.

                                                       29
108. FSR part: The appraisal only provided two or three examples of the would-be monetary
values at the national economy level which was too indirect for the appraisal of the efficiency of
the project pe se. While a NPV-type of analysis may not be appropriate for the planned
interventions, there should have been qualitative analysis of project benefits and costs by
comparing with the efficiency of similar projects or that of a situation without the Project.

109. ICR analysis: The ICR review is unable to conduct an ex-post cost effectiveness
analysis. It appears documentation and records keeping of project data were quite weak.
Collection of data on results and outcomes for the ICR purpose took months. The project
documents of a couple of related projects were reviewed and those reports suffered similar
weaknesses in economic analysis of project efficiency. 32 This ICR evaluates the EMCB
efficiency in the following aspects.

•    Outcomes: The expected outcome (revised) of the PSR part was achieved – A new pay range
     structure became effective. The intended outcomes (inferred) of the FSR part were also
     achieved – There was significant progress towards strengthened regulatory regimes of
     securities, insurance and pensions markets and the operational efficiency of those sectors’
     regulators as well as that of the BOG and the FSD/MOFEP was improved.

•    Costs: The cost for achieving the PSR outcome was approximately USD13.1 million
     (including over US$3.4 million for the retrenchment programs of the four subvented
     agencies). The cost of achieving the FSR outcomes was around USD27.7 million, including
     USD22 million IDA financing, USD2.7 million DFID financing, USD2.2 million SECO
     financing and USD0.9 million GOG financing. 33 The costs were substantial and some of the
     project financed consultant reports which were either not finalized or did not lead to on-the-
     ground results.

•    Capacity building: This category of project activities accounted for over 30 percent of the
     actual total cost of the FSR part. 34 All most all the IAs of this part of the project reported
     benefits from capacity building. However, the modus operandi of the project interventions
     for capacity building was piecemeal training activities, and a large part of which was
     conducted overseas. Implementation of many activities was consultant driven with uncertain
     impact on in-house capacity. There was no arrangement for knowledge dissemination; nor
     was there any assessment of training effectiveness. Those mechanisms should have been
     built into the Project at appraisal or through the project restructurings. This is another sign
     that the complexity and the wide span of control affected project effectiveness.

   Data on the final cost of the PSR part was provided by the PSR Secretariat as of October 2011. Data on the IDA,
DFID and SECO financing of the FSR part are from the World Bank Client Connection ( as of Sept 30, 2013), and
that on the GOG financing of the FSR part is provided by the MOFEP.
34
   Training amounted to over 19 percent of the actual total cost of the PSR part at project closure, and
Meetings/Seminars/Workshops close to 12 percent (MOFEP data).

                                                        30
•     Duration: The implementation period was very long for a largely technical assistance project.
      The PSR outcome took five and half years to achieve, and the FSR outcomes took almost
      seven and half years to achieve. Given Ghana’s four-year cycle of presidential elections and
      consequent government changes, project implementation suffered from institutional memory
      loss (PSR part) and gaps between official replacements (FSR part).

110. Based on the above analysis, the Project is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory in terms of
efficiency.

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

111.     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

112. The Project provided modest but meaningful support to the GOG to eventually become a
facilitator of economic development. The pay management aspect of public sector management
was improved and there should be better incentive for the public sector employees to improve
service delivery, due to the pay reform. The financial sector regulatory role of the government is
critical to ensure sustained economic development. This role was improved thanks to the
strengthened financial regulatory regimes and improved operational efficiency of the beneficiary
regulators. The upward factors considered include: (i) the Project’s consistency with the current
Government and Bank strategies; (ii) the achievement of the revised PSR Outcome Indicator;
(iii) the achievement of the FSR part’s inferred objectives; and (iv) the common practice in ICR
reviews to give more weight to project efficacy among the three main evaluation categories of
outcomes. On the other hand, the Project was too complex to be effective and efficient; the
original PSR outcome indicator was not achieved; and the data difficulties in validating actual
improvements in service delivery by the public sector employees and those in financial sector
supervision enforcement.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

113. There was no direct impact as the Project was not designed to directly address those
issues.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

114. The most dramatic institutional change took place in the pensions sector. Before the
Project, pensions were managed solely by SSNIT, which kindly regulated itself. The Project
contributed to the establishment of a three-tier pension system. New pension contributions to the
occupational and individual schemes are gradually being managed by private sector fund
managers, which are regulated by the NPRA.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

115.     Not Applicable

3.6       Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

116. A questionnaire was provided to the FSD/MOFEP and the PSR Secretariat and through
them the implementing agencies with an attempt to collect feedback on the project design and
performance. The FSD/MOFEP and three FSR implementing agencies provided brief comments.
A summary of those responses is available upon request.

117. In general, the IAs were satisfied with the project design and implementation, in
particular the project’s contributions to the development of a modern legal and regulatory
framework, supervision capacity building, establishment of a basic framework for access to
finance, and growth of the private equity industry. They also pointed out a number of
shortcomings related to the ambitious project scope, a lack of synergies between components, the
difficulties with the design and implementation of the M&E framework/indicators, and financing
shortfalls for operational system automations.

118.      The frequently cited causes of implementation delays included:

      •   Lack of project management skills and expertise

      •   Unforeseen technical difficulties and lack of technical capacity

      •   Weakened management commitment due to changes in institutional policy and/or
          priorities

      •   Changes in main staff for project management and implementation

      •   The World Bank’s procurement guidelines and procedures

4.        Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

119.      Rating: Moderate

120. Technical: From the technical perspective, the risk to the development outcomes is
negligible to low. The main project outcomes (e.g. the Single Spine Pay Structure and the
enhanced securities or insurance laws) follow the international standards. Government agencies
in charge of the implementation and improvement of the outcomes have been put into place (e.g.
the Fair Wages and Salary Commission and the FSD of the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning).

121. Financial: From the financial perspective, the risk to the PSR outcome can be moderate
to significant. This is related to the need to further streamline the government agencies and
remove ghost workers, in order to make the reform more sustainable. The risk to the FSR
outcomes is moderate. Donors are working with the Government to design new programs in
support of continuous strengthening of financial sector’s regulatory regimes. However, more
attention should be paid by the project beneficiaries on the costing and financing for continuous

                                                  32
improvements of operational efficiency. Automated operational systems are necessary but costly
investments, and their maintenance and upgrading should be planned and budgeted. Regular
system audits can ensure that there is value for the money.

122. Political: From the political perspective, the risk to continuous public sector reform is
considered as moderate to significant, due to the well-known challenges of the reform (some of
which have been discussed elsewhere in this ICR). The risk to continuous financial sector
reform is negligible to low in the medium-term, as the Government is implementing the FISSP II
with the support of the donor community.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

123.   Rating: Unsatisfactory

124. The Bank responded to the government requests for support of public sector reform and
implementation of FINSSP. The project design was aligned with the GOG and Bank strategies.
The plan to pool donor resources under the Project was a good approach for coordinated DP
interventions and ensured plenty funding of the Project.

125. The decision to combine two broad programs of limited synergies under one Bank
investment operation was a major factor leading to the less than satisfactory outcomes. The
management decision to combine those programs under one project was said to have been
influenced more by budget and staffing concerns, rather than technical soundness and
implications for implementation. Good recommendations were made at the QER time to
improve the design of the PSR part. However, the approved project design did not incorporate
those recommendations (perhaps due to the time limit). Lessons from the previous PSR and FSR
operations in Ghana, in particular those about the scope and complexity of projects were not
adequately incorporated in project design.

126. The decision to let a unit without public sector reform expertise to manage a PSR
program for the sake of a bigger single investment in the Bank portfolio did not work, even if
technical support from the PSR colleagues could have been timely and adequate. This is partly
due to the fact that neither the Bank nor the client were organized and funded to conduct those
complex cross-sector operations well. Other factors considered include the design defects of the
implementation arrangement for the PSR part and the results framework for project monitoring
and evaluation. The lack of proper project economic analysis is also a downward factor
considered for the rating.

(b) Quality of Supervision

127.   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory



                                              33
128. The Bank team made commendable efforts in supervising project implementation. The
2009 mid-term review save the PSR part from failing to achieve the PDOs, and the supervision.
The FSR components overcame the challenges brought by the wide span of control (6 main
subsectors of the financial system, about 3 dozens of main activities, and ten implementing
agencies), with a view to providing timely support to the implementation of FINSSP and
FINSSP II. The Bank maintained a cordial working relationship with the MOFEP which was in
charge of the overall implementation of the FSR part.

129. On the downside, it took the Bank too long (almost four years after the Board approval)
to squarely face the design weaknesses of the PSR part. Furthermore, even when the problems
were recognized and the scope of the PSR part reduced in 2009, the needed project restructuring
was not carried out until June 2011. The challenges rising from the wide span of control under
the FSR part was not fully recognized. More new activities were added late in project
implementation without first analyzing their synergy with the project objectives and the
implication for project efficiency. The FSR part should have undergone a detailed review
similar to that of the PSR part at the MTR time, so that project supervision could be better
oriented towards results.

130. Another major weakness can be found in project M&E and reporting. It appears that
inadequate attention was given to the quality of the deliverables. There was more reporting on
the status of the processes which did not do credit to the policy and/or technical discussions the
Bank team must have conducted with the counterparts (e.g. the design of subvented agency
retrenchment programs or the need to revise the 2006 insurance law to make it more in line with
the latest IAIS core principles). The supervision reports were not quite candid about the status of
the PSR part before the 2009 MTR, or the challenges faced by the FSR IAs (such as those
identified by the ICR questionnaire respondents). Project restructurings should be good
opportunities to analyze the progress made towards achieving the PDOs. However, only general
remarks about the progresses were made in the Project Papers. The reluctance to revise the FSR
part of the PDOs and its outcome indicators turned out to be a major hurdle to timely and candid
evaluation of the progress towards the project objectives. Those supervision weaknesses might
be partly attributed to the lack of supervision budget. The supervision budget allocation based
on the regional average did not allow adequate participation of different technical expertise in the
Bank team for the ambitious project (e.g. colleagues experienced in the regulation and/or
institutional development of banking, securities, insurance, and pension industries).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

131.   Rating: Unsatisfactory

132. This rating takes into account the Bank performance in project design (Unsatisfactory)
and supervision (Moderately Unsatisfactory). Positive factors accounted for are the strategic
alignment, the provision of plenty of funding, and the quick responses to client’s requests, while
the main factors pulling down the rating include the ambitious project scope and the inadequate
attention to impact and efficiency.

5.2       Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

133.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

134. The Government’s PSR strategy and FISSP I provided the basis for the project design. In
particular, the GOG had maintained strong ownership of the financial sector reform program,
and promptly implemented reform measures once they were formally adopted (e.g. establishment
of FIC and NPRA and reposition of FSD/MOFEP). The participatory approach in the
development and implementation of the two FISSPs ensured continuous commitment of the
implementing agencies to the objectives of the FSR components. The role of the FSD/MOFEP
was critical in ensuring the achievement of the expected results of the FSR components. The
Ministry of Public Sector Reform and later the Public Sector Reform Secretariat might have
played a similar role although information on this PMU’s performance is not available.
However, several important factors were overlooked at the design phase, such as the need to
assign one government agency as the overall owner of the whole project. Project M&E was
weak for both the PSR and the FSR parts, and this includes a lack of proper record keeping.
Capacity was limited for data collection and analysis.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

135.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

136. There were 10 implementing agencies for the PSR part of the Project (see Section A of
the Datasheet for details). Specific information on the implementation performance by each IA
is not available. From a result oriented perspective, it appears that the main PSR IAs’
performance was possibly moderately satisfactory, in particular:

      •   The Office of the Head of the Civil Service – Revision of the Civil Service Bill and
          Transformation of the Civil Service Training Colleague

      •   The Fair Wages and Salary Commission – Implementation of the pay reform
          program/SSPS

      •   The GRATIS Foundation – Retrenchment program and restructuring exercise

137. Ten financial sector regulators and/or operators implemented the FSR components (see
Section A of the Datasheet). Again, historical data on individual IA performance is missing.
Assessed by the results achieved, the FSR IAs’ performance is at least moderately satisfactory;
and the following agencies in particular had achieved major results:

      •   The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning – FISSP I review and FISSP II
          preparation, Review/preparation/amendments of laws, and Development of the
          government debt management strategy

                                                  35
     •   The Ghana Securities and Exchange Commission – Amendments of the securities law
         and Improvements of operational efficiency

     •   The Bank of Ghana – Improvements of operational efficiency

     •   The National Insurance Commission – Preparation and implementation of the 2006
         insurance law and Improvements of operational efficiency

     •   The NPRA – Initiation of the new regulator and Implementation of the 2008 pension law

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

138.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

139. This rating takes into account the performance of the Government as represented by the
MOPSR/PSR Secretariat and the FSD/MOFEP; as well as the performance of the
implementation agencies. The performance of implementing agencies could have been rated
higher based on the final results, but the ICR review has to factor in the lack of detailed
information on the performance of each IA, the moderately unsatisfactory overall performance of
the PSR part in 2008 – 2009, and the serious delays in project implementation in the first two
years under the FSR part. The neglect on project efficiency is another downward factor.

6.       Lessons Learned

140. Several important lessons have been learnt from this challenging project, in addition to
the repeated lessons about the importance of selectivity and sequencing.

141. Synergy is critical in cross-sector approach: This was overlooked when the PSR and
the FSR programs were combined. Cross-sector approach could work if there is synergy: e.g.
government debt management in public sector reform (e.g. forecasting, planning and cash
management) and domestic bond market development in financial sector reform (e.g. primary
and secondary markets, institutional investors).

142. Span of control is important: While there were synergies between some of the main
activities of the different FSR components (e.g. RCB regulation and access to finance), the FSR
part of the Project was populated by a large number of activities implemented by different
agencies. Consequently, more energy was spent on keeping the project moving, rather than
focusing on the results. Even if a sector-wide approach is appropriate, there has to be gives-and-
takes between the theoretical presumptions and practicality. The institutional capacity of the
Bank’s managing unit, as well as of the client and the implementing agencies, has to be
considered when determining how wide a sector-wide approach should be.

143. Instrument of intervention has to fit: Given the open-endedness of the PSR program in
the design phase, it appears an adaptable or more phased-in instrument would be more fitting.
The selected instrument (SIL) is more fitting for operations where specific activities have been

                                               36
developed with costing; and the objectives are expected to be achieved within no longer than the
medium-term (e.g. 5 years).

144. Quality assurance should not be once for all: There was only one QER close to the
decision meeting for appraisal and project negotiation. It appears that before the Project was
submitted for Board review, the design was not checked to see if the QER and decision meeting
recommendations were incorporated. For a project as complex as the EMCB, it would be better
to conduct QER earlier, for instance in the pre-appraisal phase, and a follow-up QER be carried
out at the appraisal time to ensure the incorporation of QER recommendations. Quality at
supervision review should also be planned and conducted for complex projects and projects
which require several rounds of restructurings and closing date extensions.

145. Reform strategy should be broadly owned: The financial sector part of the Project
benefited from strong ownership of the reform strategy by the GOG and the regulatory
authorities, thanks to the participatory approach in years of FINSSP development. The regular
FSAP updates (2003, 2006 and 2011) gave the Bank a handle on the status of Ghana’s financial
sector. Without it the Bank would not be able to provide technical advice to the development
and updating of the government reform strategy. Those elements were critical in overcoming (at
least partially) the challenges brought by the overly ambitious scope and the wide span of control.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

146. At the time of this ICR, only the Financial Sector Division of the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning provided a self-assessment of the FSR part of the Project. The Ministry
found that the objectives of the Project were consistent with the Government’s Medium-Term
Policy Framework. The Project was considered as generally satisfactory. The outcome
indicators were deemed to have been achieved as there were improvements in financial
deepening and competitive environment. The performance of the Government and the World
Bank were also deemed satisfactory despite the frequent changes of Bank task team leaders and
government officials in charge. The government took the ownership of the Project by setting up
and leading the project steering committee and conducting frequent dialogue to sensitize the
implementing agencies and the management on progress made under the Project.

147. According to the MOFEP assessment, the implementation challenges were incurred
mainly in the earlier phases of project implementation, and included Slow decision making in
implementation process by the IAs; inadequate personnel to handle the technical aspects of IAs’
procurement and monitoring & evaluation; World Bank delays in the approval processes affected
the rest of those processes; and Frequent Changes of World Bank task team leaders and
government officials resulted in temporary slowdown of activities. The MOFEP found that some
of component-level indicators for the FSR part were not relevant given the institutional, growth
and development of the country (e.g. number of the credit reporting bureau operational, on-site
inspections coverage of insurers by the NIC). Among the lessons learnt, there were the needs to:
(i) encourage sub-sector specific interventions rather than the all-inclusive approach which
involves too many implementing agencies for implementation; (ii) review periodically the

                                               37
indicators to reflect changing economic and environmental conditions; and (iii) have a dedicated
staff in each implementing agency to manage (and coordinate between) different components.
The MOFEP’s self-assessment report is available upon request, and a more detailed summary of
the report is provided in Annex 7.

148.       The ICR review has no major reservations of the MOFEP assessments.

(b) Cofinanciers

149. The FSR part of the Project benefited from the participation and co-financing of the UK’s
Department for International Development (DFID), and Switzerland’s State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs (SECO).

150. DFID originally contributed GBP 2.6 million (US$5 million equivalent at the exchange
rate in August 2007) to the pooled fund for the FSR part. At the time of the conclusion of DFID
involvement, more than GBP1.6 million was disbursed and the unutilized funding (GBP0.98
million) was cancelled. The decision not to co-finance the Project in the extended
implementation period was in line with the realignment of DFID’s priorities with wider UK
Government priorities, as DFID Ghana withdrew from engagement in the PSR and FSR
sectors. 35

151. In October 2011, DFID issued the Project Completion Report for Financial Sector
Reform, which covered the EMCB Project. 36 In general, DFID found that the expected outputs
were only partially achieved, although significant progress was made during the project period in
the expansion of financial services to MSMEs and poor and rural households. Two lessons were
learnt. First, country ownership of projects is a significant factor in the success of projects
(referring to the two main activities under Component 7 (FinScope and Remittance Country
Partnership) which DFID particularly championed. Second, procurement expertise is important
for the speedy implementation of a project such as EMCB. DFID found that an early investment
in procurement expertise at the level of the relevant implementing agencies would have
significantly enhanced project implementation. Annex 8 has reproduced the Executive Summary
of the DFID report.

152. SECO joined the partnership for the FSR part of the EMCB in August 2009 and
originally contributed USD2.44 million. When SECO concluded the engagement in April 30,
2013, USD2.23 million was disbursed and the rest of the funding cancelled.

153. SECO has provided a brief summary of the DP’s views of the EMCB Project in October
2013 which can be found in Annex 8. The participating development partner found that the
operation was and still is very relevant. SECO also recognized that the broad design has paved
the way for more dialogue and coordination among regulators and associated stakeholders in the
sector. The main shortcomings were attributed to the large number of implementers, a certain
disconnect between high level aggregate objectives, indicators and activities, and a large number

challenges recognized included inadequate human resources at the expense of results monitoring
and guidance for prioritization and sequencing of the project activities. SECO is inconclusive as
to whether the EMCB achieved the expected impact of the program.

154.   The ICR review has no major comments of the views of DFID and SECO.

                               Financial Sector Reform Part
                                    (October 14, 2013)
A. Overview
   • The achievement of the overall project objectives of the EMCB-FSR project, as well as
      the World Bank and Government’s performance, is generally deemed to be satisfactory.
   • The Government took ownership of the project by putting in place the necessary
      institutional structure, i.e. the Ghana steering Committee to oversee and provide high-
      level monitoring for implementation of the financial sector reform. The financial sector
      division of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) provided day-to-
      day project management.
   • The listing of companies on GSE improved significantly. Total market capitalization
      improved significantly mainly due to increases in the prices of the shares and additional
      listings by the 34 listed companies.
   • A notable achievement was also seen in the regulatory environment through the
      enactment of financial sector laws for the Banking & NBFI, Insurance, Pensions and
      Capital Markets industries.
   • The pooled funding arrangement was appropriate.
   • The project design in terms of collaboration with the Public Sector Reform is deemed as
      not to be the best as it combined two reforms under one project with no appropriate
      communication channels.

B. Impact
   • The capital market saw an increase in activities and higher visibility of its products.
      The computerized systems for data storage and transmission, market surveillance and
      regulatory compliance and the on-site inspection activities by the GSEC instilled greater
      confidence in the transparency of GSEC operation and the market. The automation of the
      GSE resulted in improved efficiency, information dissemination, capacity and market
      competitiveness. The implementation of the 2nd tier pension scheme led to market
      liquidity improvements.
   • The Banking and NBFI industry benefited from improved efficiency and more
      transparency in bank products and access to bank information. The rural banks can better
      compete with other financial institutions and big commercial banks. Reports of fraudulent
      activities in RCBs were reduced to the minimum. The capacity building programs and the
      airing of a documentary on venture capital financing contributed to the significant
      increases of the number of applications for venture capital financing.
   • The insurance industry experienced remarkable improvements in the legal and
      regulatory framework and NIC’s operational capacity. The installed systems for
      management information and regulatory analysis improved submission of data and
      required reports by insurers, as well as the preparation and analysis of market statistics
      for early warning purposes. Foreign participation of the local insurance market increased
      together with the growth in the number of local insurance companies.

                                               52
C. Results Framework
   • The PDO is considered as aligned to the Government’s Medium Term Policy Framework
      (2006).
   • The overall outcome indicators were all met with the exception of a few component
      based indicators.
   • The improved levels of financial deepening and intermediation were the result of the
      growth and diversification of financial institutions and services over the years.
   • The competition environment was improved with the licensing of some regional banks.
   • Some of component-level indicators for the FSR part of the project were not relevant
      given the institutional, growth and development of the country, specifically:
       Number of the credit reporting bureau operational in country: The small economy
          does not need four operational Credit Referencing Bureaus as the project targeted.
       On-site inspections of insurers by the NIC: The indicator contradicted with Section
          165 (4) of Act 74 (2006), which requires inspection of insurers at least once every
          two years, instead of every year as the project targeted.
       The Long Term Savings Act: This indicator became redundant due to the passage of
          the Pensions Act (2008).
       Compliance with Basel Core Principles: The indicator measures the compliance
          based on the 1999 BCP Assessment Methodology which was 100%, while the
          compliance level would fall to 88% by the 2006 methodology.
       Compliance with IAIS: The target was not achieved due to the current legal and
          regulation environment of the insurance industry. The expected passage of the revised
          NIC Act would increase the compliance level.

D. Challenges during early periods of implementation
   • Slow decision making in implementation process by the IAs led to a slowdown of the
     implementation process when approvals are granted by IDA/MOFEP.
   • Delayed reimbursements were caused by two problems at the IA level: Failure to submit
     accurate documentation to facilitate speedy re-imbursement of these activities; and late
     application for re-imbursement or request for No-objection.
   • Requirements of submission of quarterly and annual reports by IAs were often not met
     (late or no submissions), and inaccurate reporting by some IAs was a major challenge.
   • There were inadequate personnel to handle the technical aspects of IAs’ procurement and
     monitoring & evaluation and a lack of effective communication with the IAs on the
     issues faced.
   • World Bank delays in the approval processes affected the rest of those processes and put
     pressure on the internal resources of various IAs which was a cause of underachievement
     of the expected results.
   • Overloaded yearly Work Plan by some IAs resulted in little or no achievement in the year,
     and the two project extensions to accommodate incomplete activities.
   • Lack of Adequate Funds for several activities which had to be cancelled.
   • Frequent Changes of World Bank task team leaders and government officials resulted in
     temporary slowdown of activities.
   • Delivery of imported goods suffered delays due to the difficulties in securing approvals
     for exemption from duties/taxes on goods secured from outside Ghana.


                                              53
E. Lessons learnt
   1. There is a need to consider insurance cover for delicate assets acquired under the projects.
   2. There is a need for IAs to have a dedicated staff to manage (and coordinate between)
      their components under the project.
   3. Project indicators should be reviewed periodically to reflect changing economic and
      environmental conditions.
   4. Financial Literacy Education should be sustained over a long period rather than the once
      a year annual financial literacy program.
   5. There is a need to encourage sub-sector specific interventions rather than the all-inclusive
      approach which involves too many IAs for implementation.

                  Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
                      Ghana Economic Management Capacity (P092986)

In October 2011, DFID issued a project completion report for financial sector reform in Ghana,
which covered the development partner’s participation of the EMCB Project. In addition, the
ICR review has received SECO’s summary views of the Project. Below is the Executive
Summary of DFID’s report and SECO’s summary views.

DFID Executive Summary

Quote:
“The EMCB project was designed as a multi-Development Partner SWAp support to the
Government of Ghana under a basket funding arrangement. DFID committed GBP 1.3 million 37
through the EMCB to support the government to define and perform its role as a facilitator for
economic development by establishing a level playing field in the financial sector focusing on
outcomes rather than new institutions. The DFID support was specifically targeted at Component
7 of the EMCB: Access to Finance and Financial Sector Governance. Under this component, two
major initiatives were targeted by DFID for support: the FinScope Survey and the Remittance
Country Partnership.

The log frame for the SFSR established the following Goal, Purpose and Outputs:

Goal: Expansion of private sector financial services for micro, small and medium enterprises and
poor rural and urban households

Purpose: Improved capacity of Ghana's financial sector to meet the needs of micro, small and
medium enterprises and poor rural and urban households

Outputs
 Achievement of Financial Sector Reform development objectives as specified in the World
Bank Economic Management and Capacity-Building Project Appraisal
 Enhanced financial sector policies and products
 Regular Information available to users/beneficiaries of remittances to increase transparency
and competition
 Remittance Country Partnership Grants allocated to private sector for the development of
innovative remittance projects

The indicators for the outputs suggest that the outputs had only been partially realized as at June
30, 2011. The activities that were to drive the outputs were either delayed (FinScope Survey) or
did not quite get off the ground (remittances). The most recent World Bank Project
Implementation Mission rated the project as Moderately Satisfactory.
Despite the setbacks in the implementation of these specific project activities, significant
progress was made during the project period towards the project purpose as reflected in the
expansion of financial services to MSMEs and poor and rural households. The number of
financial institutions providing pro-poor services increased and deposits in rural and community
banks grew at an annual rate well in excess of inflation.



37
  This must be a typo as the relevant legal documents showed that DFID originally provided GBP2.6 million
(USD5 million equivalent) to cofinance the FSR part of the Project.
                                                      55
These results have driven some important gains in the realization of project goals. Credit to the
private sector has increased above targets, several laws have been passed to enhance financial
regulation and regulatory supervision and compliance has been significantly improved.

On balance, the risks associated with the project were as expected from start. While the risks
anticipated with regard to FinScope did not materialize, the risks of the remittance component
materialized, reflected in minimal implementation of the component activities as at June 2011.

Programme management was supported by DFID’s active role in the Steering Committee and all
implementation support missions. However, the implementation of the project was negatively
impacted by turnover of government personnel (Minister, Chief Director and Director of
Financial Sector Division of MOFEP) and the World Bank Task Team Leader. In addition, the
lack of procurement expertise within the implementing agencies resulted in extremely weak
implementation during the first year of the project.

The lessons to be learned from the project are twofold. First, country ownership of projects is a
significant factor in the success of projects. In was noted, for example, that the two projects
championed by DFID (FinScope and Remittance Country Partnership) were not part of the
recommendations of FINSSP suggesting that they were not fully demand driven and thus
suffered from a lack of interest by the relevant stakeholders. Second, procurement expertise is
important for the speedy implementation of a project such as EMCB. An early investment in
procurement expertise at the level of the relevant implementing agencies would have
significantly enhanced project implementation.”

SECO summary views

Quote:
“In October 2003 Ghana’s Cabinet approved a comprehensive Financial Sector Strategic Plan
FINSSP I aimed at promoting rapid financial sector development. The EMCB was addressing
comprehensively financial sector reform and development needs. In this respect it mirrored the
comprehensive high level government approach and government ownership to wholesome sector
reforms. To strengthen this consolidated vision, and acknowledging that the fragmented nature of
the sector needed to be addressed on the one hand and strong interconnections of the subsectors
on the other side, a sector wide approach was considered to be the right approach. SECO joined
the EMCB in 2009. In its decision process, SECO assessed the option join the coordinated
efforts through formal alignment as well as the option of a pooled funding. Given the broad
nature of the operation and the limited resources to monitor progress and actively participate in
policy dialogue around the issues, SECO decided to:
    • to pool funds with the World Bank and other donors, but to limit its attention to the
         following areas: banking regulation and supervision (component 2), pension sector
         development (component 5) and public debt management (component 6); 38 and
    • to complement the programme through targeted bilateral support initiatives in the
         mentioned areas.

Such initiatives were and are still ongoing, amongst others: strengthening of the banking
supervision capacities of the Bank of Ghana, and the ability to assess and address systemic risks.
Strengthen the central Bank’s ability to address money laundering issues, incentivize the use of
formal channels for remittances, etc. It also embarked on a long-term cooperation with the



38
     This could be a typo as public debt management was grouped under Component 7.
                                                       56
pensions regulator, NPRA. On debt management, SECO made funds available to strengthen the
management of public debt.

SECO was of the view and continues to hold the view that the operation was and still is very
relevant.

SECO recognizes that the main shortcomings in terms of results are attributable to the design of
the EMCB:
    • large number of implementers
    • a certain disconnect between high level aggregate objectives, indicators and activities;
      and
    • large number of activities without clear contribution path to the overall, aggregate
      objective.
On the positive side, SECO recognizes that the broad design has paved the way for more
dialogue and coordination among regulators and associated stakeholders in the sector. The merits
of such increased dialogue are likely to become more apparent with increased integration into the
global market and raising complexity of risks.

SECO is inconclusive as to whether the EMCB achieved the expected impact of the program,
which was to strengthen the effectiveness and competitiveness of the financial sector in Ghana
and to enhance private sector access to competitive financial products and services.

SECO also recognizes that the programme faced important implementation challenges, some of
which again were attributable to the initial design. Whilst a number of steps taken to address the
challenges have been adequate, e.g. redesign of the programme, strengthening of the
procurement capacities, the allocated human resources to the EMCB have been inadequate. The
limited resources were completely absorbed by the attempt to keep the programme together and
track the execution of the numerous activities, but largely fell short to monitor results and
provide strategic orientation (namely with regard to the sequencing and prioritization of
activities). SECO therefore believes that sufficient resources will need to be allocated for the
monitoring of such a complex operation.

SECO has appreciated the collaboration with the World Bank and intends to pursue joint efforts
in the future.”
