                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         While overall project implementation has continued to improve significantly, the final rating of the PSR component (moderately satisfactory)¸ coupled with ongoing implementation
                         challenges in a few areas of the FSR component means that progress towards the achievement of the PDO remains at Moderately Satisfactory. Project implementation arrangements
                         have also improved, as most contracts and activities for the remainder of the project have already been committed or mobilized.
