                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY
This paper seeks approval from the Country Director for a second-order restructuring
plan for the Ghana Economic Management Capacity Building project based on the results
of the midterm review conducted in August 2009, and the slower than anticipated
implementation pace thereafter. The restructuring will allow refocusing the activities on
outstanding priorities, and improving overall project implementation performance.

The proposed changes include the following:

1. Project Description:

The Economic Management Capacity Building (EMCB) is a joint-donor program
supporting the public and financial sector reform agenda of the Government of Ghana
(GoG) through co-financed trust fund arrangements between World Bank, U.K.
Department for International Development (DfID), and Swiss State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs (SECO). The IDA credit (US$25m with additional financing of
US$10m in FY08) was approved in FY06, with a closing date of end-FY11. The stated
project development objectives are achievable, as confirmed by ongoing progress with
regard to performance indicators. Overall implementation progress (as well as project
management by implementing agencies) is rated moderately satisfactory, given the
slower than anticipated implementation pace (disbursements are estimated at 74 percent).
The Government agreed to restructure and extend the project by 18 months so as to
refocus the activities on outstanding priorities, as identified under the recently concluded
Financial Sector Assessment (FSA), and improve implementation performance. Specific
changes in project activities will include:


  a) Completion of work program activities under the first component “Public Sector
     Reform” (PSR) by June 30, 2011, to reflect the intention of the Government of
     Ghana (GoG) to identify a new PSR program in association with the World Bank
     and other development partners. The following activities under finalization by the
     PSR component include: (i) support to the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission in
     implementing the New Pay Policy and Single Spine Salary Structure; (ii) adoption
     of Civil Service Bill and related regulations and capacity building activities; (iii)
     implementation of business process analysis in two Ministries, Departments and
     Agencies (MDAs; (iv) completion of voluntary retirement program in two
     subvented agencies. Completion of these activities is expected to exhaust nearly all
     project resources allocated to this component. Thereafter, no additional activities
     will be implemented under this component, reflecting the intention of the GoG to

                                             7
        identify a new PSR program in association with the World Bank and other
        development partners.

     b) Refocusing the activities under components 2 through 7 “Financial Sector Reform”
        (FSR) to reflect the evolving financial sector reform agenda and the transition
        toward a new Financial Sector Strategy Plan (FINSSP II) for Ghana. Activities
        under other FSR components will be refocused to address the priorities identified
        under the recently completed FSA and the anticipated impact and the absorptive
        capacity of implementing agencies.

2.       Extension of the Closing Date:

The closing date of the project, originally set for June 30, 2011, will be extended by 18
months, until December 30, 2012.

3.       Results Framework:

The project performance indicators and results framework will be revised to enhance
simplicity and relevance of the monitoring and evaluation process.


4.       Project Development Objective:

The PDO will not be affected by the proposed changes.

5.       Reallocation of the Proceeds and Credits:

A change to the allocation of funds across components is required reflecting the changes
in the work program agreed with GoG until project closure in December 2012.

It is proposed that project funding be reallocated as follows:
• Component A (1): No changes in the allocation of 7,260,000 XDR.
• Component A (2): No changes in the allocation of 2,240,000 XDR
• Component B: Change the allocation from 2,800,000 XDR to 2,100,000 XDR
• Component C: Change the allocation from 5,900,000 XDR to 5,200,000 XDR
• Component D: Change the allocation from 500,000 XDR to 700,000 XDR
• Component E: Change the allocation from 1,000,000 XDR to 1,600,000 XDR
• Component F: Change the allocation from 200,000 XDR to 400,000 XDR
• Component G: Change the allocation from 3,200,000 XDR to 4,100,000 XDR

Variations from the original project allocations as described above reflect the anticipated
impact of components and the absorptive capacity of implementing agencies, as well as
the evolving agenda of the Government concerning financial sector reform.

6.       Project costs:

Total project costs are estimated to change as follows:

                                             8

7.      Institutional Arrangements:

Under the new GoG institutional configuration for PSR, the counterpart implementing
agency for the EMCBP PSR component has changed from the Ministry of Public Sector
Reform to the Public Sector Reform Secretariat in the Office of the President, under the
Minister of State for Public Sector Reform. As such, there will be need to reflect the
status in the change of the institutional arrangements.

 The current allocation reflects an additional financing which was approved in FY08, in support of Public
Sector Reform and Public Sector Reform Retrenchment Schemes (respectively A.1 and A.2 as per the
Additional Financing Project Document).

8.      Procurement Arrangements:

The financing agreement will be revised as follows: (i) the Procurement Plan will set forth those
contracts which shall be subject to the Association’s Prior Review, and (ii) all other contracts
shall be subject to Post Review by the Association.




     B. PROJECT STATUS
The EMCBP is a joint-donor program supporting the GoG public and financial sector
reform agenda through co-financed trust fund arrangements between World Bank, DfID,
and SECO. The IDA credit (US$25 million with additional financing of US$10 million)
was approved in FY06, with a closing date of end-FY11. The Project Development
Objective (PDO) is to support the Borrower to perform its role as a facilitator for
economic development through: (i) implementation by MDAs of a reform initiative for
improved public sector management and service delivery; (ii) strengthening the
governance and competitiveness of the financial sector. The stated project development
objectives are achievable, as confirmed by ongoing progress with regard to performance
indicators. Overall implementation progress (as well as project management by
implementing agencies) is rated moderately satisfactory, given the slower than
anticipated implementation pace (disbursements are estimated at 74 percent). Annual
audit reports are expected to be submitted within the June 30th 2011 deadline. Following
the latest supervision mission in December 2010, the Government formally requested to
restructure and extend the project by 18 months so as to refocus the activities on
outstanding priorities and improve overall project implementation performance. Project
development objectives are achievable A component by component review of project
objectives, status, and perspectives is presented below.

•    Component A (Public Sector Reform and Public Sector Reform Retrenchment
     Scheme) of the EMCBP has been designed on the basis of the Government’s public
     sector reform strategy developed in 2004/2005. Progress on the PSR component has
     been slow, and rated Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) by mid-term review. On the
     basis of the 2009 mid-term review, the component was refocused in accordance with
     GoG on the following activities: (i) support to the Fair Wages and Salaries
     Commission in implementing the New Pay Policy and Single Spine Salary Structure;
     (ii) adoption of Civil Service Bill and related regulations and capacity building
     activities; (iii) implementation of Business Process Analysis (BPA) in two MDAs;
     (iv) completion of Voluntary Retirement Program (VRP) in sub-vented agencies.
     Overall, PSR implementation is progressing well, with contracts awarded and near
     completion. Enclosed is a synthesis of the status of activities under component A:

            ƒ   Pay reform: Pay policy reform under the EMCBP is been carried out
                under the Fair Wages and Salary Commission. The main thrust of this pay
                reform program is to implement the government’s White Paper on Pay

                                                                   currently on-going


        ƒ   Review of the Civil Service Law (1993). The Head of the civil Service
            set up a committee to review the Civil Service Bill which was returned to
            the Office of the Head of the Civil Service by the Cabinet. The committee
            completed its work and submitted the revised Bill to the Head of Civil
            Service. Thereafter, the Bill was submitted to the Civil Service Council for
            further review. The Council reviewed the Bill during the first week of
            November 2010. The Bill has subsequently been forwarded to the Public
            Sector Reform Secretariat. Remaining steps include forwarding the Bill to
            the Attorney General’s Department and then to the Cabinet for review.
            Additional activities that have to be supported under this sub-component
            which are very critical are: (i) the development of regulations under the
            Bill, and (ii) dissemination and training of officers of the civil service on
            the new regulations.


        ƒ   Business Process Review. The business process review program of
            central management agencies is a precursor to the need to address
            institutional design issues required for decentralization. The expected
                                         11
               outcome of this sub-component is a Business Process Analysis of two
               MDAS. Business process reviews are currently been undertaken in two
               ministries – the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Environment,
               Science and Technology. Even though there was a delay in the
               commencement of the reviews, management in both ministries are
               committed to completing the exercises. Subsequently, teams were formed
               in the two ministries to work expeditiously with the consultants to get the
               assignment completed before end of June 2011.

           ƒ   Subvented Agencies Reform. Under this sub-component, a consultancy
               service was launched to study the options for classification of Subvented
               Agencies (SA). This assignment was carried by PricewaterhouseCoopers
               Ghana Ltd. The final report was delivered to the Government in
               November 2010. Subsequently, a Cabinet memo has been drafted by both
               the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the Public Sector
               Reform Secretariat to forward the recommendations to the Cabinet for
               review and approval. The main objective of this report is to remove some
               SAs from Government subvention. This component also includes a VRP
               program involving four agencies: Ghana Trade Fair (GTF), Ghana
               Procurement Agency (GPS), Ghana Standards Board (GSB) and the
               GRATIS Foundation. GoG has already paid for the retrenchment
               exercises. EMCBP has already reimbursed GoG for payment made to
               GTF, GSB and GPA after their documentation was reviewed.
               Documentation for the support of the VRP for the GRATIS Foundation
               was submitted to the Bank. These retrenchment exercises have resulted in
               lower operating costs and in three out of the four agencies, profitability
               and removal from subvention (GTF, GPA and GSB). GRATIS Foundation
               is also undergoing a restructuring exercise. The final report on the
               restructuring was delayed but submitted to the GRATIS and PSRS in
               December 2010. The aim is to reduce its cooperating costs and eventually
               remove it from subvention.

•   Components B to G (Financial Sector Reform) of the EMCBP have been designed
    to support the Government’s own Financial Sector Strategy Plan (FINSSP). A
    successor plan, the Financial Sector Strategic Plan II, is currently under development,
    and will cover the period from 2011 to 2014. An important analytical input for the
    Government in finalizing the plan--the joint World Bank-IMF Financial Sector
    Assessment--was carried out in 2010. The new assessment is timely, as Ghana’s
    financial sector is evolving rapidly: new institutions, new technology and products,
    and expanded inclusion mean new opportunities, but also new stresses and risks that
    need to be managed. In this context, the FSA examined high priority issues such as
    the continuing impact of increasing levels of non-performing loans and the impact of
    continuing high levels of Government arrears to the private sector on the health of the
    banking sector, and the impact of the Government’s presence throughout the financial
    system more generally. In addition, the FSA undertook analysis on the broad sweep
    of financial sector issues from banking regulation and supervision, pension sector
    development, capital markets development, to issues of access to finance, which
    provide useful guidance as Ghana consolidates its transition to middle income status.
                                            12
   The Government requested the extension of FSR activities for a period of 18 months
   to support the evolving financial sector development agenda. The extension will
   support the completion of select financial sector reform activities, facilitate the
   transition to FINSSP II and begin the implementation of reform measures arising
   from the FSA.

                    •   Development of remittance program

The sections below summarize the status of FSR components and priority areas of focus
that will be addressed during the project extension.

•   Component B: Regulation and Supervision of Financial Markets. This
    component supports the review of legislation that impedes financial sector
    development to increase access to financial services and long- term funding; upgrades
    the resource capacity of regulators to enhance supervision as well as
    regulatory/supervisory capacity in automated systems through investment in training,
    technical assistance etc. Progress on the development of key rules and regulations and
    institutional strengthening activities has continued to be somewhat slow this past year
    and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fallen short of targets for the
    supervision of regulated institutions (35 percent instead of 50 percent). However,
    procurement of important information technology upgrading (automated surveillance
    and alert systems) and technical assistance was recently concluded for a contract
    amount of US$1.76 million. Important consultancies for the development of the legal
    and regulatory framework for commodities markets, the review of the Securities
    Industry Law, and development of rules regulations for OTC securities market are
    underway. An additional effort is required by SEC during the next 18 months to
    achieve the component’s performance outcomes. In line with the recent FSA
    assessment, the work program and component allocation has moving forward will
    include the activities: complete a strategic plan for SEC; review and amend the
    Securities Industry Law; develop the legal/regulatory framework for the unlisted
    Securities Markets; establish a Data Center and install the equipment for automated
    surveillance system/alerts; and strengthening the capacity of SEC staff with targeted
    training programs. Taking into consideration the proposed work program until project
    close, funding under this component will be adjusted to 2,100,000 XDR.



•   Component C: Banking and NBFI Regulation and Supervision. This component
    supports strengthening of the Bank of Ghana (BOG) through technical assistance to
    the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) for enhanced supervision of banking and
    non-banking financial institutions; support to the enactment of several laws critical
    for implementation of reforms, and improvements to the technological base of BOG
    (Central Securities Depository), support for other capacity and resource upgrades for

                                            14
    Payments Systems, and Research Departments, and the creation of an appropriate
    training and professional development environment to facilitate improved human
    resources development. The support provided to BSD has been instrumental in the
    department’s being able to inspect and supervise 100 percent Banks and 90 percent
    NBFIs over the past 12 months, and procuring and installing electronic equipment for
    the Line Clearing and Automated Clearing House System. The work plan for the
    remainder of the project implementation period has been reviewed to focus on
    priority areas including strengthening effective risk management of the Banking
    Supervision Department, supporting the automation of supervision procedures and
    documentation processes. Refocusing the work program of this component is
    expected to improve impact of the project, and enabling the reallocation of resources
    that had been originally allocated to very generic training and capacity building
    programs. Taking into consideration the proposed work program until project close,
    total funding under this component will be adjusted to 5,200,000 XDR.



•   Component D: Insurance Regulation and Supervision. The EMCBP supports the
    National Insurance Commission (NIC) in strengthening its capacity to supervise,
    regulate and monitor the insurance industry. Following the passage of the Insurance
    Act, the number of insurance companies increased from twenty three (23) in 2007 to
    forty-two (42) in 2010 (of which 23 are life insurance companies, 17 non-life
    companies, and 2 reinsurers). In 2010, NIC’s compliance with International
    Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) core principles increased to 66 percent
    (above the 60 percent target for the year). The proportion of insurance companies
    inspected increased from 66 percent in 2009 to 80 percent in 2010. On the basis of an
    additional funding allocation, the work program under this component will be
    strengthened so as to enable the full development and implementation of a
    management information system to interface NIC with the insurance industry (the
    consultancy on the development of MIS is underway, and the installation of the
    hardware/software is at an advanced procurement stage), as well as a review and
    overhaul of the legal and regulatory framework (Insurance Act) in light of recent
    changes in the industry. Taking into consideration the revised work program, funding
    under this component will be adjusted to 700,000 XDR.



•   Component E: Strengthening of Capital Markets. This component of the EMCB
    project supports activities related to strengthening of financial market structure and
    efficiency, promotes transparency and competitiveness amongst market participants,
    upgrades resources and capacity of regulators to enhance supervision, and creates
    required industry associations for regulators. Dematerialized trading with automated
    clearing and settlement is now in place, and migration of securities into the depository
    system is ongoing (47,800 accounts were open in 2010 as opposed to 37,000 in
    2009). Secondary market turn-over as a percentage of market capitalization peaked to
    3.4 percent in 2008, fell to 1.39 percent in 2009 and rebounded to 2.42 percent in
    2010. Two Initial Public Offering (IPOs) have been launched in 2010 and more
    activity is expected by end 2011. Consultancies are underway and expected to
                                            15
    complete as planned to support GSE’s demutualization process and strengthen its
    capacity --- specifically with the assistance of a resident advisor for the Automated
    Trading System (ATS). Funding allocation under this component will be increased to
    1,600,000 XDR reflecting higher than anticipated cost of equipment procured by
    GSE.


•   Component F: Pension Sector Development. The pension sector reforms came into
    legal effect with the passage of the new Pension Act, which was assented on
    December 4, 2008: this three-tier pension scheme has now established in Ghana: (i) a
    mandatory social security scheme; (ii) a mandatory fully funded and privately
    managed occupational pension scheme; and (iii) a voluntary fully funded and
    privately managed provident fund and personal pension scheme. Employer and
    employee contribute a total of 18.5 percent for every worker's salary (13 percent and
    5.5 percent respectively); Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) takes
    11 percent of the contribution to run the Tier 1 scheme, 2.5 percent is ceded to the
    National Health Insurance Scheme, while the remaining five percent is meant for the
    Tier II scheme. Contributions started in October 2009, with Tier II contributions
    currently held in an account at the Bank of Ghana as the National Pensions Authority
    (NPRA) readies itself to license fund managers who would manage contributors'
    funds. SSNIT has one million active contributors, 100,000 pensioners receiving
    SSNIT pension payments and two million inactive contributors. Their actuarial
    projections indicate the system is sustainable over the foreseeable future.
    Nevertheless, a study is being done to assess the impact of the on-going pension
    reforms. Moving forward, an additional funding allocation of 200,000 XDR will be
    provided under this component to support the institutional strengthening of NPRA,
    including the development of appropriate legal and regulatory instruments, as well as
    related training and communication campaigns.

•   Component G: Access to Finance and Financial Sector Governance. This
    component supports activities which promote financial sector inclusion, as well as
    enhancing the capacity of the Government in performing a strategic role in financial
    sector development and the improvement in the operating environment. EMCBP
    funding will be increased by 900,000 XDR under this component to focus on the
    following elements of the Government’s agenda:

               ƒ   Aid and Debt Management Division (ADMD): ADMD has over the
                   last few years undertaken far-reaching internal reforms aimed at
                   ensuring it provides satisfactory technical advice to the Government. It
                   is currently at the point where it needs to complete its internal re-
                   organization and install cutting management processes within the
                   department to further support government’s agenda on domestic debt
                   and capital markets’ management. Key work plan items agreed with
                   the Government include : Engage international expertise to assist in (i)
                   drawing a business plan for the department, which will among others,
                   include a new organizational structure and ADM Operating Manuals;
                   and (ii) the review and update of the division’s responsibilities in the
                   further development of the domestic debt and capital markets.
                                            16
    Additional support would be provided for the procurement of
    Information Technology (IT) and relevant capacity building for staff
    of the division.

ƒ   ARB-Apex: Over the past year ARB-Apex (a mini-central Bank for
    rural and community Banks) completed on-site inspection of 13 out of
    136 Rural and Community Banks (RCBs) by two inspectors funded by
    EMCBP. To expand the service, ARB-Apex requested funding for
    four additional inspectors. The role of ARB-Apex is expected to
    increase significantly over coming years as function of supervision and
    inspection of RCB currently being undertaken by BOG is expected to
    transfer to ARB-Apex. i.e. ARB-Apex will effectively serve as a
    central bank for rural finance sector. Key work plan items agreed with
    the Government include (i) procurement of inspectors; (ii) consultancy
    for developing internal control and risk management operation
    manual; (iii) consultancy for developing long term institutional
    strategy; (iv) consultancy for developing pension fund scheme; (v)
    consultancy for updating training needs-assessment plan for ARB-
    Apex; and (vi) consultancy to undertake three RCB mergers.

ƒ   Microfinance Unit (MFU): Key achievements over the past year
    include: (i) validated and adopted a national strategy for consumer
    education in the microfinance sector; (ii) clarified supervision and
    regulation function of Credit Unions and RCBs; and (iii) 15 staff at
    different MFIs attended three training programs. Going forward,
    deepening the ownership and launching of Ghana Microfinance Policy
    (GHAMP) should be the key priority for MFU.

ƒ   Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF): VCTF established four VCTC
    partnerships and leveraged seed funding of GHC 22.4 million to create
    GHC 40.5 million. The industry now boasts of a venture capital fund
    size of GHC 62.9 million to be invested in the SME sector. VCTF
    financed Sorghum value chain project in North Ghana and has led to
    the creation of 4,500 jobs. Key work plan items agreed with the
    Government include: (i) capacity building for fund managers; (ii)
    support to monitoring; (iii) public awareness and promotional
    programs.

ƒ   National Pensions Authority (NPRA): The National Pensions
    Authority is now operational with the Government’s appointment of a
    Board and key management staff. Its mandate, among others, is to
    oversee the administration and management of registered pension
    schemes in Ghana, including the Social Security and National
    Insurance Trust. Given that the authority is in its nascent stages, Credit
    resources will be utilized to support the drafting of a Strategic Plan.
    Other support will also be provided for public awareness creation and
    office equipment. Support to the NPRA will be undertaken through
    component F of the project.
                              17
                ƒ   Project and Financial Analysis Unit (PFA): Further to an agreement
                    between GoG and the Bank, EMCB supported, over the past year,
                    select activities related to the development of a PPP program in Ghana.
                    These have included consultancies to support the preparation of PPP
                    policy/legal instruments and consensus building activities and
                    workshops. Moving forward this work will be subsumed under a
                    separate stand-alone facility in support of the preparation of a
                    dedicated IDA-funded PPP project.

                ƒ   Financial Sector Division (FSD): FSD is a relatively newly-
                    established division in MOFEP, however, its role and responsibilities
                    related to policy analysis for Ghana’s financial sector are wide and
                    varied. These include providing advisory functions on: financial sector
                    stability, policy development, regulation, performance, and structural
                    issues. In order to ensure that FSD is able to deliver on its mandate,
                    support will be provided under EMCB to finance the cost of a
                    technical adviser within the division, and to strengthen its overall
                    administrative capacity. The proposed advisor will assist the division
                    to develop a Strategic Plan. In addition, FSD will support the
                    development of the domestic capital markets, facilitate stakeholder
                    reviews related to the development of financial sector laws and
                    regulations, financial literacy programs, remittance program, and of
                    the development of the FINSSP II policy document. Considering that
                    DfID will reallocate the undisbursed EMCB Trust Fund (TF) funding
                    contribution (estimated to be around US$1,5 million by end June
                    2011) to other programs in Ghana, FSD is exploring complementary
                    funding sources for this initiative.



C.      PROPOSED CHANGES

•    Extension of Closing Date

     The closing date of the project, originally set for June 30, 2011, will be extended by
     18 months, until December 30, 2012.

•    Components

It is expected that activities under Component A will be completed by June 30th 2011,
specifically: (i) Support to the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission in implementing the
New Pay Policy and Single Spine Salary Structure; (ii) adoption of Civil Service Bill and
related regulations and capacity building activities; (iii) implementation of business
process analysis in two MDAs; (iv) completion of VRP program in subvented agencies.
Completion of these activities is expected to exhaust nearly all project resources allocated
to the PSR component. Thereafter, no additional activities will be supported under this

                                             18
component, reflecting the intention of the GoG to identify a new PSR program in
association with the World Bank and other development partners.

The Government requested the extension of FSR activities for a period of 18 months to
support the evolving financial sector development agenda. The extension will support the
completion of select financial sector reform activities, facilitate the transition to FINSSP
II and begin the implementation of reform measures arising from the FSA. Accordingly,
activities under Components B-G will be refocused, particularly to address issues arising
from the recently completed FSA and the finalization of the FINSSP II.

A change to the allocation of funds across components is required reflecting the changes
in the work program agreed with the Government. It is proposed that project funding be
reallocated as follows:

o   Component A (1): No change in the allocation of 7,260,000 XDR
o   Component A (2): No changes in the allocation of 2,240,000 XDR
o   Component B: Change the allocation from 2,800,000 XDR to 2,100,000 XDR
o   Component C: Change the allocation from 5,900,000 XDR to 5,200,000 XDR
o   Component D: Change the allocation from 500,000 XDR to 700,000 XDR
o   Component E: Change the allocation from 1,000,000 XDR to 1,600,000 XDR
o   Component F: Change the allocation from 200,000 XDR to 400,000 XDR
o   Component G: Change the allocation from 3,200,000 XDR to 4,100,000 XDR

Variations from the original project allocations as described above reflect the anticipated
impact of components and the absorptive capacity of implementing agencies, as well as
the evolving agenda of the Government to address the issues arising from the FSA
analysis.


•   Results/indicators

It is proposed that project performance indicators and Results Framework be revised to
reflect changes made in component activities and to be relevant with the new monitoring
and evaluation process, particularly in the PSR component. The proposed Results
Framework is attached in Annex 1.

•   Institutional arrangements

Under the new Government of Ghana institutional configuration for PSR, the counterpart
implementing agency for the EMCB PSR component has changed from the Ministry of
Public Sector Reform to the Public Sector Reform Secretariat in the Office of the
President, under the Minister of State for Public Sector Reform. As such, there will be
need to reflect the status in the change of the institutional arrangements.

The Economic Management Capacity Building (EMCB) is a joint-donor program
supporting the public and financial sector reform agenda of the Government of Ghana
(GoG). Financial sector reform components of the EMCBP have been funded by the IDA
Credit and TFs contributions from the U.K. Department for International Development
(DfID), and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). The DfID and
SECO TF and the IDA Credit are executed by the same implementing agency (MOFEP)
and support a coordinated financial sector reform work program.

Moving forward, the financing plan of the project will be amended as follows:
• The closing date of the IDA credit will be extended thru December 30, 2012
• The closing date of the DfID TF (June 30, 2011) will not be extended. The
  undisbursed DfID TF contribution (estimated to be around US$1,5 million by end
  June 2011) will be reallocated to other programs in Ghana. The projected work
  program of EMCBP Component Access to Finance and Financial Sector Governance
  has been amended to reflect this change.
• The closing date of the SECO TF will be extended so as to continue supporting the
  EMCB program thru December 30, 2012. An extension package of the SECO TF is
  being prepared.

Sector Reform and Public Sector Reform Retrenchment Schemes (respectively A.1 and A.2 as per the

Competitive Bidding contracts as well as relevant National Competitive Bidding
Contracts deemed complex or having significant risk levels (as indicated in the
procurement plan), would be subject to prior review by IDA. For consultancy contracts,
firm contracts above US$150,000 and individual consultant contracts above US$50,000
would be subject to prior review by IDA, as well as all Terms of Reference irrespective
of the contract amount. In addition, all Direct or Single Source selection contracts would
be subject to prior review by IDA. Accordingly, the financing agreement will be revised as
follows: (i) the Procurement Plan will set forth those contracts which shall be subject to the
Association’s Prior Review, and (ii) all other contracts shall be subject to Post Review by the
Association.
