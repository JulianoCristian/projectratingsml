                         Extension of Closing Date
  GHANA - GHANA ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
                      {GRANT No. TFO 94774}

                                   Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for GHANA ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT CAPACITY
   BUILDING PROJECT {GRANT No. TFO 94774} will be extended from June 30,
   2011 until December 30, 2012.

2. The EMCBP is a joint-donor program supporting the GoG public and financial sector
   reform agenda through co-financed trust fund arrangements between World Bank,
   DfID, and SECO. The Project Development Objective (PDO) of TF0 94774 is to
   support the Borrower to perform its role as a facilitator for economic development
   through strengthening the governance and competitiveness of the financial sector.
   The financial sector reform components of the EMCBP have supported the
   Governmentâ€™s own Financial Sector Strategy Plan (FINSSP) in areas including: (i)
   regulation and supervision of banking institutions, insurance, and financial markets,
   (ii) strengthening of capital markets, (iii) pension sector development, and (iv) access
   to finance and financial sector governance. Performance indicators for financial
   sector reform project components have largely been met and/or have improved
   following mid-term review. The project is rated marginally satisfactory, given the
   slower than anticipated implementation pace (overall EMCB disbursements are
   estimated at 74%) with a specific disbursement of TF094774 of US$1,151,193.72
   (47.28% of the grant amount). Following the latest supervision mission in December
   2010, the Government formally requested to restructure and extend the project by 18
   months so as to refocus the activities on outstanding priorities and improve overall
   project implementation performance. A successor plan, the Financial Sector Strategic
   Plan II (FINSSP II), is currently under development, and will cover the period from
   2011 to 2014.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to support the completion of select financial
   sector reform activities, facilitate the transition to FINSSP II and begin the
   implementation of reform measures arising from the joint World Bank-IMF Financial
   Sector Assessment (FSA)---carried out in 2010. FSA. A dedicated work plan has been
   devised to this end.

4. This will be the first extension of the project.
