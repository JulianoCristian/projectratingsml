 Capacity Building Project for Ghana were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was unsatisfactory;\n            and borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: this was overlooked when the\n            PSR and the FSR programs were combined. Cross-sector\n            approach could work if there is synergy: e.g. government\n            debt management in public sector reform (e.g. forecasting,\n            planning and cash management) and domestic bond market\n            development in financial sector reform. The institutional\n            capacity of the Bank's managing unit, as well as of the\n            client and the implementing agencies, has to be considered\n            when determining how wide a sector-wide approach should be.\n            Given the open-endedness of the PSR program in the design\n            phase, it appears an adaptable or more phased-in instrument\n            will be more fitting. There was only one QER close to the\n            decision meeting for appraisal and project negotiation. It\n            appears that before the project was submitted for Board\n            review, the design was not checked to see if the QER and\n            decision meeting recommendations were incorporated. The\n            financial sector part of the project benefited from strong\n            ownership of the reform strategy by the Government of Ghana\n            (GOG) and the regulatory authorities, thanks to the\n            participatory approach in years of Financial Sector\n            Strategic Plan (FINSSP) development. The regular Financial\n            Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) updates (2003, 2006 and\n            2011) gave the Bank a handle on the status of Ghana's\n            financial sector."}, "docdt": "2013-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
