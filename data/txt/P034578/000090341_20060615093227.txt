3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The project's original objective was to improve the serviceability of the state highway network with a view
to reducing road transport costs through the following actions:

(a) more efficient resource allocation and use in the road sector;

(b) increased participation of the private sector in the management of the road;

(c) improved capacity of the state road administration (DAER - Departamento Autônomo de Estradas de
Rodagem) to manage state's road programs; and

(d) rehabilitation of selected sections and maintenance of the entire paved highway network of the state.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The project's original objective was not substantially altered during project execution. However, following
the project's restructuring in 2003, an additional action was added, namely to:

(e) rapidly expand the capacity of the Borrower's core administration systems, to avoid the saturation of
such systems by increasing user's demands

3.3 Original Components:
The Project consisted of the following two main components:

     (a) a policy and institutional development component (2% of total project costs), including technical
         assistance, equipment, software and training to staff to:

         (i) prepare and monitor efficient state road expenditure and funding programs in accordance with
             policies, standards and economic criteria satisfactory to the Bank, thereby strengthening
             DAER's planning, programming budgeting and monitoring systems;

         (ii) supervise and monitor the implementation of the State's highway concession program and the
              transfer of maintenance activities to private contractors; and

         (iii) restructure DAER's operations in accordance with the above policy changes, downsizing
              operation divisions and strengthening technical, environmental, management and supervision
              capabilities, and establishing clear goals and accountability to implement and monitor the
              state's highway programs; and

     (b) a rehabilitation and maintenance component (98% of total project cost), consisting of the
         rehabilitation, resurfacing and routine maintenance components of the state's 1997-2001 road
         programs, and related studies, engineering designs and works supervision.

3.4 Revised Components:
The scope of the first component was adapted to take into account the additional action to be undertaken
within the project's scope, namely providing support to the modernization of the mainframe servers and
distribution environment structure of the state public company in charge of the operation and management
of the Borrower's information systems (PROCERGS), at a cost of US$5 million.


                                                       - 2 -

The inclusion of this additional action was justified on the following grounds: (a) the state information
system manages essential tasks such as payments of civil servants salaries and pension benefits, tax
collection and judicial processes; (b) the state had been developing in partnership with the Inter-American
Development Bank, a long-term plan for the modernization of the state information systems, but the
implementation of the plan was delayed; (c) at the time of the request for immediate support from the state
to the Bank, in August 2003, the information system was running close to saturation point (with, at peak,
98% of the system's capacity used), leading to significant delays in the treatment of information; (d) such
request was in line with the Bank country assistance's strategy of developing integrated support to states in
Brazil; and (e) simulations had showed that, despite significant improvements observed in the
implementation of the project starting in 2002, US$ 5 to US$ 10 million would most probably remain
unused by the end of the extended implementation period.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Note: this project predates the introduction of the QAG quality at entry process.

The quality at entry is assessed as satisfactory. Indeed:

(a) the project's objective was in line with the CAS, dated June 29 1995, updated on June 20, 1996, and the
long-term development policy of the State. Improving the condition of the state road network would help
foster economic development through the reduction of road transport costs and improvements to
population's access to markets and services;

(b) the project's institutional component was structured to support the implementation of an adequate road
management policy, combining delegation of infrastructure maintenance and operation to the private sector,
and the reorganization of DAER from an executing to a modern management agency able to manage more
efficiently the state road network, combined with a corresponding decrease in the number of DAER's
operational staff; and

(c) the project's physical component adequately focused on rehabilitation and preservation of the trunk road
network given that: (i) over 90% of transport flows in the state are dependent on such network; (ii)
rehabilitation investments yield high rates of returns (a key consideration especially given the State's fragile
fiscal situation); and (iii) a substantial part of the road infrastructure was reaching its life expectancy limits
(most state roads were built in the 1960s and 1970s, and have been subjected to rapidly increasing traffic
flows).

In addition, the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was well structured, and presented a comprehensive
technical, economic and financial evaluation of the project, as well as a thorough analysis of project risks.
Indeed the 3 project risks identified in the SAR materialized during project implementation.

With hindsight, some elements could have benefited from more detailed analysis, including:

(a) the likely impact on the project of a substantial change in Government (the project was declared
effective 3 months prior to the October 1998 federal and state elections), knowing that the state of Rio
Grande do Sul has a tradition of alternating right-wing and left-wing Governments. While it was not
possible for the project team which prepared the project to anticipate whether a substantial change in
Government would occur and whether the change would have necessarily affected project implementation,
the probability of such change occurring and affecting project implementation could have been presented as
a risk which could not have been effectively mitigated by the Bank;



                                                        - 3 -

(b) while possible Government failure to provide counterpart funds was clearly identified as a risk, the
SAR did not identify Government failure in ensuring sufficient levels of payments during project execution,
a failure which resulted in repeated contractors' demobilization, i.e. implementation delays. During project
preparation, the possibility of not subjecting budgets necessary for project execution to budget freezes
could have been explored;

(c) the necessary conditions for the Borrower to execute the following actions:

     (i) contracting of maintenance, and monitoring of the condition of the state unpaved road network: the
     SAR was brief on how the Borrower intended to carry out these actions, especially as the maintenance
     would have required a substantial reorganization at the level of DAER's regional offices, still in charge
     of the maintenance of such network, and the monitoring required the use of an indicator easier to
     measure (such as average speed); and

     (ii) downsizing of DAER's staff: the SAR did not really review the adequacy of the state legislation
     and financial capacity to allow such downsizing to take place, especially as it noted that a federal
     constitution amendment probably needed to be approved in order to facilitate the downsizing;

(d) designing an indicator to measure whether the project achieved its main objective to reducing transport
costs by improving the serviceability of the state highway network would have been interesting;


4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Note: the evaluations presented below have to read, taking into consideration the main factors which
affected project implementation and outcome (see especially sections 5.1 to 5.3).

The outcome of the project is evaluated as moderately satisfactory, based on the following findings:

(a) the efficiency in the allocation and use of resources in the sector has increased: (i) road concessions
have reduced the size of the network on which public resources need to be spent; (ii) DAER's planning
capacity has enabled road interventions to be designed taking into account the state's fiscal difficulties; and
(iii) bidding of result-based road maintenance and rehabilitation has decreased unit costs of road
rehabilitation by 30% on average (although using technical solutions with a duration of 8-10 years instead
of 12-15 years).

(b) private sector participation in the management of roads has substantially increased, with over 1,800
kms. of federal and state paved roads conceded (or 72% of the original target), and the rehabilitation and
maintenance of 2,550 kms. of state paved roads transferred to the private sector through result-based
contracts (or 50% of the original target, given the fiscal constraints faced by the state)1. In summary, over
the project implementation period, management of close to 60% of the state road network was transferred
to the private sector.

________________________________________________________________
1 while designs for the bidding of result-based contracts on the remainder of the network were prepared, the
bidding could not be launched given the lack of sufficient budgetary allocations to road maintenance and
rehabilitation.




                                                     - 4 -

(c) the capacity of DAER to manage the State's road programs has gradually improved over the project
implementation period, through a series of focused organizational changes (in 1998, 2002 and 2005) aimed
at improving the administration's project management capacity and in parallel reducing its execution
capacity; developing an adequate long-term planning capacity; hiring about 114 new technical staff (or
76% of the initial target); and introducing result-based contracts, a first in Brazil. In addition, the number
of DAER staff decreased from 2,100 to 1,775, with further reduction to reach the 1,500 staff initial target
impeded by legal and financial difficulties encountered by the Borrower in being able to declare DAER's
operational staff redundant. Instead, such staff, mainly working by force account on maintaining the paved
network, was in large part relocated to working on maintaining the unpaved network.

(d) at project end, the portions of the state paved road network in good and bad condition have been
estimated at having increased from 52% to 77% respectively (compared to an expected 85%), and from 5%
to 8.3% (compared to an expected 2.5%)2. These relatively mixed results can be explained by:

         (i)  a 4-years delay in the execution of the bulk of rehabilitation contracts, during which road
conditions continued to deteriorate;

         (ii)  a lack of adequate maintenance on the remaining part of the network, due principally to
non-availability of state funding; and

         (iii) a shift in the network management strategy with the introduction of result-based contracts,
from the rehabilitation of the whole network, to the rehabilitation of the sections of that network located in
the most economically active regions of the state, given the overall scarcity of resources for road
rehabilitation and maintenance. While this shift was beneficial to such regions, the lack of systematic
rehabilitation and maintenance of the remainder of the network resulted in the deterioration of
additional road sections.

4.2 Outputs by components:

(a)         Policy and institutional development component

For purposes of Annex 5 to this ICR, the achievement of the Sector Policies and Institutional Development
objectives of this component is rated, respectively, as modest and substantial.




_________________________________________
2the overall condition of the unpaved network is rated as satisfactory by DAER, but this evaluation could not be
underpinned by concrete data.

(i) Preparation and monitoring of efficient state road program and budgets: at the state road program
level (including maintenance, rehabilitation and construction), the project supported the structuring of a
pavement management system, using the initially Bank-developed software HDM; the initial road data
collection; as well as the training of dedicated staff. With respect to the state road rehabilitation and
maintenance sub-program,3 DAER staff and the project team have defined, during project preparation, the
catalogue of technical solutions to be used for purposes of programming and execution of works. Such
catalogue had to be revised during project implementation to reflect the shift from "traditional" to
long-term, result-based contracts (see below). DAER also created a Direction of Planning in 2002, notably
in charge of the road network condition evaluation and interventions planning, based on detailed field
survey methodologies taking into account international standards. However, the impact of having such a
planning capacity operational has been constrained, at times, by: (a) uncertainties in the levels of budgetary
allocations, and wild variations in monthly payment limits, which decreased the relevance of planning
exercises, and did not allow the regular undertaking of road condition data collection; and (b) the
divergences between technical and political criteria, which resulted in lower than optimal budgetary
allocations to the State road maintenance and rehabilitation program.

To minimize these constraints and generally increase the efficiency of planning and monitoring of road
maintenance and rehabilitation activities, DAER staff and the project team developed a long-term,
result-based approach to road maintenance and rehabilitation, a first in Brazil. The approach basically
transfers, for long time periods (5 years instead of 1.5 years under a traditional approach), a significant
part of the responsibility for road maintenance and rehabilitation to the private sector (at the level of
sub-networks, of about 400 km. in length, instead of 70 km. under a traditional approach), with services
and works (instead of just works under a traditional approach) to be undertaken following a given
catalogue of technical solutions, to be paid for on the basis of "global" unit prices (i.e. the price for
executing a unit of a specific technical solution) and to be monitored according to specific indicators. Such
an approach successfully allowed: (a) simplifying the planning and monitoring of the State road
maintenance and rehabilitation program; (b) increasing DAER's capacity as a management (rather than an
execution) agency; (c) drastically increasing the program's efficiency (see below); and (d) fostering a close
cooperation between the secretariats of transports, planning and finance, as the execution of result-based
contracts implies the preparation of multi-year budgets, and a higher degree of certainty with respect to
payment limits in order to allow the contractors to prepare their activities' program.

(ii) Monitoring of concession and contract maintenance programs: most of the State road concession
program was implemented: concessions were awarded on 7 of the initial 9 concession lots, on a total of 800
kms. of the paved state network, and 980 kms. of the paved federal network (through concessions delegated
to the State). Despite various difficulties at the initial stage linked especially to the nonacceptance by the
population of tolls (which led the Government to reduce toll fees in 1999), and after renegotiations of the
concession contracts to ensure the financial and economic equilibrium of the contracts (renegotiations
concluded without major fiscal impact), the concession system has been stable since 2000, and seems to
yield most of the expected benefits to road users and the State.

and JBIC-financed project worth US$300 million, which allowed the paving of about 800 km. of road sections.

In terms of monitoring, the State of Rio Grande do Sul set up a regulatory agency in 1997, and in 2002,
consolidated DAER's capacity to supervise execution of civil works and services on road concessions by
creating the Direction of Operation and Concessions. Both entities seem to operate adequately, but it needs
to be underlined that the project did not substantially participate in the strengthening of either entity.

On the other hand, the project played a key role in structuring DAER's capacity to monitor result-based
rehabilitation and maintenance contracts on the paved network, through preparation of specific norms and
regulations; training of DAER staff at the central and regional levels; and support to the development of
DAER's testing laboratory. However, no project activity was developed to strengthen DAER's capacity to
manage the unpaved network. Given lack of adequate funding and availability of additional operational
staff,4 the State could not undertake routine maintenance on a contract basis.

(iii) Reorganization of DAER: as mentioned above, the project has had a substantial impact in setting up a
technical planning capacity, and in restructuring DAER's operations when it comes to its paved road
rehabilitation and maintenance program. The project also had some impact on DAER's management of its
regional divisions, with regional supervisors largely expanding their role, from simply controlling quantities
and authorizing payments, to acting as contract supervisors fully engaged in decision-making processes
concerning choice and execution of technical solutions, regular control of compliance with contract
indicators, emission of warnings and penalties for noncompliance.             However, such improvements in
DAER's organization to deal with planning, maintenance and rehabilitation of the state paved road network
did not lead to the preparation of the initially-foreseen staff retrenchment plan and asset sales program, for
the reason given in section 4.1 (c). Instead, DAER's regional divisions staff and equipment formally
allocated to paved network maintenance by force account were re-allocated to the maintenance of the
unpaved network.

(iv) Environmental management: DAER had established an environmental unit to apply environment
norms and guidelines during project preparation. This unit was removed during the reorganization of 2002,
and responsibility for the management of environmental impacts returned to DAER's studies and
engineering department, within the Planning Direction. DAER also prepared an environmental manual that
was approved by DAER's Executive Directors in 2001.                  No additional activities to support the
strengthening of DAER's environmental management capacity took place during the project
implementation, but capacity has been evaluated as adequate when it comes to road maintenance and
rehabilitation activities on the paved network.

(v) Project management: during project implementation, the Project Management Unit (PMU) capacity
was effectively strengthened, and project management has been adequate overall with two main caveats: (a)
financial management of loan resources by the central Government (and not DAER) failed in one instance
(see section 5.2 below); and (b) the PMU did not succeed to put into operation a fully integrated and
automated project information system, notably because of the lack of a fully integrated system at the
DAER level, and the relatively obsolete software running on DAER's central systems.

(vi) Modernization of PROCERG's systems: most of the information technology equipment planned to be
purchased has been acquired, helping to: (i) modernize and expand the mainframe server's capacity; (ii)
consolidate the system's server structure; (iii) modernize the decentralized administration systems; and (iv)
develop a backup operation and data storage system. As of today, the state's information system runs with
peaks around 70% of the system's total capacity, a net improvement compared to a previous peak in
utilization of 98%.


(b)         Rehabilitation and maintenance program component

For purposes of Annex 5 to this ICR, the achievement of the Physical objective of this component is rated
as substantial.

The component originally anticipated rehabilitation using traditional contracts of 2,500 km. of the state
paved network, and the introduction, on a pilot basis, of result-based road rehabilitation and maintenance
contracts. In addition, it was foreseen that the State would contract out all routine maintenance on the
paved network.

The component's implementation was initially very slow: by end-2000, 400 kms. of the paved network was
rehabilitated, compared to an initial target of 1,900 kms. The main reasons for the slow start-up: (a) a 15
months delay between Board approval and effectiveness (effectiveness was declared in August 1998), as
project approval within Brazil was held up by the 1997 national elections' process; and (b) delays in
procuring engineering designs and civil works contracts and in paying contractors' bills, in a context where
the State was facing increasing fiscal constraints. As such, it became clear in 2000 that the traditional
model used to contract road maintenance and rehabilitation was not adequate. Instead, it was decided to
undertake road rehabilitation and maintenance using result-based contracts on a network-wide scale. The
expected benefits (many of which did eventually materialize) of this shift included:

(i) result-based contracts generally cover an entire route or a small network of road sections (usually about
300 km) instead of a small road section. These contracts first ensure consistency and therefore
predictability of road conditions over an entire route or network. They also allow contractors to continue
working even when a technical or fiscal issue delays works on a specific road section.                    On the
administration's side, the main advantages are to substantially reduce the number of contracts to be
procured, managed and supervised, and to transfer detailed design and quality control responsibilities to
contractors;

(ii) result-based contracts have an implementation period of up to five years, compared to about 1.5 years
for traditional contracts, which ensures (a) the accountability of the contractor with respect to the quality of
the rehabilitation works (as the contractor is responsible for maintaining satisfactory road conditions during
a certain period following the conclusion of the rehabilitation works), and (b) added flexibility to react to
changing budgetary situations;

(iii) only basic designs are required, leaving the responsibility to the contractor of finalizing the designs just
before works are about to be executed on a certain road section. This reduces the time needed to prepare
the contract designs, and reduces the risk of contract renegotiations during contract execution; and

(iv) payments of result-based contracts are not, by definition, "input-based", which decreases significantly:
(a) the risk for disputes over the actual quantities used; and (b) the burden on the federal road
administration, in terms of supervision. Supervision is undertaken on the basis of road condition indicators


                                                      - 8 -

to be complied with at regular time intervals, combined with technical audits to verify the quality of the
works undertaken. Financial penalties are applied in case the road condition indicators are not met, and
additional works are to be undertaken at no cost to the employer in case the quality of the works is found to
be non-satisfactory.


The introduction of such an innovative concept in Brazil required special efforts on both the Borrower and
Bank's side, as: (a) specific bidding and contract documents had to be structured; (b) new technical norms
had to be elaborated; and (c) the concept needed to be understood by the engineering and construction
industry. By early 2002 seven result-based contracts of the state paved network were signed, covering an
extension of 2,550 km. or 50% of the paved network. Unfortunately, two elements initially delayed
contracts execution, including (a) the election, at the end of 2001 of a new Government, and the resulting
application of an even stricter adjustment policy to respond more efficiently to the fiscal situation; and (b)
the necessary adjustments in the dialogue between DAER and the contractors, as both sides needed to fully
understand the "result-based" concept.

In light of the continuing slow implementation of the various project components, the project team proposed
at the end of 2002, the cancellation of the loan. Ensuing discussions with Bank management and the
newly-appointed State Government at the beginning of 2003, led to a series of agreements and
commitments which were complied with and allowed over 2004 and 2005 the rehabilitation and
maintenance of over 1,800 km. of road sections (see graph in section 5.2).

Overall, close to 90% (2,200 km) of the initial paved road rehabilitation target (2,500 km.) has been
achieved. Road maintenance (together with road rehabilitation) has been effectively contracted on 50% of
the paved network, instead of the 100% initially planned. This achievement is major as it institutionalized
the shift in road maintenance and rehabilitation policy, towards the use of an integrated result-based
strategy (including both maintenance and rehabilitation). The success of such shift is also the main reason
in the delay for contracting maintenance on 100% of the network alone (as initially planned), as the
contracting of both road rehabilitation and maintenance increased significantly the financial burden of such
contracts to the State, which decided: (a) to contract only road maintenance together with road
rehabilitation on the second half of the network; and (b) taking into account prevailing fiscal constraints, to
postpone the contracting of road maintenance and rehabilitation on the second half of the network, until the
rehabilitation of the first half of the network is completed (expected to happen in 2006).

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
While 90% of the original physical target was eventually achieved using 74% of the original budget, this
took place in an extended timeframe, 4 years longer than originally foreseen. In addition, the Borrower was
not able to allocate substantial budget for maintenance and or rehabilitation of the second half of the
network. These two elements result in a posteriori project net present value and economic rate of return
than estimated during project preparation; howver, at 79%, the IERR is still very positive (see table below).

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Project's main institutional development impacts have been to: (a) introduce in Brazil a new, more
efficient paradigm for road maintenance and rehabilitation, through a result-based approach which proved
to be successful for the Borrower, and prompted other states and the federal Governments to request Bank
assistance to structure and finance similar approaches to efficiently manage their own paved road networks;
and (b) help coordinate a Government-level effort to resolve a development priority of the administration
which took office in 2002, despite severe constraints both on the fiscal and administrative sides (see below).

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
In the nineties, while Brazil succeeded in stabilizing inflation, it was still lagging behind in term of fiscal
reform. As a result, Brazilian fiscal accounts deteriorated progressively to the point that, by the end of the
nineties, most states in Brazil were in a very difficult fiscal situation, with a number of large economy
states on the verge of bankruptcy. The threat to the national economy was real, and in 1998, the federal
Government engaged in a process of debt restructuring with 25 out of the 27 states, and in 2000, approved
the Fiscal Responsibility Law, which consolidated Brazil's fiscal adjustment policy. The Borrower's fiscal
situation was particularly delicate, and it took until 2003 to see the initial results of the implementation of
its fiscal adjustment policy. Especially over the 2000-2003 period, the state administration was not
authorized to borrow, had to drastically cut on expenditures to ensure it could meet its monthly payment
obligations, and found itself in a situation where less than 2% of the state's revenues were available for
discretionary expenditures, including investments under the project. The necessary fiscal adjustment policy
followed by the State impacted negatively the project, by generating large delays in payments due to
contractors (up to seven months), which decreased significantly the confidence of contractors in the State's
ability to pay, as evidenced by delays in procurement and contract signing, frequent demobilization and
renegotiations of contract schedules.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Changes in Government development priorities and levels of Government coordination have been two of the
main variables affecting project implementation6.

_____________________________________________________

1995-1998, 1999-2002, and 2003-2006 periods.

Indeed, in a highly constrained fiscal environment (which was the case in the State especially over the
2000-2003 period): (a) development priorities tend to be more short-sighted and focused on enabling the
State to continue to meet its core obligations (e.g. payment of salaries, social security, pension and social
programs); and (b) high level of internal Government coordination is required to ensure buy-in into the
strategies to be followed and wide participation in the decision-making process, especially when it comes to
decisions on budgetary and expenditure limits.

The 3 state administrations involved in project implementation wrestled with the two above-mentioned
issues, with varying level of success, and, not surprisingly, this was lowest during the period of highest
fiscal constraints (see graph below).

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Two main factors affected project implementation: (a) while DAER's technical capacity was adequate
overall, DAER's efficiency in implementing the project was affected by its outdated central information
system, an insufficient number of highly trained technical staff (partly as the result of hiring restrictions
imposed by the State as part of its fiscal adjustment effort) especially when it comes to management of
result-based contracts, and state-wide lengthy and complex administration processes; and (b) the resilience
of DAER staff in executing the project despite the major difficulties encountered.

5.4 Costs and financing:
Project's physical output targets were basically achieved in line with the U.S. dollar cost estimates
undertaken during project preparation.      However, given the strong devaluation of the Brazilian real
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and the relatively low inflation over the project implementation period,7 it is
estimated that the project's actual real cost in Brazilian Reais is about 24% higher than originally
estimated. The main reasons for these cost increases include: (a) higher degradation of road condition
(resulting from large delays in contracting of works) which increased rehabilitation costs; (b) irregularity of
payments to contractors which led to various neutralization of works, and thus requirements to pay
interests on late payments, pay higher price adjustments, and revise work schedules; and (c) an increase in
the price of bituminous material of close to 100% over the project implementation period.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The result-based concept for road rehabilitation and maintenance, as well as the related norms and
documents necessary to the concept's implementation have been well accepted by the Borrower, and by the
engineering and construction industry. In fact, the concept is at the center of the Borrower's strategy for
managing its paved network, and is increasingly accepted by other states and the federal administration. In
addition, during project implementation, DAER succeeded in structuring a core technical capacity to
manage such contracts. Finally, the present Government considers the rehabilitation of the paved network
as a high-priority development objective, and has set-up an effective coordination mechanism between the
Secretariats of Transports, Finances and Planning to ensure that progress could be made toward reaching
that objective.

However, while the Borrower's fiscal situation has shown some improvement over the last two years, it is
likely that a rigid fiscal adjustment policy will need to be maintained over the medium-term. In addition,
while it is likely that adequately managing the state paved road network will remain a priority development
objective of the new Government to take office at the end of the year, it cannot be estimated whether the
new Government will be able to organize itself in a way so as to continue working effectively toward
reaching the objective.

Taking the above into account, the sustainability of the institutional improvements brought by the project is
rated likely, with some uncertainty as to whether the state's fiscal situation in the short- and medium-term
will allow the road administration to take full opportunity of such improvements to maintain adequately the
whole state road network.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
No specific transition arrangement is required to allow for regular project operation.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The project's objective was in line with the Government's development strategy and the Country Assistance
Strategy for Brazil, the components were well targeted, the risk analysis and overall project evaluation were
realistic, the project's implementation structure was well designed, and the project team adequately staffed.
On the other hand, with hindsight, the project team could have better recognized the risks associated with
the state's fiscal situation and the possible impact which could have resulted from a substantial change in
Government. Overall, Bank performance during lending is rated satisfactory.

7.2 Supervision:
During implementation, the project team maintained a constant and comprehensive dialogue to the
Borrower to identify and help resolve the main implementation issues, and in doing so, received full support
from sector and country management. Supervision intensity was adequate, both in terms of site visits (on
average, two a year) and in terms of experience/knowledge of project team members. The project could
have been cancelled unilaterally by the Bank in 2002, given a clearly unsatisfactory project implementation
performance over a 3 years period. Instead, the Bank chose to engage in a high-level dialogue with the
Borrower to assess whether cancellation was the proper solution. Following the elections in October 2002,
the Government transition team mentioned that the project would be high-priority for the new Government,
which led the Bank to define a set of conditions to be achieved within the 6 first months of the
administration, to avoid cancellation and allow for project restructuring. Doing so allowed for the project
to be implemented and strengthened the relationship between the Borrower and the Bank. The Bank's
strategy thus paid off. In addition, the choice to shift to result-based contracts for road maintenance and
rehabilitation revealed judicious.     As such, Bank performance in supervising the project is rated
satisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall performance of the Bank is therefore rated satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower showed a high level of commitment with the project, as evidenced by its willingness to
engage in a far-reaching reform of its road administration, and its readiness in delivering all documents
necessary to complete the preparation, including the development of a set of maintenance policies, the
preparation of a rehabilitation and upgrading/paving program and the respective five-year highway public
expenditure program, the collection of information for and the carrying out of the project's economic
analysis, and the definition of project targets, cost estimates and the financing plan. The performance of
the Borrower during project preparation is rated satisfactory.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
From April 2001 to November 2002, the Government implementation performance is rated highly
unsatisfactory. Indeed, the Government did not make available, in a timely fashion, the financial resources
necessary to ensure adequate execution of works, did not initiate the staff restructuring of DAER,     and

incurred close to US$1 million in foreign exchange loss by changing U.S. dollars from the Special Account
into Brazilian Reais in the project account, with no short-term perspective for using the funds for project
purposes.8

Since 2003, the Government implementation performance is rated highly satisfactory.            Indeed, the
Government was highly successful in acting in a coordinated fashion to resolve the financial issue which
plagued project implementation and to closely monitor, on a very regular basis, implementation progress.
By July 2003, the Government had fulfilled all conditions defined by the Bank not to cancel the operation,
and to restructure the project, including a one-year closing date extension, renewable automatically  (9)for
another year provided a specific implementation target is achieved. The Government achieved the target,
and in two years, undertook 70% of all civil works executed under the project.

Government implementation performance is rated satisfactory.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Generally speaking, DAER handled appropriately the technical issues faced during implementation,
especially those emanating from the introduction of the result-based concept to road maintenance and
rehabilitation. In addition, the PMU assumed adequately its responsibilities with respect to procurement
and reporting requirements (including the financial management aspects to be handled at the level of
DAER). However, as mentioned earlier, DAER failed to structure a fully integrated and automated project
information system.

The implementing agency's performance is rated satisfactory.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

8 Following discussions with the Bank's Disbursement Department, it was agreed that this loss would be
compensated by the submission of Special Account replenishment applications evidencing eligible expenditures
incurred by the Borrower up to the above-mentioned amount.

8. Lessons Learned

Result-based contracts are effective: the execution of the project confirmed the efficiency of result-based
contracts for road maintenance and rehabilitation contracts, even in a fiscally-constrained environment,
with respect to the following: (a) rehabilitation works are followed by maintenance services within the same
contract, which allows to partially address chronic lack of network maintenance, and improve contractor's
accountability with respect to rehabilitation works; (b) contract flexibility allows to accommodate large
variations in the client's payment capacity; (c) result-based contracts allow for simpler but more efficient
supervision of contract execution; (d) longer term contracts and transfer of responsibility of final design to
the contractor allow to lower the risks as perceived by the contractors; and (e) contracts cover longer
extension of road sections, for longer periods of time, thus significantly reducing the number of
procurement processes to be undertaken. Since its introduction in Brazil within the state of Rio Grande do
Sul, the result-based concept has been adopted at the national level as well as by various states.

Government's commitment to reforms is put to the test in a fiscally-constrained environment: fundamental
political preferences are highlighted in a highly fiscally-constrained environment. In this case, the project
was prepared and implemented essentially at the same time as an IADB- and JBIC-financed road paving
project.   This generated, within the same sector, "unfair"10 competition for allocation of resources,
interference at the policy dialogue level, and reduced the project's impact in terms of development of an
integrated road management policy. While closer coordination at the time of project preparation would
have allowed management better of such issues, the question could be asked as to whether, under conditions
such as those found in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, the concomitant execution of an infrastructure
rehabilitation, and an infrastructure construction projects should have been evaluated as a risk to the
satisfactory implementation of the rehabilitation project.

Could the Bank refine the way it takes into account "external" implementation delays in evaluating or
seeking to improve implementation performance?: the implementation of the project suffered from two
main "external" implementation delays:

         (a) a 15 months delay in effectiveness, reflecting (i) the increasing difficult fiscal situation of the
state (the federal government, as guarantor of the Bank loan, will only sign the guarantee agreement during
such periods all dues of the sub-national government to the federal government have been paid, such
periods being usually short, down do a day or two in some cases), (ii) general political divergences between
the state and federal governments, which have generated additional delays in the emission of the federal
government's authorization to sign the guarantee agreement, pending the resolution of non-project related
issues; and (iii) political difficulties within the state Congress, which have generated delays in the approval
of the project; and

         (b) a 3-years implementation delay, reflecting the tight fiscal situation at the level of the state, and
the ensuing difficulties for the Government, in such context, to prioritize financing of project expenditures.

It can be argued that both these delays are, in a way, "external" to the project, and that the Bank had
limited ability to foster an early resolution of the related issues. In addition, in the case of the effectiveness
delay, given the reasons for such delay, it could be argued that (i) such delay was not linked to the fact that
the project was not ready; and (ii) in such cases, project implementation should really starts from the
effectiveness date, and not the Board presentation date. Finally, in the case of the implementation delay, it
could be argued that having asked the project team to devise action plans to improve implementation
performance and demonstrate proactivity was of little effectiveness, in a situation where both the Bank and
the Government were not ready to cancel the Project but, on the other hand, the Government was clearly
not in a situation to effectively commit itself. It was not until 2003 that the Government succeeded in
structuring an effective partnership between the secretaries of planning, finance and transport, which then
allowed project implementation to improve substantially.

Conditional, performance-based extension of loan closing date is an effective tool: as part of the project
restructuring, it was agreed that the project implementation period would be extended by two years, but
that the second year extension would be subject to the achievement, during the first year of a specific
implementation target, to confirm the validity of the project restructuring. The introduction in the loan
agreement of such a conditional extension of the loan closing date based on performance, has been seen,
both by the Borrower and the project team, as an effective mechanism to ensure that adequate
implementation progress be made in a timely fashion.

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

The general evaluation of the Rio Grande do Sul Highway Management Project (RGSHMP)
implementation is rated very good.

Institutionally, under the RGSHMP, the Departamento Autônomo de Estradas de Rodagem (DAER) had
the opportunity of modernizing its staff, promoting training of such staff taking into consideration their new
roles, and preparing the future evolutions of the institution, all this under the supervision and orientation of
an international financial institution. Besides, in the framework of the Loan Program, a new highways
network management approach was developed notably focusing on economic and financial evaluations and
benefits to road users. The opportunity to discussing highway engineering daily issues within the DAER
with internationally experienced and renowned consultants, contracted in the framework of the Project
Technical Assistance, allowed to improve the management of the highway network, notably envisaging an
accrued recourse to the participation of the private sector.

In this context, with the World Bank support, the Rio Grande Sul Government started the Program of
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contracts (CREMA Contracts) on 2,544 km of state highways. Despite
the difficulties to maintain regular payments to the companies, which consequences were negative for the
good implementation of the program, the DAER, through the CREMA contracts, was able among others,
to improve the staff skills in contract management, to develop tools for conflict resolutions, to expand
communication with road users etc. At the end of the Loan disbursement period, the DAER capacities in
contract management have been strengthened, in line with the project institutional strengthening component
objective.

Thanks to CREMA contracts, the capacity of management of the road network was improved. In
particular, the design of performance indicators was very supportive for the management of the Program as
it helped the DAER's staff pointing out the issues and focusing on the resolution of the observed problems.

The implementation of cost-benefit analysis on the diverse lots of the Program allowed to (a) improve the
efficiency of the resource allocation in the road sector and use of funds; (b) increase private sector
participation in the management and financing of the network; (c) strengthen DAER's capacity to manage
its road programs; and (d) rehabilitate and maintain selected road network sections, in line with the Project
objectives.

The technical assistance provided by the joint venture ACL-Scetauroute was also very opportune allowing
a share of experiences between DAER's staff and internationally experienced consultants. In addition, day
to day support to decision making process based on experience acquired in other projects and similar
situations were provided by the JV. Likewise, the contribution of this consultant was very valuable for the
conception and implementation of the CREMA Program and for the development of the Highway Network
Management Software (ROUTE 2000RS System). However, resistance to hiring international Consultants
were observed within DAER, considering their cost, far above the price normally paid to national
consultants.

The restructuring of the Loan Agreement, required by the Rio Grande do Sul Government and authorized
by the World Bank, revealed a fundamental element allowing to attain the project targets. Although this
restructuring resulted in a general reduction of resources allocated to the Project, the reduction of the share
of the counterpart was in fact supportive to the implementation of the Program components, in particular
CREMA Program, which was previously seriously jeopardized due to the lack of regular allocation of
counterpart resource. The introduction of a new component aiming at modernizing the Companhia de
Processamento de Dados do Estado (PROCERGS), despite it slightly altered the main objective of the
project (i.e. the state highway management), has set the conditions to improve the tax system efficiency. In
medium to long term, this should result in increased resources allocation to investments.

Eventually, minor negative aspects such as the non-implementation of the Project Management System
(delivered with delay), the non-acquisition of enough computers and software, and delays in the execution
of contracted works, which consequences will continue beyond the closing of the Loan disbursement period,
affected negatively the general evaluation of the Project. As previously mentioned, the evaluation remains
however globally positive in the light of the main achievements of the Project.

2.     Part A: Policy and Institutional Development

The Project includes the following components, which are evaluated below.

1.     Preparing and monitoring the implementation of the State Road Programs and strengthening
DAER's planning, programming, budgeting and monitoring systems.

       The establishment of a set of actions needed for the implementation of CREMA Program was a
       challenge for DAER's staff, especially the design of a set of performance indicators for the
       contracts' monitoring. This new way of evaluating the performance of contracts was used to
       establish a series of basic premises aiming at building a set of knowledge needed for the planning
       and implementation of road programs. Likewise, the processes for program budgeting and
       monitoring have been developed and refined over the last four year of the CREMA Program.

       Based on the above processes, thanks to the support of DAER's staff training program, and
       technical assistance from consultants, DAER's staff evaluated the feasibility of two programs
       dedicated to the management of the state road network: Estudo de Viabilidade de Implantação do
       Programa CREMA/RS II (second phase of the CREMA program) and Relatório para Implantação
       do Sistema de Gerência de Pavimentos ­ ROUTE II (design of a pavement management system).
       The effective implementation of both programs, which derive from the Loan Agreement objectives,
       remains, at the end of the disbursement period, subject to a decision of implementation by the State
       government.

       Finally, it is evaluated that the Loan Program allowed to support the institutional development of
       DAER's staff, which has acquired the capacity to formulate, prepare, plan, program, monitor and
       budget state network management programs, thus achieving one of the Loan Agreement objectives,
       the "strengthening DAER's capacity to manage its road programs".

2.     Supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Borrower's highway concession and contract
maintenance programs.

       Both the Rio Grande do Sul state highway concession program (PECR) and the program of
       rehabilitation and maintenance contract (CREMA) were implemented in the frame of the Project.
       The concession contracts have been facing difficulties resulting from the cultural resistance against
       the principle of tolls on road transport. Even so, the PECR has been able to match its objectives
       consisting in providing security, comfort and economy for the concerned roads' users. Other
       difficulties observed in the implementation of this concession program were caused by late toll
       price adjustment and the non-implementation of foreseen toll plazas. The difficulties were subject
       to negotiation between the conceding authority, the concessionaires and the road users under the
       supervision of the state regulation agency (AGERGS). The experience and knowledge gained in the
       development of this program are considered definite and future eventual cancelling of the PERC
       very unlikely.

       Contracts for management of paved state highways of the network have been implemented in the
       frame of the CREMA Program. The financial difficulties faced by the state treasury did not allow
       to implement further management and infrastructure widening contracts, as initially planned for the
       remaining paved network, notably considering the fact that this type of programs requires regular



                                                   - 19 -

        payments and cash flow availability.

        It is generally recognized by DAER's staff that highway network management contracts are more
        efficient and effective than traditional contracts. However, the state Treasury financial limited
        capacities only provided sufficient resources for maintenance contracts. Rehabilitation projects,
        though pointed out as priority works through the simulations of the pavement management system,
        had to be postponed, due to financial difficulties faced by the State Treasury. These constraints will
        conduct to undertake works only in specific cases, whenever the state of the roads does allow
        proper transport conditions anymore.

        In addition, another maintenance program to the unpaved roads network was considered, based on
        similar concepts as of CREMA programs. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned financial difficulties
        did not permit to concretely implement the program either. As a result, the unpaved roads network
        maintenance remained carried out through traditional maintenance contracts, sharing the service
        between the DAER's force account and private partners.

        Generally, it is evaluated that the Loan Program strongly contributed to the implementation of the
        PERC and CREMA Programs and feasibility studies on programs of maintenance of the unpaved
        network. The Program also contributed to the development of a culture of monitoring and
        supervision of the road network within DAER in order to determine technical solutions for both
        maintenance and rehabilitation. Thus, it is evaluated that the Loan Program objective aiming at a
        more efficient resource allocation and utilization in the road sector was attained and that the
        DAER's staff was able to develop efficient resource allocation tools. The full applications of these
        achievements were unfortunately constrained by the lack of financial resources.

3.      Restructuring of DAER's operations in accordance with the above policy changes through the
reformulating of its institutional structure including the preparation and implementation of a staffing plan,
and staff training programs, as well as the carrying out of an inventory of DAER's physical assets and
assets' sales program.

        Restructuring of DAER

        The restructuring of DAER is currently coming to an end. The delays in its finalization were due to
        antagonist visions of the succeeding governments (1994-1998, 1999-2002 and 2003-2006).
        DAER's first administration (1994-1998), during which the Loan Agreement was signed,
        supported the reduction of staff through voluntary retrenchment program, an increased
        participation of the private sector, an improvement of DAER's staff competences and capacities
        with emphasis on the management rather than the execution of works with force account, the
        transfer of some highways operations to private partners in order to reduce costs, etc. At this stage,
        DAER's restructuring process remained unconcluded due to the government change.

        The following administration (1999-2002) adopted an opposite policy: strengthening of the public
        sector through an increase of DAER's staff and force account participation, new structuring of
        operational staff, increased force account works through the recruitment of new technical staff
        (competitive exam set up in the previous government), starting of a process of acquisition of the
        tools and equipment to support the new structure of operational activities (process which remained
        uncompleted), reduction of activities contracted to private partners, in particular for works
        supervision, design, road maintenance etc. A new functional organization chart was also discussed




                                                     - 20 -

        and was partially implemented.

The current administration (2003-2006) has been working on consolidating a DAER's structural
organization since none of the previous restructuring processes were completely concluded or implanted.
Based on the knowledge gained of the previous processes, the new structuring aims at reducing conflicts
and improve DAER's operation and management through force account and private partners' participation.
Delays in the implementation of this new reform were linked to the uncertainties regarding the continuation
of the Loan program and the possible consequences of such reform. In particular, the management focused
on ample discussion with the staff representatives in the frame of a consensual process of restructuring.

        Reducing of the DAER's staff

        The initial plan to reduce DAER's staff faced legal obstacles to its effective implementation. The
        Brazilian civil servants are entitled to "job stability", which practically ensure a protection against
        unjustified dismissals. At the time of the project design, a state voluntary retrenchment program
        was in place and foreseen to be implemented, resulting in a staff reduction. The changes of
        orientation in the succeeding administrations regarding civil servants public policies led to the
        non-accomplishment of this target. The current DAER's administration currently attempted to
        obtain a restructuring of the staff by natural retrenchment ­ specially the middle and lower staff
        level ­ replaced by superior and middle staff level as needed.

        Training program

        The design of DAER's staff training program started during the 1999-2002 administration. The
        implementation of the training program was delayed due to two main constraints imposed by
        DAER's administration. The first one was related to the obligation to call for superior teaching
        institutions, with a good grade following the Ministry of Education evaluation, instead of calling
        for Consulting companies, as is usually the case. The second constraint resulted from an
        inconsistency between the Brazilian legal framework and the World bank rules on procurement: the
        legal agreement established between two public institutions is a partnership, called Convênio,
        rather than a contract. When training or consulting service are provided through Convênio, a
        complex system obeying specific preconditions has to be respected in order to avoid unfair
        competition between public and private institutions. Convênio is a Brazilian legal provision which
        does not exist in the World Bank Guidelines. The Guidelines provisions (Direct Contract) were
        therefore not applicable to this specific type of relationship. As a result, the training program could
        not be effectively implemented, resulting, through simple enrollment, in the training of about only
        ten technicians ­ in public or private institutions ­ up to the end of 2002. The issue was eventually
        solved in 2003, thus ensuring that there were no longer obstacles from the National legislation or
        Bank to the enrollment of the staff in regular courses provided by either public or private
        institutions. Only by this date, thus, it was possible to effectively undertake the training program
        for DAER staff in the framework of the loan, which went on well from this date. One of the
        positive achievements obtained in the training program was the understanding of highway
        cost/benefits stakes, especially the importance of traffic, vehicle operation costs, rehabilitation and
        maintenance costs.

        The results were considered very positive: not only the training contributed to update the staff
        knowledge but also it supported the staff in becoming more aware of the management and
        supervision of roads program stakes. In particular, DAER's outsourcing works and services started
        being better understood thanks to the training. Other training course focused on the evaluation of
        engineering design with the objective to prepare the technical staff to the increasing recourse to


                                                     - 21 -

       outsourcing process.

4.      Preparation and implementation of the Environmental Guidelines and development of the
Borrower's institutional capabilities to implement such Guidelines.

       During the first three years of the Loan disbursement period, with the support of the contracted
       technical assistance, a Manual de Meio Ambiente para Empreendimentos Rodoviários (highway
       activities environment manual), was designed. This Manual is currently used in the DAER, which
       disposes of a specific unit that deals with environment. In the new structure, two units dealing with
       environment are designed: one concerned with norms, inspection services, and works related to
       environment; the second concerned with environment design preparation.

       The highway activities environment manual developed is being required to support the elaboration
       of other manuals across Brazil.

3.      Part B: Rehabilitation and Maintenance

1.      Carrying out of Subprojects for the rehabilitation or resurfacing of approximately 2,500 kilometers
of the Borrower's road network, including related studies and supervision of such Subprojects.

       The starting of the Program related to the rehabilitation works followed the timetable as it was
       initially scheduled, consisting in the planning and programming of the rehabilitation works, the
       contracting of the engineering design, the contracting of the works and of the supervision. At the
       end of the first year of the rehabilitation program, following a series of discussion and meetings,
       DAER's administration, with the approval of the government, decided to switch the classical
       rehabilitations program towards rehabilitation and maintenance contracts (CREMA). These types
       of contracts had been successfully implanted in Argentina in the framework of World Bank loans
       and appeared to be a good alternative to traditional management of highway network.

       The implementation of the CREMA Program started in march/2000 with the contracting of a
       consulting firm to support the planning of the program, the setting-up of engineering design, the
       contracting of works, and others. This first stage was concluded in 2002 with the signing of seven
       CREMA contracts (out of a total of fifteen planned). The eight remaining lots were not contracted
       due to insufficiency of resources on the loan and incapacity of the state Treasury to support new
       further expenditures. The a posteriori evaluation of CREMA contracts is that they provide better
       performance than the traditional contracts, for the following reasons: they allow to ensure road
       maintenance on sets of highways and to implement road works at lower prices (efficiency); they
       keep the Contractors responsible for road maintenance after the conclusion of the works (efficacy);
       in the particular case of Rio Grande do Sul, they allowed to attain the expected objectives
       (effectiveness). These contracts require however regular payments and sufficient funding to be
       implemented continuously.

       The Rio Grande do Sul CREMA program was conceived and contracted during the 1999-2002
       DAER Administration. Due to payment irregularities, the implementation of the program was early
       stopped in August 2002. At that moment, one of the contractors had already requested the contract
       rescission by judicial means, and six contracts/lots were still in force, works being however on
       hold. The DAER administration faced enormous difficulties to restart the program between 2003
       and 2006 due to the following reasons: needs to update and re-adequate the design of the contracts,
       renegotiate with the contractors, redefine the counterpart funds in order to turn the program more
       consistent with the budget availability of the State. A specific commitment of the actual



                                                    - 22 -

government in 2002 to maintain the program alive, together with specific efforts of the three
Secretariats ­ Coordenação e Planejamento (SePlan), Transportes (ST), and Fazenda (SeFaz) ­
eventually achieved to maintain a minimum regularity in the cash flows allocations, allowing to
merely execute the contracts.

By the end of the Loan disbursement period (December 15, 2005) almost all contracted works had
been concluded and the contracted maintenance of the network had been regularly implemented,
allowing the allocation of further resources to the rest of the network. The above mentioned efforts
also allowed the re-contracting of the Lot 01 following its judicial rescission. In total, during the
period (between 2003 and 2006), 2.106,07 km of roads were rehabilitated out of the 2.188 km long
rehabilitation extension of network contracted through CREMA. This represented a total of R$
195.662.634,60 out of which R$ 59.390.869,22 financed by the state Treasury, a very consequent
effort considering the low financial/fiscal capacities.

As a first lesson learned, it is evaluated that future CREMA programs shall require both a better
definition of the performance indicators and an increase of the number of such indicators. Indeed, a
regular trend has been observed among the Contractors to questioning these indicators, not
sufficiently well defined at the initial step of the process. Additionally, the non-respect of such
indicators has been regularly observed, in particular when the contractors weren't submitted to any
financial potential sanctions. The design of indicators in the future CREMA contracts should take
into account the necessity to focusing on the general serviceability of the network on the one side,
notably the road conditions, if possible based on other countries experience, and on specific
technical issues and currently observed defects (such as pothole, cracking, among others) on the
other side. Other performance indicators should also be designed to measure the contract correct
execution (such as key personnel, work teams, plants, equipment, among others). Eventually,
performance indicators associated to routine maintenance of the network should also be better
specified, as it was observed a trend to neglect these parts of the Contracts by the Contractors.

A second lesson learned concerns the contract evaluation process. During the evaluation of the
bids, the contractors shall be allowed to propose alternative (and innovative) solutions, thus taking
a certain risk, however in the respect of both the public patrimony and the comfort and security of
the road users. Additionally, a clearer definition of work priorities shall be made, focusing in
priority on the roads with highest traffic flows or worst conditions. In fact, the experience showed
that, when the initiative was left to the contractors (i.e., when the criteria weren't sufficiently well
defined at the bidding stage), the priority order set by the contractors weren't necessarily the most
pertinent for the public goods.

Another lesson learnt concerns the need to define tools allowing an adaptable rhythm of
implementation of the works, including for example, the suspension of the rehabilitation works for
diverse motives (specifically financial ones), without stopping the maintenance activities. In
compensation, regular payment of these maintenance activities by the employer shall be ensured.
The risk, without such minimum maintenance, would be otherwise to reach a complete and rapid
decay of the network infrastructure. In the particular case of the present Project, specific indicators
for price adjustments were also designed due to the fear of potential increase of American Dollar
rate compared to Brazilian Real (which would increase the prices of the bituminous materials).
However, considering the observed evaluations of the change rate during the period of
implementation of the Project, it is interesting to note that, though the contracted amounts have
been increased by 60% in Reals, they remained practically stables in American Dollars.

        Ultimate lesson learned, the technological control shall be implemented by consulting and
        engineering specialized companies. The tries to implement this technological control by force
        account in the present program, using equipment provided by the Contractors, revealed inadequate
        due to the insufficient number and availability of experienced technical staff. In the next CREMA
        contracts, the engineering companies should, jointly with DAER's teams, verify that the activities
        were implemented in conformity with the performance indicators.

2.      Maintenance of the Borrower's paved road network, excluding the conceded sections

        The DAER maintains the state highway network through 17 operational districts (called Distrito
        Operacional or DOP), strategically distributed in the state. These DOP are decentralized units.
        They dispose of autonomy in their jurisdiction to evaluate the condition of the network and traffic,
        to design the maintenance program within their circumscription, to require the contracting of works
        and services to the DAER and to supervise contracted works and services. These DOP, which
        dispose of financial resources, work teams, equipment and materials to perform the maintenance
        activities, are allowed to implement the road maintenance by their own force account. When the
        DOP is able to perform these activities or is not under a CREMA contract, the alternative is the
        "supplying contracts" (called Contratos de Fornecimento)

        "Supplying contracts" is a concept that was developed in the Rio Grande do Sul. These contracts
        are considered intermediate and transitory ways towards CREMA to palliate the DOPs deficiencies
        on the maintenance of both the paved and unpaved network. These contracts have been developed
        to answer the observed lack of means, such as human resources, equipment, financial resources in
        the existing system. In various cases, it was observed that, though resources were available in the
        district, they were not sufficient to correctly perform the road maintenance. In such cases, private
        partners were contracted to supply equipment and/or material (such as asphalt concrete to fill
        potholes), to cover the districts' needs. Though not the most efficient nor effective road
        maintenance system, it has revealed a possible transitory alternative system.

        In some cases, the routine maintenance of part of the network is included in the CREMA when the
        other part is maintained by the DOP. Based on the road network evaluation carried out at the end
        of 2004, it is evaluated that both CREMA contracted firms and operational districts have been
        performing well. This is all the more positive as, when compared, the Federal network of the State
        was found in bad conditions.

        One of the main outbreak of the Project is the acceptance by the State of the importance of an
        increased participation of the private sector for the maintenance of the road network, which was
        one of the objectives of the loan, for the following reasons: relieve the State from such activities,
        obtain better performance, obtain better efficiency. Other achievements concern the development of
        performance indicators for the quality of contract implementation and performance indicators on
        the general condition of the network. Together, these tools allow to compare the network
        maintained with force account to the one maintained by the private sector. The system is also
        adaptable, allowing the design of new performance indicators to best monitoring the contracts.

Effectively, at the end of the Loan disbursement period, about 80% of the state highway network was rated
"good" (IRI < 3) while less than 5% was rated "poor". Based on surveys carried out in 1997 and 2004,
about 1.500 km of highways changed their classification from "bad" or "regular" to "good" during the
Loan period.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

1.        Summary of the Staff Appraisal Economic Analysis

The economic analysis of the Staff Appraisal Report was based on the comparison of a "do-nothing"
situation, including routine maintenance, to the evaluated optimal strategy, which consisted in investing
US$ 25 million per year over a period of 5 years on rehabilitation in addition to the expenses of the
"do-nothing" situation. This strategy was expected to lead to the following results:

             (a) Net present value of US$ 615 million;
             (b) Internal rate of return of 98%;
             (c) Benefit/Cost ratio of 6.7
             (d) Improvement of the road conditions:

                   - from 52 to 85% of the paved network with an IRI<3
                   - from 5 to 2.5% of the paved network with an IRI>5

2.        Main facts affecting Economic analysis results

The rehabilitation and maintenance strategy could not be implemented as initially planned for the reasons
discussed in the paragraph 4 of the ICR. Indeed, the total investments in rehabilitation and maintenance of
the paved network were US$ 105 million, compared to the planned US$ 142 million, over a 7 year period
instead of 5 years. The average annual expenses on the paved network were US$ 15 million. The table
below shows the total project investment between 1999 and 2005.

* estimated value for 2005




The above table illustrates the comments issued in the ICR and reflects the fact that: (a) the project start
was delayed by at least 2 years; (b) the total and average investments were by far lower than initially
planned, in particular during the first 5 years of implementation; (c) only by 2004, year corresponding to
the initial implementation of the CREMA contracts, the investment levels have started to be in line with the
initial plans.

3.        Results of a posteriori evaluation

The Project, though it roughly achieved the output objectives, with the rehabilitation of 2400 km of paved
roads, did not manage to reach the expected outcome targets: the proportion of paved network in good

conditions increased from 52% to 77% instead of the planned 85%, the proportion of paved network in bad
conditions increased from 5% to 8.3% instead of decreasing to 2.5%.

The a posteriori economic evaluation was conducted taking into account the observed rehabilitation and
maintenance expenses and an average investment of US$ 15 million on the remaining 15 years of the
evaluation period until reaching the initially expected level of road conditions. The economic simulation led
to the following results:

(a)     NPV = US$ 495 million
(b)     IRR = 79%
