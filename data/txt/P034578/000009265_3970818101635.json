of the Rio Grande Do\n            Sul State Highway Management Project is to improve state\n            highway network serviceability with a view to reducing road\n            transport costs, through: (1) more efficient allocation and\n            use; (2) increasing private participation in road\n            management; (3) improving the capacity of the state\n            department that manages roads (DAER); and (4) rehabilitating\n            selected sections and maintaining the state's entire\n            paved highway network. The project's components are:\n            (1) policy and institutional development, including\n            technical assistance, equipment, software, and staff\n            training to (a) prepare and monitor efficient state road\n            expenditure and funding programs; (b) supervise and monitor\n            implementing the state's highway concession program and\n            transferring maintenance activities to private contractors;\n            and (c) restructure the DAER's operations according to\n            policy changes satisfying stated criteria, downsizing\n            operational divisions and strengthening technical,\n            environmental, management and supervision capabilities, and\n            establishing clear goals and accountability; and (2)\n            rehabilitation, including resurfacing, and routine\n            maintenance of the state's roads, and related studies,\n            engineering designs, and works supervision."}, "docdt": "1997-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
