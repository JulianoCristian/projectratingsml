and\n            implementation of community-based integrated ecosystems\n            management plans (watershed management plans, wetland\n            catchment management plans) that achieve local, national and\n            global benefits. Due to unforeseen delays in project\n            implementation, primarily due to staff changes and delays in\n            procurement related to the biodiversity information system,\n            the Government of Rwanda has requested a second extension\n            for six months to enable it to bring all project activities\n            (including biodiversity information system and awareness\n            building activities) to an orderly closure by June 30, 2011.\n            The reallocation also reflects lessons learned during\n            project implementation, reduced workshop costs due to\n            synergies with other activities, and additional support\n            required for goods and consultancies required for the\n            biodiversity information system."}, "docdt": "2010-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
