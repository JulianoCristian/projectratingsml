Restructuring Paper

1.    Proceeds for Rwanda, Integrated Management of Critical Ecosystems Project,
[TF 55471], P070700 will be reallocated as follows:

                                                   Allocation
                 Category of Expenditure
                                                   Current         Revised
                 Subproject Grants                       310,000     308,908.38
                 Works                                   580,000     752,557.16
                 Goods                                   380,000     319,347.56
                 Consultants (Incl. Audits)            2,000,000   2,042,803.28
                 Training, Workshops                     560,000     387,041.26
                 Incremental Operating Costs             470,000     489,342.36
                 Unallocated                             0         0
                 Total                                 4,300,000      4,300,000


2.      The project is largely completed. All planned activities are bring brought to an
orderly closure. The knowledge base for biodiversity has been improved, including the
development of a Biodiversity Catalog and the roll-out of a Biodiversity Information
System. Policy and capacity-building initiatives have been undertaken, and community-
based micro-projects have been realized. Work on the development of an Atlas, and
studies on climate change and marshland conservation are expected to provide useful
information for critical ecosystem management in Rwanda. The project objectives
continue to be achievable and no change in project activities are proposed.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to bring the project to an orderly closure.
The reallocated amounts reflect the final estimates of category expenses near the end of
the project that will be accounted for in the four months following project closure. The
changes primarily reflect the increase in civil works costs due to improving the
construction standards of the watchtowers, changes in training, workshop, and IT needs
and costs, as well as recruitment of additional interns and consultants to help with the
biodiversity catalog development.
