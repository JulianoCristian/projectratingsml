SUMMARY
1. This Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President for the
   extension of the Closing Date of the GEF Trust Fund Grant for the Rwanda Integrated
   Management of Critical Ecosystems (IMCE) Project (TF 55471) from December 31,
   2010 to June 30, 2011 and the reallocation of Grant Funds among existing
   disbursement categories. The Grant signed August 11, 2005 between the Republic of
   Rwanda ("Recipient") and the International Development Association ("World
   Bank") in the amount of US$ 4,300,000 aims to promote the adoption of an integrated
   ecosystem approach to promote the adoption of an integrated ecosystem approach
   using improved farming technologies that improve farmers' livelihood and increase
   productivity in a way that protects the resource base for biodiversity conservation
   outside protected areas and for increased carbon sequestration.




PROJECT STATUS
2. The project is being implemented by the Rwanda Environmental Management
   Authority (REMA). The project was initially part of the first phase of the Rwanda
   Rural Sector Support Program and had a slow start after its effectiveness on February
   9, 2006. Project implementation picked up substantially after the IMCE project
   became a stand-alone project in June 2008. Based on MTR recommendations, the
   project was extended to December 31, 2010. The project has made satisfactory
   progress on its objectives and has several laudable achievements relating to
   biodiversity policy and on-the-ground implementation.

3. Due to unforeseen delays in project implementation, primarily due to staff changes
   and delays in procurement related to the Biodiversity Information System (one of the
   key project performance indicators), the Government of Rwanda has requested a
   second extension for six months to enable it to bring all project activities (including
   Biodiversity Information System and awareness building activities) to an orderly
   closure by June 30, 2011.

PROPOSED CHANGES
4. Reallocations: A total of about US$0.98 million (23% of the grant amount) will be
   reallocated as follows:

                                                      Allocation
             Category of Expenditure
                                                 Current         Revised
             Subproject Grants                          550,000          310,000
             Works                                      310,000          580,000
             Goods                                      280,000          380,000
             Consultants (Incl. Audits)               1,500,000        2,000,000
             Training, Workshops                        800,000          560,000
             Incremental Operating Costs                360,000          470,000
             Unallocated                                500,000          0
             Total                                    4,300,000        4,300,000

5. These changes are primarily due to reallocation of the original "Unallocated"
   category. The reallocation also reflects lessons learned during project
   implementation, reduced workshop costs due to synergies with other activities, and
   additional support required for goods and consultancies required for the Biodiversity
   Information System. The procurement plan is being accordingly revised pending
   approval of the restructuring package to ensure timely execution of remaining tasks.
   There are no outstanding audit reports.

6. Closing date: The extension of the current Project Closing Date by six months to
   June 30, 2011 is being requested in order for the government to complete the project
   effectively. This will help bring all project activities to an orderly closure, especially
   related to the Biodiversity Information System development which is a key
   performance indicator for the second component (Capacity Building and Institutional
   Strengthening for Integrated Ecosystem Management). The proposed extension
   would allow for expansion of the ongoing Biodiversity Cataloguing to cover all major
   flora/fauna species, as well as in setting up a modern Biodiversity Information
   System. It would also help improve activities related to related policy and
   institutional environment for ecosystem management, improvement of training and
   outreach activities, and better synchronization with an ongoing related technical
   assistance on climate change and sustainable land management.

7. With the proposed extension, the Project Objectives are achievable. The performance
   of the Recipient is satisfactory and they have a reasonable and achievable action plan
   to complete the project by the requested closing date of June 30, 2011. Funds and
   staff are available in the Bank to support the project through the extension period.
   This will be the second extension of the Project. The original completion date was
   first extended from October 15, 2009 to December 31, 2010. There are currently no
   issues present which would further delay the project and the Recipient team is
   committed to complete the activities by the new closing date.

1.    Proceeds for Rwanda, Integrated Management of Critical Ecosystems Project,
[TF 55471], P070700 will be reallocated as follows:

                                                    Allocation
            Category of Expenditure

            Subproject Grants                          550,000         310,000
            Works                                      310,000         580,000
            Goods                                      280,000         380,000
            Consultants (Incl. Audits)               1,500,000       2,000,000
            Training, Workshops                        800,000         560,000
            Incremental Operating Costs                360,000         470,000
            Unallocated                                500,000         0
            Total                                    4,300,000       4,300,000


2.     All project components show good progress with delays in activities related to the
Biodiversity Information System. A marshlands inventory has been completed and
adopted. A new Marshlands Law has been drafted. Capacity-building of institutions at
various levels has been initiated with appropriate training and coordination arrangements.
A Biodiversity Catalog is being prepared. Four targeted watershed management plans
have been completed and adopted. Community-based micro-projects and new wetland
management paradigms have been undertaken. Related work on climate change and
marshland conservation guidelines has been initiated. The project objectives continue to
be achievable and the proposed reallocation and closing date extension would help
considerably enhance project achievements and sustainability.

3.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to reallocate the original "Unallocated"
category. The reallocation also reflects lessons learned during project implementation,
reduced workshop costs due to synergies with other activities, and additional support
required for goods and consultancies required for the Biodiversity Information System.

4. The closing date for Rwanda, Integrated Management of Critical Ecosystems Project,
   [TF 55471], P070700 will be extended from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011.

5. The proposed extension is necessary to bring all project activities to an orderly
   closure, especially related to the Biodiversity Information System development which
   is a key performance indicator for the second component (Capacity Building and
   Institutional Strengthening for Integrated Ecosystem Management). The proposed
   extension would allow for expansion of the ongoing Biodiversity Cataloguing to
   cover all major flora/fauna species, as well as in setting up a modern Biodiversity
   Information System. It would also help improve activities related to related policy
   and institutional environment for ecosystem management, improvement of training
   and outreach activities, and better synchronization with an ongoing related technical
   assistance on climate change and sustainable land management.

6. This will be the second extension of the project. The original closing date was first
   extended from October 15, 2009 to December 31, 2010 after recommendation from
   the Mid-Term Review of the project.
