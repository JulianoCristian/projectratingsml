These are some of the lessons learned from\n            this project: Strong and continued Borrower commitment to\n            the project objectives during implementation was critical to\n            a successful project outcome. Payment for part of the\n            technical assistance provided to the participating banks\n            contributed to a reinforced ownership of the project\n            objectives. Although the project was designed carefully and\n            potential risks were identified correctly-for example, there\n            was weak Borrower commitment to bank privatization and a\n            resulting lack of interest by the foreign strategic\n            investors)-- both the Bank and the Government gave\n            insufficient attention to addressing the emerging\n            discrepancies and constraints during project implementation.\n            Implementation of the Loan raised questions about the\n            ultimate effectiveness of the technical assistance provided\n            and the probability of successful bank privatization while\n            state owned enterprises continue to dominate the economy.\n            The technical assistance delivered could have been even more\n            effective if the consultants had been more familiar with\n            local practices and circumstances and had they been more\n            actively involved in implementing their recommendations. In\n            a technical assistance project such as this, these two\n            requirements would need to be part of the consultants'\n            terms of reference. A well-functioning project\n            implementation unit staffed with competent and committed\n            people, fairly remunerated and trained, is essential for a\n            successful implementation of a multi-component and complex\n            project such as this. The Bank and the counterparts used a\n            flexible approach to design and implement best practice\n            solutions. Combining components 1, 2 and 3 under one\n            component resulted in significantly lower contract values\n            and costs. Although the FIBL task management changed over\n            the course of the life of the project, key staff supervised\n            the project during the whole implementation period. This\n            continuity contributed to the success of the project.\n            Although privatization of the banks was not an objective,\n            the latter provided a platform to conduct a dialogue on bank\n            privatization. However, a technical assistance project\n            cannot serve as a vehicle for addressing difficult policy\n            issues such as privatization of state banks or enterprises.\n            A policy based adjustment operation would be required to\n            support such fundamental systemic reforms."}, "docdt": "2004-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
