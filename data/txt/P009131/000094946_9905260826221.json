There are six components. The first provides\n            technical assistance to selected banks addressing treasury\n            and financial risk management, strategic planning,\n            accounting, internal audits, management information systems\n            (MIS), and credit risk management. Experts will be placed in\n            participating banks in order to design and implement\n            reforms. The second component provides technical assistance\n            to all commercial banks, and funds training in critical risk\n            management areas. The third component strengthens the\n            legal/regulatory and supervisory capacity of the central\n            bank. The fourth component strengthens the MIS available to\n            support bank manager decisionmaking; upgrades payments\n            systems, improves telecommunications performance supporting\n            MIS and payments systems; and establishes a global security\n            system to safeguard the commercial banks' data transfer\n            networks. The fifth component funds bank privatization and\n            restructuring.
