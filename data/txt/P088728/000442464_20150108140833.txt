 SYNOPSIS
  The past decade in Albania has been characterized by very rapid economic growth and substantial
  improvements in the welfare of the population. Once labeled as the continent’s poorest country, Albania
  has enjoyed annual real economic growth rates of around 6 percent over the last decade, enabling it to
  graduate from the Bank’s concessional lending arm (the International Development Association or IDA)
  and to join the ranks of the world’s upper-middle income countries.           In July 2010, Albania’s gross
  domestic product (GDP) per capita stood at US$3,836, well above the IDA threshold. The last decade
  also saw important gains in the population’s welfare evidenced by falling poverty rates and substantially
  improved MDG indicators. The Albanian economy has proven quite resilient in the face of domestic and
  exogenous shocks – e.g., it was only one of two countries in Europe to achieve positive (albeit reduced)
  growth in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial and economic crisis.
