Once labeled\n            as the continent's poorest country, Albania has enjoyed\n            annual real economic growth rates of around 6 percent over\n            the last decade, enabling it to graduate from the\n            Bank's concessional lending arm (the International\n            Development Association or IDA) and to join the ranks of the\n            world's upper-middle income countries. In July 2010,\n            Albania's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita stood\n            at United States (U.S.) $3,836, well above the IDA\n            threshold. The last decade also saw important gains in the\n            population\u0092s welfare evidenced by falling poverty rates and\n            substantially improved millennium development goal (MDG)\n            indicators. The Albanian economy has proven quite resilient\n            in the face of domestic and exogenous shocks - for example,\n            it was only one of two countries in Europe to achieve\n            positive (albeit reduced) growth in the wake of the\n            2008-2009 global financial and economic crisis."}, "docdt": "2010-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
