EDUCATION (PEC)", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7347", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the School-Based Management\n            Project for Mexico were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: this was a central observation made during\n            the program's design, based on the international\n            literature. However, some elements of PEC (Quality Schools\n            Program - Programa Escuelas de Calidad) were still top-down\n            and did not work well. PEC has a transparent formula that\n            allocates resources across states on a per capita basis\n            using the total number of children between the ages of four\n            and fourteen. The studies found that in many cases community\n            participation existed in paper but not in reality. Real\n            community participation requires cultural changes,\n            incentives, and capacity building. Phase two will support\n            enhanced capacity building for school directors and\n            community groups and will more actively promote greater\n            social participation. Government commitment to the\n            implementation of a project or program is perhaps the best\n            indicator of its overall success. An Adaptable Program Loan\n            (APL) is a useful instrument to support implementation of a\n            Government program where a long-term involvement may be\n            necessary to produce expected outcomes. When designing\n            projects and corresponding Bank loans with both relatively\n            fast disbursing components and slower technical assistance\n            type activities, it is desirable to build in mechanisms that\n            pace the disbursements of fast disbursing components to\n            progress in the implementation of technical assistance for\n            institutional strengthening type activities. Care is needed\n            in the design of a project's monitoring framework and\n            indicators to avoid individual indicators that are not\n            feasible given the changes brought about by the project."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
