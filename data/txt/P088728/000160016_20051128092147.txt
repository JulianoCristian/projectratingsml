A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country andsectorissues

Mexico, a member o f the OECD, and the 10thlargest economy inthe world has made significant progress
in expanding education access over the past few decades. Achievements include: increased access to
primary education; a rapid expansion o f lower secondary education; and an increased access to lifelong
learning opportunities. Today, 93 percent o f school-aged children attend primary school with a
completion rate of 89 percent. Despite this progress, however, universal coverage remains a challenge,
particularly in the poorest states in rural areas and indigenous communities where dropout rates and
repetition rates remain high and access to preschool i s limited, and learning achievement and access to
lower secondary education are low. Incontrast with high enrollments for primary education, as recent as
2004, net enrollment in upper secondary education was only 53 percent. This i s particularly low when
compared with economies o f similar size and with other Latin American countries such as Argentina and
Chile, with net enrollment rates o f 79 and 75 percent. Dropping out i s a critical problem for migrant
students, who represent a significant proportion o f the primary and lower secondary school-aged children
not attending school. Lower and upper secondary education i s critical to the development o f a labor force
with the necessary s l l l s to compete inthe global economy.

Another major challenge now facing Mexico's education system i s low overall learning achievement
levels and new students entering the system not learning very much. School quality has not kept pace
with enrollment increases and increasingly more children, especially poor children and those living in
rural areas, are being educated in low quality schools. Recent international assessment results (PISA
2003) show that less than 1percent o f 15 year olds are at the highest level o f performance in Spanish and
math, compared to an OECD average o f 8 percent. Indeed, 25 percent o f Mexican students are below
level 1 - the lowest level o f performance - in Spanish, and 38 percent below level 1 in math, a result
significantly worse than the OECD average o f only 7 percent.

The main issues facing the Mexican education system include: (a) inequality inaccess to learning; (b) low
access to lower and upper secondary education; (c) low internal efficiency; and (d) l o w overall learning
achievement levels throughout the'education system. At the secondary and tertiary education levels, a
key challenge i s to increase enrollment rates and improve quality inan equitable and sustainable manner.

These issues are being addressed under the Government's National Education Development Program
which the World Bank has been supporting since its inception.             Recent initiatives at all levels o f
government have been undertaken to address the challenge o f education equity and quality. Two current
government programs designed to increase school autonomy are improving school climate and showing
 signs o f positive impacts on learning outcomes. A compensatory education program for disadvantaged
rural and all indigenous schools inthe country implementedby CONAFE builds an environment inwhich
 a highlevel o f satisfaction and leaming at schools exists and there i s some evidence that the program has
improved equity inoutcomes. Evaluations show that the programreduced learning gaps between similarly
 disadvantaged groups. The Prograrna Escuelas de Calidad,or PEC (Quality Schools Program), a school-
based management program, which i s very innovative in the Mexican context, aims to increase parental
participation through voluntary participation by urban schools, and school improvement grants. Infact,
PEC i s one o f the first federal programs undertaking a transformation o f the school by making the school
the center o f action and allowing decisions to influence the system from the bottom up.

2. Rationale for Bankinvolvement

The World Bank has contributed,both technically and financially to the evolution o f the Mexican
education strategy. The proposed Program would support and extend the PEC which transfers resources
directly to the school in an effort to increase autonomy and decision-making in some aspects o f school
management. The Program supports the Government's efforts to raise the level and quality o f schooling
in Mexico. The Program supports the current CAS'S stated objective o f human capital development by
enhancing the quality of public education, and ensuring the sustainability o f ongoing efforts in basic
education.   Improving the quality o f education i s critical for Mexico to become competitive in the
knowledge economy.

The Government wishes to have the involvement o f the World Bank in this Program in order to
consolidate the gains made over the last three years, expand the Program, and contribute to its
sustainability over the long term. PEC provides an excellent candidate for a quality o f education lending
program. The Program has successfilly expanded from the initial 2,000 pilot schools in 2001 to more
than 21,000 schools this year. The objectives o f the PEC fit current Bank thinking on what it takes to
improve learning outcomes.

The ongoing Programmatic sector work on the quality o f education in Mexico has identified that school
autonomy and school climate are important factors that affect learning outcomes (World Bank 2005).
This is based on extensive analysis o f Mexico's results from the international student achievement tests
organized by the OECD known as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) using
both 2000 and 2003 data. The analysis suggests that both students and schools perform best in a climate
characterized by high expectations that are supported through strong teacher-student relations, students
who are ready to invest effort and who show interest and lower levels of anxiety with mathematics, and a
positive disciplinary climate. Inmost o f the countries that performed well on PISA, local authorities and
schools have substantial responsibility for educational content and/or the use o f resources, and many set
out to teach heterogeneous groups o f learners. Ina simulation usingPISA 2003, it i s shown that changes
and improvements inthe school climate and current schooling practices increase the overall score o f the
bottom achievers by about 30 percent.

School climate played a significant role in the performance o f low and high achievers indiscriminately.
Changes and improvements in the school climate (relations between students and teachers for example,
belief in students' ability to learn and support for that to happen) and current schooling practices are
shown to have an impact on achievement. Increasedautonomy may give schools the flexibility they need
to empower teachers, thus improving the school climate as well as the relationship between students and
teachers. The analyses also showed that parental involvement with schools and attitudes about their
children's schooling have an impact on educational achievement.
                                     $                                          Strengthened accountability
mechanisms could create space for parents to actively participate in the education system and, if
successful, raise aspirations for greater educational attainment levels for their children.

The sector work recommends that more autonomy, accountability and assessment will help improve the
quality o f education, through improvements in learning outcomes, in Mexico. This will also allow other
policy actions to be more effective. For example, more autonomous schools can implement appropriate
language policy, thus fulfilling national guidelines for indigenous students. A more accountable system
will in turn encourage more active,participation by parents and teachers, which i s central to improving
learning outcomes.      Finally, a system that i s based on constant assessment and participation in
internationalbenchmarking exercises will improve cost-effectiveness. The fact that over half o f Mexican
 students barely attained minimal levels o f Math and Spanish lends itself to support for stronger
 accountability mechanisms.




                                                      2

The PEC Program contributes to school autonomy by allowing the local stakeholders (school principals,
teachers, parents, and community members-in other words, the school community) to diagnose the
specific shortcomings o f their school and to design School Strategic Transformation Plans (PETEs).
Participation in the PEC Program i s voluntary. The plans are then submitted to state officials, and the
accepted plans receive resources for up to five years (renewed each year, based on satisfactory
performance) to implement their plans. Federal PEC funds are matched by the state at a ratio three to
one, federal to state, and the schools can raise further resources from the school community, non-
governmental organizations and the private sector. The PEC rules require that the school community i s
effectively involved in carrying out the plan. Parents have a direct relationship as they are custodians of
the funds and must verify the purchases and contracts made with the resources received. Thus, PEC
changes the school climate by creating the conditions for more meaningful parental and community
participation inthe school. Furthermore, PEC creates a significant level o f autonomy as the school plans
are the creation o f the school community, which i s then responsible for carrying out the plans. There are
many elements of accountability in the Program - for parental and community oversight o f the plan
implementation and spending o f resources, to federal and state supervision o f the Program. The PEC
schools are assessed, both in terms o f the fulfillment o f their School Strategic Transformation Plans and
Annual Work Programs, but also in terms o f a national information system on key indicators, assessment
o f student achievement inMath and Spanish, and a number o f evaluations.

Therefore, it i s expected that PEC would contribute to a significant degree to increasing levels o f school
autonomy (interest in participating in a voluntary school-based management program, diagnosis o f
school-specific issues and problems, production o f School Strategc Transformation Plans (PETE) and
Annual Work Program, implementation o f the plan, parental participation), accountability (parental
oversight and control o f PEC resources and school spending, federal and state oversight o f plan
implementation) and assessment (plan implementation, reports on results, testing, evaluations). Thus,
PEC schools become more participatory, which should improve the school climate, making the school a
more welcoming environment fqr students and their parents, especially in more disadvantaged
communities. A more participatory environment would improve the internal "quality" o f the school.
Further, in the medium term the more participatory environment should see a decrease in school dropouts
as weaker students are given more attention and their parents take a more active role in their schooling
careers. The added responsibility that comes with the increased autonomy should help focus principals
and teachers on the needs o f weaker students. A recent retrospective evaluation (Shapiro and Skoufias
2005) used several nonexperimentalmethods with existing data to measure the impact o f PEC. A before-
after comparison over a two-year period without background controls showed significant increases in
parental involvement in schools and in students' homework, and in students' expectations o f educational
attainment for PEC schools. Research emphasizes a time lag between implementation o f school-based
management programs and effects on student learning achievement.                 School-based management
interventions show evidence o f the benefits o f parental and community participation in school
improvement activities and research shows that school based management changes the school climate and
improves the school environment, factors that eventually lead to improved outcomes. Therefore, in the
longer term one should see improved learning outcomes. This would come about as well because o f the
added assessment that will take place inPEC schools.

Insummary, participation inPEC spouldrdsult inhigher levels ofparticipation byparents andthe school
community in the short term. This is followed by the creation o f an improved school climate - attention
on the actual problems o f the school and focus on weaker students - which becomes a welcoming
environment for disadvantaged students, which should lead to an increase in the medium to long term in
school retentionrates (lower dropout rates, but a likely increase inrepetition rates inthe first few years as
weaker students are retained). Inthe long term, the positive school environment, with the increased levels
o f accountability generated, along with increased assessment o f PEC schools, should result in increased

                                    3

levels o f student learning, provided that part o f the grant i s used to implement quality-oriented
pedagogicalimplementation plans.

3. Higher levelobjectives to which the project contributes

The proposed Program i s consistent with the objectives o f the Country Partnership Strategy (CAS) for
Mexico (Report No. 2814-ME o f March 18, 2004) in that it contributes to improve the quality o f basic
education services and to reduce poverty.     By transforming the way schools are managed, the Program
increases school autonomy and decision-malung capacity, empowering parents, teachers and principals to
participate in a process o f change that leads to a better school climate, strengthens accountability, and
improves the quality o f schooling. The Program fosters improvements to the quality o f basic education
services by raising teacher motivation, improving student-teacher relations, and by increasing parental
participation. Even though in the short run the Program cannot be expected to raise student academic
achievement levels, its impact on the quality o f schooling i s significant, especially in the schools serving
the lowest-income urban areas.

International evidence shows that education quality has a consistent, stable and strong influence on
economic growth. Because qualitative differences in the labor force are important for growth and these
differences are relatedto the quality o f schooling, the Quality Schools Programhas a direct bearing on the
potential for growth o f the Mexican economy. The Program i s also strategic for reducing poverty, since
improvements in the quality o f basic education have stronger impacts on the labor market outcomes for
people at the bottom o f the wage distribution.


B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION                ,
1. Lending instrument

An Adjustable ProgramLoan (APL)instrumentis especially well suited for achievingProgram objectives
that require sustained long term investments and that introduce major innovations in the way public
education services are delivered. The APL i s especially well suited for supporting the PEC Program,
where the long term objective i s improved learning outcomes. The first phase would support fine-tuning
o f the model and lead to increased levels o f participation and school autonomy, and a modest expansion
with robust accountability measures and increased use o f assessments and impact evaluations. The
second phase would consolidate gains and make appropriate improvements to the model, and expand the
Program to more disadvantaged schools, with the goal o f seeing improvements in intermediate school
outcomes such as reduction in dropout rates. The third phase would see the maturation o f the Program
and improvements in learning outcomes. The proposed APL supports innovative school management
practices in public schools that promote school autonomy, parental participation, accountability, and the
active involvement o f the school community inthe delivery o f basic education services. The Government
favors the use o f an APL instrument in this case for several reasons. An APL affords enough flexibility
to permit adjustments to Program,design and financing over time, as country conditions change and
partnerships evolve, helping ensure Program relevance, continuity and development. The PEC i s a new
program that needs to grow and be able to take advantage o f accumulated experience inorder to best meet
the needs o f different school communities through a process o f learning-by-doing. This process would
start in the first phase o f the proposed APL, with the design and implementation o f rigorous Program
impact evaluation. Impact evaluation activities would continue in subsequent phases and would provide
new knowledge to guide Program adjustments and scaling up. As the Program evolves and the needs o f
different types o f schools and students become clearer, it would be possible to fine-tune Program
interventians, strengthening their impact on,improving the quality o fbasic educationservices.

 2.  Program objectiveand Phases

 The long-term development objective o f the proposed Program i s to improve the quality of education as
 measured by coverage, social participation and educational outcomes, as follows:

         0   Program schools as a percentage o f all public basic education schools;
         0   Commitment to the goals and activities o f the Strategic School Transformation Plan (PETE)
             or its state equivalent' as expressed by local financial contributions to the schools; and
         0   Average test scores in Math and Spanish for students in participating PEC schools. This
             indicator will be reportedby type o f school (primary, secondary) and will be evaluated during
             the thirdphase o f the project.

 The Program contributes to school autonomy, accountability and assessment. These outcomes result in a
 better school climate where dropout rates tend to decline, weaker students receive more attention and the
 quality of the school improves, ultimately helping raise student learning achievements. The APL i s
 especially well suited for supporting the long term objectives o f the PEC Program. The first phase would
 support fine-tuning o f the model and lead to increased levels of participation and school autonomy, and a
 modest expansion with robust accountability measures and increased use o f assessments and impact
 evaluations.  The second phase would consolidate gains and make appropriate improvements to the
 model, expansion to more disadvantaged schools, with the goal o f seeing improvements in intermediate
 school outcomes such as retention and dropouts. The third phase would see the maturation o f the
 Program and improvements inleaming outcomes.

 The first phase o f the APL would support the federal share o f the Program and would consists of: (a)
 school grants; (b) monitoring and Program oversight; and (c) policy development and evaluation,
 including specific interventions to encourage the participation o f schools serving the most disadvantaged
 urban areas where the Program i s expected to be expanded insubsequent phases.

 The Government and the Bank wouldjointly review the progress achieved inphase Ibased on the triggers
 below to decide whether or not to proceed to phase 11.

Ifphase I1is entered into, thenitis anticipatedthat itwould support the expansion ofProgramcoverage,
especially to cover the most disadvantaged schools invery low-income urban areas, as well as to reorient
a significant portion o f the school grant to improve those schools' internal efficiency and learning
outcomes. Phase I1 would also support pilot experiments designed to identify, design and develop
adjustments to adapt the Program for further expansion to schools serving other types o f disadvantaged
communities insemi-urban and non-urban areas.

increase in the number o f PEC schools located in areas o f medium, high and very high disadvantage
(using the marginalization index developedby CONAPO and described inAnnex 13) will be collectedby
PEC using its database. Completion o f the second measurement for the impact evaluation and evidence
o f compliance with the approved Program expansion plan are events registered inthe project monitoring
arrangements described inAnnex 3 and verified duringproject supervision missions.

The third phase would continue to support Program expansion and consolidation, and would introduce
 adjustments to the Program design and financing to reflect evaluation results and facilitate the expansion
 o f the Programto different types o f schools outside urban areas.

3. Project developmentobjective and key indicators

The proposed project aims to improve public basic school management through strengthening and
 expanding the Government's     QuditySchools       Program (Programa Escuelas de Calidad-PEC)        now
being implemented on a small scale by SEP. PEC i s designed to empower the school community, and
promote school autonomy and accountability, encouraging parents, teachers and directors to design and
 carry out School Strategic Transformation Plans (PETE) that respond to the needs o f the school and its



                                                       6

students. The PEC awards a grant to finance the improvement plans in selected schools; these grants are
jointly financed by SEP and state governments. The Program i s open to all public basic education
schools that apply on a voluntarily basis, but priority i s given to disadvantaged schools located in poor
urban areas, as these schools have the most need and also tend to benefit more from the Program. The
federal investment in the Program leverages up to half as much in state contributions.     Inaddition the
Program mobilizes contributions from local school communities, where schools mobilize parents,
municipal governments and private organizations to support their School Strategic Transformation Plans
(PETEs).

The overall success o f the project would be judged on its impact on institutingimproved management
practices in public basic education schools, as measured by the increase in Program coverage and the
increase inparticipatory school planning, as follows:

     (a)     The number o f schools participating inthe Program;
     (b)     Program schools as a percentage o f all public basic education schools; and
    (c)      The percentage of community members committed to the goals and activities inthe PETE.

Inaddition, intermediate Programresults wouldbe monitoredandevaluatedthroughindicatorsreflecting
key aspects of Program implementation, including:

     0   Improved school management reflectedin: (i)     improved school planning through the participation
         o f the school community in preparing a School Strategic Transformation Plan (PETE),
         monitoring the implementation of the plan, and assessing its results; (ii)improved accountability
         through parental oversight and increased knowledge on the part o f parents about their children's
         performance in school; (iii)improved pedagogical skills, as more teachers encourage students to
         improve performance, provide special support to the weaker students, and promote the active
         participation o f students inschool activities.

     0   Equitable Prom-am expansion, measured by the increase in participation by more disadvantaged
         schools.

 program that i s transferred each year by SEP from the PEC national trust fund to the PEC trust funds o f
 participating states. The states complement federal funds in accordance with a financing-share schedule
 and are responsible for Program implementation in their jurisdiction. At the local level, the Program i s
 carried out by the State Education Authorities (AEEs) and the Sub-secretariat o f Educational Services for
 the Federal District (SOSEDF). The AEEs transfer PEC grants fi-om the state trust fund directly to the

bank accounts o f the participating schools, after completing a process o f Program dissemination,
submission o f applications by interested schools, technical assistance to schools for preparation o f grant
proposals, qualification o f proposals, and selection o f schools for grant award. This process i s repeated
each year throughout the country. T o qualify for the Program, schools must establish participatory school
management and present a satisfactory School Strategic Transformation Plan proposal. As the number o f
schools that qualify for the Program tends to exceed Program funds, states are instructed to give priority
to qualified schools located in low-income urban neighborhoods. During phase I,an estimated 33,000
public schools would benefit from one or more o f the following types o f PEC grants:

         (a) Initial PECgrant, renewablefor a maximum ofJive years. This initial grant i s awarded to
              all schools selected (from the schools that voluntarily chose to participate and submitted
              plans) to participate in the Program in a given year, and may be renewed for a maximum o f
              five years. Each year, the schools that wish to continue inthe Program must re-apply for the
              grant, meet the selection criteria, and be chosen by the state selection committee to receive a
              grant. After the five year cycle, the schools graduate from the Program. The amount o f this
              grant varies according to the requirements o f each School Strategic Transformation Plan but
              may not exceed 50,000 Mexican pesos (US$4,600) per year, per school. The AEEs transfer
              the grant funds to the bank accounts o f the schools in a single installment inthe first half o f
              the school year, before the end o f the fourth month o f classes.

              Supplemental matching grant, renewable for a maximum of five years. This grant i s
              awarded to PEC schools that are implementing the School Strategic Transformation Plans
              with funds from the initial PEC grant, but that have also mobilized additional local resources
              for their project. That is, the PEC schools eligible for this type o f grant are those that seek and
              obtain donations in cash and/or in kind from parents, municipal governments, civil
              organizations and/or private enterprises. The supplemental grant matches the amount o f local
              resources raised by the school, but may not exceed 50,000 Mexican pesos (US$4,600) per
              year, per school. Schools may apply and receive additional supplemental grants during the
              five-year Program cycle, as long as they continue to meet the eligibility criteria. The AEEs
              transfer the supplemental grant funds to the bank accounts o f the schools inthe second halfo f
              the school year, before the end o fthe ninthmonth o f classes.

              Suecial matching prant with no renewal restrictions.This special type o f grant i s targeted to
              disadvantaged basic education public schools that want to continue to carryout their School
              Strategic Transformatiqn Plan after graduating from the five-year PEC Program cycle, but
              need financial support to do so. To be eligible for this grant a school mustmeet the following
              conditions: (i) be located in lower-income urban neighborhoods, (ii) graduated from the
                                                                                           be
              regular PEC Program; (iii) Program requirements, and (iv) has raised additional local
                                             meet
              resources in support o f their School Strategic Transformation Plans.

The PEC Program OperatingRules (Reglas de Operacibn) are published by SEP every year; they specify
the amount to be invested inthe Program each year by the federal government and the states; confirm the
criteria for the selection o f schools and the arrangements for Program implementation at the national and
 state levels. These rules form part o f the Project Operations Manual that has been reviewed by the Bank
 and found satisfactory. DuringProgram implementation, the AEEs may introduce additional procedures
to operate the Program in their jurisdiction, as long as they continue to fully comply with the Program
 Operating Rules (see Annex 6).

Inaddition to the school grants, this component finances the banking fees for the administration of the
PEC federal trust fund usingonly counterpart funds.

Component 2: ProgramMonitoring and Oversight (US$15.1millionwith contingencies or 4% of
total project cost; 0% Bank financing). This component finances Program monitoring, oversight and
information dissemination by SEP with the objective o f ensuring compliance with Program Operating
Rules throughout the country and to provide ample information to the public about Program operations
and results. These objectives would be achieved through the following three subcomponents.

Subcomponent 2.1: Program monitoring (US$0.16 million). This subcomponent finances the
continuous operation, maintenance' and upgrading o f the PEC national management information system
(Sistema de Informacidn del Programa Escuelas de Calidad-SPEC).               The SPEC i s currently fully
operational, online and will be continuously updated and serves to: (a) record and systematize information
on the operations o f the Program at school, state and federal levels; (b) record key Program outcomes,
such as the use schools give to the grant funds and the amount o f local funds schools are able to mobilize,
among others; and (c) flag Program shortcomings that need to be addressed by state agencies for the
efficient operation o f the Program. The design and operation o f the SPEC still requires additional
investment to finance the production o f additional modules, and provide user-training in order to increase
reliability and timeliness o f information flows. With this aim, SPEC would be enhanced through the
design, test and operation o f a customized user support module that would be made available to
participating states and schools, enabling them to maintain the appropriate flow o f information to the
national office.    The institutional management o f the SPEC also needs improvement, especially
regarding the linkage between the flagging o f a problem and the corresponding remedial action. The
subcomponent would finance consultancy services for system development. Inparallel, SEP will procure
additional computer equipment to expand the current technical configuration o f the system using other
sources o f funds.

Subcomponent 2.2: Support for.Program Implementation (US$lO.O million). The national PEC
coordination office would provide technical and operational support to the AEEs to ensure smooth
Program implementation in accordance with Program Operating Rules. This objective would be achieved
with assistance from regular SEP staff assigned to the PEC by the Under-Secretariat of Basic Education.
This team consists of experts in Program operations and basic education that would carry out the
following activities: (a) visit each state several times a year following a constant supervision program; (b)
organize seminars and workshops to promote the continuous development o f technical staff working on
the Program at state level; and (c) coordinate regional and national meetings, and the annual PEC
Congress, attended by federal and state authorities. Duringthese events, Program innovations would be
discussed, best practices shared, agd the Program Operating Rules updated. It should be mentioned that
technical support provided to schools for the preparationo f School Strategic Transformation Plans i s not
part o f this subcomponent because this function i s performed by the AEEs and is funded by a 20% share
o f state funds that are deposited in the PEC state trust funds. Project funds allocated to this component
would finances travel by federal and state personnel and expenditures associated with training seminars,
workshops, Program meetings, and congresses, including hotel accommodations, meals, speakers,
facilitators, and materials to support these events. In addition, an estimated $1.2 million would finance
incrementaloperational costs.                 I

                                      >
Subcomponent 2.3: Program Dissemination (US$5.0 million). This subcomponent supports the
dissemination o f information on Program objectives, activities and results through a wide range o f
communication vehicles, with the aim o f promoting the Program and guaranteeing full accountability and
transparency. T o meet this goal, television, radio, newspapers and special publications would be used
throughout the year during Program implementation to disseminate messages tailored to specific
audiences o f parents, teachers, directors, AEEs technical staff and society at large. A Program magazine
(Educare) would continue to be published by the National Free Textbooks Commission (Comisidn
Nacionalde Libros de Textos Gratuifos-CONALITEG) and distributed three times a year throughout the
country. SEP would also continue)to collaborate with the Secretariat o f Internal Affairs (Secretaria de

Component 3: Policy Development and Evaluation(US%5.8 million with contingencies or 2% of
total project cost; Bank financing US$4.91 or 85%).). This component supports the development o f
basic education policy based on the results o f policy studies, Program evaluation activities and pilot
experiments intended to test possible adjustments to Program design and financing. These objectives
would be achieved through the following subcomponents:

Subcomponent3.1: ProgramEvaluation(US$5.0 million).This subcomponent supports the design and
implementation of Program evaluation activities that would be carried out throughout Program
implementation with the aim to create a strong analytical basis for the development o f the Program. To
this end, the following types o f evaluation activities would be financed: (a) external evaluation o f
Program performance and preparation o f the Annual Report to the National Congress; (b) qualitative
evaluation to determine the non-quantifiable benefits accruing from the Program; (c) student learning
achievements assessments using National Standards, and (d) impact evaluation by an external,
independent evaluator usingrigorous methodology. The impact evaluation activities planned for phase I
are: (i) design and field test o f evaluation methodology and data collection instruments, (ii)
        the                                                                                       baseline
survey and (iii)  preliminary data analysis. During the proposed phases I1 and 111, impact evaluation
activities would continue with repeated surveys to measure the impact of the and further analysis and
dissemination o f results. The expeqditures financed under this subcomponent include consultant services
provided by individuals, firms, and national academic institutions.

Subcomponent3.2: Policy Studies (US%O.8 million).This subcomponent supports the development of
national basic education policy, including the lower-secondary education reform currently in progress,
through the analysis o f national and international assessments o f student learning achievement,
evaluations o f Program outcomes, and special studies. The analytical work to be financed under this
subcomponent would be carried out by national academic institutions and independent consultants. The
themes that would be analyzed include, among others, the following:


    0    Development and pilot experiment o f strategies to encourage applications to participate in the
         PEC from schools located in lower-income urban areas; and best forms to provide technical
         assistance to help these schools prepare School Strategic Transformation Plans;


    0    Adjustments to the PEC Program design and financing aimed to strengthen its impact and expand
         its coverage; and

5. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign

This project incorporates lessons learned from previous education projects in Mexico as well as those
with similar objectives elsewhere in Latin America and other countries. The school grant mechanism is
used ina wide range of education projects. The school grant fund mechanism i s very similar to that used
in standard social funds where money is sent straight to the end-user (inthis case the school) to fund a
proposal designed to support the improvement o f education. In some cases the grants are awarded on a
competitive basis and most projectscontain a strong community involvement component.




                                                     10

School grant programs have been increasingly included in Bank-funded education projects since 1991
when the mechanism was first used in the Chile Primary Education Project. Inthe context o f education
reform in Chile, and targeted to some o f the poorest schools, this first school grant scheme had as its goal
the improvement o f the quality o f education through empowering schools to take decisions about the use
o f funding, and to develop projects that were locally relevant.

International experience has shown that school grant mechanisms can provide enabling conditions for
change and empowerment. However, despite the compelling case for school based management, there
are very few rigorous evaluations with respect to its impact on student performance. The majority o f
researchers indicate that there i s little direct evidence o f school based management on student
achievement.      School outcomes usually change slowly in response to any kmd o f educational
intervention. Research emphasizes a time lag between implementation o f educational reforms and the
effect on student achievement. School based management interventions show evidence o f the benefits o f
parental and community participation in school improvement activities and research shows that school
based management changes the school climate and improves the school environment, factors that
eventually lead to improved outcomes.

A review o f World Bank projects supporting programs similar to PEC shows that these projects often do
not have the direct improvement o f learning outcomes as a primary goal and may not include indicators
for its measurement because it i s difficult to see any changes during the life span o f the project. Overall,
the review found that the grant mechanism was an exciting enabling instrument for creating conditions
that can lead to a responsive education system, acting as a catalyst for change and empowerment.
Positive outcomes can include: devolution o f decision making power to the local level; democratization
and accountability through the empowerment o f local agencies such as school boards or municipal
governments; and sustainability o f investments through local involvement. Inaddition, the grant schemes
can build capacity for improved teaching and learning both through the immediate provision o f training
and equipment, and through longer term training for development.

Examining school-based management (SBM) in Nicaragua, King and Ozler (1998) noted some gains in
student learning.    The study examines the impact o f the school autonomy reform in Nicaragua on
learning, using an educational production function approach.         Results show that autonomous public
schools are indeed making more decisions about pedagogical and administrative matters than do
traditional public schools, butbecause there i s a lag intransforming school decision-making after a school
becomes legally autonomous, autonomy dejure does not appear to have any impact on student test scores.
However, another autonomy variable which measures the actual level o f decision-making by the school i s
positively associated with student test scores. In particular, schools that exert greater autonomy with
respect to teacher staffing and the monitoring and evaluation o f teachers appear to be more effective in
raising student performance.

The best known school based management program, EDUCO, was evaluated in terms o f learning
 outcomes as well as participation.      EDUCO i s an innovative program in El Salvador designed to
 decentralize education by strengthening the direct involvement o f parents and community groups.
 EDUCO has been remarkably successful in expanding educational opportunities for the poor living in
 rural areas. A rigorous impact evaluationby Jimenez and Sawada (1999) finds that more participation by
 parents in schools, as measured by the number o f visits to classrooms by a parent association member, i s
 significantly and positively correlated with,higher test scores in math and language. The study suggests
 that community-based school marygement does improve student and teacher attendance compared to
 traditional, more centralized schools. When estimating the effect o f EDUCO on third grade achievement
 test scores inmathematics and language, and on days o f school missed due to a teacher absence, they find
 that EDUCO participants showed n o significant difference in achievement test scores, compared to
 similar traditional school students. Jimenez and Sawada highlighted that EDUCO students come from


                                                       11

poorer backgrounds and their parents have, less education. However, based on grade three test results,
EDUCO students do not learn 1es.s than their counterparts in traditional schools (corrected for other
variables). They found that student test results are positively and significantly related to the number o f
visits by community education associations. However, teacher attendance in EDUCO schools was better
than intraditional schools. Insome cases, EDUCO students did slightly better.

More recently, Cambodia's Education Quality Improvement Project (EQIP) School Grants Program was
evaluated (Marshall 2004). The evaluation shows that school-based management (SBM) can improve
educational outcomes. EQIP's school grants helped reduced dropout and increased promotion rates.
There i s also some evidence that school grants helped improve test scores over time, a result associated
with participation inthe program. The evaluation also showed the importance o fparental participation.

Some risks-such       as raising expectations, extremely bureaucratic procedures for school-based
management, long processes for approval o f School Strategc Transformation Plans (PETEs), the risks o f
tied financial disbursements to schools, and resistance to shifting powers to schools by traditional
education management actors-have         all been assessed and lessons learned have been incorporated in
project design.

6. Alternativesconsideredandreasonsfor rejection

Indiscussing options to address the objective ofproviding quality basic education to all studentsduring
the preparation of the Program, a number of alternatives were considered. A focus on states with higher
levels o f poverty was rejected given that experience shows that while giving priority attention to the
poorer states simplifies targeting, disadvantaged schools and students exist in every state, and high
performing schools exist even in poor states. Also, there are severely disadvantaged schools in urban
areas as well. Another alternative would have been to maintain the status quo, which i s continued
expansion o f enrollments without increasing autonomy or implementing School Strategic Transformation
Plans (PETEs). This was rejected because quality i s an issue. Similarly, top-down approaches were
rejected, as these would not significantly increase quality, especially inmajor urban areas that are highly
diversified. An inputs-based approach, where schools receive additional resources based on choices made
in Mexico City and in the state capitals was also seen as inadequate given what is known about the
importance o f school climate and the need for more local decision making.
More innovative options, such as competition and school choice, are seen as valid only in the post-
compulsory upper secondary level, and only in the context o f plans to reform secondary education inthe
coming years; similarly, including private schools was rejected given that Mexico does not use public
funds to support private schools. Cqnsiderations to incorporate ruraland disadvantaged schools duringthe
first phase o f the APL was rejected because: (a) disadvantaged rural schools are supported by SEP's
compensatory education program, implemented by CONAFE, with a similar approach (one o f the
compensatory measures i s school-based management); (b) the proposed project incorporates indigenous
students in urban areas and all rural indigenous schools receive the compensatory support; and (c) the
thrust of the first phase i s to fine tune the PEC approach, evaluate it, and pilot its possible expansion to
more disadvantaged schools inthe second and thirdphases o f the APL.
Therefore, it was decided that a bottom-up approach that empowers the school community i s the best
 option for increased school autonomy and attention to learning gaps. Consistent with its philosophy and
vision, PEC has built into its Program since its inception baseline and follow-up data for qualitative and
 quantitative analysis o f operational processes and outcomes. It i s noteworthy that o f the many SEP
programs, PEC i s one o f the few that has included evaluation studies o f their performance and results.

1. Partnershiparrangements(if applicable)
NIA

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

The proposed Program would be implemented over a period o f three years by the Secretariat for Public
Education (Secretaria de Educacidn Pziblica-SEP)        using implementation arrangements that are already
in place for the PEC.     These arrangements are characterized by transparent operating rules; shared
financing; decentralized implementation by the states; and efficient tools for federal oversight. The SEP
staff directly managing the Program has no previous experience with Bank-financed projects, but the
overall implementation arrangements were reviewed by the Bank and are considered satisfactory. These
implementation arrangements are presented in Annex 6. Financial and procurement procedures are
described inAnnexes 7 and 8.

The PEC Program Operating Rules (Reglas de Operacidn) issued by SEP govern all Program
implementation activities, including the eligibility and the selection criteria for schools to enter the
Program. The states and participating schools carry out the Program according to these national
guidelines. SEP coordinates Program implementation through the General Directorate o f Management
Development and Education Innovation (Direccidn General de Desarrollo de la Gestidn e Innovacidn
Educativa-DGDGIE). The Federal funds for the Program are administered through a national trust fund
(Fideicomiso) entitled Fondo Nacional para Escuelas de Calidad (FNEC), and are allocated to the states
in proportion to the size of their respective school age population (aged 4 and 14 years). In any given
year, the actual amount o f federal funds transferred to the state trust funds (Fideicomiso Estatal de
Escuelas de Calidad, FEEC) must match the amount o f funds provided by the states at a rate o f three-to-
one, but cannot exceed the maxiqum state allocation. (For two most disadvantaged states the federal
share has been increased to four-to-one.)

At state level, the Program is carried out by State Education Authorities (Autoridades Educativas
Estatales-AEEs).     State education authorities are free to introduce additional Program rules and
procedures provided these are compatible with the Program Operating Rules. The FEECs transfer grants
directly to the bank accounts o f the selected schools after the state education authorities complete a
process o f Program dissemination, reception o f applications submitted by interested schools, provision o f
technical assistance to schools for preparation o f School Strategic Transformation Plans (PETEs),
qualification o f school proposals, and selection of schools. Schools are encouraged to raise additional
local resources to support their projects from various sources including municipalities, private sector,
parents and civil society organizations.     Each school uses grant funds to pay for infrastructure and
pedagogical improvements included in the PETE and in the Annual Work Program (Programa Anual de
 Trabajo, PAT).

The processes and procedures for project implementation are described in the project Operations Manual
 (OM), which i s satisfactory to the Bank.

3. Monitoringand evaluation o foutcomes/results

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are key elements in the policy making process. They should be used
not as a historical accounting exercise, but to inform current policy so that objectives and targets can be
reconsidered in the light o f evidence o f policy effectiveness. This i s particularly important in the context
 o f the proposed APL, given its implementation period and structure in phases. Program evaluation
 activities would be strengthened through the implementation o f Component 3: Policy Development and
Evaluation, which provides technical assistance and funding for rigorous evaluation and pilot experiments
                                     1

                                                      13

intended to test possible adjustments to Program design and financing. The proposed Program impact
evaluation i s described inAnnex 14.

Moreover, Program monitoring would be reinforced through Component 2: Program Monitoring and
Oversight which provides financing and technical assistance for the continuous operation, maintenance
and upgrading o f the PEC national management information system (Sistema de Informacidn del
Programa Escuelas de Calidad-SPEC).

The results framework and Program monitoring indicators are presented in Annex 3. The overall success
o f the project will be measured, in the short run, through the number o f school participating in the
Program and the local financial contributions to the schools as a measurement o f their commitment to the
goals and activities o f the Strategic School Transformation Plan. Intermediate results o f the main
component o f the project (school grants), will be measured through indicators o f changes inside the
school, particularly improvements in school planning, accountability and pedagogical practices. The long
term impact o f the project would be reflected in improved student learning achievements, measured
through tests scores inMath and Spanish duringphase 3.

The proposed indicators o f changes inside the school would be collected through qualitative surveys
applied to teachers, parents, school principals and supervisors, who are the main stakeholders that
comprise the school community, for a representative sample o f PEC schools. As can be seen in
Annex 3 (Arrangements for Results Monitoring), the values for these intermediate indicators are already
very high. The reason to include them i s to monitor that they don't decrease in value during the
implementation o f the proposed APL.

The baseline for the representative sample o f PEC schools corresponds to the 2003-2004 school year
which i s the most recent reliable information available. This year was chosen as the baseline because
various changes were made to the PEC model during its initial years o f operation, making the
comparisons based on earlier years unreliable. This baseline i s a representative sample o f participating
schools that joined the Program in 2001; this sample would be followed up until the end o f school year
2005-2006. Starting in school year 2006-2007, a majority o f the schools in the baseline sample will
graduate from the Program, makingit necessary the collection o f a new baseline inorder to control for the
permanence o f the schools inthe Program. .The new baseline will be compared with the original one and
adopted if deemed satisfactory. Otherwise, the Bank and the Borrower will agree on new a strategy to
measure intermediate results.

4. Sustainability

Project sustainability i s closely linked to government and beneficiary ownership. First, Government
ownership i s high, since the PEC has received political and financial support at national and state level.
This is reflected in the sustained and increasing funding for the Program provided by both federal and
state governments since its inception. In Mexico today, there i s wide recognition of the importance o f
 school-based management as a means to improve the quality o f education, and this public awareness has
been a decisive factor for the support provided at all levels for the operation o f the Program. Second,
beneficiary ownership has been rapidly growing, as the demand from schools to participate in the
Program has increased steadily, and so has the amount o f resources contributed to be Programby parents,
municipal and private sector sources.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses
Information on the returns to basic education and the returns to quality o f education in Mexico are
presented in Annex 9. These data give clear evidence that completing basic education i s an attractive
investment option for Mexican students. The economic feasibility o f the project analyzed in Annex 9
distinguishes, on the benefits side, school and out-of-school benefits generated by the project. The most
important among the school benefits are: (a) improvements in community participation measured by the
amount o f funds contributed by the school community to the Program; and (b) efficiency gains or savings
that accrue to the education system as a result o f lower repetition and dropout rates produced by the
Program. On the cost side, the analysis notes that the PEC Program i s becoming more cost-effective
because public unit costs per student are decreasing.

2. Technical
The technical design o f the project draws on several years o f experience in the implementation o f SEP's
programs aimed to promote social participation in education, and by extension, increased the
empowerment o f parents. Examples of this are the CONAFE's School Management Support (AGE) and
the Primary School Management Project (La Gestidn en la Escuela Primaria) implemented on a pilot
basis in 20 states over a five-year period. The project design also draws on Bank's analytical work
requestedby the G o M inresponse to the country's needs to: (a) improve the quality o f schooling; (b) set
benchmarks, internal and international, on key indicators; (c) evaluate the effectiveness o f public
programs designed to improve school quality; and (d) design improvements to current policies and
programs. No technical problems are anticipated.

3. Fiduciary
The Bank carried out a Financial Management Assessment (FMA), with the objective of ensuring that
project design provides for an appropriate level o f transparency, facilitating oversight and control while
also supporting smooth implementation.       The FM team concluded the following: (a) although some
project-specific mechanisms will need to be implemented for the proposed project by the Secretaria de
Educacidn Pliblica (SEP), through the) Direccidn General de Desarrollo de la Gestidn e Innovacidn
Educativa (DGDGIE), the existing financial management arrangements are operational and considered to
form a sound basis for this project; and (b) since FMrisk i s moderate, project implementation should be
accompanied by a close supervision that allows earlier detection o f financial management issues and
ensures the proper use o f the project funds. The focus o f this supervision will be on Component 1, which
will be implemented in a decentralized manner by the states and the schools.            Annex 7, provides
 additional information on the FMA, its findings and on the agreed FM arrangements for the proposed
project.

4. Social                           L
The GOM carried out a social assessment study during project preparation inclose coordination with the
Bank technical team. The study was based on analytical work completed over the last four years and new
 field work, both of which were used to inform a stakeholder analysis focused on the following
dimensions: (i)characterization o f current and potential beneficiaries; (ii)actual experiences o f



                                                     16

beneficiaries and other social actors involved in the Program; (iii)           expectations o f a variety o f relevant
stakeholders; (iv) levels o f social capital and potential for participation; and (v) impact o f the Program on
the lives o f participating stakeholders. A second social assessment study i s planned for the third year o f
project implementation, focusing on populations with different characteristics that are expected to
participate in the Program as a result o f its expansion duringphase I1o f the proposed APL.

The main findings o f the social assessment can be summarized as follows: (i) i s strong support for
                                                                                           there
the Program but some risks must be considered, particularly the position o f the teachers union and the
media; (ii) is highpotential for community participation and oversight, which can be maximized by
             there
strengthening the capacity o f local actors; (iii) 4.5% o f current PEC schools are in highly marginal
                                                       only
areas, which highlights the need to further promote the Program in poor neighborhoods; (iv) the new
criteria for the identification o f the target populationwill strengthen efforts to increase the participation o f
poor people; (v) public knowledge about the Programhas decreased since its creation; this issue shouldbe
addressed since this i s a voluntary Program in which information i s key for its success; (vi) community
participation i s significant but could be strengthened, especially in poor communities; and (vii) the
expectations o f community members differ from those o f principals, posing                         the risk o f lack of
coordination among key stakeholders and potentially high levels o f frustration, which inturn, may lead to
community apathy inthe future (see Annex 10).

5. Environment
The Program includes small civil works at participating schools (construction o f sanitary facilities, minor
repairs and maintenance) which will be carried out by community development, and are not expected to
have any environmental impact.

                           Annex 1: Country and Sector or ProgramBackground
                              MEXICO: School-BasedManagementProgram

Mexico, a member o f the OECD, and the 10th largest economy in the world, has made significant
progress in expanding education access over the past few decades. Achievements include: increased
access to primary education; a rapid expansion o f lower secondary education; and an increased access to
lifelong learning opportunities. Today, 93 ,percent o f school age children attend primary school with a
completion rate o f 89 percent. Despite this progress, however, universal coverage remains a challenge,
particularly in the poorest states in rural areas and indigenous communities where dropout rates and
repetitionrates remain highand access to preschool, learning achievement and lower secondary education
are low.

The main issues facing the Mexican education system include: (a) inequality inaccess to learning; (b) low
internal efficiency;   (c) low access to lower and upper secondary education and (d) low overall learning
achievement levels throughout the education system. At the secondary and tertiary education levels, a key
challenge i s to increase enrollment rates and improve quality inan equitable and sustainable manner.

Inequalityinaccess to learning.Significant inequalities persist, mainly inremote or disadvantaged areas
and in schools serving vulnerable groups. This i s infact the first challenge outlined inMexico's National
Education Program (SEP 2001). Considerable educational differences persist between the indigenous and
non-indigenous populations. Illiteracy rates and dropout rates continue to be substantially higher among
the indigenous population. Average years o f schooling, on the other hand, are much lower for indigenous
people. Educational gaps, however, are closing rapidly among the younger generations. The average non-
indigenous person born before 1939 has 120 percent more years o f schooling than an indigenous person
o f the same age group. A non-indigenous person born between 1979 and 1985, by contrast, has 26
percent more years of schooling than an indigenous person born in the same period. And among 7-14
year-old children the indigenoushon-indigenous educational gap i s 8 percent. Despite the fact that
Mexico has one o f the highest preschool (nearly 75%) enrollment rates in Latin America, access to early
childhood education in rural and poor areas i s still low. However, recent legislation made preschool
education compulsory for age five (school year 2004-2005), for age four (school year 2005-2006), and it
will be compulsory for age three starting the school year 2006-2007. Only 5 percent o f children below
the age o f four benefit from formal or informal initial education. This limited access may explain the low
readiness for learning among children (especially the poor) entering school as manifested in high
repetition rates inthe early grades qf primary school. Repetition inthe first grade continues to be common
for poor students. Indigenous peoples' returns to education are lower than for non-indigenous people.
Part o f the reason for the lower returns that indigenous people experience i s the quality o f schooling that
they receive. Indigenous schools consistently obtain lower Spanish and mathematics scores than all other
types o f schools, regardless o f area o f residence. The degree o f implementation o f bilingual education
policies i s low, even for indigenous schools, and varies widely from one type o f school to another. In
 addition, schools serving the poor, rural, indigenous and marginalized urban poor lack critical inputs and
have limited access to textbooks, learning materials and trained teachers. The majority o f teachers
 graduating from pre-service institutions refuse teaching positions in remote rural or indigenous schools,
 forcing the government to rely on untrainedteachers to provide educational services inremote rural areas.

 Low internalefficiency. Inspite o f an increased demand for upper secondary education, large numbers
 o f students still drop out. At the lower secondary level, the completion rate i s only 80 percent o f those
 who enroll. And o f those who successfully complete lower secondary, only 85 percent continue to upper
 secondary. Therefore, 20 percent o f those in lower secondary drop out and another 15 percent did not
 transition to upper secondary. Dropping out i s a critical problem for migrant students, who represent a
 significant proportion o f the primary and lower secondary school-age children not attending school.

                                     i




Low access to lower and upper secondary education. In contrast with high enrollments for primary
education, as recent as 2004, net enrollment in upper secondary education was only 53 percent. This i s
particularly low when compared with economies o f similar size and with other Latin American countries
such as Argentina and Chile, with net enrollment rates o f 79 and 75 percent. Lower and upper secondary
education i s critical to the development o f a labor force with the necessary skills to compete inthe global
economy.

Low overall learning achievement levels. Another challenge i s to raise the quality o f education. School
quality has not kept pace with enrollment increases and increasingly more children, especially poor
children and those living inrural areas, are being educated inlow quality schools. Throughout the system,
the quality o f education remains low-well        below international standards. The consequences of low
quality schooling include grade repetition and low achievement. Recent international assessment results
(PISA 2003) show that less than 1 percent o f 15 year olds are at the highest level o f performance in
Spanish literacy compared to an OECD average o f 8 percent. Indeed, 25 percent o f Mexican students are
below level 1, the lowest level o f performance, a result significantly worse than the OECD average o f
only 7 percent. Today a child in Mexico can expect to be in school for up to 12 years, compared to 19 in
Australia, Finland and the United Kingdom. Much remains to be done to bring Mexican students to a
comparable level with other OECD countries.

The fact that over half o f Mexican students barely attained minimal levels o f Math and Spanish lends
itself to support for stronger accountability mechanisms. Given the variance in performance between
states, as well as between indigenous and non-indigenous students, increased autonomy at the school and
community level would allow schoQlsto determine school level strategies customized to the local context.

The ongoing Programmatic sector work on the quality o f education inMexico has identified that school
autonomy and school climate are important factors that affect learning outcomes. This i s based on
extensive analysis of PISA 2000 and 2003. School climate played a significant role inthe performance o f
low and high achievers indiscriminately. The analysis suggests that both students and schools perform
best in a climate characterized by high expectations that are supported through strong teacher-student
relations, students who are ready to invest effort and who show interest and lower levels o f anxiety with
mathematics, and a positive disciplinary climate. Inmost o f the countries that performed well in PISA,
local authorities and schools have substantial responsibility for educational content and/or the use of
resources, and many set out to teach heterogeneous groups o f learners. Changes and improvements inthe
school climate (relations between students and teachers for example, belief in students' ability to learn
and support for that to happen) and current schooling practices are shown to have an impact on
achievement. Ina simulation usingPISA 2003, it i s shown that changes and improvements in the school
climate and current schooling practices increase the overall score o f the bottom achievers by about 30
percent. Increased autonomy may give schools the flexibility they need to empower teachers, thus
improving the school climate as well as the relationship between students and teachers. The analyses also
showed that parental involvement with schools and attitudes about their children's schooling have an
impact on educational achievement. Strengthened accountability mechanisms could create space for
parents to actively participate in the education system and, if successful, raise aspirations for greater
educational attainment levels for their children. The sector work recommends that more autonomy,
accountability and assessment will help improve the quality o f education, through improvements in
learning outcomes inMexico. This will also allow other policy actions to be more effective. For example,
more autonomous schools can implement appropriate language policy, thus fulfilling national guidelines
for indigenous students. A more accountable system will in turn encourage more active participation by
parents.

There i s reasonto remain optimistic that the situation inMexico can improve. For more than a decade, the
education system has been experiencing a dynamic process o f change. Recent initiatives at all levels of
government have been undertaken to address the challenge o f education equity and quality. Two current
government programs designed to increase school autonomy are improving school climate and showing
signs o f positive impacts on learning outcomes. A compensatory education program for disadvantaged
rural and all indigenous schools inthe country implementedby CONAFEbuilds an environment inwhich
a high level o f satisfaction and learning at schools exists and there i s some evidence that the program has
improved equity in outcomes.        Evaluations show that the program reduced learning gaps between
similarly disadvantaged groups (see, for example, Shapiro and Moreno-Trevino 2004).

The Progruma Escuelus de Culidud, or PEC (Quality Schools Program), a school-based management
program, which is very innovative inthe Mexican context, aims to increase parental participation through
voluntary participation by schools, and school grants for school improvement. PEC, therefore, aims to
putinplace a limited amount o f school autonomy by allowing schools to decide on how to spend federal,
state and private resources allocated to them through their voluntary participation in the Program. PEC
also institutes a highlevel o f accountability by mandatingparental participation and oversight o f spending
decisions and through heightened supervision by federal and state authorities, as well as participation in
assessments and evaluations.       PEC allows local stakeholders (school principals, teachers, parents,
community members) to diagnose specific shortcomings o f their school and to design School Strategic
Transformation Plans (PETEs). The PEC rules require that the school community i s effectively involved
incarrying out the plan. Parents have a direct relationshipas they are custodians of the funds and must
verify the purchases and contracts made with the resources received. Thus, PEC changes the school
climate by creating the conditions for more meaningful parental and community participation in the
school.

Therefore, it i s expected that PEC would contribute to a significant degree to increasing levels o f school
autonomy, accountability and assessment - precisely those elements called for in the Bank's and the
Government's Quality o f Education Sector Work (World Bank 2005). Thus, PEC schools become more
participatory, which should improve the school climate, making the school a more welcoming
environment for students and their parents, especially in more disadvantaged communities. A more
participatory environment would improve the internal quality o f the school. Further, in the medium term
the more participatory environment should see a decrease in school dropouts (Shapiro and Skoufias 2005)
as weaker students are given more attention and their parents take a more active role in their schooling
careers. Infact, injust three years o f the PEC, participating schools were able to reduce dropouts by 0.41
percentage points, compared to only 0.23 points decrease for non-PEC schools. The added responsibility
that comes with the increased autonomy should help focus principals and teachers on the needs o f weaker
students. Therefore, in the longer term one should see improved learning outcomes. This would come

The Programa Escuelas de Calidad (Quality Schools Program-PEC)               i s an educational strategy
that gives autonomy to the school by encouraging shared decisions on school improvements by
principals, teachers, and parents. The Programaims to reduce the quality gap between schools by
raising the quality o f the basic education services in the poorest urban areas. The Program
assumes that when a school has more autonomy, it i s able to identify aspects that need
improvement, take measures towards solving problems and account for results to the school
community, it i s a better position to help the weaker students who have fallen behind in their
school work due to poor environment, ethnic background, andor family conditions, ultimately
raising student learning achievements..

The schools learn about the Program through information campaigns carried out by state
education authorities every year and choose voluntarily to apply. Interested schools are invited to
prepare strategic School Strategic Transformation Plans (PETEs) and Annual Work Programs
(PAT), which must be approved as a condition for the school to qualify for the Program. The
plans are expected to cover improvements to school management, teaching practices and social
participation. Schools with approved plans are selected to receive school grants and may use
grant funds to pay for infrastructure, equipment, and pedagogic enhancements tools contemplated
in their improvement plans. Each year, the schools evaluate the extent to which they have
advanced towards reaching their goals, and may re-apply for grant renewal up to a maximum
period o f five years.

The PEC i s jointly financed by federal and state funds, through SEP and the state education
authorities at a ratio o f three-to-one federal to state contributions. The school grant i s an incentive
to promote the desired school-based management transformation and as such, i s an innovative
tool not only to transfer funds directly to schools but primarily to empower the school
community. The school grant i s also an instrument to introduce in the schools a culture of
accountability, as each participating school must keep precise records o f the use o f grant funds,
and account for the use o f any additional resources contributed by local community sources.
Parents are responsible for the funds and state education authorities supervise the procedures used
by the schools and advise schools on procurement and financial management.

Origins ofMexico's Qualityof SchoolsProgram(PEC)

This Program started in 2001, with the participation o f the federal and the state governments
through their respective education authorities, as a strategy to help urban school improve their
operating conditions, giving priority to schools located in poor neighborhoods. These schools
generally have deficient       infrastructure facilities, poor student learning outcomes and low
participation by the school community. The Program addresses these issues by supporting school-
based management. The strategy recognizes that schools inpoor urban neighborhoods face many
problems and some o f these problems are beyond the reach o f public policy. However, many
problems are germane to the way schools are managed and solving them i s a central aim o f the
PEC. Examples of suchproblems include:


     0   Parents, teachers and principals have little influence on school decisions,
     0   There i s a lack o f communication among the actors in the school community, including
       . among teachers inthe same school,


                                                    27

        Teaching i s carried out in routine, inflexible, formal lessons and memorization exercises
        that sap creativity,
        There i s no participation by members o f the school community in the planning,
        implementation and following up o f school activities,
        Education authorities govern schools through heavy bureaucracies that limit leadership
        by schoolprincipals and other members o f the school community,
        Teacher absenteeism is.high,
        Schools do not use well the available resources, and
        School infrastructure and equipment i s either lacking or inadequate.

Program objectives and strategy

PEC aims to increase the quality o f public education through strengthening school autonomy
ultimately contributing to: (a) reduce urban poverty and lessen educational inequality by
improving the academic achievement o f disadvantaged urban beneficiary students enrolled in
preschool, primary and lower secondary public schools-i.e.        throughout the compulsory basic
education cycle; (b) strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity and integrate local
management strategies into the national education system; and (c) build social capital in
disadvantaged urban areas and increase cooperation between schools and local communities in
those areas.

The Program strategy assumes that improvements to the internal organization and decision-
making capacity o f the schools are key elements to achieve higher quality o f education. Starting
with this basic concept, PEC promotes a model o f school autonomy and school-based
management which emphasizes: (i)      liberty to make school decisions; (ii) leadership; (iii)
                                                                            shared
team work; (iv) flexible teaching practices; (v) collaborative planning; (vi) evaluation to inform
continuous improvement; (vii) responsible social participation; and (viii) accountability.

The PEC strategy recognizes that in order to succeed in achieving autonomy and school-based
management, schools must be willing to participate ina process o f change. As this ina voluntary
decision on the part of the school, Programparticipation i s likewise voluntary.

To join the Program and qualify to receive a school grant, schools must prepare a strategic five-
year School Strategic Transformation Plan (PETE) where the school community defines the goals
it want to reach in the median term and the means that will be used to achieve these goals. To
implement the PETE the schools prepare, as an added condition to qualify for the Program,
Annual Work Programs (Programa Anual de TrabajePAT) where they specify the investments
and activities that will be carried out each year. Since the great majority o f schools have no
experience in strategic planning or in participatory management, the PEC provides technical
assistance and training to all schools that express interest in participating in the Program. This
assistance i s provided by state education authorities through different means: (a) direct assistance
to the school by the technical coordination o f the Program at state level; (b) technical meetings
(mesas te'cnicas) organized by the supervisory team o f each level o f education (preschool,
primary and lower-secondary); or (c) services provided to schools by pedagogic assistants
assigned to the corresponding supervisory teams. In all cases, technical assistance focuses on
school management and planning, diagnosis o f school needs and evaluation o f results. Technical
assistance i s primarily provided to school principals, who in turn have the responsibility for
sharing the information with the teachers and parents.

                                                  28

State education authorities also provide continuous training to school principals and teachers as
part o f their regular activities. This service i s critical to the PEC as it builds capacity o f key
Program actors.

After the first year o f participation in the Program, the schools must prepare a progress report
indicating advances made during the year towards reaching each o f the goals o f the PETE and
prepare a new PAT for the following year. These reports are presentedto the PEC state education
authorities and are made public to the school community at the end o f the school year. Approval
o f the progress report and the new PAT by state education authorities are conditions for the
renewal o f the grant.


Project components to be financed by the proposed APL insupport of the PEC Program

Component 1: School Grants (US$324.7 million with contingencies or 94% of total project
cost; Bank financing US$234.49 or 72.2%)). This component finances the federal share o f the
PEC school grant program that i s transferred each year by SEP from the PEC national trust fund
to the PEC trust funds o fparticipating states. The states complement federal funds in accordance
with a financing-share schedule and are responsible for Program implementation in their
jurisdiction. At the local level, the Program i s carried out by the State Education Authorities
(AEEs) and the Sub-secretariat o f Education for the Federal District (SSEDF).            The AEEs
transfer PEC grants from the state trust fund directly to the bank accounts o f the participating
schools, after completing a process o f Program dissemination, submission o f applications by
interested schools, technical assistance to schools for preparation o f grant proposals, qualification
o f proposals, and selection o f schools for grant award. This process i s repeated each year
throughout the country. To qualify for the Program, schools must establish participatory school
management and present a satisfactory School Strategic Transformation Plan proposal. As the
number o f schools that qualify for the Program tends to exceed Program funds, states are
instructed to give priority to qualified schools located in low-income urban neighborhoods.
During phase I,an estimated 33,000 public schools would benefit from one or more o f the
 following types o f PEC grants:

          (a) Initial PEC grant, renewable for a maximum of five years. This initial grant i s
              awarded to all schools selected to participate inthe Programina given year, and may
              be renewedfor a maximum o f five years. Eachyear, the schools that wish to continue
              inthe Programmustre-apply for the grant, meet the selection criteria, andbe chosen
              by the state selection committee to receive a grant. After the five year cycle, the
              schools graduate from the Program. The amount o f this grant varies according to the
     . .      requirements o f each School Strategic Transformation Plan but may not exceed
              50,000 Mexican p5sos (US$4,600) per year, per school. The AEEs transfer the grant
              funds to the bank accounts o fthe schools ina single installment inthe first halfo f the
               school year, before the end o f the fourth month o f classes.

          (b)Supplemental matching grant, renewablefor a maximum offive years. This grant is
               awarded to Program schools that are implementing School Strategic Transformation
              Plans with funds from the initial PEC grant, but that have also mobilized additional
              local resources for their project. That is, the PEC schools eligible for this type of
              grant are those that seek and obtain donations in cash and/or in kind from parents,
              municipal governments,       civil organizations and/or       private enterprises. The
               supplemental grant much match the amount o f local resources raised by the school,
              butmay not exceed 50,000 Mexican pesos (US$4,600) per year, per school. Schools


                                                    29

                                 3




              may apply and receive additional supplemental grants during the five-year program
              cycle, as long as they continue to meet the eligibility criteria. The AEEs transfer the
              supplemental grant funds to the bank accounts o f the schools inthe second half o f the
              school year, before,the end o f the 9" month o f classes.

      (c) Special matching grant with no renewal restrictions. This special type o f grant i s
          targeted to disadvantagedbasic education public schools that want to continue to carryout
          their School Strategic Transformation Plan after graduating from the five-year PEC
          Program cycle, but need financial support to do so. To be eligible for this grant a school
          must meet the following conditions: (i) located inlower-income urbanneighborhoods,
                                                   be
          (ii) graduatedfromtheregularPECProgram; (iii) Programrequirements, and
              be                                                    meet
          (iv) has raisedadditionallocalresources insupport o ftheir school projects.

The PEC Program Operating Rules (Reglas de Operacidn) are publishedby SEP every year, and
specify the amount to be invested in the Program each year by the federal government and the
states, and confirm the criteria for the selection o f schools, and the arrangements for Program
implementation at the national and state levels. These rules form part o f the Project Operations
Manual that has been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. During Program
implementation, the AEEs may introduce additional procedures to operate the Program in their
jurisdiction, as long as they continue to fully comply with the Program Operating Rules (see
Annex 6).

In addition to the school grants, this component finances the banking fees paid by SEP to a
commercial bank for the administration o f the PEC federal trust fund using only counterpart
funds.

Component 2: ProgramMonitoring and Oversight (US$15.1million with contingencies or
4% of total project cost; 0% Bank financing). This component finances Program monitoring,
oversight and information disseminatior by SEP with the objective o f ensuring compliance with
Program Operating Rules throyghout the country and to provide ample information to the public
about Program operations and results. These objectives would be achieved through the following
three subcomponents.

 Subcomponent 2.1: Program monitoring (US$0.16 million). This subcomponent finances the
 continuous operation, maintenance and upgrading o f the PEC national management information
 system (Sisterna de Inforrnacidn del Prograrna Escuelas de Calidad-SPEC).            The SPEC i s
 currently fully operational and serves to: (a) record and systematize information on the operations
 o f the Program at school, state and federal levels; (b) record key Program outcomes, such as the
 use schools give to the grant funds and the amount o f local funds schools are able to mobilize,
 among others; and (c) flag Program shortcomings that need to be addressed by state agencies for
 the efficient operation o f the Program. The design and operation o f the SPEC still requires
 additional investment to finance the production o f additional modules, and provide user-training
 inorder to increase reliability and timeliness o f information flows. With this aim, SPEC would
 be enhanced through the design, test and operation o f a customized user support module that
 would be made available to participant states and schools, enabling them to maintain the
 appropriate flow o f information to the national office. The institutional management o f the
 SPEC also needs improvement, especially regarding the linkage between the flagging o f a
 problem and the corresponding remedial action. The subcomponent would finance consultancy
 services for system development. Inparallel, SEP will procure additional computer equipment to
 expand the current technical configuration o f the system usingother sources o f funds.

Subcomponent 2.2: Support for Program Implementation(US$lO.O million). The national
PEC coordination office would provide technical and operational support to the AEEs to ensure
smooth Program implementation in accordance with Program Operating Rules. This objective
would be achieved with assistance from regular SEP staff assigned to the PEC by the Under-
Secretariat o f Basic and Normal Education. This team consists o f experts in Program operations
and basic educationthat would carry out the following activities: (a) visit each state several times
a year following a constant supervision program; (b) organize seminars and workshops to
promote the continuous development o f technical staff working on the Program at state level; and
(c) coordinate regional and national meetings, and the annual PEC Congress, attended by federal
and state authorities.    During these events, Program innovations would be discussed, best
practices shared, and the ProgramOperating Rules updated. It should be mentioned that technical
support provided to schools for the preparation o f the School Strategic Transformation Plans i s
not part o f this subcomponent because this function i s performed by the AEEs and i s funded by a
20% share o f state funds that are deposited inthe PEC state trust funds. Project funds allocated to
this component would finance travel by federal and state personnel and expenditures associated
with training seminars, workshops, Program meetings, and congresses, including hotel
accommodations, meals, speakers, facilitators, and materials to support these events. Inaddition,
an estimated $2.1millionwould finance incrementaloperational costs.

Subcomponent 2.3: Program Dissemination (US$5.0 million). This subcomponent supports
the dissemination of information on Program objectives, activities and results through a wide
range o f communication vehicles, with the aim o f promoting the Program and guaranteeing full
accountability and transparency. To meet this goal, television, radio, newspapers and special
publications would be used throughout the year during Program implementation to disseminate
messages tailored to specific audiences o f parents, teachers, directors, AEEs technical staff and
society at large. A Program magazine (Educare) would continue to be published by the National
Free Textbooks Commission (Comisidn Nacional de Libros de Texto Gratuitos-CONALITEG)
and distributed three times a year throughout the country. SEP would also continue to collaborate
with the Secretariat o f Internal Affairs (Secretaria de Gobernacidn-SEGOB) to gain access to the
official television network and other media for PEC's messages. The activities that would be
financed under this subcomponent are: (i) production o f television, radio and newspaper
                                               the
messages; (ii)    the design and editing o f periodicals and pamphlets; and (iii)printing and
distribution o f materials.

Component 3: Policy Development and Evaluation (US$5.8 million with contingencies or
1.8.% of total project cost; Bank financing US$4.91 or 85%). This component supports the
development o f basic educatiov policy based on the results o f policy studies, Program evaluation
activities and pilot experiments intended to test possible adjustments to Program design and
financing. These objectives would be achieved through the following subcomponents:

Subcomponent 3.1: Program Evaluation (US$5.0 million).This subcomponent supports the
design and implementation of Program evaluation activities that would be carried out throughout
the Program implementation with the aim to create a strong analytical basis for the development
of the Program. T o this end, the following types o f evaluation studies activities would be
financed:  (a) external evaluation o f Program performance and preparation o f the Annual Report
to the National Congress; (b) gualitative evaluation to determine the non-quantifiable benefits
accruing from the Program; (c) student learning achievements assessments using National
Standards, and (d) impact evaluation by an external, independent evaluator; using rigorous
methodology. The impact evaluation activities planned for phase Iare: (i)the design and field
test o f evaluation methodology and data collection instruments, (ii)     baseline survey, and (iii)
preliminary data analysis. During the proposed phases I1and 111, impact evaluation activities


                                                  31

would continue with repeated survey to measure the impact o f the Program and further analysis
and dissemination o f results. The expenditures financed under this subcomponent include
consultant services providedby individual, firms, and by national academic institutions.

Subcomponent 3.2: Policy Studies (US$O.8             million). This subcomponent supports the
development o f national basic education policy, including the lower-secondary education reform
currently in progress, through the analysis o f national and international assessment o f student
learning achievements, evaluations o f Program outcomes, and special studies. The analytical
work to be financed under this subcomponent would be carried out by national academic
institutions and independent consultants. The themes that would be analyzed include, among
others, the following:


    0    Development and pilot experiment o f strategies to encourage applications to participate
         inthe PEC from schools located inlower-income urban areas; and best forms to provide
         technical assistance to help these prepare the School Strategic Transformation Plans;


     0   Adjustments to the PEC Program design and financing aimed to strengthen its impact and
         expand its coverage; and


     0   PEC expansion plan for phases I1and I11o f the proposed APL.

                      MEXICO: School-BasedManagementProgram

The executing agency for the Program i s the Secretariat o f Public Education (Secretaria de
Educacidn Pliblica-SEP).       The Program carried out by the states and the participating schools.
No special Project CoordinatingUnit will be created for the implementation o f PEC. SEP has the
overall responsibility to establish the normative framework for the Program, to finance the federal
share o f Program expenditures, and to coordinate Program implementation. The normative
framework i s established by the PEC Program OperatingRules, which are updated and published
yearly by SEP.

Agencies, Roles andResponsibilities

The federal share o f Program funds i s administered by SEP through the national PEC Trust Fund
(Fideicomiso Nacionalpara Escuelas de Calidad-FNEC), which transfers school grant funds to
the PEC Trust Funds o f each State and o f the Federal District (Fideicomisos Estatales de
Escuelas de Calidad-FEEC)         according to the norms established in the Program Operating
Rules.

The FNEC was established in august 2001 through a contract ("Trust Agreement") signed
between the SHCP (as Fideicomitente or "Trustee" and the Banco Nacional de Mkxico, S.A.
(Banamex, as Fiduciaria or "Trust Administrator") and SEP as the agency responsible for the
execution o f the PEC Program. The Trust Agreement establishes the capital o f the Trust, creates
a Technical Committee (Comitk Tkcnico) to direct the activities of FNEC, defines the
responsibilities o f the parties under the contract, and specifies the payment due to the Trust
Administrator paid out o f FNEC funds.

The,responsibilities o fthe Trust Administrator under this contract are the following:

    (a) Transfer 94% o f FmC funds to the governments o f the states and the SSSEDF,
         according to the Program Operating Rules and following the instructions from the
         Technical Committee;
    (b) Invest 6% o f FNEC funds in operating costs and costs associated with Program
         dissemination incurredby SEP, following the instructions from the Technical Committee;
    (c) Invest FNEC liquid funds inpublic or private bonds o f recognizedliquidity and l o w risk;
         and
    (d) Assign the earnings from FNEC investments, as well as any other contribution to the
         fund, for the purposesthat are eventually specified bythe Technical Committee.


The responsibilities o fthe FNEC Technical Committee are the following:

    (a) Instruct Trust Administrator to distribute 94% o f FNEC funds to the governments o f the
         states and the SSSEDF, inaccordance with the Program Operating Rules;
    (b) Receive statement o f accounts presented by Trust Administrator on the operations o f the
         FNEC;
    (c) Instruct the Trust Administrator to open specific sub-accounts in the FNEC in order to
         differentiate federal funds from other funds that eventually are depositedinthe Trust;
    (d) Providethe TrustAdministrator withthe information itrequires; and,
    (e) Ensure the all necessary conditions for the achievement o f the Trust objectives.



                                                 35

The structure and operation o f the state level FEECs i s similar to that o f the FNEC. The funds
deposited inthe FEECs include the federal transfers from the FNEC, the funds contributedby the
States and the FederalDistrict to the Program, any other contributionreceived for the Program, as
well as the earnings accruing from investments o f the Trust capital.

The states carry out the Program within their jurisdiction, through their Education Authorities
(Autoridades Educativas Estatales-AEEs),        . The states have the responsibility to define the
strategy to carry out the Program and may introduce additional Program rules and procedures
provided these are compatible with the Program Operating Rules. The specific hnctions o f the
state education authorities inthe implementationo f the Program are to:

     (a) Submit to SEP, every year, a written confirmation o f their willingness to participate inthe
        Program and o f the amount o f funds they will allocated for the Program;

     (b) Administer Program activities including public announcement o f Program Operating
         Rules and application procedures, reception o f applications submitted by interested
         schools, provision o f technical assistance to schools for preparation o f School Strategic
         Transformation Plans, qualification o f school proposals, selection o f schools, transfer o f
         school grants to the bank accounts o f the selected schools, and the carrying out staff
         training; Program monitoring, dissemination and evaluation.

     (c) Administer the state PEC Trust Funds(FEECs);

     (d) Propose state-specific criteria for school selection and resource allocation that are

     (e) Support the professional development o f teachers and school principals, through training
         programs;
                                 L

     (f) Finance the administrationo f the Program usinga maximumo f 20% o fthe state share of
         Program funds;

     (g) Prepare Programsupervision reports; and

     (h) Administer the PEC state information system (SPEC) and provide advice to schools on
         how to use the system.

At the national level, SE the General Directorate o f Management Development and Education
Innovation (Direccidn General de Desarrollo de la Gestidn e Innovacidn Educativa--DGDGIE)
i s responsible for the development o f innovative projects and programs with the purpose o f
improving the school performance and student's learning achievements. The DGDGIEwould be
responsible for the implementation o f the Program. and its coordination nationwide. To this end,
the DGDGIEhas the following specific responsibilities:

     (a) Define and interpret the Program Operating Rules;

     (b) Monitor Program objectives, goals, processes and timetables in coordination with the
         state education authorities;

     (c) Administer federal Program funds through FNEC and supervise the allocation o f
         Programfunds to the states;

    (d) Support the carrying out o f the Programby the states and ensure that state comply with
         the Program Operating Rules;

    (e) Train state technical staff involved inthe Program;

    (f) Advise states on strategies for Programdissemination;

    (g) Monitor the process o f school registration, technical assistance, evaluation o f proposals,
         selection of schools, and school grant awards and use o f school grants, carried out by the
         states and the participating schools;

    (h) Encourage states to implement professional development programs for school principals
         and teachers, and for members o f the State Education Council for Social Participation
         (Consejo Estatal de Participacidn Social en la Educacidn-CEPSE);

    (i)OperateanddevelopthePECInformationSystem(SPEC) andutilizethis systemto
        monitor Program operations at state and school levels;

    6) Design and carry out national Programdissemination campaigns;

    (k) Carry out external and internal Program evaluations with the support of SEP's General
         Directorate o f Evaluation (Direccidn General de Evaluacidn, DGE) and the National
         Institute for Education Evaluation (Instituto Nacional para la Evaluacidn de la
        Educacidn, INEE), among others; and

    (1) Finance the national operating costs o f the Program usingnot more than six percent (6%)
                                 \

         o fthe annual PEC budget.

The DGDGIE provides operational and academic assistance to the state education authorities
through a small central network o f academic and operational support officers (Coordinadores
Acade'micos, Coordinadores Territoriales, and Coordinadores de Informacidn y Andisis)
assigned to the Program. Members o f this team are allocated to the five regions o f the country
(Northwest, Northeast, Pacific, Southeast and Central) to oversee Program implementation and
maintain direct contact with academic and operational state officers worlung on the Program.
This national team fulfills its implementation support functions through visits to states, seminars
and workshops designed to promote the continuous development o f state-level PEC technical
staff; and through regional and national meetings. The interactions between the national and state
PECteams are shown on the graphbellow.

The management instruments used by the DGDGE to coordinate the Program are the State
Agenda for Strategic Management (Agenda Estatal de Gestidn Estratigica) and its state
equivalent, and a computerized management information system (Sistema de Informacidn del
Programa Escuelas de Calidad, SPEC). The Agenda i s updated yearly and describes the
activities to be carried at state level, highlighting key processes and timetables that provide
benchmarks for the coordination o f Program nationwide. The SPEC processes and consolidates
information on Program operations based on data supplied by federal and state agencies, and by
the participating schools. This system helps to ensure compliance with the Operating Rules and to
identify eventual implementation problems.

                  Annex 7: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements
                            MEXICO: School-BasedManagementProgram


Background
The agreed Financial Management (FM) arrangements are consistent with Bank's principles and practices
on the subject, and some o f these arrangements will allow for the use o f existing government FM
arrangements (country systems that are acceptable to the Bank), thus minimizing any additional Program
specific requirements.    Most o f the agreed FM arrangements are currently in place; however the
implementing unit will need to slightly adjust some of them to make all o f them fully acceptable to the
Bank.
FinancialManagement Assessment (FMA)
The Bank carried out a FMA, which involved ensuring that project design will allow for an appropriate
level o f transparency, facilitating oversight and control while also supporting smooth implementation.
The Appraisal mission took place in October 2005 and reviewed FM arrangements.               The FM team
evaluated the institutional capacity o f the implementing agency the Direccidn General de Desarrollo de
la Gestion e Innovacidn Educativa (DGDGIE), housed in the Subsecretaria de Educacidn Bhsica (SEB)
which i s an Under-Secretariat withinthe Secretaria de Educacidn Pliblica (SEP).

Implementingentity
SEP will be the implementing entity through DGDGIE which houses the PEC National Coordination.
The DGDGIE does not have experience with the implementation o f Bank-financed projects; however, up
to now it has demonstrated its institutional capacity for an adequate project financial management.
NAFIN,the financial agent, will provide its services, including advice on project FM, duringthe entire
implementationperiod.

Flow of funds andinformation
The Secretariat o f Finance (SHCP) has t w o options for the project's flow o f funds: (a) passing through a
Special Account or (b) passing thrdugh a dedicated account, a Bridge Account. Inboth cases SHCP will
pre-finance total project spending through the standard budget o f SEP. For this project it i s expected that
a Bridge Account will be used rather than a Special Account. The National Treasury (Tesoreria de la
Federacibn-TESOFE,       a SHCP Under-Secretariat) will transfer funds to SEP inlocal currency (Mexican
Pesos) via its standard budget for the Escuelas de Calidad Program. SEP will: (a) pay the suppliers o f
goods and services for the implementation o f the project components; and (b) transfer funds to
participating schools through the National Trust Fund for the Program (Fideicomiso Nacional para
Escuelas- de Calidad-FNEC)         which will transfer funds to the participating State Trust Funds
(Fideicomiso Estatal de Escuelas, de Calidad--FEEC) for the implementation o f the corresponding
Component 1. In line with Program Operating Rules, fund-raising activities will complement the funds
received by the participating schools from federal and state sources, to allow them to execute their
approved School Strategic Transformation Plans. Schools will pay its suppliers for expenditures financed
with PEC grants and retain all the corresponding supporting documentation. At the end of this cycle,
TESOFE will be reimbursed. The flowchart at the end o f this subsection illustrates details on the flow o f
funds and on the flow o finformation for the project.

Counterpart funds are provided by the standard budget o f SEP for the Program. These funds are used to
complement Bank funds to finance the project. Program funds also include funds provided by the States,
by the Federal District, and by the participating schools, even though only SEP founds part of the
estimated total project cost.


                                                    39

Bank funds and counterpart funds will be registered in the standard budget of SEP in two separated
budgetary lines earmarked for the proposed project (digit0 2 and 3).

The following flowchart shows the flow of funds and information. This flow was not created specifically
for the proposed Bank-financed project as it is the normal country system flow and might be changed as a
result o fNegotiations.

AccountingPoliciesandProcedures
SEP will maintain records and accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with accounting practices
compatible with International Accounting Standards and in compliance with local requirements, its
operations and financial condition, including records and separate accounts for the proposed project.
Administrative procedures must be in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with
consideration to safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting and monitoring
systems. Basedon discussions and agreementsreached betweenthe Bank and SHCP (Unidad de Politica
y Control Prespuestal, Direccidn General de Programacidn y Presupuesto, Direccidn General de



                                                     40

Organismos Financieros Internacionales, Tesoreria de la Federacidn, among other areas), NAFIN and
SEP (Direccion General de Recursos Financieros and DGDGIE), the implementing unit (DGDGIE) will
be able to have inplace reliable accounting policies and procedure before Negotiations.

The accounting systems at SEP, complemented with information systems, currently have the capacity to
record assets, liabilities and financial transactions, and to produce financial statements and reports useful
for program management. These systems meet Bank's FMrequirements. Financial Monitoring Reports
(FMR) will be produced in spreadsheets (Excel), based on information and reports generated by the
existing systems.       SEP i s responsible to keep files o f all supporting documentation on project
expenditures, and to coordinate the files o f the supporting documentation corresponding to expenditures
under Component 1 which will be implemented at the state level. These arrangements will be used for
the proposed project and will be supported by the SPEC system and a set o f written procedures
(guidelines).   The financial management section o f the project Operations Manual (Chapter 7) will
provide details on accounting policies and procedures. An updated Operations Manual shall be approved
by the BankbeforeNegotiations and adoptedby SEP before Effectiveness.

InformationSystems
The information system operated by SEP will track all project transactions. Existingsystems, which are
under use for the regular SEP's programs, are considered satisfactory to the Bank. Those systems will be
complemented with spreadsheets (Excel) to produce FM information required for the management o f the
proposed project, and for reporting purposes.         These systems are the following: (a) SIAFF for the
financial operation and budgetary control by SEP and SHCP; (b) UrNet for the financial operation and
budgetary control by SEP's administration; (c) SIAVI for tracking travel costs; (d) SIBISEP for fix assets
and inventories; (e) SIBCOM for institutional procurement; (f) SIAPSEP for staffing; (g) COI for the
accounts o f the proposed project; and (h) Sistema de Buncos for operation o f the bank accounts o f the
DGDGIE. The SPEC module for the control of expenditures at state level pertainingto Component 1, is
being designed and shall be ready before June 2006, that is, prior to the startingo f the next school year.

Staffing
Key FMstaf$ A FMteam within the DGDGIE,headedby an experienced public accountant, responsible
for project FM, in coordination with staff from all administrative areas o f SEP (accounting, treasury,
budgeting, information systems, and others), and participating federal entities (e.g. Direccidn General de
Administracidn de la Secretaria de Educacidn Pzibica Estatal) was integrated to carry out all financial
management activities. The team i s financed through SEP's standard budget and will receive advice and
occasional support from NAFIN. \The entities that participated in project design, including the SHCP,
NAFIN,SEP and the Bank agreed that additional FMstaff is not required for the implementationof the
proposed project. This denotes that SEP's officials have qualifications and public sector experience
adequate to undertake the financial management tasks related to the Bank-financedproject. The main FM
duties o f SEP for the project will be: (i)to prepare the project budgets, financial statements and
disbursement requests; (ii)  to supervise internal controls and efficiency in the execution o f funds; (iii)
                                                                                                           to
coordinate on financial management issues with NAFIN, SHCP, SFP, the state institutions and the Bank;
 (v) coordinate annual project audits; and (vi) prepare and submit FMRreports on semi-annual basis via
NAFIN, Current staffing arrangements inSEP are acceptable to the Bank.

InternalAudit

The internal audit department at SEP i s responsible for permanent internal audit reviews o f all its Under-
 Secretariats, including the SEB; no internal auditor will be assigned specifically to the project. Each area
within SEP that is involved in the project will make sure that proper internal control procedures are
 followed, as all are subject to internal control reviews. The internal audit function is operational and


                                                       41

relatively independent, reporting to Secretaria de la Funcidn Pliblica (SFP). The internal control unit at
SEP has experience auditing Bank-financed project, which were and are being implemented by other
units o fthe SEP.

ExternalAudit
The audit process and audit report will follow the Bank's audit policy (dated July 2003). Project annual
audits will be carried out in accordance with auditing standards compatible with International Standards
on Auditing (IFAC), by a combination o f independent auditors (private firms and governmental auditors)
and under Terms of Reference acceptable to the Bank. As soon as available, but in any case not later than
six months after the end o f each audited year, SEP will furnishthe audits to NAFIN,to be submitted to
the Bank.    The Bank will review the audits, evaluate its acceptability, and provide comments and
recommendations (if   any). The project Operations Manual includes a section on financial management
(Chapter 7) which provides detailed information on project audits. The auditors would perform at least
one interim visit per year. The audit review will include the FNEC, the state FEECs, the state education
entities (AEEs) and the schools for Component 1 which i s implemented at state level and SEP for the
remaining Components. The audit will include all project bank accounts e.g. deposit accounts, Special
Account and Bridge Account, and Trust Funds. The audit o f the Special Account and o f the Bridge
Account i s the responsibility of NAFINthat, as the financial agent, i s responsible o f management o f this
account, and will be carriedout under arrangements acceptable to the Bank.

The table below summarizes the audit requirements for the proposed project.

The Bank's default position i s to recognize eligible expenditures upon final disbursement to suppliers and
contractors. Recognizing expenditures upon transfer the FEECs to the schools (before final disbursement)
for Component 1, which will be implemented in a decentralized manner, is justified in the proposed
project because: (a) funds are provided to the state, and then to schools, as grants; (b) funds are
mergedhomplemented with state funds; (b) the amount o f each school grant i s small; (c) the number o f

The inherent risk o f the recognition o f transfers to schools as eligible expenditures, inthe case o f school
grants in Component 1, i s mitigated by several controls. Ifmonitoring/audit detects that resources have
not been used for intended purposes by a participating school, the school becomes ineligible and
immediately i s excluded from future transfers, the State EducationAuthority (AEE) request to the school
a full explanationo f the identified deviations, the explanations are reviewed by SEP and by the AEE, and
an investigation i s conducted by the corresponding authorities e.g. the state internal control Contraloria
Estatal, the internal audit department o f the AEE and the internal audit department o f SEP. The latter
action i s the standard response when governmental officials (in this case the school's director) incur in
misconduct.

Statements of expenditures. Loan withdrawal applications will be supported by SOEs and SOTS,which
will be prepared by SEP and submitted to NAFIN; this financial agent will review them and incorporate
needed information in standard forms and subsequently will submit the SOEs/SOTs to the Bank.
Documents in support o f SOEs/SOTs must be maintainedby SEP, NAFINand the corresponding national
and state level entities that incurred project expenditures, at least until one year after the Bank have
receivedthe audit report for the fiscal year inwhich the last Loan withdrawal was made. Such documents
must be available to review by the external auditors and by Bank staff at all time. SEP has the overall
responsibility for project supporting documents through the DGDGIE.

Special Account (SA) and Bridge Account. The project will establish such account in the Banco de
Mexico a SA inU S dollars. NAFINwill support the project inthe management o f the SA (e.g. monthly
reconciliation or coordination with the central bank). NAFINmay request an advance to the SA. For
replenishment o f that advance, NMIN will prepare monthly (in any case, no more than quarterly)
requests for reimbursement o f expenditures made. Total advances to the SA at any given time would not
exceed an authorized allocation o f US$25,000,000.

Other procedures. The proposed project, most likely will not require other disbursement procedures,
however upon request from NAFIN and subject to Bank's approval, payments may be made: (i)         directly
to a thirdparty (e.g. a consultant contracted by SEP) for services; (ii)
                                                                       to a procurement agent, which i s not
likely, or to the FNEC; or (iii)to a commercial bank for expenditures against a Bank Special Commitment
covering a commercial bank's letter o f credit, which i s highlyunlikely.

Retroactive Financing (expenditures).          The project will be eligible to submit for retroactive
reimbursement, documentation on expenditures totaling up to 10% o f the loan amount, for eligible
expenditures incurred after project Appraisal (October 2005) but before the signing o f the Loan
Agreement.

FinancialReporting
The main. FM reports will be the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs), which will be submitted
semiannually to the Bank via NAFIN. The FMRs will sufficiently describe project financial operation.
The FMRs will include a narrative section and the financial informatiodstatements. The rest o f the
information normally provided in the FMRs will be submitted in separate reports and include: (i)
information on physical progress will be provided in the progress reports submitted seminally, and (ii)
information on project procurement will be provided in the Procurement Plan, which will cover 18
months and will be permanently updated. The format o f the FMRs will be agreed prior to Negotiations,
and will be included inChapter 7 o f the project Operations Manual (OM).

OperationsManual(OM) andWritten Procedures
Project financial management-related procedures will be documented in the OM (Chapter 7), which will
                                     J


define the roles and responsibilities o f SEP, NAFINand SHCP at the federal level, and o f the entities at
the state level, including the AEEs and the schools. A draft o f this Operations Manual will be submitted


                                                     44

to the FM Specialist for its approval before Negotiations in order to avoid to having to include Bank
approval o fthe OM as an Effectiveness Condition inthe Loan Agreement.

SupervisionPlan
One FM supervision mission will be conducted yearly, and will include the state level supervision. A
Bank Financial Management Specialist will review the project annual audit reports (entity, project and
SA) and the semi-annual FMRs.

Procurement inMexico: recentdevelopments

Procurement o f goods, services and works financed by the World Bank under the first phase o f the
Program would be carried out in accordance with World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" published in May 2004); the hiring o f consultants would be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by WorldBank
Borrowers" published in May 2004), and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement and in the
Procurement Plan.

The Bank has agreed with the Government o f Mexico to accept the full-fledged use o f the
COMPRANET as vehicle for the Bank-financed procurement for N C B and ICB pursuant to paragraphs
2.11, 2.18, 2.44, 2.45 and other parts o f the Procurement Guidelines o f M a y 2004. In order to remove
some perceived obstacles for international participation in Bank-financed procurement, COMPRANET
has agreed that: (a) the biddingdocuments will be free o f charge; (b) will adopt The Hague Convention
on national certification o f the back-up, paper signed copy o f the signature o f the prospectivebiddersand
will enter into relevant agreements with countries that have not signed that Convention as needed, and
(c) will add a facility inthe system to post the ads indgmarket and UNDB possibly throughthe use o f the
Bank's Client Connection. The bidding documents for ICB will be the same as those used in the pilot
program successfully completed as o f July 1, 2004, the only difference being the addition o f arbitration
clauses and a 45-days period for bid submission.

The Secretaria de la Funcidn Pliblica (SFP) and the Bank have agreed on a new generation o f standard
bidding documents for goods and yorks under NCB. These documents are to be used by all federal and
state purchasingentities for all N C B procurement financed by the Bank and include several modifications
due to recent changes to the Law, including the use o f one-envelope bidding procedures. Further, the
Bank, IDB and Government reached agreement on a harmonized Request for Proposals package in
October 2005. Discussions were initiated in October towards a similar agreement on a harmonized ICB
Goods bidding documents. The Bank has completed two sector studies: one at the federal level and
another one at the state level inorder to determine the acceptability o f the country systems inprocurement
and other fiduciary areas, and to monitor and evaluate government procurement performance at the state
level. The findings o f the studies continue demonstrating that Mexico has robust procurement procedures.

Given the nature o f this Program, most o f the procurement actions are made by eligible schools with the
supervision o f the PEC Coordinaciones Estatales which receive transfers from the Federal Government
through the states' PEC trust funds (FEECs). The procurement actions at this level include small works,
goods and training for the teaching staff. Each school shall include these actions in an Annual Work
Program. The methods to be used for the procurement o f goods and services under the loan are described
below with the estimated amounts, and summarized in Table A. Table B suggests thresholds to be used
inthe ProcurementPlanandthe Operations Manualfor the various procurementmethods.


ProcurementofWorks

Small works will be procured by schools under Category 1 "School Grants." These works include
construction and improvement o f learning and sanitary facilities, minor repairs, and maintenance works. It
i s estimated that the resources allocated for works under each school will not exceed the equivalent o f

US$3,000-4,000 per year. These works will be generally procured through shopping or price quotations
from local contractors through shopping, price quotations or direct contracting from local contractors.

Procurement of Goods andNon-ConsultingServices

Sundry goods and small value items, including didactic materials and furniture will be procured by the
schools.under Component 1. These items will be generally procured through shopping, price quotations
or direct contracting from local suppliers. Goods and Non-Consulting Services under Component 2 and 3
are not expected to be financed with Loan funds.


Employment of Consultants

Consultant services would be procured in accordance with "Guidelinesfor the Use of consultants by the
WorldBank Borrowers and the Bank as Executing Agency publishedinM a y 2004 and the agreements in
                                                             "
the procurement plan. Consultants services will be contracted under this Program include audits, and
advisory services infinancial, institutional, legal and information technology support and development, as
well as technical consultant services for policy studies and Program evaluation.         The short list of
consultants, estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equivalent per contract, may comprise entirely
national consultants, inaccordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines.

        Firms: All contracts for firms would be procured using QCBS procedures except for small
contracts for assignments of standard or routine nature and estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO
equivalent that would be procured using Least Cost Selection or using other procurement methods as
defined inthe annual procurement plan review.

        Individuals: Specialized advisory services would be provided by individual consultants selected
through comparison of qualifications of at least three qualified candidates. They would be contracted in
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 5.1-5.3 o f the Consultant Guidelines as defined in the
annual procurement planreview.

        Prior Review Thresholds: The prior review o f procurement actions will be defined in the
annual procurement review and will not exceed the thresholds determined by the procurement capacity
assessment o f SEP and a sample o f three states as summarized in Table B and will be further defined in
the Procurement Plan.

        OperationalCosts:Not expected to be financed under the loan.

ProcurementCapacity Assessment

        The Bank carried out a procurement capacity assessment o f SEP and o f a sample o f three states
participating in the Program. As a result o f the capacity assessment, the Bank defined the procurement
implementation as high risk due to the following reasons: (a) staff at the PEC unit i s rather unfamiliar
with Bank's lending and procurement planning or supervision; (b) the web based information system of
PEC was under construction at the time o f the assessment; (c) procurement implementation involves
several layers o f management and supervision that are not integrated; (d) at the school level there are
several thousands units carrying out procurement actions; and (e) for expenditures under Component 1,
which i s the largest, there would be no prior review by the Bank. The procurement implementing
capacity at the school level is minimal but it should be enough as the procurement under the Program i s
not complex. The highrisk on procurement will be mitigated with: (a) the detailed drafting o f rules and
regulations o f the Program through a well disseminated Operations Manual; (b) a robust information



                                                      47

system that should include details on the procurement actions; and (c) periodic and specialized
procurement reviews by independent procurement reviewers visiting the schools and reporting on
compliance of the procurement regulations. In 2007 the Bank will review this risk assessment and will
adjust it if warranted. The SEP shall establish a supervision unit or hire independent reviewers to report
periodically on the procurement procedures carried out at the school level to ensure the adequate use of
the funds.

The Plan covering the first 18 months o f project implementation starting January 1, 2006, was prepared
by SEP. With respect to Component 1, this Plan shows the total amount that is expectedto be transferred
fkom the national trust fund (FNEC) to the state trust funds (FEECs) to finance school grants. This Plan
shall be approved by the Bank prior to Negotiations. Subsequently, when school grants have actually
been distributed, the Plan will be updated to reflect, among other things, the use o f grant funds by the
participating schools which i s reportedby the schools as part o f their Annual Work Program (PAT) that i s
presentedto the PEC State Coordinating Units(Coordination Estatal).

         ProcurementMonitoring

In addition to the prior review and ex-post supervision to be carried out by the Bank, the capacity
assessment has recommended: (a) two full supervision missions per year; (b) supervision by SEP
procurement staff; and (c) annual external review by an independent agent with the objective not only to
review compliance with procurement norms at state level but also to advice SEP and the state education
authorities (AEEs) on how to strengthen technical assistance to the schools in the area o f procurement.
Based on the overall highrisk assessment, the post-review field analysis should cover a sample o f not less
than 1in 5 contracts signed as well as direct supervision in at least 6 states per year. The SEP shall report
bi-annually the procurement audits carried out by their supervision unit or by independent auditors
specialized inprocurement usingterms o freference acceptable to the Bank.

                          MEXICO: School-BasedManagementProgram

Summary

This Annex provides information on the returns to basic education and the returns to quality o f education
inMexico. These results give clear evidence that completing basic education is an attractive investment
option for Mexican students. In addition, the economic feasibility o f the project i s analyzed,
distinguishing,on the benefits side, "school" and "out-of-school" benefits generated by the project. The
most important among the school benefits are: (a) improvements incommunity participation measuredby
the amount o f funds contributed by the school community to the Program; and (b) efficiency gains or
savings that accrue to the education system as a result o f lower repetition and dropout rates producedby
the Program. On the cost side, the analysis notes that the PEC Program i s becoming more cost-effective
because unit costs per student are decreasing while the financial contributions from the school community
are increasing.


1.EconomicRationalefor Supporting aBasicEducationProgram

The schooling attainment o f the population i s a goal that stands on its own merits for a variety o f reasons.
Notably, empirical evidence has shown that education i s one o f the main determinants o f economic
growth. Moreover, the importance o f schooling i s reflected inthe creation o f externalities arising from a
more literate work-force, a more intense sharing o f ideas whose value are not captured by the originator,
and a better functioning civil society.

InMexico, investing in education has an average return of 13 percent per additional year of schooling.
However, the economic literature has not only been studying the average returns to schooling, but has
also focused on examining if the observed returns to additional years o f schooling change depending on
the level o f funding that schools receive. In other words, the question posed is whether an increase in
resources per pupil would make as attractive an investment as requiring students to attend one additional
year o f schooling.

Rateof Returnto Schooling

The strong and positive linkbetween years o f schooling and earnings o f students once they enter the labor
marketis well supported by the empirical evidence inMexico. Based on the latest information available,
the private rate o f return per additional year o f education i s approximately 13 percent.2 This estimate
indicates that for each additional year o f education the expected individual income will increase by 13
percent.

Extendingthe analysis to consider the returns by level o f education over time, we found that completing
primary education has a rate o f return that decreased from 17 percent in 1992 to 14 percent in 2002. For
completed lower secondary education, the rate o f return has decreased from 15 percent in 1992 to 12
percent in,2002. Notwithstanding the observed decrease in the rates of retum to primary and lower
secondary education, these rates repain high enough and are attractive as an investment opportunity for
Mexican students (see Figure 1).

Additionally, there i s significant evidence that shows a positive impact o f education on the distribution o f
income. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the highest returns to education accrue to people at the
bottom of the wage distribution. Therefore, education appears to compensate for lack of skills and i s a
good investment for increasing labor force productivity (see Figure 2, Patrinos and Metzger 2004;
Zamudio 2001)  .

Returns to Quality

At the aggregate cross-country level, there is evidence that educational quality has a consistent, stable and
strong influence o n economic growth. For example, using TIMSS data at the aggregate cross-country
level, Hanushek and Kimko (2000) analyze the quality o f the labor force as measured by comparative
tests o f mathematics and scientific skills.             The estimated impact o f educational quality on growth
indicated that a one standard deviation improvement in mathematics and science skills translates into
more than a one percentage point increase in average annual real growth. Also, Barro (2001) has analyzed
the impact o f quality o f education on growth and found that science scores have a statistically significant
positive effect on growth. The implication i s that a one-standard-deviation increase in scores i s associated
with a growth rate o f 1percent a year.

Inthe United States, school quality - measured by, among other factors, the pupil-teacher ratio - has a
positive but small effect on the rate o f return to education. A decrease in the pupil-teacher ratio from 30
to 25, for example, i s associated with a 0.4 percentage point increase in the rate o f return to education
(Card and Krueger 1992).

In Mexico, preliminary findings show that those educated in states with higher quality schools, as
measured by variables such as teacher-student ratios, teachers' schooling and test scores, have an impact
on earnings. Controlling these variables for indigenous and community schools shows a negative impact
on earnings for these populations. Thus, there i s evidence that the quality o f education increases the
returns to education in Mexico (Garcia, Knaul and Patrinos 2005). More specifically, a decrease in the
pupilheacher ratio from 40 to 30, for example, i s associated with a 0.1 percentage point increase in the
rate o f return to education. There i s also a small variation in the rate o f return to education across
individuals born in different states qnd different times; and this variation i s associated with differences in
the quality o f schooling (Card and Krueger 1992). Test scores are shown to have less impact, but an
increase in 1 point on the average score increases earnings by 0.04 percent. Teachers' schooling has a
positive impact on earnings; ifaverage teacher schooling were to increase by one whole year, then
earnings would increase by 9 percent.                Conversely, the percentage o f teachers that has only basic
education has a negative impact on earnings, causing a 1 percent decrease in earnings. Thus, there i s
some evidence that the quality o f education increases the returns to education in Mexico, although the
impact i s lower than that found inthe United States (Garcia, h a u l and Patrinos 2005).

2. Aspects that Define the Quality of Education'

There are many things that need to be done to improve the quality o f education delivered by Mexican
schools, considering the poor results obtained by Mexican students in the OECD's first Programme for
International Student Assessment4 (PISA) in 2000. Students from Mexico and from other Latin American
countries were among the worst performers in this test.                      Although Mexican students, on average,
outperform students from other Latin American countries in Spanish and science, and come second after
Argentina in math, much more improvem5nt i s needed for them to reach the performance level o f the
other OECD countries that participate in PISA. Also noticeable i s that fact that the performance o f
Mexican students has not significantly improved over time, as can be seen by comparing the test results
from PISA 2000 with those from PISA 2003. Inboth tests Mexican students scored poorly; in fact, their



 This section reviews the main results o f the programmatic sector work on the Quality o f Education in Mexico that i s presented
in "Determinants of Learning Policy Note." World Bank, 2005. This report analyzes the determinants of learning using
international and national assessments, as well as new research on the returns to quality o f education.
 PISA provides a measure of reading, mathematics y d science achievement for a nationally representative sample, comparable
across countiies. PISA's assessments focus on young people's ability to apply their knowledge and skills to real-life problems
and situations, rather than on how much curriculum-based knowledge they possess.


                                                               52

performance declined in all three subjects, though this may be associated with the fact that enrollments
increasedduringthe same period o ftime by about 5 percentage points.

Recent empirical research (World Bank 2005) has shown that the quality o f education can be improved
through changes in school management and involvement o f the community in school decision-malung. In
particular, it was found that increased autonomy, accountability and assessment are the three most
important changes that are associated with improved quality o f education and better learning outcomes.
For example, more autonomous schools can implement appropriate pedagogical practices to teach
language and are in a better position to fulfillingthe national guidelines for indigenous students. A more
accountable school system will encourage more active participation by parents and others, and that i s
important for improving learning outcomes. Finally, a system that i s based on constant assessment and
participation in international benchmarking exercises will tend to improve education outcomes and cost-
effectiveness.

Increased autonomy may give schools the flexibility they need to empower teachers and parents, thus
improving the relationships between students and teachers. The results o f PISA 2003 suggest that both
students and schools perform best in "a climate characterized by high expectations that are supported
through strong teacher-student relations, students who are ready to invest effort and who show interest
and lower levels o f anxiety with mathematics, and a positive disciplinary climate" (OECD 2004). Inmost
countries that performed well in PISA, local authorities and schools also have substantial responsibility
for educational content and/or the use o f school resources, and many are able to take the initiative to
adjust Programs to better teach heterogeneous groups o f learners.

Results from the analysis of results o f the Mexican National Assessments and PISA 2003 showed that
factors such as teacher morale, teacher-student relations, teacher behavior, school climate, teacher
expectations o f student performance, student's awareness o f value o f school for future earnings, and
active leamindteachingpractices are all associated with better learning outcomes.

A multivariate analysis was carried out in Mexico, using the National Assessments (Estdndares
Nacionales) and controlling for many factors that could be measured and that theoretically could have a
simultaneous effect on academic performance-such         as characteristics o f the students and their family
and school characteristics. A key r.esult o f this analysis was that pedagogical practices have a small but
significant effect on student achievements in Math and Spanish; for example, one percentage point
increase in the index measuring pedagogical practices increases by 0.06 standard deviations the Spanish
score for boys. This finding suggests that there i s an opportunity to improve the quality o f Mexican basic
education through training teachers in active pedagogic techniques that expose students to certain
teaching methods such as problem solving and critical thinking.

Moreover, the analysis o f PISA 2003 shows that some characteristics o f teachers are associated with
higher student performance.      ThFse characteristics include teacher morale, behavior, attitude, and
qualifications.   High teacher morale, as perceived by the school principal, is associated with better
performance.    The results confirm the substantial evidence indicating that teacher quality i s highly
correlated with student test scores (Rockoff 2004; Murnane 1975; Armor and others 1976). In schools
where teachers work with enthusiasm, student Math and Spanish scores tend to be higher. Likewise,
when teachers take pride in their work and their students, the students in that school perform better.
When teachers value academic achievement, students significantly perform better in Math and Spanish.
Moreover, teacher morale is more important for low and middle achievers in Spanish and math, and for
middle achievers inscience (Figure 3).

Teacher behavior and teacher-related factors affecting school climate are associatedwith student learning
performance. In schools where teachers have high expectations, students are observed to perform better.
When principals feel that there is a strong relationship between students and teachers, students perform
better. Conversely, in schools where teachers have high levels of absenteeismand do not encourage their
studentsto achieve their full potential, studentsperformworse, especially inmathematics and Spanish.


3. Cost-Benefit Analysis

PEC aims to improve school-bas%dmanagement (SBM) as an enabling condition for improving the
quality of basic education. To this end, the Program gives a small financial incentiveto the school (School
Grant) as a mechanism to facilitate school change and empowerment.

The benefits o f this project can be of two types: "school" and "out-of-school" benefits. Because of the
nature and objectives o f the project, "school" benefits prevail and are easily identifiable, but are mainly
qualitative and measurable in non-monetary terms. Examples of this type of benefits in SBM projects
include: higher parental and community participation, increased school autonomy and accountability, and
improved school climate. On the other hand, international evidence on impacts o f SBM on student
performance i s scarce, and there are few such evaluations that utilize rigorous methodological standards.
For the most part, research results indicate that there i s little direct impact of SBM on student learning
achievement, and that education outcomes usually change slowly in response to any kind of educational
interventi~n.~ the particular case o f PEC, there is presently a lack of appropriate data with which to
                In
measure rigorously the impact of the Program on student learning achievement.

Among the "out-of-school" benefits of SBM, the most important are relatedto productivity improvements
of the beneficiary students once they enter the labor market. A good estimation of the out-of school net
benefit i s the rate of returnto schooling (social and private), as shown in section 1 above, which presents

the latest available estimates o f private rates o freturn to education inMexico by level o f schooling. Social
rates o f return are discussed below.

The following sections o f this analysis focus on the "school" benefits o f PEC, using the available
information providedby quantitative and qualitative evaluations o f the Program.

Savings to the Education System

The results o f the last qualitative evaluation o f PEC show the following impacts observed during the
2001-2004 period: (a) the perception o f school staff and community members o f pedagogical practices
used in the school improved by 21 percent; (b) the perception of school staff and community members o f
school management practices improved by 3.3 percent; and (c) there was a modest but significant
improvement in student scores in math (1 percent) and Spanish (0.5 percent) among third grade students
ina sample o fPEC schools.6

Also, preliminary results on the impact evaluation carried out by the World Bank' find that on average
PEC decreases primary school drop-out and repetition rates by 0.05 and 3.7 percent a year-as              measured
by comparing PEC schools with comparable non-PEC schools. This finding suggests that PEC improves
the quality o f teaching and school conditions leading to better learning outcomes, thereby reducing
repetition and dropout rates.

The repetitionrate gives an estimate o f the number o f students that take longer than normal to complete a
cycle o f education. The students lose time and the education system incurs higher costs because repeaters
take up space that schools could use for others. In this context, a project that reduces repetition rates will
produce savings inrecurrent costs for the education system. Inother words, the estimated project impacts
on lowering repetition and dropout rates can be used to estimate efficiency gains for the education system
as a whole.

Table 1below presents yearly estimated savings for the education system that are expected duringphase I
o f the proposedAPL. The main assumption o f these calculations i s that PEC will not be expanded during
phase Iand will be supporting approximately 20,000 basic education schools per year with a total o f 4.9
million students. Among the participating schools, 52 percent are estimated to be primary schools
enrolling approximately 3.2 million students. The result o f this simple calculation indicates that the
savings for the education system are considerable, reaching nearly US$1million per year due to a lower
repetitionrate, by 4 percent, plus US$1.23 million per year due to a lower dropout rate. Allowing for the
9 year life o f the project, the estimated savings for the education system in present value are
approximately US$5.5 million due 10 lower repetitionrate and US$7.1 due to a lower dropout rate'.

costs

Given that PEC will not be expanded during the three years of the first phase o f the proposed APL, we
can assume that project cost per year will be approximately equal to the PEC budget for the 2004-2005
year. During this period the number of beneficiary schools was 21,312 schools with nearly 196,000
principals and teachers, and a total enrollment of 4.9 million students.

Table 2 below shows total PEC costs per year for 2001-2005, including federal, state and local program
funding. For this reason, the 2005 and 2006 figures are significantly higher than project costs per year
shown inAnnex 5.9 Table 2 also shows the relative share of federal, state and local sources of funds for
the Program, and these figures clearly indicate that PEC i s able to attract an important share of financial
support from states, municipalities and from the private sector. On average, the states have been financing
a 20 percent share of total PEC cost, but their contribution has increased substantially inmonetary terms
due to the fact that the Programhasexpandedbymore than 200 percent since its creationin2001.lo

 The cost figures used in this Annex do not match project costs in Annex 5. That i s because the present cost- benefit analysis
computes program costs taking into account all sources o f funds (federal, state and local), while Annex 5 considers only the
federal share o fprogram financing. For details on the project costs see Annex 5
loDuring the period 2001-2004 the accumulated inflation was 20.3 percent. Therefore the program growth inreal terms has been

constitutes an important factor inensuring longterm project sustainability.

ProjectEconomic Feasibility

Because there i s no accurate estimate o f the total number o f beneficiaries o f the project (see benefits
section above), economic feasibility analyses using Net Present Value or Internal Rate o f Return criteria
would not be appropriate.

Project unit costs per student and per school are shown inTable 3. These figures show that unit costs per
student financed by federal sources show a declining trend over time. This trend indicates that PEC i s
becoming more cost-effective as the amount o f federal funding per student i s decreasing while funding
from public and private local school community sources i s increasing.

The central objectives o f PEC focus on improving community participation, accountability and autonomy
in school decision-making. So, one indicator that indirectly measures the degree of community
involvement i s the growth in the local share o f Program financing contributed by municipalities and the
private sector. As shown inTable 2, the shdre o f Program funds from local communities has increased by
4.7 percentage points over a period o f three years (2001-2004). At the same time, the Program i s
becoming more cost-effective because unit cost per student paid with federal funds decreased and state
funding has remained relatively stable, while fimding from community sources have steadily increased
(see Table 3). Although we lack comparative information and thus cannot say that PEC i s more cost-
effective than other programs aimed to increase community participation at the school level in Mexico,
we can reliably affirm that the cost effectiveness o f the Program i s increasing over time.

The efficiency gains accruing to the education system as a result o f PEC constitute another aspect o f the
economic feasibility of the Program. As shown inTable 1, the project i s expected to generate savings that
amount to more than U S 2 million per year as a result o f the estimated Program impacts on repetition and
dropout rates at participating primary schools.

Finally, the most important out-of school benefits o f this project are the developmental impacts for the
country, such as building human capital and improvements in labor productivity. So, the profitability o f
the investment on basic education from the social point o f view can be estimated through the social rate o f
return. Latest estimate o f the social rate o f return o f completing basic education inMexico i s 10 percent."

  Estimatesbased on ENE 2003 third quaqer (EncuestaNacional de Empleo 2003-INEGZ).This estimateis for basic education,
which includes primary and lower-secondary levels, and considers annual net earnings; 3 years of opportunity cost in primary

This lower-bound estimate shows that once one considers the degree of public subsidization, basic
education has a substantial return for the whole society. Therefore, since PEC does not increase
substantially the unit cost per student, then this intervention has a net benefit in the long run that i s
economically justified.

4. FiscalAnalysis and Sustainability

PEC was created by the present Federal Administration (2000-2006) and it i s one o f the strategies chosen
by SEP to improve the quality o f education. Even though SEP allocates more than half o f its strategic
basic education programs budget to finance PEC, the share o f the Program inthe public education budget
i s relatively low.

Furthermore, PEC was created to fulfill the lack o f spending on non-salary items in basic education
schools. Particularly, under the actual decentralized financing scheme, state participation in basic
education i s largely focused on the provision o f the main inputsto the education process; that is, the state
governments cover the payment o f salaries o f the teaching and maintenance staff and some o f the basic
operating cost (such as water and electricity bills), acquire and distribute basic education materials, and
carry out major investments ininfrastructure. Normally, no cash allocations are made from the federal or
state government to schools for smaller petty cash expenditures required in the day-to-day operation o f a
school or pay for local, school-based initiatives. Schools are allowed, however, to raise contributions
from parents and other interested parties (including municipal governments) and employ the funds for the
operation, maintenance and improvement o f the school facilities or the acquisition o f additional education
material. (See Annex 15 for a detailed description on the financing and provision o f basic education in
Mexico)

International comparisons show that most o f the education spending in Mexico i s tied up in current
spending with less than 2.8 percent o f basic education expenditure for capital spending, compared to an
average o f 8.4 percent in OECD countries.                Moreover, most o f the current spending goes to the
compensation of staff, leaving at the primary level only 6.4 percent for other current expenditure, such as
instructional materials, compared to an OECD average o f 19.3 percent (OECD 2004b).


PECinthe EducationSystem

Although PEC covers 10.2 percent o f all public basic education schools in the country, its total cost
(including federal, states and private sector contributions) represents only a 0.47 percent o f the total
public education spending and only 0.88 percent o f the federal resources devoted to basic education.
These numbers indicates that PEC does not have a significant fiscal impact on public finances (see Table
4). It should be noted that federal resources financing PEC originate from Ramo II which i s usually a
 source o f hnds for federal programs.            I

Complementarities between the PEC and the PAREIBprograms

PEC i s one o f the priorities o f the present federal Administration. It received 51percent o f its resources
allocated by SEP to the Subsecretaria de Educacidn Busica (SEB)"                        in 2005. This national Program
focuses on empowering schools to adopt participatory decision making through a S B M model and
currently gives priority to disadvantaged urban schools. Over the long run, however, the S B M model i s
expectedbecome a national policy that i s applied to allbasic education schools.

PARED (Programa para Abatir el Rezago Educativo en la Educacidn Inicial y Bdsica) i s a federal
education compensatory program supported by the World Bank and implementedby CONAFE. Its main
objective i s to provide additional support to the most disadvantaged schools, particularly in rural and
indigenous communities, through the provision o f extra resources and inputs to these schools, fulfilling
the minimumrequirements for the adequate delivery o f basic education services. Support for community
participation inschool management i s part of the PARED program, but the bulk o f programresources are
used to finance compensatory inputs. So, the overlapping between the two interventions i s low. Rather,
the two programs are complementary in so far as PEC gives priority to disadvantaged urban schools,
while P A R E D serves primarilypoor rural and indigenous school^.'^

Project Sustainability

Sustainability i s crucial to maintain Program benefits over the long-run after the period of project
implementation. Among the most important factors that determine PEC sustainability are: (a) the
sustained and increasingly larger financial support from the states; (b) the increasing financial support
provided by local school communities; (c) the widespread recognition among the public o f the importance
o f the SBM for improving the quality o f education; and (d) the fact that the Program finances relatively
small school grants that do not represent a fiscal burden, but nevertheless are effective incentives for the
transformation o f school management practices.

Statesupportfor PEC                                 1



PEC financing mechanism gives the right incentives to states, municipalities and the private sector to
participate in Program funding. As shown in Table 2, the states have been steadily supporting Program
financing with increased amounts over the last five years. This behavior might be the result o f the
economic incentive provided by PEC, where each state peso i s matched by three pesos from the federal
government. Inthe case o f local contributions from municipalities and the private sector, the economic
incentive i s a one-to-one match from federal and state sources, up to 50,000 Mexican pesos per year.

The active participation o f the states in the Program can be seen in Figure 4 below, which shows federal
and state funds contributed to the Program as a percentage o f the minimumexpected financial resources
that are established in the Program Operating Rules. In2003 and 2004, the states contributed more funds
than mandated inthe rules; that is, 8 and 15 percent more than expected.

School Grants
                                        L

The magnitude o f the school grant i s not the main element o f the Program. Instead, school grants are only
the mechanism through which PEC i s supporting the adoption o f the S B M model in the participating
schools. In fact, over time PEC has lowered the average grant amount through changes in the Program
Program Operating Rules. In real terms, amount o f the basic school grant decreased by 40 percent
between 2001 and 2003 and, in2004 the community contribution matching grant decreased from two-to-
one matching ratio to one-to-one ratio.

It is also important to point out that the PEC financial support to schools is not permanent. The school
grant can be awarded for a maximum period o f five years. After the five year cycle, schools graduate
from the Program. An exception to this rule i s being considered in the proposed APL, where graduated
schools located in poor urban areas can apply for a community contribution matching grant even though
they no longer receive the basic PEC grant, provided they continue to meet the Programrequirements.

The use o f PEC grants by the schools has changed over time. While the majority o f expenditures financed
by the grant pertain to infrastructure (comprising construction and equipment), the analysis o f grant use
over time clearly shows that the infrastructure categories have decreased, and the participation o f
expenditures for pedagogical enhancement and teacher training have become more important.

Community Participation

According to the General Education Law (Ley General de Educacidn-LGE),              state government should
promote the direct participation o f municipal government to provide maintenance and basic equipment to
public schools. Municipal governments obtain their revenue largely from local taxes (property taxes) and
fees, tax share revenue (slightly over 20 percent o f the federal tax share revenue to states has to be passed
on to municipalities) and federal government transfers. Estimated data on the contribution o f municipal
government to education suggest that less than MXN 1billion pesos, or on average less than 1percent o f
municipal resources, are allocated to support education.
However, as shown in Table 2, the municipalities, parents and the private sector entities are recognizing
the importance o f the Program and have increased their financial participation to PEC schools by almost 5
percentage points from 2001 to 2004.

Figure 7 shows the average financial contribution per school from municipalities, parents and other
sources, according to the socioeconomic level o f the school community (measured by the
"marginalization index").    As expected, there i s a strong and positive relationship between the
socioeconomic level o f the school community and the average amount o f the contribution that schools
receive from parents. However, in the case of the municipalities, contributions are targeting relatively
well since on average municipalities make larger contributions to more disadvantaged schools than to
schools located in higher income areas. With respect to other local sources o f financing, such as private
firms, NGOs, etc., there i s no evident association between the amount contributed and the socioeconomic
level of the school community. Ingeneral, these data support the hypothesis that the adoption o f an SBM
model helps schools raise funds from different community sources, independently o f the socioeconomic
level o f the neighborhood where the school i s located. Nonetheless, this i s a preliminary conclusion that
can only be rigorously confirmed with more accurate information.

                           MEXICO: School-BasedManagementProgram

The GOM carried out a social assessment as part o f project preparation with the objective o f better
understanding the characteristics o f the population involved in the Program and identifying the potential
social impact o f the PEC on their lives. The study consisted o f a stakeholder analysis focused on the
following dimensions: (i)   characterization o f current and potential beneficiaries o f the Program; (ii)
                                                                                                         actual
experiences o f the beneficiaries and o f other social actors involved inthe Program; (iii)   expectations held
by the relevant stakeholders; (iv) levels o f social capital and potential for participation; and (v) impact o f
the Program on the lives o fthe participants.

Methodology

The PEC team at SEP directed the study in close coordination with technical Bank staff. The study was
based on existing Program evaluations carried out during the last four. These were complemented by a
series o f interviews with Program coordinators at the state level and by a sample survey o f school
directors conducted by the study team. Since the beneficiary population for phase Io f the proposed APL
i s expected to be similar to the current Program population, the findings from this study can be
generalized for phase I.

Inphase I1the Program is expectedto be expanded to include beneficiaries with different characteristics
and therefore a second social assessment study would be required to expand the present analysis. This
study is planned for the end o f the first 3-year phase and will focus on updating the social analysis and
completing it with information on the additional populations that are expected to participate in the
Program as a result o f its expansion.

Besides interviews with Program staff and the survey o f school principals, the present analysis i s based on
the following studies: (i)a series of Program evaluations conducted by Heuristica Educativa; (ii)
evaluations conducted by CIDE on a yearly basis; (iii)    analytical work conducted by the National Institute
for EducationEvaluation (INEE); and (iv) complementary analyses by the PECteam.

Main Findings

First, the stakeholder analysis found that there is strong and widespread support for the Program. At the
same time, there are potential risks associated with Program expansion, particularly with respect to the
position o f the teachers' union and the media that seem to be indifferent today but could turn negative
when Program coverage i s expandep.

Second, more than half (55%) o f the schools enrolled in the Program are located in small towns o f less
than 15,000 people; and another 15% are located in medium-sized cities o f less than 100,000 inhabitants.
This points out to the highpotential for community participation and oversight, which usually i s stronger
in smaller localities. However, it also points out a need to strengthen the capacity of local actors to
participate and empower them to monitor school operations and the use o f the PEC funds.

Third, only a few PEC schools (4.5%) are locatedinurban areas classifiedas highlymarginal. Thisposes
 a challenge in terms o f the poverty .impact o f the Program and suggests a need for strategies to encourage
more of these schools to apply to the Program. These strategies must take into account that capacity for
 effective participation may be considerably lower in schools serving highly marginal urban
neighborhoods, as the level o f education o f parents tends to be lower (a proxy used inthe study for family
 income). Conversely, the majority o f the students who benefit from PEC today have more educated



                                                       64

parents, which shows that the Program i s not reaching the most excluded populations. Since enrollment in
the Program i s voluntary, schools 'with higher human and social capital may be in a better position to
participate inthe Program. Therefore, a compensatory promotion strategy i s called for.

Fourth, the new the definition o f the target population based on the urban marginality index developed by
CONAPO applied to Basic Geo-Statistical Area (Area Geo-Estatistica Bhsica-AGEB)               i s expected to
increase the likelihood o f participation in the Program for schools serving poor students who are at a
disadvantage compared to the current beneficiaries. However, this outcome will depend largely on how
systematically the poverty priority criteria are in fact implementedat state level (see Annex 13).

Fifth, public knowledge about the Programhas decreased since its creation. The study clearly shows that
members o f the school community as well as teachers and school principals have less knowledge about
the Program today than in previous years-reflecting        the high turnover among the school staff and a
declining emphasis on promoting the Program at the local level. Today, those who know about the
Program mainly learned o f it through school authorities and teachers, and in general there i s little
opportunity for community pressure when principals and teachers do not communicate the existence o f
the Program. Improvingcommunications (i.e. having "complete" information about the Program) i s the
second most important priority for parents and teachers, who rank that just below the timely delivery o f
grant funds as the main aspect which needs improvement inthe Program.

Sixth, the level o f community participation in the Program i s significant but could be strengthened. In
most cases, it i s the school principal and the teachers who decide to apply to enter the Program. The
available data show that in only 12% o f the cases parents and members o f the school community
participated in this decision. On the other hand, community participation focus on the School Strategic
Transformation Plantends to be stronger at the beginningbut declines insubsequent years over the life o f
the project. Participation i s estimated to decline by 33% from the first to the fourth year o f project
implementation. Moreover, througqout the implementation period, the level o f participationby principals
and teachers tends to be 50% higher than that o f students and their parents.

Finally, the expectations with respect to the Program differ between members o f the school community
and school principals. Almost half (49%) o f the school council members expect the Program to improve
education quality, while only 3.9% o f the principals hold such expectation. A large number o f principals
(34.8%) expect the Program to simplify administrative procedures-a       goal that i s not even mentioned by
community members.

Recommendations                      r


Based on the findings described above, there are a number o f recommendations that may increase the
chances for Programsuccess.

First, since the Program has many benefits to show, it would be important to proactively engage the
media during its implementation and later expansion, possibly by increasing Program investments in
information dissemination. Although today the media seem to be indifferent to the Program, it remains a
strategic ally when the Program seeks public support for expansion and may help overcome potential
resistance from the teacher's union.:

 Second, one o f the Program's main pillars i s community participation in the definition o f priorities and
the preparation o f the School Strategic Transformation Plan proposal and in monitoring the use o f grant
funds. However, community actors do not always have the capacity or the willingness to participate
effectively, especially if parents perceive that their kids may be punished at school. Because the
distribution of power at the community level may be very asymmetric, special interventions (e.g. training,


                                                       65

        . .


workshops, use o f confidential means for complain, etc) should be considered as strategies to strengthen
participation. This i s particularly important since the Program i s expected to expand coverage in highly
marginal urban areas where the levels o f social capital (accompanied by human capital accumulated by
the family) may be lower than where the Program operates now. Successful strategies must also allocate
resources and time for participation, considering that as many as 38% o f the principals said they would
needmore time for the implementation o f effective participation strategies.

Third, schools apply voluntarily to participate inthe Programand only 4.5% o fthemare located inhighly
marginal urban areas. This suggests a need for the Program to develop additional recruitment strategies to
encourage participation by schools serving the poorest communities. Examples o f such strategies are
targeted communication campaigns and priority criteria for school selection that favor the poor.

Fourth, there i s a need for communication campaigns that are tailored to particular audiences. Although
regular mass media campaigns should be continued, other channels o f communication need to be
explored, such as community radios and non-conventional media like Community Theater and
"perifoneo,'' already used in Mexican communities. Since participation in the Program i s voluntary, an
effective communication strategy i s central to the success o f the Program as school communities need to
h o w that the Program exists in order to apply.

Finally, expectations about the Program should be shared among the different stakeholders who are part
o f the school community. Efforts towards this goal would help align expectations to reality and coordinate
efforts for the achievement o f common goals. As a result, the chances o f frustration would decline and
the riskthat unrealistic expectations became a barrier for participation would also be lower.

Introduction

One o f the most important features o f the Prograrna Escuelas de Calidad(PEC) i s that it establishes the
basic conditions for the active participation by the school community in the school. Also noteworthy i s
the fact that, since its creation, the PEC has reached some indigenous schools located in disadvantaged
urban areas and rural communities. Including indigenous schools has enhanced and enriched the Program
but, at the same time, it has created new challenges. For PEC to properly serve these schools it has to
focus special attention on the characteristics o f indigenous students and indigenous communities. To
address this issue, SEP has prepared an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) with the aim to
strengthen the strategy usedby PEC to reach indigenous schools.

The analysis, upon which the IPDP i s based, starts with a description o f the main characteristics o f the
Mexican indigenous population and the legal framework that informs policy towards indigenous peoples.
This is followed by a summary o f the critical education challenges facing indigenous students, and the
obstacles that curtail access to quality education for indigenous students. The analysis then focuses on the
participation o f indigenous students in the PEC Program, and on the findings from consultations with
indigenous peoples. Based on this information, the plan indicates the benefits from the Program accruing
to indigenous students, the actions to enhance these benefits, and the timeframe for implementation o f the
recommendedactions duringphase Io f the proposed APL.

IndigenousPopulation

The National Population Council (Consejo Nacional de Poblaci6n-CONAPO)            estimates the indigenous
population o f Mexico-defined as either a speaker o f an indigenous language, or belonging to an
indigenous ethic group-to      be 12.7 million. This figure approximates other estimates o f the indigenous
population based on different social, cultural and demographic indicators.         Approximately 10% o f
Mexico's population lives in a household where the head speaks an indigenous language, and 7.3 million
indigenous language speakers fall into one o f 62 indigenous language groups. The states o f Oaxaca,
Chiapas, Veracruz, Puebla, and Yucathn account for over 60 percent o f indigenous language speakers.
Numerically, the most important ethnic groups are the Nhhuatl, Maya, Mixteco, Zapoteco, Otomi, and
Tzotzil. Many indigenous communities are rural and poor-over 80% o f indigenous people live in a
locality o f less than 500 people, and the settlements with the highest concentration o f indigenous
population have an illiteracy rate o f47% or nearly four times the national average o f 12.4% (IN12002).

There i s a high incidence o f poverty among indigenous peoples. In2002, for example, an individual that
lived in a municipality where 10 to 40 percent o f the population i s indigenous had an average income
equivalent to 46 percent o f the income o f a person living in a non-indigenous municipality (Ramirez
2005).    Similarly, an individual, in a predominantly indigenous municipality (above 40 percent
indigenous) had an income equivalent to only 26 percent o f the income o f a person in a non-indigenous
municipality. Even with similar education levels, indigenous people have a much higher probability o f
being poor than do non-indigenous people. The indigenous population with no education i s more than
twice as likely to be extremely poor than the non-indigenous population without education.              The
education gap, rather than narrowing with increased education, grows as higher education levels are
attained. For individuals with incomplete secondary schooling, the probability o f being extremely poor i s
five times larger if you are indigenous than if you are not, and almost ten times higher if you have
completed secondary education (see Table 1).

Access to public services and assets i s limited in most municipalities with high concentration o f
indigenous population. Overall, the living conditions o f Mexico's indigenous population are below those
o f non-indigenous people. One o f the main reasons for this i s lack o f education. Improving access to all
levels o f education would therefore increasethe welfare o f the indigenous population.

LegalFramework

Awareness o f the multicultural nature o f Mexico has increased since the late 1970s. The Mexican
Constitution has been modified several times inthe recent past inorder to expand and clarify the rights o f
indigenous peoples.      The 1992 Constitution recognizes that Mexico population i s multicultural in
composition due to its indigenous origins. It affirms as a duty o f the law to promote the development o f
indigenous languages, culture, customs, resources, and social organization, and to generally guarantee to
indigenous peoples full access to statesjurisdiction. Several states o f Mexico have legally recognizedthe
obligation to offer bilingual-multicultural education to indigenous students.

The third and fourth sections o f article 7 o f the General Law on Education establishes that all institutions
that offer education shall: (i)strengthen sovereignty and national awareness, and the knowledge o f
history, patriotic symbols and national institutions, and the cultural traditions and particularities of all
national regions, and (ii)  promote, through the Spanish language, a common language for all Mexicans
while protectingand promoting the development o f indigenous languages.

Insummary, Mexican legislationoneducation recognizes the rightofindigenouspeoples, as Mexicans, to
education, as well as the moral obligation to compensate centuries o f discrimination and lack o f
opportunities.

More broadly, the World Bank has recognized the importance o f including indigenous peoples in social
development (OD 4.20 of September 1991) and the UnitedNations has drafted a declaration on the rights
of indigenous peoples which emphasizes access to high-quality education. The International Labor
Organization has also adopted a convention that recognizes the social rights o f indigenous peoples,
including education (No. 169, JuneJ989).

IndigenousPeople'Access to Education

Education improves individual capabilities through the acquisition o f knowledge and skills. Therefore,
education i s a basic tool for social interaction and for adequate incorporation into the individual's social,
economic and cultural environment; it i s also a valuable asset for improving an individual's productivity,
wages and welfare. It i s only by attending school from primary to tertiary level that an individual can
exercise hisbasic constitutionalright to education. Therefore, poor school attendance i s a social handicap
for any individual from any social group.

Despite significant improvements in education over the past several decades, considerable educational
differences persist between the indigenous and non-indigenous populations. Illiteracy rates and dropout


                                                      68

rates continue to b e substantially higher among the indigenous population. Data indicate that 25% o f
indigenous people over 25 years o f age do not read or write; 40 % o f indigenous people over 15 years o f
age have not completed primary education, o f these 18% have never been to school, and only 22% have
completed some years o f elementary school. On the other hand, almost two out o f ten individuals from
indigenous households have completed primary school, and four out o f ten have completed lower
secondary education.      The number o f years o f schooling i s much lower for indigenous people.
Educational gaps, however, seem to be closing in the younger generations. The average non-indigenous
individual born before 1939 has 120 percent more years o f schooling than an indigenous individual o f the
same age group. A non-indigenous individual born between 1979 and 1985, by contrast, has 26 percent
more years o f schooling than an indigenous individual born in the same period. However, this gap i s
expected to widen when the generation inquestion reaches upper-secondary and tertiary education, where
enrollment differences between non-indigenous and indigenous are larger.

Not only do indigenous people have on average less years o f schooling, but their schooling
attainment results in lower labor market earnings. This occurs because the Indigenous peoples'
returns to education are lower than for non-indigenous people (Garcia and Patrinos 2005).

Part o f the reason for the lower returns that indigenous people experience i s the quality o f education that
 indigenous people receive. Indigenous schools consistently register the lowest Spanish and mathematics
 scores compared to all other types o f schools, regardless o f location. Indigenous schools obtain
 significantly lower scores than urban public and private schools and have poorer test performance than
rural public schools and CONAFE community schools. In2002 a sixth grader from an indigenous school
had 15 percent lower Spanish scores and 8 percent lower mathematics scores than the average sixth
 grader nationwide. When compared with students from urban public schools, sixth graders in indigenous

schools had test results that were 16 percent lower in Spanish and 9 percent lower inmathematics. Even
when compared with students from public rural schools, indigenous schools performed poorly. The
average sixth grader in an indigenous school had 10 percent lower Spanish test results and 6 percent
lower results inmathematics than the average sixth grader ina publicrural school (Ramirez 2005).

Indigenous Students andthe PECProgram

The PEC Program i s open to all public basic education schools but i s primarily an urban program that
gives priority to schools located in poor urban neighborhoods. As most indigenous schools (90%) are
located inrural areas, one would expect very few indigenous schools participating inPEC. Infact, this i s
not so. The participation rate of urban indigenous primary schools inPEC i s 20% (133 schools out of a
total o f 661), or two times higher than the 10% participation rate for all public basic education schools
(21,312 PEC schools out of a total of 208,830 schools). Considering both urban and rural preschool and
primary indigenous schools, the rate ofparticipationinPEC i s 4.5% as showninTable 4.

The main reasonwhy PEC gives priorityto urban schools is that disadvantaged rural schools are covered
by the CONAFE compensatory education program, which also promotes social participation and school-
based management. The CONAE`E compensatory program covers approximately 90,000 indigenous
children between 0 and 4 years of age with initial education program; more than 250,000 preschool
indigenous children enrolled in 7,665 schools, and almost 800,000 primary school indigenous students
enrolled in 9,142 schools. The great majority of these schools are in rural areas. Thus, for purposes of
this analysis the PECwill beconsidered anurbanprogram.

The analysis of the impact of PEC on indigenous students is hampered by the fact that it i s difficult to
identify in which schools indigenous students are enrolled, since many are enrolled in basic education
schools that are not classified as "indigenous." This i s due to several reasons. First, the classification of
indigenous primary schools i s linked to the application of a bilingual curriculum, and that occurs
primarily in the schools serving indigenous rural areas.        Second, general primary schools enroll a
significant number o f indigenous students. In 2004-2005 there were 318,878 indigenous students
distributed among 4,109 general primary schools in rural and urban areas. Third, the classification of
indigenous schools i s discontinued after primary education because there i s no bi-lingual curriculum in
the secondary education level or beyond.

Thus, the 846 indigenous schools that participate inPEC underestimate the actual number of indigenous
students benefiting from the Program. Unfortunately, it is not possible to estimate the total number of
indigenous beneficiaries with the available databases.

The participation of indigenous schools in PEC has steady grown in the four years o f operation o f the
Program. Inits first year of operation (2001) there were 27 indigenous schools out o f a total of 2,240. In
the following year (2002), this number was significantly increased to 373 indigenous schools o f a total o f
9,819-an     increase fi-om 1.2% to 3.8%. Inthe third year (2003) the positive growth trend was maintained
but at a slower pace (625 indigenous schools or 4.1% o f a total o f 15,362 schools); and in2004, the share
o f indigenous schools remained approximately the same (4%) butthe absolute number increasedto 846.

It i s important to note that indigenous peoples are very unevenly distributed amongst the 31 Mexican
states and the capital. For this reason the 4% national average participation rate i s less meaningful than
state-specific rates. The figures shown in Table 5 clearly indicate that states with high concentration o f
indigenous population have consistently higher indigenous school participation rates compared to the
national average. For example, in2004 the participation rates for selected state were: 10% in Campeche,
7.1% inChiapas, 5.6% inGuerrero, 18.5% in Hidalgo, 10.9% inMichoachn, 11.9% in Oaxaca, 22.2% in
Puebla, and 9.8% inQuerCtaro. The two exceptions to this trend are Veracruz (0%) and Yucathn (1.2%).

Meansto enhance PECbenefitsfor indigenousstudents

PEC recognizes the rich multicultural nature o f Mexican society. Inorder to enhance the benefits o f the
Program for indigenous students, PEC authorities must adopt a strategy that promotes participation by
indigenous schools and supports a multicultural approach to basic education. This i s primarily the task o f
state education authorities, and some aspects o f the Program can be adjusted in order to reach these
objectives. The first important task i s to properly identify indigenous schools, notjust as those designated
as indigenous, but also those that have a significant share o f indigenous students, andor are located in
"indigenous towns" where the majority o f the population i s indigenous. In other words, indigenous
students who are enrolled in PEC schools must be identified using several criteria besides the official
designation o f "indigenous school." This i s particularly important because most urban schools with large
indigenous student enrollment are not formally classified as indigenous. The methodology for identifying
indigenous students in urban areas i s well developed and available to SEP.

Once the indigenous students are properly identified and PEC has updated its database on indigenous
school coverage, it i s possible to proceed to implement other specific measures to address the needs o f
indigenous students. For the most part, these measures are adjustments to Program strategies in order to
(i) encourage indigenous schools to apply; (ii) indigenous schools in preparing school plans and
                                                   assist
meeting other criteria for admission inthe Program; and (iii)     strengthen the capacity o f school principals,
teachers and parents o f indigenous students to collaborate to improve education outcomes and help
schools best meet the needs o f indigenous students.

In carrying out these measures it is important to keep in mindthat PEC has proven most effective in
improving the performance o f schools located in very poor urban areas and these are the areas where
urban indigenous students tend to concentrate. It i s also important to keep inmindthat PEC has installed
capacity to monitor progress regarding indigenous schools and indigenous students.

Consultationswith IndigenousPeoples           ,

                                     1.
Indigenous peoples have participated intensively in several consultations and Program evaluation that
were carried out by SEP and education authorities at state level, since the PEC Program was created in
2001. The findings from these consultations help identify the issues o f concern to indigenous peoples, and
highlighttheir education demands. Recurrently, indigenous peoples mention as general education issues
of concern bilingual education, better quality o fpublic education services, improved school infrastructure,
and more ample access to education.

Inthe specific caseofthe PEC, severalevaluationshave capturedthe opinionsofindigenous participants
inthe Program. Because PEC is a national Program and covers urban areas including areas classified as
being o f medium, high and very high marginality (disadvantage), it became necessary to develop
evaluation instruments able to capture Program impacts on the school and on the school community.

PEC schools join the Program voluntarily and this decision i s made with the full support o f the school
community consisting o f the school principal, teachers and parents. The instruments used to evaluate the
Program were designed to confirm the extent to which the School Strategic Transformation Plan
 (PETE)-which     i s financed with the PEC pant-has       the support o f all the key actors who makeup the
 school community. PEC has today,in its database the results o f evaluations carried out during the past
 four years and this constitutes invaluable material for further analysis, particularly with respect to the
impacts o f the Program on indigenous schools and indigenous students. Some o f evaluation results
regarding the views o f parents are:



                                                       73

     0   Sixty-five percent (65%) o f the parents are fully committed to the goals and activities that
         comprise the School Strategic Transformation Plan (PETE);

     0   The large majority o f the parents (87 to 94%) recognize that the Program improves teaching and
         learning practices inthe classroom; and,


     0   A similarly large majority (83-94%) o f parents report being informed o f the progress made by
         their children in school and feel that they views are taken into account in school decisions.

These indicators are consistent for indigenous and non-indigenous schools. They show that PEC not only
does not harm indigenous peoples but i s seen by indigenous parents as a highly beneficial education
Program.

As indicated elsewhere in this PAD, in order to qualify for the Program the schools must prepare a
Strategic School Transformation Plan (PETE) as well as an Annual Work Program (PAT). These plans,
which must be approved by the appropriate state education authorities, synthesize the findings o f a
systematic process of self-evaluation o f the part o f the school community, select the goals for
improvement, and define the short- and medium-term actions to reachthese goals. This process i s carried
out jointly by school principals, teachers, parents and other members o f the school community, and the
resulting plans are expected to reflect the points o f view and the choices o f the members o f the school
community. The evaluation instruments applied inthe Program are able to ascertain that this i s infact true
inthe large majorityofcases.

Four types o f evaluations have been carried out each year since the creation o f PEC, setting an
unprecedented standard for the education sector inMexico. These evaluations are:

     0   Qualitative evaluation o f the school, measuring school management standards, teaching practices
         and social participation;
     0   Student learning achievement through tests usingNational Standards;
     0   Evaluation o f Program implementation at federal and state level, in terms o f strategy used and
         public policy relevance; and
     0    Self-evaluation on the part o f participating schools taking as a base the "Annual Work Program"
          (PAT).

In addition to these on-going evaluation activities, the proposed APL will finance rigorous Program
impact evaluation throughout the implementation period o f the three phases o f the Program. This impact
evaluation will focus, inter alia, on the impact o f the Program on indigenous students.

In September 2005, SEP consulted with representatives from indigenous schools including principals,
teachers and supervisors regarding the general situation o f indigenous education and the relations that
indigenous schools have with the PEC Program.              This consultation was attended by indigenous
representatives from the states o f Yucatan, Oxaca and Chiapas, which have the highest concentration o f
 indigenous population, as well as from the states o f Nayarit, Sonora and Baja California. The main results
 of this consultation can be summarized as follows:
                                      >
     a) In general, indigenous education suffers from high mobility of teachers, lack o f coordination
          among the different educational institutions involved in the operation o f indigenous schools, lack
          o f resources to implemented bilingual education, and low technical capacity o f indigenous

    b) With respect to the PEC 'Program, indigenous schools have difficulty to participate in the
          Program because o f lack o f information on program requirements. The indigenous schools that
          succeed in applying for the Program need to receive more technical assistance from state
          education authorities (AEEs) to help them prepare the PETEand the PAT.

Insum, the participants recommend dissemination of more information about the Program inindigenous
areas, and the more extensive technical assistance to indigenous schools, to permit higher participation o f
these schools inthe PEC. The IPDP incorporates these recommendations.

The proposedIPDP for the project i s based on the recommendations made duringthe consultation process
reported above, and on information provided by the evaluations carried out by SEP during the past four
years.

Objective ofthe IPDP

The central objective of this IPDP i s to identify PEC indigenous schools and promote inthose schools a
school-based management model that fosters teaching and learning practices that appropriately meet the
needs o f a diversified group o f students in an equitable and efficient manner. The IPDP also aims to
expand PEC's coverage o f indigenous schools even though the voluntary nature o f the Program does not
allow for specific targeting o f indigenous schools.

EstimatedProgrambudget directlybenefitingindigenousstudents

Based on historical averages o f the representation o f urban indigenous schools inPEC, and the likelihood
that indigenous schools would continue to represent about 4% o f total PEC schools, the Mission estimates
that about 40 million pesos will be received by indigenous schools each year, as long as the demand by
indigenous schools i s maintained.

The specific actions that comprise the IPDP will be financed from the operating costs o f the Program
contributedby the SEP and by the states.

Timetable for IPDPimplementation

All five components o f the IPDP will be implemented during the three years o f phase Io f the proposed
APL. Components4 and 5 are expectedto continue to be carriedout duringthe subsequent phases I1and
111.

Monitoringandimpact evaluation arrangements

All schools that participate inPEC, including indigenous schools, are currently monitored by the SPEC
information system. This system operates at the school, state and federal levels, and at all these levels
permanent training i s provided to ensure that the information captured by the SPEC i s provided by staff
intimely and reliable manner. The criteria presently usedto identify indigenous schools and indigenous
students will be modified       upon completion o f the first component o f the IPDP and, following that, the
SPEC database will be updated and the corresponding information on indigenous students participating
inthe Programwillbeamply disseminated.

                            MEXICO: School-Based Management Program


A. PEC rulesto prioritize school selection incase of over demand

The Programa Escuelas de Calidad (Quality Schools Program-PEC)              i s based on voluntary participation
o f states and schools. The states that participate inthe Program are those that express willingness to do so
and contribute their share o f Program funding. As to schools, PEC i s open to any public basic education
school which applies to participate in the Program and meets the selection criteria established in the PEC
Operational Rules. Given voluntary nature o f the Program, and the fact that inmany states more schools
qualify to participate than available Program funds permit, this Annex i s intended to explain the methods
usedto prioritize schools duringthe selection process, when there i s over demand.

Thepriority selection criteria are:

     (a) Preference i s given to schools that participatedinthe Program inprior years (up to a maximum o f
         five years) and continue to fulfill Programrequirements.

     (b) Among schools applyingto the Programfor the first time, preference is given to qualified schools
         located inurban areas (AGEBs)o f medium, highand very highmarginality, as defined in Part B
         o fthis Annex.

     (c) Further, a state may use additional school priority selection criteria, as long as these criteria are
         uniformly applied to all public basic education schools in the state and do not contradict the PEC
         National Operational Rules.

Validation:

The states.are instructed to validate priority ,criteria for school selection following the five steps:
                                      ,
         Determine the geographic location o f the school as an urban settlement o f 2,500 inhabitants or
         more, based on the XI1General Census o f Population and Dwellings, 2000.

          Verify that the school location i s clearly identified ina cartographic urban geo-statistical area
          (AGEBs).

          Ascertain that the AGEB where the school i s locatedhas been classifiedby CONAPO according
          the urban marginality index.

          Visit the school to confirmthat it effectively exhibits the degree o fmarginality indicatedbythe
          CONAPOindex.

          Include the schools that meet the above conditions ina final list o f the schools that can receive
          preferential treatment inthe selection procedure.

The nextsection explains the concept o f urbanmarginality and describes the urban marginality index
usedto prioritize schools inthe PEC school selection process.

B.Urbanmarginalityindex

The concept of urban marginality

Marginality can be broadly defined as a structural phenomenon identifying people who lack goods and
services considered crucial to meet their basic needs and support their development. The condition o f
marginality may occur in different degrees and as a result o f a variety o f factors, including obstacles to
access technological advances ingiven regions o f the country, or social exclusion affecting specific social
or ethnic groups thereby curtailing their access to the benefits o f economic development.

The design o f social programs aimed to reduce the incidence o f marginality in urban areas, must use
specific indicators in order to identify the spatial patterns o f distribution o f marginality at the level o f
local communities-blocks,       neighborhoods or other city zoning classification. Inother words, for these
programs to function well they require more than a general knowledge o f municipal levels o f marginality
or household poverty levels. The index o f urban marginality developed by the National Population
Council (Consejo Nacional de Poblacidn-CONAPO)               seeks to contribute to the generation o f these
indicators.

The urban marginality index

The index o f urban marginality i s a tool for measuring, on the basis o f objective criteria, the degree of
social and economic need experienced by people living in specific city neighborhoods. This index may
have a variety o f applications, the most important o f which are: (a) to determine the criteria for setting
priorities for public programs at the local level; as it allows the ranking o f AGEBs according to degree o f
socioeconomic need; (b) to analyze the magnitude of the incidence o f urban marginality in different cities
o f the country and make inter-city comparisons; and (c) to provide a starting point for the analysis o f the
spatial distribution o f the urbanpopulationaccording to socioeconomic conditions.

Definition of the AGEBs

The National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica,
GeograJia e Informcitica-INEGI)       defines AGEB as the basic unit o f the national geo-statistical mapping
system. Its limits are given by geographic details, permanent infrastructure or other territorial features
identified within a given territory. An urban AGEB i s a geographic area defined within a locality
inhabited by 2500 inhabitants or more and must have at least 100 inhabitants.

Dimensions of urban marginality captured by the urban marginality index

The CONAPO index o f urban marginality has five dimensions: (1) access to health care, (2) access to
education services, (3) access to adequate housing, (4) the perception o f sufficient monetary income, and
(5) gender.

These five dimensions are further specified in eleven (11) types o f basic need. The spatial incidence and
intensity o f these basic needs i s measured as the percentage o f the population ina givenAGEB that i s not
participating in or enjoying essential goods or services needed for their development and satisfactory o f
basic needs. Table 1 presents the 11 dimepsions and indicators o f basic needs used to evaluate each o f
dimension.                            i

Methodology used to estimate the urban marginality indext4

The XI1General Census of population and housing of 2000 was usedby CONAPO to estimate the urban
marginality index. The Census provides the condensed social demographic indicators for all urban
AGEBs o f the country, and therefore represents the best available source o f data to estimate the urban
marginality index.

Using these data CONAPO applied the technique o f "Principal Components." This statistic technique
enables one to reduce in a single dimension a large quantity o f information for each o f the 11indicators
that comprise the five dimensions o f the urban marginality index. The technique also permits the ordering
o f the urban AGEBs according to their level o f marginality. The application of this technique requires that
the basic census variables used must have a certain level o f correlation among them. Thus, once the urban
marginality index was estimated, CONAPO calculated the correlation coefficients between each
dimension and the overall index and found in nine out o f eleven dimensions correlation coefficients o f
0.70 or more. The two dimensions with lower correlation coefficients were "Gender," measured by the
percentage o f women between the ages o f 12 and 17 who bore at least one child, which has a correlation
coefficient o f 0.29 with the urban marginality index, and one component o f the "Education" dimension-
the percentage o f the population between the ages o f 6 and 14 that do not attend school-which               had a
correlation coefficient o f 0.68.

Main results

CONAPO estimates that 34,061 urban AGEBs or 31.7 % o f the total present some degree o f marginality.
In these AGEBs the incidence of marginality varies from high (7015 AGEBs or 20.6 %), medium


l4Presently, CONDO estimates the index of urban marginality based on data from the XI1General Census o f
Populationand Dwelling, 2000.


                                                         84

 (20.8%), low (17.7 %), and very 10,w degree o f marginality (9.2%). In2000, these 34,061 urban AGEBs
 concentrated only 19% o f the total population, which suggests that the incidence o f marginality tends to
 be higher in smaller urban areas. And among rural localities o f less than 2500 inhabitants, 72.8 % o f the
 AGEBs register some degree o f marginality. This means that three quarters o f the rural population (75.2
 %) reside in AGEBs with that are disadvantaged in terms o f health, education, housing, income, and
 gender relation. Conversely, the incidence o f marginality decreases as the size o f the locality increases.

 Table 4 shows the distribution o f the population in localities of 15,000 inhabitants or more by AGEB
 classified according to the urban marginality index. The results show large cities and their metropolitan
 areas concentrate a have a large number o f people living in high or very high marginality AGEBs. This
 occurs in spite o f the fact that the incidence o f marginality tends to be higher in smaller localities, as
 mentioned above, and probably reflects the rapid urban population growth that occurred inMexico since
 the 1970s.

 Overall, approximately seven million people live inhighand very highmarginality AGEBs in urban areas
 o f 15,000 inhabitants or more. Most o f them live inthe larger cities o f one million people or more and in
 smaller urban localities that are part o f the metropolitan areas o f these larger cities.                          Large cities
 concentrate 37.2 % of the population living in high or very high marginality AGEBs. When we add
 AGEBs in the smaller urban localities near these larger cities, the number o f people living in high and
 very highmarginality AGEBs ascends to 18.8 million. These data, shown inTable 4, clearly suggest that
 inorder to minimize the incidence ofurbanmarginality it is necessary to focus interventions inthe poor
 areas o f large cities, even though these cities have an overall lower marginality index than rural areas.

                                       Annex 14: Impact Evaluation
                           MEXICO: School-BasedManagementProgram


Since its inception, PEC has emphasized evaluation through qualitative and quantitative studies
investigating the effect o f PEC on parent-teacher relations and learning outcomes. The importance o f
rigorous evaluation i s clear: PEC i s a relatively new Program and has potential to support most Mexican
preschool, primary and lower secondary education schools. Since the ultimate goal o f PEC i s to improve
the quality o f Mexican education, it i s important to precisely measure the effect o f PEC on learning
outcomes. The Bank and PEC management have agreed that the project would contract with independent
experts to carry out a rigorous impact evaluation and that exact designs and details would be agreed
duringthe first year o fproject implementation.

A recent retrospective evaluation (Shapiro and Skoufias 2005) used several non-experimental methods
with existing data to measure the impact o f PEC. A before-after comparison over a two-year period
without background controls showed significant increases in parental involvement in schools and in
students' homework, and in students' expectations o f educational attainment for PEC schools. Similar
indicators were not available for non-PEC schools so differences-in-differences estimates could not be
completed. The study also used differences-in-differences matching and a production function with a
three-year panel on a census o f Mexican primary schools to measure impact on dropout, repetition, and
failure rates. These methods associated PEC with a statistically insignificant mean decrease o f 0.1
percentage points inrepetition and dropout rates. Estimated impact on dropout was 0.5 percentage points
for schools in highly marginalized localities but was also statistically insignificant. Limitations in data
and methodology make future rigorous evaluation more important.

PEC has always been a voluntary Program, and an unobserved factor o f self-selection separates those
schools that participate in PEC from those that do not. The motivation which encourages principals,
teachers, and community members to participate in PEC influences learning outcomes directly; hence,
any evaluation design which does not control for the self-selection involved inPEC participationi s likely
to inaccurately measure PEC's impact. The voluntary nature o f PEC both implies that use o f a
comparison group in evaluation i s critical, and that any evaluation design must control for self-selection
to the extent possible.

Two future designs would be most appropriate; both would identify similar treatment and control schools.
The first would use excess demand to carry out a lottery. Inmany Mexican states, more schools apply for
PEC funds than PEC can afford to support. Each state decides the criteria used to select the funded
schools from the interested schools - typically states prefer urban disadvantaged schools, and states also
add subjective criteria. If states had randomly selected schools to fund from among the qualified schools
that applied, then PEC would have an experimental design similar to Colombia's PACES scholarships
program (see Angrist et al. 2001).

A variant ofthe first design could use alternative selection mechanisms. After states identify schools with
 adequate school project proposals, States could fund only those schools with marginality indices below a
 given fixed level. Then an evaluation could use a regression discontinuity design to evaluate impact.
 States could also select the schools that first submitted their plans. This alternative would help control for
 self-selection but would encounter the difficulty that the schools which submit plans early can differ
 substantively from the schools that submit plans late. In any case, if excess demand i s substantial, these
methods could create an instrument that would allow an evaluation to identify the impact o f PEC.




                                                       86

The second, an encouragement design (see Duflo and Saez 2003), randomly selects a group o f schools to
receive extra encouragement to join PEC. If the encouragement significantly increases the rate o f PEC
participationbut does not change the nature o f PEC, it can serve as an instrument to identify the impact o f
PEC. The principal advantage o f this design i s its use o f random selection, which controls for any
unobserved background factors, without requiring that a control group be involuntarily excluded from the
Program. Potential disadvantages include: (a) it may be difficult to design a method o f encouragement
that significantly increases participation without affecting design or implementation o f the School
Strategic Transformation Plan; (b) since PEC i s decentralized, each Mexican state might implement the
encouragement differently: (c) since about 1,600 new schools will enter PEC in2006 and about 5,000 will
enter in 2007, it may be difficult to achieve the sample size needed to obtain significant results; (d)
observers may question why some but not all schools receive encouragement to join the Program.

Inthe first year o fproject implementation, government andBankstaffwill:


    0   Agree on the preferred design, the states and region where the evaluation will focus, the sample
        size and unit o f observation (school or student).
    0   Prepare terms or reference for an independent consultant to carry out the study.
    0   Ifthe encouragement design is to be used, possibly pilot test several types of encouragement to
        see which has the largest effect on increasing the probability that schools participate inPEC.
    0   Agree on exactly which indicators will be used (including both school management and learning
        outcomes) and what data collection will be necessary to complete the study.

An independent decision-making advisory committee o f experts will be formed (over and above the
regular technical committee) to choose the best methodological option and submit that option for the no-
objection by the World Bank. The committee shall have four members comprising two national and two
international experts in impact evaluation design and implementation, and with practical experience on
the feasibility o f approaches that could be utilized in Mexico. The consultants that will prepare the
proposed methodology for the impact evaluation will work under a separate contract from the actual
impact evaluation.

Inthe secondyear oftheproject implementation, baseline data willbeobtained; inthe thirdyear, results
for management indicatorswill become available; inyears 4-6, outcome results will become available. A

               Annex 15: FinancingandProvisionof BasicEducationin Mexico
                          MEXICO: School-BasedManagementProgram

BasicEducationExpenditure

The Mexican Constitution and the General Educationlaw determine the obligation o f the public sector to
provide basic education services, that is, at the preschool, primary and lower secondary levels. The law
also establishes the conditions under which private education services may be offered at these levels,
though approximately 9 out o f ten students currently attend public schools. The organization and
financing of public education i s shared among the federal and the state governments, whereas municipal
governments are encouraged to participate in the maintenance o f and provision o f basic educational
equipment to public schools intheir locality.
Public education is free of charge, though parents and parents associations often contribute, in cash or in
kind, to cover part of the operating, maintenance or school improvement costs through annual inscription
fees, a school fair, the concession or operation o f a kiosk, or fees for extra-curricular activities. Public
schools may also receive donations from other social or private organizations. Article 6 o f the General
Education L a w permits donations to public education and schools as long as these are not a payment for
public education services.      Funds obtained are generally managed by the school principal and a
representative o f the parents association.    The administration o f such funds i s generally subject to
simplified local state government regulation and accounting controls, particularly if the school principal
has a responsibility for such administration..

Resources allocated to education, from all main sources o f finance: federal, state, municipal and private,
increased substantially not only inreal terms but also as a percentage o f GDP (Table 1). Total education
expenditure in Mexico related to the size o f the economy i s above the average observed in OECD
countries (OECD 2004b).

The increase in education expenditure has been largely allocated to basic education as, at least for federal
education expenditure, the proportion o f public resources allocated to basic education went up
considerably, from 44% in 1992 tob64% in 2004 (Table 2). In the case o f state governments, more than
60% o f the state education expenditure effort is, on average, dedicated to basic education (State Education
Finance Survey-SEP, 2002). Private education expenditure mainly comprises college fees for private
schools and universities, though also includes the contributions o f parents to public schools. No detailed
information on the total o f private contributionsto public schools i s available at a national level.

Decentralization
The provision o f public basic education services in Mexico has been subject to a reassignment of
responsibilities among different levels o f government, for little more than a decade now, aimed at
decentralizing the administration and operation o f the basic education system to state governments while
strengthening the regulatory role o f the federal government. Under an agreement signed by the federal
government and all 31states inMay 1992 and subsequent modifications to the General Education Law in
1993, assets, resources and responsibilities to operate the federal basic education system were transferred
to the state governments. At the same time, the federal government strengthened its regulatory roles inthe
development o f curricula as well as inthe control, supervision, and evaluation o f education. This process
o f decentralization-also      known as the federalization o f basic education-arises           "from the need to
revitalize an educational system that had hit levels o f authentic gigantism that hindered its due operation"
(Mancera 2000).
The current de~entralization'~followed a long period o f centralization and unification o f the education
system that initiated with the creation o f the Secretariat o f Public Education (SEP) in 1921, Before this,
public education had been mainly an issue o f local attention. The modifications to the Constitution
required for the creation o f SEP made it possible for the federal government to establish, organize, and
sustain schools o f any type and grade in the entire Republic, without limiting the abilities o f state
governments to maintain their own public education. The federal education system was initially
conceived to increase the coverage o f basic education, complementing state and municipal efforts. After
absorbing the municipal schools o f the Federal District, SEP expanded provision o f education services to
all states, initially inrural areas where state and municipal education services hadnot yet arrived.
Subsequently, the centralization was intensified upon expanding the authority o f the federal government
to "unify and coordinate education in the entire Republic." Furthermore, SEP reached agreements with
some state governments for the transfer and incorporation o f state education systems into the federal one,
even maintaining in some cases state contributions to sustain the transferred schools.16 The growth o f
demand-as       a result o f population growth-further       facilitated the centralization o f education as SEP
began to expand the delivery o f its education services inthe entire territory, including inurban areas, at a
faster rate than many state governFents. Only some states continued to support and expand their state-
supported education system presumably because the rate o f expansion o f the federal system was deemed




   From 1958 deconcentration and decentralization attempts have been made. However, the explosive growth o f the
educational demand in the 1960s and seventy frustrated the projects o f deconcentration upon giving an illusion o f
flexibility and mobility within a growing system. Only until 1978 it was possible to advance inthe deconcentration
o f the SEP upon being established delegations state in each one o f the states, which formed the basis o n which the
states could establish its respective state agencies decentralized inorder to take charge o f the functions transferred
b the federal government in 1992.
"Chihuahua,      Zacatecas, Guerrero, Nayarit, Coahuila, Colima, Morelos, and Tlaxcala entered in these types o f
agreements with the federal government between 1933 and 1934.

insufficient to meet demand." As a result, there was an uneven presence o f the federal education system
among states at the time o fthe decentralization o f education in 1992.
The financing o f education has been an important issue in the discussion o f the decentralization o f basic
education. The General Education Law establishes the obligation o f both federal and state governments to
contribute in the financing o f public education and identify the need to strengthen sources o f education
finance. However, there i s no explicit reference to the proportion in which different levels o f government
should contribute. Inthe negotiations on the decentralization o f basic education, state governments tried
to avoid the transfer o f teachers and schools becoming an additional financial burden and a way o f the
federal government to transfer the cost o f sustaining its systemto the states. Thus, the federal government
committed to continue to assume the full cost o f the transferred system. As a result, the federal
contribution i s based on the registry o f staff and schools transferred to state governments in 1992, as well
as any updates in this registry. The combination o f an uneven presence among states and federal
contributions based on the registry o f staff and schools at the time o f the decentralization has meant a high
disparity o f federal resources for education among states ever since.

Since the budget o f 1993, the federal government includes resources for the financing o f the transferred
educational services in a specific budget line. However, the budget did not include the allocation o f
resources by states and permitted some discretion on behalf o f SEP in establishing the exact amount
needed to sustain the transferred services, giving room for case-by-case negotiations between SEP and
each state. Inorder to create greater certainty and to increase transparency inthe allocation o f resources,
as o f 1998 federal transfers to states have been regulated by the Fiscal Coordination Law. The
modifications to this law created several funds-among         them the Fund for Basic Education (FAEB)-
integrated in Ramo 33 o f the federal budget. On FAEB the Fiscal Coordination Law incorporates the
same element o f the "common registry o f schools and staff' and updates thereof as the criterion for the
determination and allocation o fresources. The modified legal framework made it possible for the states to
maintain savings generatedby an eqficient operation o f the transferred educational system as long as these
resources are applied in the basic education system operated by the state government. Furthermore, ever
since the transfer of resources through Ramo 33 all states fully incorporate these resources into their
respective public accounts (contrary to the previous practice in many states that maintained these
resources off-budget).


Despite greater transparency in the allocation o f resources through FAEB, marked differences among
 states persist inthe proportion betweenfederally financed transfers and the state's own resources spent on
basic education. Figure 1 shows the states' own resources as a proportion o f total public spending on
basic education in 31 states. On avlerage, states contribute 22.5 percent o f total public spending in basic
 education with resources other than those obtained from federal transfers through FAEB. However,
 differences between states inthis regardremain huge.

These differences are mainly the result o f the number o f schools sustained by the state and federal
government respectively before the decentralization. As pointed out previously, the expansion o f federal
schools occurred at a different pace throughout the country largely as a result o f historical decisions by
state and federal authorities. By basing federal transfers after the decentralization in 1992 on the registry
o f staff and schools transferred to state government, the distribution o f federal funds perpetuates a
distribution o f federal funds that i s not related to the number o f students, the cost o f education, the relative
level o f development o f the states, educational lags or the efficiency and quality o f the educational
services but that i s the result o f a series o f historical decisions, particularly with regard to expansion o f
education services sustainedby the federal or state governments respectively.

These disparities in state contributions have been the subject o f discussion from the beginning o f the
decentralization o f basic education. Particularly, states that contribute more resources to education seek a
greater recognition and compensation by the federal government through higher transfers. However, one
o f the issues that federal educational authorities face i s that an additional budgetary allocation for states
with a high participation in the financing o f education will not necessarily represent a greater financial
effort on education, especially if the additional federal resources replace part o f the existing state effort.
Furthermore, an additional allocation o f federal resources to states with a higher participationby the state
inthe financing of educationdoes notnecessarily havethe largest impact onthe coverage ofeducation or
educational quality.


FinancingPublicBasicEducation
Public basic education expenditure in Mexico can be divided in three main categories: direct federal
government spending, local government spending with earmarked federal transfers, and local government
spending with own resources. The latter includes non-earmarked tax revenue (participaciones) shared
with and transferredto local governments by the federal government as a result o f a highly centralized tax
system.
Education expenditure contained in the federal budget amounts to almost quarter o f total programmable
expenditure" and includes the budget allocation to the SEP (Ramo I]),a budget fund to finance the not-
yet decentralized basic education in the Mexico City federal district (Ramo 25), a series o f funds
providing earmarked transfers to local governments (Ramo 3 3 , and resources dedicated to education by
other sector ministries and agencies. The share o f public spending allocated to education i s the highest
among OECD countries and almost twice as highas the OECD average (OECD 2004b).
Basic education expenditure makes up about 64% o f total federal education spending. The main modality
o f federal basic education expenditure i s the transfer o f earmarked funds to state governments through the


   Education expenditure as a percentage of federal programmable expenditure amounted to 21.9% in 2004, is
expectedat 22.8% in2005 andthe budgetedat 23.8% for 2006 (Proyecto de Presupuesto 2006).


                                                                    94

Ramo 33 funds. These include the largest federal earmarked transfers under the Fondo de Aportaciones
para la Educacidn B6sica (FAEB) that make up more than three quarters o f federal basic education and
almost half o f federal total education expenditure. FAEB resources are earmarked to use in basic
education and largely cover the operating cost o f the former federalized basic education system
transferred to the state governments. Similarly, Ramo 25 resources are employed for the operation o f the
federal basic education system in the Mexico City Federal District, which has not yet been transferred to
the local authorities and i s still operated through a dedicated area o f the federal government.

SEP's own budget (Ramo ZZ) also includes resources dedicated to basic education, though in a much
smaller proportion after the transfer o f the major parts to state governments and the creation o f Ramo 33
transfers. Inaddition to the normative, regulatory andplanning tasks for the basic education system inthe
country and the printingand distribution o f text books, compensatory basic education programs operated
by the Consejo Nacional de Foment0 Educativo (CONAFE) throughout the country receive their budget
allocation from Ramo 11." The same i s true for the federal contribution to the Programa Escuelas de
Calidad. The larger part o f the SEP's own budget i s currently allocated to higher education, partly
through direct transfers to universities and, in numerous cases, in conjunction with similar transfers by
state governments.
At the local government level, it is largely the state governments that are involved in the provision of
public education within their territory. This was the case previous to the decentralization and has been
further strengthened as a result o f the decentralization o f basic education. State governments are currently
in charge of operating the whole basic education system and also support, often inconjunction with the
federal government, higher education facilities. State expenditures are financed from local taxes, fees
etc., federal tax share revenue and federal transfers. On average, states spend some 45% o f their own, un-
earmarked resources (local revenue and federal tax share revenue, net o f the obligatory pass-on to
municipal governments) on education, o f which 60% i s allocated to basic education. As a major part o f
the Ramo 33 federal transfers to states are earmarked to education, the average state spending (including
the earmarked transfers) on education amounts to about 56% o ftheir total budget (again net o f transfers to
municipal governments).
 State participation in basic education i s largely focused on the provision o f the main inputs to the
 education process, i.e. the state government takes care o f the payment o f salaries of the teaching and
maintenance staff and some o f the basic operating cost (such as water and electricity bills), acquires and
 distributes basic education materials, and carries out major investments in infrastructure. Normally, no


 l9The budget allocation for CONAFE, that operates basic education services for disadvantaged group inrural and
 indigenous communities, amounted to MXN 18.8 billion in2004 or almost 70% o f the SEP's own budget for basic
 education.

cash allocations are made from the federal or state government to schools for smaller petty cash
expenditures required inthe day-to-day operation o f a school or to pay for local, school-based initiatives.
Schools are allowed, however, to raise contributions from parents and other interested parties (including
municipal governments) and employ the funds for the operation, maintenance and improvement o f the
school facilities or the acquisition o f additional education material.
According to the General Education Law (LGE), state governments should promote the direct
participation of municipal government to provide maintenance and basic equipment to public schools.
Municipal government obtain their revenue largely from local taxes (property taxes) and fees, tax share
revenue (slightly over 20% o fthe federal tax share revenue to states has to be passed on to municipalities)
and federal government transfers.         Estimated data on the contribution o f municipal government to
education suggest that less than MXN 1billionpesos, or on average less than 1% o f municipal resources,
are allocatedto support education.
Transfers from the federal government to municipalities include the Ram0 33 Municipal Social
Infrastructure Fund (FISM).         Resources from this fund are earmarked to investments in water and
sanitation, municipal urbanization, electricity, basic infrastructure for health and education, housing, rural
roads and rural productive infrastructure. The amount o f resources distributed among municipalities
through this fund i s significant -MXN 19.6 billion pesos in 2004- and the distribution o f funds favors
poorer states and municipalities. Though municipalities may invest part o f their FISM resources inbasic
education infrastructure, the broad earmarking o f the resources and the lack o f uniform accounting
practices and information exchange inhibits a clear picture about how much o f the FISM funds i s spent on
education.
A recent reform to the general education law introduces a target on public education spending equal to
8% o f GDP." Eventhough the target includes expenditures by all three levels o f government, no specific
allocations and spending responsibilities o f the different levels o f government are included.
In addition to the level of spending, the distribution o f those expenditures is probably as important. In
this regard, the OECD observes that most o f educational expenditure is tied up incurrent spending with
less than 2.8% o f basic education expenditure for capital spending compared to an average o f 8.4% in
OECD countries. Moreover, most o f the current spending goes to the compensation o f staff, leaving at
the primary level only 6.4% for other current expenditure, such as instructional materials compared to an
OECD average o f 19.3% (OECD 2004b).

World Bank

The purpose o f this document i s to explain the general framework o f the education policy under which the
Quality Schools Program (PEC, in Spanish) operates. This program will be partially financed with a loan
from the World Bank. This financial support will allow the consolidation o f different educational
activities with the objective of changing institutional and school management to focus on the
improvement of student learning and teaching practices through the strategic management o f schools that
serve diversity with equity, based on a co-financing scheme, social participation, and accountability, as
established by the National Education Program (ProNaE 2001-2006).

GeneralGuidelines ofthe EducationPolicy

ProNaE 2001-2006 recognizes that there i s inequity in the structure and operation o f the educational
system, since the provision of better quality services has been concentrated in regions with enough
income, infrastructure, and good access, and resources have been allocated to schools with the best
administrative capacities. Thus, efforts to achieve universal coverage with basic education services have
not solved the problem o f low educational achievement. It is crucial to adopt and strengthen measures
aimed at improving the quality and equity o f educational institutions, selecting schools located in urban
areas with high and very high poverty rates. In this context, the Mexican Government assumes the
responsibility o f promoting, through the PEC, schemes to strengthen Basic Education.

W e believe that the PEC i s a powerful intervention instrumentthat gives priority to: schools incorporated
inprevious years that havemet the reincorporationrequirements; schools locatedinurbanareaswith high
to very highpoverty rates, identified in the AGEB (Basic Geostatistical Area) established by CONAPO
and/or its State equivalent; schools serving indigenous students, students with special education needs
associated to a disability, multi-grade schools and camps servingmigrant students.

The Program aims at transformiq the design from the centrally formulated educational policy that
concentrates all the decisions concerning priorities, strategies, resources and their distribution, toward a
scheme that makes it possible to generate projects from the school itself, that supports actions to
transform school management with the objective o f improving the learning results, that helps transform
school management, expanding decision-making at the school level. Along with this, the PEC offers
training and technical assistance to enrich the school transformation process; creating significant
opportunities for responsible social participation and providing additional financial resources directly
administered by the school.




                                                     97

GeneralObjective

The PEC seeks to contribute to the improvement o f school management in public schools as a
fundamental condition to strengthen the quality o f basic education. To this end, the program offers
incentives to the schools so that they adopt a new management model based on planning, evaluation,
social participation, and accountability.

Specific Objectives

a) To redirect school management to strengthen pedagogical practices based on students' educational
needs identified by the teachers o f schools belonging to the PEC.

b) To establish a school management transformation dynamic at each incorporated school, through the
provision of strategic planning and evaluation methodologies based on Basic Education structures.

c) To foster strategies promoting social participation in order to encourage the collaboration o f the
educational community inschool life, co-financing, transparency and accountability.

d) To strengthen coordination mechanisms at the federal, inter-institutional and state levels that promote
policies and actions for technical and financial assistance in order to strengthen the management capacity
and optimal operation o f the schools incorporated to the PEC.

Objectiveof the first phaseof the Loan:
The first phase o f the loan will support the Federal Government's financial participation in the program.
This will consist on transferring resources to schools through existing trusts; monitoring and follow-up
activities; and impact assessments and policy studies to introduce changes that may be necessary for
subsequent stages.

Strategies

To implement the Program, coordination strategies have been encouraged among State educational
authorities to generate the necessary conditions inschools receiving the support, especially:

         In addition and complementary to current federal, state and municipal programs, transfers of
         resources to schools for infrastructure and operational costs o f permanent school staff. Inno case
         will these funds replace the regularresources allocated to these ends.

         Program resources cannot be allocated for payment of economic incentives or bonuses to people
         contracted by SEP, CONAFE, State Secretariats o f Education, or their equivalent at the three
         government levels.          I



         Contributions and/or donations to the schools from municipalities, private and social
         organizations, may be made incash or inkind.

         Corresponding actions in the states that promote the transformation o f institutional management
         through a more profound intervention in the incorporated and reincorporated schools. The
         National Coordination and the States' General Coordination units must promote an inter-
         institutional support network to link, connect, and strengthen program ends, objectives, and
         resources affecting the schools, to increase their scope and social impact and avoid duplication of
         similar actions ina single beneficiary population.



                                                      98

    e    Establish in the annual Operational Rules the guidelines on coverage, target population,
         beneficiaries, characteristics o f the financial support, regulatory entity, institutional coordination,
         and allocation of resources!,

MainResultsofthe Four PreviousYears of Operation (2001-2005)

Four years after the initial implementation o f the PEC, the conditions have been set to move school
management toward strengthening teaching practices based on the educational needs o f students as
identified by the teachers; the transformation o f school management has been promoted in the schools
through the provision o f tools and methodologies for their strategic planning and evaluation. This has
been carried out through the technical assistance provided by the staff constituting the Basic Education
structure in the states; social participation strategies to promote community involvement in school life,
co-financing, transparency, and accountability have been established; and inter-institutional coordination
between federal, state, and municipal entities has been developed. This has been translated into actions for
technical and financial assistance to support the regular operation o f the schools incorporated to the
Program.

Furthermore, the direct transfer o fresources to the schools achieved quite favorable results withregard to
the demand and adoption o f the PEC, such as the following:




 ** Figures
 *         in US$million
  Thefigure is determined by center key. Ifwe consider benefited school shifts, particularly at the secondary level,
theJigure would increase to 21,521.

For the Program's fifth year, the same structure o f the PEC IV has been kept, incorporating adjustments
to the Operational Rules, based on the experience o f previous years and the various evaluations carried
out to improve the universe o f incorporated schools.

The Mexican Government, through the Public Education Secretariat, ratifies that the General Directorate
 for the Development o f Educational Management and Improvement, under the Department o f Basic
 Education, i s in charge o f coordinating the Quality Schools Program and each state i s responsible for
 implementing the program.

 The Secretary
