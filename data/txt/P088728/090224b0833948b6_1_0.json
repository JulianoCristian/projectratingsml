Education quality was a major concern at\n            all levels and most students did not meet minimum standards.\n            World Bank has supported most areas of the education sector,\n            with a strong focus on early childhood development and rural\n            education. One important area in the National Education\n            Strategy was promoting greater community participation in\n            schools with focus on disadvantaged schools. The Bank was\n            also supporting efforts to improve inclusion through better\n            targeting of scholarships and an increased focus on\n            indigenous and disabled students. The federal government has\n            played a leading role in identifying interventions and\n            supervising the activities of each agency. Mexico also has a\n            wide range of civil society and philanthropic organizations\n            in the education sector. Mexico has achieved universal\n            primary education and gender equality, meeting the education\n            related Millennium Development Goals as well as focusing on\n            improving quality and relevance."}, "docdt": "2010-10-25T06:52:05Z"}
