development outcome was negligible\n            to low, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included:  The project confirmed that flexibility is\n            paramount in dealing with a project that is being\n            implemented while a major reform program is in progress.\n            Commitment and support of government at various levels and\n            strong ownership at the power utility level is a key to the\n            success of the sector reform and technical assistance (TA)\n            programs. Piloting has been a feature characteristic of\n            Chinese reform and Bank-assisted power sector projects.\n            Project elements explicitly designed to pilot new approaches\n            include: competitive provincial power market, comprehensive\n            Distribution Management System (DMS), condition-based\n            maintenance, and leasing arrangement for a peaking\n            generation plant. This approach, coupled with flexibility in\n            the use of loan funding for low-cost high impact TA, could\n            be a successful means to further reform and innovations.\n            Delays in government clearance and approval process resulted\n            in significant delays of project implementation. Effective\n            re-scheduling and re-organizing project construction\n            activities by experienced implementing agencies can often\n            catch up delays during the project implementation and\n            minimize the impacts. Cost estimates proved to be too high\n            and resulted in excessive front-end fee and commitment\n            charges to the Borrower. Significant cost savings were also\n            achieved by a number of other Bank-assisted power\n            project's in China. In-depth review of project design\n            and unit prices could help reduce unnecessary financing costs."}, "docdt": "2008-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
