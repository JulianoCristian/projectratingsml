"This is an environmental assessment of\n            the Tongbai Pumped Storage Project, which operates a pumping\n            station and sub-stations to regulate peak energy demand,\n            provide emergency service, and ensure the safe operation of\n            the East China Power Grid. Possible negative impacts caused\n            by project construction will be offset by the following\n            countermeasures: The unstable slope caused by the large\n            variation in the water level of the upper and lower\n            reservoirs will be closely monitored. A flood releasing\n            tunnel built will be set up and people alerted when the\n            reservoir is being discharged. Project affected persons will\n            be resettled locally and the land resources available per\n            capita will be minimally changed. To offset negative impacts\n            to the ecological environment in the resettlement host area,\n            the area will be afforested and protected as a bamboo, tea,\n            and fruit tree zone to attract tourists. A wastewater\n            discharge plan will alleviate the impact of sewage discharge\n            on water quality. Artificial watering will control quarry\n            construction and road pavement dust. Vehicle washing in the\n            area of the lower reservoir will avoid water pollution in\n            the area of the upper reservoir. Waste oil will be burned or\n            shipped away; and wastewater from mechanical equipment will\n            be centrally treated before discharge. Sewage will be\n            diverted to septic tanks, and the manure used as fertilizer,\n            while dining hall sewage will be discharged through an\n            oil-separation pool. Drinking water will be sterilized."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
