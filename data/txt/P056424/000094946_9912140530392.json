These objectives will be supported by the\n            following components: 1) The development of the Tongbai\n            pumped storage power plant, based on an existing upper\n            reservoir, will consist of a new lower reservoir, impounded\n            by a dam, with connecting tunnels, and an underground\n            powerhouse. An environmental management plan will be\n            implemented, as will a resettlement action plan to protect\n            the affected population. In addition, the component includes\n            consulting services, for engineering, design, procurement,\n            and construction management assistance. 2) The transmission\n            reinforcement comprises erection of twin transmission lines\n            connecting the Tongbai plant to a 500 kv grid, and\n            construction of substations. Existing substation lines will\n            be expanded, and telecommunication equipment will be\n            supplied, covering customer service centers. 3) A\n            competitive program for power market development, and sector\n            restructuring will be implemented."}, "docdt": "1999-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
