1.     Preface
1.1    Project Background and Purpose of ELA,
Alon2 with the continuous economic boost. the power load of the East
China Power Grid increases vear by vear and the difference in peak
and valley load is getting bigger accordingly. However. the peak
re-ulatin- capacity of the zrid is increased little. resultine, in the
conspicuous peak- regulation problem.
The East China Power Grid takes thermal power as its main power
source; particularly. the thermal units put into operation in recent years
are mainly of large therrnal units of high voltage and high temperature.
The percentage of hydropower (the total installed capacity of the
hvdropower units wvith unit capacity of 6MW  or above bein2
2385.5MW) is gettinz smaller and smaller (only 6.°2%/o)Because of
insuffliciency in peak regulating capacity. the power output in peak
period can hardly be balanced; therefore, the power consumption in
this period has to be limited. resulting in operation in low frequency.
On the other hand, in the valley period. the large capacity thermal units
have to operate bv fire-banking, which causes difficulties in operation
of the grid, resulting in abnormal operation in high frequency of the
power grid in valley load period. At the same time. limitation of power
consumption will cause great economic losses.
From the actual situation of the East China Power Grid. the buildine of
pumped storage station or gas turbines can solve the peak regulation
problem. Although having advantages such as short construction
periocL prominent features in meeting urgent need and close-in
location to the trunk lines or load center of the grid. gas turbines
operate at a high operation cost by using heavy, light oil or natural gas:
while the pumped storage station can. beside taking both peak and
trough load, provide dynamic benefits in condenser operation and
serving as standby for emergency, and stabilize the frequency of the
grid fiDr which no other type of power sources can offer. In the case
that more nuclear power units are put into operation in the power grid.
construction of certain pumped storage stations is quite necessarn in
solving the peak regulation of the grid and ensuring safe operation of
the grd.
In the past few vears. some 50 sites valuable for building pumped
storage projects have been found during census of pumped storage
power resource in Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, among
which the Tongbai Pumped Storage Power Project site is one of the
most Cdx coablc ji,cs  rthermDrc, the site is closc to the Qinsha.-
Nuclear Power Stations, the operation curve of the nuclear power units
and the pumped storage power units can be approaching to the load
curve of the grid. This shows that construction of TBP for safe, stable

and economic operation of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Stations and
solving the problerr. in peak regulation of the grid is not only necessan
but also feasible.
East China investigation and Desizn Institute (ECIDI). entrusted b!
the project client, has undertak-en the feasibili5 studv of TBP. For this
purpose. this Environmental Impact Assessment is prepared based on
the "Environmental Protection Law  of the Peoples Republic of
China" and "Implenentation Regulations of Environmental Protection
for Construction Projects' and pursuant to the requirements of the
World Bank on environmental protection for construction projects
financed bv the Bank.
In order to make the project in full play and develop the economy in
the reservoir peripheries in a coordinate way with the environment.
deep-going survey has been conducted in the existing environmental
conditions within the project affected region. overall analysis.
assessment and prediction have been performed on the possible impact
on the natural and social environment caused bv construction of the
project. and meanwhile. some countermeasures and alleviation and
protection measures against the unfavorable impact are proposed.

2.7      Construction Planning
2. 7.1    Construction Lavout
The elevation difference between the upper and lower reservoirs is
about 300 m. thus, the project construction  is arranged at two sites
respectively  at the  upper and  lower reservoir  areas  to  facilitate
construction activities. The larze terrain or gentle maintain slopes at
both sites are rather hi2h in elevation and generally will not be aftected
by floods, which provide favorable topographical conditions for
construction arrangement. However, great efforts should be made to
TB/EIAR02                                    2-7



use the land in a reasonable way so as to minimize land acquisition for
construction. The  construction  camp  and  in-situ  offices wiIl be
arranaed within  1-1.5 km  ran2e around the sites w ith convenient
accesses. The iand occupation for construction is listed in Table 2.2
below.

According to the topographical conditions. in the upper reservoir area.
two s'poil areas with a total spoil containing volume of 492400 m'. will
be arranged . No. 1 spoil area is at the col near the side of the subsidiars
darn. which will be used for the permanent equipment storing area: and
No.2 is in a col 0.8 km  awav from  the intake'outlet of the upper
reservoir. The total spoil volume in the lower reservoir area is 1496000
m'. which will be dumped in the easily accessible cols on the left bank
within 2.5-3.5 km range downstream the dam.
The general construction lavout is shown in the attached drawina
HX2-'2FWB-8D2-2.
27.2.  Construction Period
The first generating unit w ill be put into operation in four vears and six
months counting from commencement of project construction. and the
total construction period of the project is five years and 10 months.
2.7.3   Construction Diversion
Upper reservoir:   The  power  tunnel  of  the  existing  Tongbai
Hydropouwer Station will be used as diversion path during upper
reservoir construction. Pre-cast concrete pipe wvill be used to extend the
diversion path to the outside of the cofferdam which is built for
rehabilitation of the existing dam.
Lower reservoir:   Considering the hydrological and topographical
characeLe-i,ics and requircrnciLt of cansi.rct.   1b,,-: and ccxin
of the reservoir water release channel with the downstream water way,
it is preliminarily planned to dam the river in one stage and divert the

river flow throuah a new tun.nel.
27.4   Access Roads
It is preliminarily planned that the goods can be transported by railway
to Cao'e Railwav Station and then transshipped to the site by truck-s. or
can be shipped to Beilun Harbor or Shanghai Porn and then forwarded
to the site by trucks or railway.
A 0.88 km long newz permanent highway will be built. a section of 3.0
km  long existing  highwav will be broadened. and a small-sized
hiahway bridze will be built. Besides. arn existing permanent highw,ay
about 6.0 km long for tourist use will also be used during construction.
W ithin the construction site. it is planned to built 3.4 km  long
temporany access roads. 1.73 krn long permanent roads. a temporary
bridge and a permanent bridge.
2.7.5   Labor Force. Main Engineering Quantities and Main Construction
Materials
Durinz construction. it requires an averaze force of 2030 people and
3800 in the construction peak period. The total man'days will be
3502000.
The main engineering quantities are shown in Table 2.3.
The main construction materials required by the project include:
cement 94800 tons. steel 6100 tons, reinforcing bar 11200 tons. timber

3.1    Natural Environment
3.1.1  Meteorology
Tongbai Pumped Storage Power Project is located at the Northwest of
the Chengguan Tonm, Tiantai County. where belongs to the subtropical
monsoon climate zone, with a moderate climate, abundant rainfall and
sunshine. The feature of four seasons is salient.
According to the statistics recorded between vears 1961 to 1980 by the
meteolo2ical stations in Tiantai County. the annual mean temperature is
16.8°C. the mean low temperature 5.0'C and the lowest temperature of
-9.1 C in Januar'; mean high temperature of 28.30C and the highest of
41.7°Cin July. In this catchment. the annual mean precipitation is 1320.5
mmrn with 160.2 rainfall days. The rainfall mainly concentrated in March
to September. which it occupies 79.3%/o of the annual precipitation in
whole year. The annual mean evaporation is 920.7 mm and the annual
sunshine time is about 2036.6 hours. The wind direction in summer is
main1v ES & BES in March to August and the wind direction in winter
is mainlv WN & WWYVN in November to next Februa-.
3.1 .2 Hvdrology and Sedimentation
The lower reservoir is located on the Baizhangkeng tributarv. upstream
of the Shifengxi River. Above the damsite, the river length is 12.7 km
and catchment area is 21.4 kin2, among which about 7.68 km of the
upstream with the catchment area 5.5 km2 is directly flows into the
upper reservoir. The actual catchment area above the damsite is 5.92
kmr and the annual mean discharge is about 0.14m3/s at the dam site.
The existing Tongbai reservoir will be used as the upper reservoir, with
2
catchmznt area about 6.7kM . As the upper reservoir has a large storage
capacit-y but with less water inflow, its potentiality is still not be fully
developed. Comrnmencement in 1966, according to the conditions of
topographv and geology, the interbasin water diversion was carried out
for supplemental water of storage in Tongbai Reservoir, which was
respect: vely taken from the rivers in the areas of Xibaizhangkeng,
Tianhuang and Xikeng in Tiantai County. The relative details for basic
status in water diversion area were shown in Drawing 4-2-1. At present,
the total interbasin water diversion area reached 54.2kM2 with long-term
mean discharne 1.71 m3/s and long-term mean discharae 53.90 million
m.
The sediment at the reservoir is mainly coming from the farmland and
TB,'EIAR03                         3-1



slope erosion in upstream  area and impacted by the activities of the
human beings. The annual average sediment amount of suspended load
between upper reservoir and lower reservoir is 15 40t and 492-0:..
transported bed load  380t and 87 80t respectively.
3.1.3   Geology
The project site is located on the rolling region. the south end of the
second upwvarping district which belongs to the New Cathvsian Svstem.
Its basic seismic intensity is less than RI on Richter's scale.
The upper reservoir is located in a gulch. a higher denudation plane
northeast of the Tiantai Basin which disinteprated in ancient time. The
reservoir was surrounding by undulatinz hills with elevation between
500 to 570 m. The terrain of reservoir basin slopes gentl\ and the bank
slope cleuch dissected shallowly with the reservoir -gradient 25 to 35
degree usually. Along the ridge of the reservoir bank. the lowest pass
locates in northwest side. near the Qiongtaicun 'Village. which the
ground elevation is about 411 .5m  and the groundw ater level about
404.48m (measured in March 13, 1994). the elevation of the other
passes are all over 420 m. Most bank slopes in the reservoir area are
c.omposed of the rhvolite hvalo-crvstal breccia welded tuff. Due to the
h%;draulic action. within the water variation amplitude of the original
reservoir. the weathered bed rock, slope wash and eluvium are exposed
and its thickness usually is between 1 to 2m without large faults
existing in the reservoir area.
Upper reservoir, an uniform earth dam, was completed in 1958, this
foundation rock was composed of the weakly-weathered-fresh granite
and rhvolite hvalo-crvstal breccia welded tuff. The faults and joints
were not developed and the rock integrity are good. The recessed depth
of the relative water resisting laver is in 32.3-40.7m. i.e. elevation of
350.0 to 359.3 m, which is lower than the reservoir's normal storage
level.
The lower reservoir is located on tributarvy of the Sanmaoxi River, the
middle reach of Baizhangxi River. The valley appears an "U" shape
with the peak elevation about 300 m. The elevation of the lowest pass
in end reservoir is about 144.8 m, which is higher than the norrnal water
level exposed with the intermission small springs. Tne massive and
high mountain bodies on the left bankL are formed by granites and the
rhydite hvalo-crvstal breccia welded tuff inr vpper series of Jurassic
system in later Yanshan period with the gradient about 30 to 35 degrees.
In reservoir area, the vegetation is developed and the rocks are hard
TB/HIAR03                            3-2



with comparatively integrity and stable bank slopes. The rocks of right
bank  composed  of the  medium-thicken  laminated  conglomerate
intercalating the medium-thinness argillaceous pow der sandstone in
Cretaceous sy stem. The rock- formation inclined to inside of the
mountains and upstream direction. The slopes are steep at upside and
gentle at toe with the gradient about 20 to 35 below elevation 130 to
150 m and about 40 to 50 over elevation 150 m. but the stabilit- of the
slopes are stable.
The lower dam site is located near the Baizhang Village and the vallev
appears "U" shape. The bottom width in natural water level is about
130 to 140 m and surface width is about 375 m in normal water storaae
level. At left dam abutment and river bed. there are scattered the granite.
rhvolite hvalo-crvstal breccia welded tuff and felsophyre: the -right bank-
congilomerated intercalating breccia powder sandstone. interbedding of
conglomerate and breccia siltstone. Along the positive slope. there
exists a group of low-angle dip structural planes which is not developed,
thus its stability is relatively good.
3.1 .4  Wvater quality
3.1.4.1 Pollutio:n Sources
Since no industrial enterprises existed in the whole catchment area
including water conservancy area of the upper reservoir and areas
surrounding the upper and lower reservoirs of the Tongbai Pumped
Storage Project. there is no any industrial polluting sources.
As inhabitants are mainly concentrated in Baizhang Village, only few
ones lived in the catchment area above the lower dam site. after
reservoir creation, these inhabitants will be resettled to other place. In
whole upper reservoir area, only about 1832 persons scatter there, with
few domestic sewage discharges.
Agricultural polluting sources are mainly from the chemical fertilizer
and pesticides. In area of the upper and lower reservoir, the cultivated
land area is 1400 mu in total. Based on the single crop of rice.
consumption of the fertilizer is about 50 kg/mu and pesticide about
lkg!mu. which is lower than the average level in Zhejiang Province as
well as in China. It is shown that the content of the nitrogen (N') and
phosphorus (P) flowing to reservoir is small.

3.1.4.2 Monitorino of Water QualitrV
There whas no monitorin2 points within catchm-ent area of the upper
reservoir and Baizhanaxi Stream w here the power station located. lp to
Oct. 1993. due to requirement for evaluation. ECIDI entrusted the
Tiantai Environmental Monitorinc2  Station to undertake monitoring
works for wA ater qualirn both in the upper and lower reser-oir. Therefore.
a monitorina section wxas set up separately on upper and lower reservoir
area (the details shows in the Drawincs 5 - Location Sketch for Water
Qualim- Monitorinz Sections). 24 items were monitored twice
respectively at wet. normal and drv season in a year. The monitoing
items are of water temperature. pH value, suspended materials. total
hardness. saturated oxv2en. CODcr. BOD;. N7H--N. subnitrate. nitrate.
Ar-OH. CN  Hg. Pb. Cd. As. Cr' . petroleum, transparencN. natural
turbid. fluoride. T-P. total bacteria. escherichia coil, etc.
3.1 4.3 Status of W'ater Quality
Based on the monitorin2 records (refers to Table 3-1 and Table 3-2).
except items of total bacteria and escherichia coil, the others are
basically up to Grade-II of the "Environmental Standards of Surface
Water" (GB3838-88) as shownm; in Table 3-S. It shows that the water
quality in this area is perfect.
3.2    Ecolooical Environment
3..1   Terrestrial flora
The flora in area around the upper and lower reservoir are mainly
composed of the mason pines. Tne forest coverage rate reaches 59%
and without precious plants to be found.
3.2.2   Terrestrial Organism
Based or. data recorded by Tiantai Afforestation Department. the white-
neck- pheasants and pangolins were found in the catchment area above
the dam site of the lowver reservoir. Accordina to "Wildlife Preservation
Law of the People's Republic of China". the state practices protection
for the \ildlife especially the rare and endanaered species. The key
wildlife protected b\ the state are divided into the national Grade-I
protected animals and the national Grade-II protected animals. The
white-neck pheasant is given national Grade-I protection status and the
pan-ohin is given national Grade-Il protection status. In the catchment.

4      Forecast of Environmental Impact & Countermeasures
4.1    Impact on Reservoir Slope Stability
4.1.1   Upper Reservoir
The a-ound topography of slope of upper reservoir is relatively uniform.
with natural slope of 25,-35. The overburden is in 0.5-1.0m thick with
good vegetation. It is mostly formed by granite and iznimbrite. less
development of faults, more  development of joints  and  deep
weatherina i.e. completely- weathered of 1-3m thick. max.7-1Om. and
strongly weathered of 10-1 5m thick.
The bottom topography of reservoir is relatively flat and wide. By the
drilling information. the sedimentation of reservoir is usually l-2m
thick after more than 30 vears operation of Tongbai Project.
The slope within water level variation area is formed by strongly-
weathered or completely- weathered rock(soil), with a gentle slope of
lf'-25. There is no major unstable slope. But. there is small scale of
slope falling case in the condition of sharp variation of water level.
The natural slope above water is about 30°. The overburden is thin.
usuallI. 0.5-1.0m thick-, 1-3m for completelv-weathered laver, 5-7m
for local area. 10-1Sm for stronglv-weathered laver, less development
of faults and more development of joints . There is no major unstable
slope. Only two small slip masses are near Xi-ao village on the right
bank in meddle of reservoir and upstream of intake/outlet, which is in
stable state. The gentle dip plane is distributed on the right bank near
the end of reservoir and on the left bankb at middle of reservoir with
(See Drawing 7 .)  It is now described as below:
(1) Shallow Slip Mass Near Xi-Ao Village
The slip mass is distributed along the reservoir bank. about 50m long
and 20m wide. The bottom elevation is at El.396m. The slip mass is of
completely and strongly-weathered, rhyolitic and crvstal tuff. about 4m
thick. The completely and strongly-weathered laver, about 4000m;. is
slid dow%n for about Im due to earth excavation for brick production. It
is stable now.
(2) Slip Mass Above Intake/Outlet
It is a small scale shallow slip mass which is stopped for development.
The b-.ttom -nevaton of slip t:ngue at E1.407.5m. The slip mass is of
deluvium and alluvium soil, about 3-7m thick, within an area of 15 x
TB/EIAR04                           4 -1



3Om. The total quantity is about 15OOrr. The talus material is sli2htl%
cemented. There is expansion phenomena when vertical slope is
reached to 7m high. The slip mass is stopped for further development.
(3) Slope W-ith Low Angle Joint At Right Bank Near Reservoir End
The slope is located at 7Om downstream the bridge near resenroir end.
The slope strike is in  N20'. E. with a natural angle of 30Q. Two
consequent. low  angle structural plans wvere developed.   w ith
occurrence of NT_8V. E. and SE <15c. filled with secondanr soil and
rock debris. The local area was opened for 5-10ccm. the joint face was
bend and rough. Two joints were in 7-8m space. The upper joint was
pass through whole slope and its min. elevation of occurrence was at
El.396m. The lower joint was not pass throuzh whole slope and its
bottom was not exposed. The slope status is stable. No unstable case
will be happened because the bottom occurrence elevation is above the
max. storage water level.
(4) Consequent Fault-Slope At Left Bankl In Middle Of Reservoir Near
Dong-Ao Village
The slope is located upstream of Dong-ao village. A drumlin is there
ir. S60°, W. with a natural angle of 20-25c. One consequent fault was
developed. with occurrence of N650. W. and SW <45'. The fault was
in 10-30cm wide, developed wvith structural breccia. No unstable case
will be happened because the dip angle of fault is steeper than slope.
As a whole. the surrounding slopes of the upper reservoir is good for a
pumped storage project: the unstable case in large scale will not be
happened. but unstable case in small scale mav possibly be caused
locally by sharp variation of water level. Besides, the bottom sediment
is possibly to move to intake/outlet due to sharp variation of water
level.
4.1.2   Lower Reservoir
Tne around slope of lower reservoir is of rock with different rock
litholouic character. Therefore, the form, structural plan and
development mode of each section is varied.
(1) The slope at reservoir head, left bank at middle of reservoir and right
bank at reservoir end is of mid-dip slope of ignimbrite, slope strike of
most sections in NW, less in NE, with a slope dip of 30-40'. The
overburden is shallow, usually, in 0.5-1.0m thick. The strata near
ground surface is strongly weathered for 5-1im thick and the lowei
TB/EIAR04                           4 - 2



part is w,eakly weathered. The rockL is hard and integrate. The slope dip
is gentle. shallow  and weak development for unloading zone. less
development for consequent low  dip angle structural plane. The
structLral plane has two high dip angle joints in NW. and NWW. No
structural condition for unstable slope is found and nor trace of
deformation appeared. It is estimated that the w hole slope will be stable
after creation of resernvoi.
(2) Both banks at reservoir end section is of high dip anzie slope of granite.
slope strike in NE. with a dip of 65,90°. The landforn is of deep-cut
valley. The overburden is scatter and shallow. The strongly-weathered
laver was fully fallen by gravit. It is mainly of weaklv-weathered rock.
with inte_rate rock character. The unloadine zone wvas mostly fallen
and joint well developed in NE and NWU  and closed. with iess
development for consequent low  dip angle structural plane. No
structural condition for unstable slope is found and there is new
unloading zone on top. Tension joint is locally developed. It is
estimated that the whole slope will be stable after creation of reservoir.
only with fewA small unstable bodies dropped off due to gravity
function.
(3) The slope from right abutment to right bank at mid of reservoir is of
gravel strata with reversed dip in N'W. The angle below El.140m  is
2540' and above El.140m is 50-65°. The overburden is usually in
0.5-1.0m thick. The strata near ground surface is strongly weathered
for 10--20m thick and the lower strata are weaklv weathered. The rock
is relativelv hard and integrate. The fault and joint and unloading zone
below El.140m is not developed, and rarely developed above El. 140m.
The strata occurrence is of SN-N40°,W, and W  or SYW<25-40'. It is
hard cemented and reversed dip to slope. No structural condition for
unstable slope is found. It is estimated that the whole slope will be
stable after creation of reservoir.
(4) The slope from right bank at mid of reservoir to end of reservoir is of
gravel strata with reversed dip, where is a low bank section. The slope
is low in 25,40'. The peakL elevation is at 162.3-191.8m, in strike of
NS. The overburden is shallow, usually, in 0.2-0.5m thick. The strata
near ground surface is strongly weathered for 1I0-2Gm thick and the
lower part is weakly weathered. The rock is hard and integrate. The
fault and joint and unloading zone is not developed. The strata
occurrence is of NS, E<25-35'. It is hardly cemented. No structural
condition for unstable slop. is found and nor trace of defornatiol
appeared. It is estimated that the whole slope will be stable after
TB/EIAR04                           4 - 3



creation of reservoir.
As a whole. no large scale of unstable slope is found and no unstable
case will be happened after creation of reservoir. But. local unstable
case will be caused by sharp variation of water level. Besides. the fine
material of bottomn alluvial deposit of Q4 . 3-6m thick.  is possibly to
move to intakeioutiet due to sharp variation of water level.
Both upper and lower reservoir of Tongbai Pumped Storage Power
Project has large variation of water level. Therefore, the protection
work,s for possible unstable slope shall be pe-formed. During operation
period. the possible unstable slope shall be closely monitored and
remedc  measures shall be taken by the reservoir management unit if
the event is happened.
4.1.3   Highways around the Reservoir
Accordinc to the olannin- of the tourist department of Tiantai count%. a
hiahxva\ fromn Toncbai iower reservoir to Shilian- Touris: Zone wvill be
constructed. At nresenL. . a secTion of the hiahwa% from lo\er reserVoir
to left abutment of the upper reservoir. about 9km. has been basicall\
compieted b! the local communication department. Construction of the
remaininz section (from the left abutment of the upper reservoir to
Shilianc Tourist Zone) is not vet commenced. Of this remainin- section.
r,art of it w-ill run along the left bank of the upper reservoir. If the spoils
from excavation of the highway dumped along the mountain slopes,
part of them w ill be washed into the upper reservoir, which will reduce
the effective storage of the reservoir. Therefore, the highway
construction must be carried out with a specific water and soil
conservation plan formulated according to the state-issued Law  of
Water and Soil Conservation and the Regulations on Preparation and
Implementation of Water and Soil Conservation Plan for Construction
Projects issued by Ministry of Water Resources. During construction.
the design in the plan should be strictly observed, dumping spoils at
designated spoil areas and adopting relevant measures including
engineering and vegetation.
4.2    Impact on Water Quality
There are no industrial enterprises within the area of upper reservoir.
lower reservoir, water conveyance zone and whole basin. The upper
reservoir has been operated for more than 30 vears. By the water
quality monitoring information from  Tiantai County  environment
inornitoriig station(rcfer to Table 3-1 - Table 3-2. the cunient water
TB/EIAR04                           4 - 4



quality is good. After establishment of the power station, the frequent
change of water bod- between upper reservoir and lower reservoir
is good for aeration. which will increase the content of solutior oxygen
into water of reservoir and promote the resolution of organism. But, the I
turbi6:lt of local area near intak-e/outlet will be increased due to the
large diversion discharge. Therefore. the turbidity is typically evaluated
in accordance w ith the features of pumped storage power project.
4.2.1   Analysis  On  Sediment Of Upper Reservoir And  Lower
Reser-voir
The existinz reservoir of Tonzbai Power station will be used as the
upper reservoir of this project. Tne catchment area is of 60.9km
(including diversion area of 54.2kn2 ) with good vegetation. The
coming sediment is very small because the water diversion is through
channel or tunnel. The sediment impact is small.
The long-term  mean  sand transportation  at da-n site  of lower
reservoir is 13700t. Based on this data, the bed load and suspended
load after 50 vears operation will be 510000m'. Considering that the
bed load is at the end of reservoir and suspended load(l 70000m') is in
front of dam. the sediment elevation will be 93.6m. According to the
project layout. the bottom elevation of intake/outlet of lower
reservoir is of 98m. Therefore. it will not impact to the normal
operation of structures.
4.2.2   Operation Impacting To Local Regime At Intake/Outlet
(1) Operation Impacting To Local Regime At Intake/Outlet Of Upper
Reservoir
The normal water storage level of upper reservoir is 395.56m.
corresponding storage capacity 11.57 million m3, dead water level
376.00m. and active power storage capacity 10.12 million m'. There
are two intake/outlets and its bottom elevation is at El.360m.
By the general pattern of power generation mode, the contracting
current is at inlet area. current velocity is vertically larger on upper part
and smaller on lower part. The plane current velocitv is uniformly
distributed.
For the pumping mode, the intake of upper reservoir will serve as
outlet.   The water current is hard to diffuse by impacting  of
cenLilfugal force frnm upper bend pine because the water velocity
inside the diversion pipe is large. It flows downward to the bottom of
TB/EIARO4                           4 - 5



inlet. wvhich results a big velocitB there and uneven velocity distr'ibution.
return flow or vortex al lower wVater level and turbulent regime.
In. order to zet even diffusion of flo-,. four bays are designed for each
inmake outlet . 6G0m  wvide and 11.5m  high for each bay. The max.
dischar2e is 293.4m>s. and mean velocity al intak-e 1.06rns. For ihe
sake of avoiding vortex. the anti-vortex beams and diffusion sections
of reinforcement concrete box culvert  are to be set at the entrance.
44.6m  long. 28.2m  wide at inlet and oTaduallv transferring to a
quadrate-section of r.'m. In order to avoid erosion to riverbed near
intake. concrete apron  is designed. 156m  long  and  84m  w ide.
According to the turbulent jet formula. the water velocity at 150m
away the outlet is dow^n to 0.41m.s for pumping mode. which will be
decreased alon_ with increase of distance. As a result. the flow beyond
the apron has no big fluctuation.
(2) Operation Impacting To Local Regime At Intake'Outlet Of Lower
Reservoir
The normal water stora2e level of lower reservoir is 139.23m.
corresponding storage capacity 12.8973 million m. dead water level
110.0Gm. active power storage capacity  10.6T3million m'. and
drawdown depth 29.66m. There are four intake/outlets and its bottom
elevation is at El.93.5m.
For the pumping mode. the tailrace will serve as inlet.  The velocity
distribution is relatively even.
For the power generation mode, the tailrace will be served as outlet.
The high velocitr zone will be moved to left side and the current
velocitv is unevenly distributed due to the influence of rotational
current by the spinning of turbine.
The type of intake/outlet of lower reservoir is the same as that of
upper reservoir. with 3 bays, 9.Om high, 5.5m wide. 19.3m wide for all.
The diff-usion sections if intake/outlet is 35.Om long. max. diversion
discharge  146.7m'/s.  The anti-vortex beams are set on top of
intake/outlet and trashrack behind the beam, with velocity of 0.99mis.
Similar as the upper reservoir, the concrete apron is designed on the
riverbed near intake/outlet, 100m long and 110m wide. According to
the turbulent jet formula, the water velocity at I00m awav the outlet is
down to 0.42rns for power generating mode. As a result. the flow
bevond the apron has no big fluctuation.

4.2.3   Turbiditv Analvsis on Local WVater Area near Intake/Outlet
Bv the long-term recorded da:a and load forecast of the East China
powArer system. the trough load period is between 23:00 to 6:00. 4 units
will be start for pumping operation in this period. The peak load
periocd is between 8:00 to 11:00 and 16:00 to 2 1:00. The units will be
start -or power generating operation in this period according to the
peak- r egulation requirement of the power system.
Accordinc to the analvsis of regime of local w ater area near
intake/'outlet. the regime at upper reservoir is turbulent in pumping
mode, and the regime at lower reservoir is turbulent in generating mode,
which increases the turbiditv of local water area near intake/outlet.
Nevertheless, interval between two operation modes is more than 2
hours. most of sand particles are settlinM down during this period. The
check dam will respectively be set at 40mr in front of intake!outlet of
upper reservoir and 35m in front of intakeioutlet of lower reservoir.
With the measures mentioned above, it is estimated that the turbidity
will be correspondingly decreased.
Also. it is recommended to set terrace or increase area of apron near
intake"outiet to reduce to the minimum the turbidity caused by large
discharge frequently exchanged between the two reservoirs.
After completion of the power station. frequent exchange of water
body betsween upper/'lowe-r reservoirs is in general favorable for
aeration. thus increasing the dissolved oxygen and promotina the
organic degradation; therefore the wNater quality can be improved. As
diverted discharge is fairly large. the local turbiditN w,ill increase in the
v icinity  of the intakes/outlets. But, after adoptinp the measures
mentioned above. the turbidirt wvill only slightlv increased in a very
small ran-e near the -area of' the intakes/outlets of the upperilower
reservoirs. resulting in slight influence on the water quality.  It is
estimated that the water quality of the lower reservoir is good. except
slight increase of suspended substances wvithin a range of 280 m from
intake,'outlet of the lower reservoir to the inlet./outlet of the power
station.

(2) Water Equilibrium  in Upper/Lower Reservoir and Change Of
Hvdrological Regime at Downstrearn
The flow- of the Baizhangxi and its downstream are mainly from rainfall.
The river lenath, above the damsite of the lower reservoir, is 12.7km with
the catchment area of 21.4km2, among which upstream about 7.68 km
with the catchment area of 15.5 km2 directly flowing into the upper
reservoir. The actual catchment area above the damsite of lower reservoir
is 5.92 km2 and the long-term mean discharge is 0.14m./. Based on the
historical records. the wvater interception or arroyo phenomenon of the
Baizhanzxi River has never been happened, even in the most drought vear.
The catchment area of the upper reservoir is about 6.7kmr. which most
water was obtained by the interbasin water diversion. Through this method.
the catchment area will be reached  54.2km2. The long-terrn mean

water loss by evaporation and leak-ace wili be added4 b- natural flow for the
norrnal reservoir operation. After analyzing the recorded data between 1967 to
1992. it shows that the inflow  of reservoir is abundant except t.hat the
precipitation is smaller thar. evaporation in drou-ht of the dr- year. Therefore.
the corm.pensation storage capacity of reservoir is alread\ reserved as selecting
the ren.ulation resernoir capacity. Tne water loss by evaporation ancd leakage will
be added by natural flow- for the normal reservoir operation so that it can satisf
the recuirement for generation.
The existing Tongbai Power Station had beer pu. into operation after extension
in 1976.  ith installation capacity 2 X 4000Kw. Leneratinv dischar2e 2 X
I 7nrr,s. The tailrace water throuch the dive-sion channel (See Autached Drawinc-
flows into the Grade-El power station about 2 klm1 dov,,stream (installation
capacity '  X  400OKvwu). After generation. the water then flows into the
Baizhangxi River. After completion of the Tongbai Pumped Storage Power
Station. the original Tongbai Power Station will be shut down. And the water
from the upper reservoir and interbasin will flow into the lower reservoir.{TneV
normal inflowA conditions. The surplus water in the lower reservoir will be
released through the flood release/diversion tunnel on the right bank. discharging
time and volume will be determined by the inflow discharge, generally. the
discharge released will be controlled less than 50m3/s (the safe discharge for the
downstream). and should not be in a sudden manner. and in the drv season, the
released discharge will be controlled at 5-1Omr3s. In the flood season. the
discharge througTh the flood release tunnel will be same as the natural floods, the
max. discharge may reach 240m'/s. When the lower reservoir water level exceeds
the weir crest elevation of the spillway the water will be released by gravity.
The daliv inflovv is relatively smaller in draught season. except release discharge
procedure will be varied, the release discharge was basicallv no variance
whatever before or after construction of the reservoir. Therefore, the dailv off-
water time is relativelv longer in 3km  interval between downstream  of the
damsite and the confluence of the Sanmao River and Baizhanzxi River. In the
most draught vear (anal'zing based on the information records for reservoir
regulation of Tongbai power station between 1977 to 1992, the most draught
monthly mean flow is 0.008m3/s in the upper reservoir), the water inflow is
smaller than evaporation, there will have no abundant inflow to discharge.
As the reasons mention above,the hvdrological regime in reservoir area and
downstream will be obviously changed after the operation of Tongbai

Pumped Storage Powe- Project. The natural river channel becomes into
reservoir. with about '9m  of water level fluctuation. The hvdrolozical
rezime downstream  will be largely influenced by operation condition and
inflow  from  upstreamr. Ref&. tL) Table 4C  for h%drolocgical characteristis
otlongba' upper'iower reservoirs and proi: .. affected areas.
In addition. the purpose of arranging the fiooc releasing turnnel on the righ:
bank of the lower reservoir is (a) to use it for releasing fiood for the
reservoir. and (b) to release reservoir water (or emptr-ing the reservoir) for
maintenance, repair or for emerzent case. For the above mentioned
purposes. the average releasing capacit- of the tunnel 50 m3;s is rational
and is the safe discharae for the lower reaches of the river. However, a
river section about 3 km  lonc downstream  the dam  is usuallv in drv status.
where the nearby villagers (particularly the children) and livestock may
enter the place, and thev may- be injured in the case of sudden releasing
water throuzh the tunnel. Therefore. for the sake of safety. sudden release
at 50 m'/s should  be avoided  but the discharge  should  be  zraduallv
increased to this standard. at least with a duration ove- 15 minutes. At this
nver section. should be set with safety lines, warning boards, warnin_
lamps for warning bells (for alarming the people and the livestock in the
vicinitv). Necessary safety education is needed so as to keep the children
awav from enterin the dangerous area.

(3) Impact on Downstream Water Qualirx
.After the completion of TBP. a fiood releasing tunnei is designed below
the dead level of the lower reservoir. the da.lv discharze will not basically
be changed as compared with that before the reservoir formation and only
the dischar-ina interval has change. Since no industrial enterprises exist in
the catclument area below the damsite and above the Countv toy T., thus.
has no anr  industrial polluting sources there. The polluting sources are
mainlv from the sewagrae discharge and the az-icultural pollution. such as
the chemical fertilizer and pesticide scourinJg by the rainfall. Due to the
drinking water was not directl  taken  from  the stream  water. the
construction of this power station will not cause influences both for water
quality and water quantities in downistream.
(4) Impact On Downstreamr Water Supplv
About 2300 persons of Lingjiao, Tianvangjin, Baizhang. Maceyang.
Xiaozhu and Shatouzhu villages live along the interval from damsite of
lower reservoir to tributar- of Baizhangxi river and Sanmaoxi river. The
livinz water for villagers was taken from wells before 1986. The fluoride
content in well water is high, resulting high endemic disease. So, the
running water has been supplied since 1986. The water source of runnin_
water is rnostly from wells. but it will supplied only after treatment. The
wvater supply capacity in downstream Chengguan Water Plant is 30000 tid.
and the water resource is taken the groundwater from the shallow laver in
Shifencg River. By the yearly practices sho-wn that the supplementary of the
groundwater for the area near the valley, city or townships are all large.
which can satisfy the water consumption for domestic use, but for
azric'itrural irr gatitn it is mainly deponded o7 the north main channel
from Lishimen Reservoir. After construction of Pumped Storage Project,
TB/EIAR04                              4 - I I



the daily discharge will not basicall- be changed as compared with that
before the reser-voir formation and onl1 the discharaina interval has chance.
and there is no impact on the water supplementary to downstream shallou.
so that there is basically no impact for downstream water supply.
(5) Impact On Downstream Irrication
The landform downstream damsite of lower reservoir is wvide. The most is
farmland, about 3000mu. double crops of rice. The ir=igation water is
taken from Lishimen channel.
The Lishimen Reservoir dam is in2 a  lle. 1 km from the upstream of the
mair trunk of Shifen- River which is located on Lishimen village. Loncxi
Town (detail of the geocraphical location is shonT. in the Drawing No. 10).
where is about 41 km away from the counrv seat. The main structures of
the reservoir are composed of the concrete double-curvature arch dam
(74.3m hich). power tunnel ('141m long). hydraulic power station. north
main channel (len2t.h of 72.26 km). The catchnment area above damsite is
296 km2. which occupied 18.39% in total catchment area of the Shifenz
River. The total reservoi storage is 199 million mi, and the normal storace
122 rrmillion m,-'. It is a comprehensive reservoir mainlv for irrization and
flood protection. auxiliary for generation and fishery. After completion of
the project. it can supply w ater for irrigation about 12000 ha.. flood
protection area 4333 ha.. The powver station will be equipped with 3 X
2OOOKw  units with the vearly power vield 25.80 miiiion Kw.h. The
available water surface for fisherv reached 449 ha. and the yearly
production was approx. 100 tonnage.
The Lishimen channel will be passed through the lower reservoir area of
the Tongbai Pumped Storage Power Station. The channel includes
Baizhang Aqueduct which over-pass the Baizhanzxi River is about 1 km
long inside the reservoir area. Based on the construction plan. the aqueduct
will be relocated by adopting diversion tunnel or reservoir flume. etc..
As Lishimen reservoir is located on upstream of the main trunk of the
Shifeng River and. Tongbai Power Station is located on Baizhangxi River.
a tributanr of the Sanmao River located on middle beach of the Shifeng
River. the North Lishimen Channel only passes through the lower reservoir
of the Tongbai Pumped Storage Project, no water be taken from the
Baizhangxi River, thus there is no anv influences on the North Lishimen
Channel by the construction of this project. Therefore the construction of
Pumped Storage Project basically no impact on downstream irrigation.

4.3.2  Impact On Diversion Area Environment
The existincg catchment area of Tonrcba' Reservoir is 6.7km2 in total.
Bezinning from  1966. the interbasin project for wate7 diversion was
performed in the villaces of Xibaizhangkenz. Tianhuanc and Xikena etc..
it was cornpleted 15.5 k;m- in Baizhengkeng diversion area in 1969. 14.6
k.rr- in Huaan,kenc diversion area in Feb. 1979. 17.0 km  in Tianfen2
diversion area in March 1985. and prior to 1990, completed 71 ;km2 in
Xilken- diversion area. The interbasin water diversion area w as 54.2. kmm in
total. with mean annual discharze 1.'71~ms. and mean annual runoff
53.90million m'. The details for basic situation in diversion area refer to
the attached Drawaing 4-2-1 and Table t-3.

The total catchment area of Baizhangxi River is 35.8 km2, amona- which
the Tongbai (upper reservoir) diversion area occupies 43.3%.
Huancrtankeng River is a main trunk located on the upstream of the Luxi
River. which is a tributarn of the Shifeng River. The catchment area of the
Luxi river is 46.3km2. the Tongbai diversion area occupies 31.53%.
The catchment area of the Tianfengkeng river is 40.2km2, the Tongbai
diversion area occupies 42.29%.
The diversion area of upper reservoir located on a higher topographical
land. the diversion area and its downstream are located mostly at high and
massive rnountains. There have no villages and fields in a considerable
distances. Besides, the diversion area occupied only about 40% of the
ori=inal catchment area. the supplemental water of storage in diversion
area can be taken by- the branches of downstream rivers. Therefore. water
diversion has not caused the influences for domestic water consumption
TB/EIAR04                            4- 13



for residents in downstream area. Since the diversion projects have been
completed several years. there have no any disputes happened caused by
the difficulties of the w ater consumption.
After construction of Pumped Storage Project. its diversion capacityv will
not be increased. Therefore. there is basically no impact for diversion area
ensironment.
4.4 Impact on Fishery
The Baizhana river where the lowver reservoir is located belon-s to a
mountainous  creek. the  existing  fishern  basically  are: Leptobotia
tien.aiensis (Wu), Leptobotia  compressicauda (Nichols). Lateolabrax
japonicus (Cuvier et  Valenciennes). Silurus asorus Linriaeus, river crab.
greenish shrimps. spiral shell. freshwater mussel and crucian carp. etc..
The fishery resources in this stream is shortage so that without precious
fish to be found,
Tonzbai Reservoir was completed in 1960. the water field which can be
used for aquatic production is 54.4` ha. occupied 3.84%  of the aquatic
production area in whole county (the whole water field can be used for.
aquatic production is 1417.39 ha). The fish once bred in the Tonabai
Reservoir are: big head carp. sported silver carp. crucian carp. grass carp.
bream. etc.. Since Tonzbai Reservoir is a regulation reservoir basically for
power Generation. interchange of the water inflow- is vern quicklv. so that
the water temperature is lower than normal and fish growth is slowly with
a low production and a poor economic benefit. The annual fishery
production is only reached 5 to 10 tons, occupied 0.30/%-0.59% in total
fishery production in whole county. Calculating based on the unit
production it is 0.14t'ha only, which is greatly lower than average
production 1 .4It'ha of the whole county. Therefore, the Tongbai reservoir
can not be used for fishery production, although some fries were put into
the reservoir at the very beginning of the reservoir was formed.
At the beginning of 1996, a person from other counties came to the
reservoir administration department and signed a two-year period contract
for raising fishes in the reservoir. Before signing the contract the
department staff told the contractor the risk of signing such contract due to
the low production output and poor economic benefit; however, the
contractor insisted in having a try in believing his personal effort.
According to the contract, the contractor should pay to the department
certain amount of fees, and he had the right of raising and catching fishes
in the reservo:r and should be resnonribie fo- loss and gain: the
department would take back all the right of fishery in the reservoir. The
TB/EIARO4                           4.14



fact was that after siEnina the contract, the contractor put quite a number
of fries. including big head carp, spotted silver carp. crucian carp. grass
carp. bream. etc.. and tried to cast net to catch fish. However. the reservoir
is big and deep. the catch is vern small. resulting poor benefit. Therefore.
the depai±ment the contractor had never paid any fees to the department
and the contract was no longer continued. When the contract was expired
in 199?7 the department onl took back the ri_ht of fisherv in the reservoir.
Currentl\. the fishes in the reserXVoir run on its course onlv without
commercial va'ue. And actually there are no fishers found in the reservoir
area and the aquatic products consumed by the inhabitants around the
reservoir are bought from the free market.
Due to backw ard communication in the Toncbai Reservoir area. no
recreation facilities and the tourism scenic spots have ever been
constructed in the reservoir area and its vicinities. Fishing by local
,villaers is occasionally found.
After completing Tongbai Pumped Storage Project. the reservoir will be
not suitable for fish breeding as the power station operation features. but
also without any adverse factors to local fishern production and fishern
resources.
4.5 Impact on Landscape and tourism Historic Relics
The Tongbai Pumped Storage Power Project is located at the suburb of
Tiantai county town near the Baizhang-Qiongtai scenic spot - one of ten
scenic spots of Tiantai Mountain proposed for development (county level).
The landform downstream damsite of lower reservoir is wide. The most is
farmland. Baizhang creek upstream is zigzag with clear water. Both banks
are very steep. The pools and falls upstream are beautiful, and
Qiongtaishuangjue and Xianrenzuo spots are maznificent and breathtaking.
Nevertheless. the access along the creek is of sand and gravel road with
lower standard. heavy- dust and narrow road surface. The vegetation area is
relativelv small. The traffic inconvenience is one of reasons for further
development of this scenic spot.
A 7km IDng perrnanent road (Grade-II) from the county town to darnsite
will be rebuilt and widen. which will better the local traffic condition.
Besides, the 9km long perrnanent road (by taking use of the 6km long
existing tourism road) from damsite of lower reservoir to intake/outlet of
upper reservoir will be built to link Shiliang tourism zone, which will be
helpful for local tourism industry.

tourism  zone. Usuallv. the water will be circularity used between upper
reservoir and lower reservoir. which will not be used as resources of
tourism. Swinmming and water sport will be forbidden in the reservoirs.
4.6 Impact of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Environment
4.6.1   Impact of Land Acquisition
The  impact of land  acquisition  to  environment include: reservoir
inundation. land occupation of permanent structures and temporar-
structures
(i) Land Acquisition
The upper reservoir is the existing reservoir and its wvater area is not
chanzed. so that there is no inundation impact after construction of
pumped storaze project.
The inundation scope is from the damsite upstream to 142.17m. Im added
above the max. water level 141.17m. 606mu will be flooded. See Table 4-4
for land tvpes and areas.

The land occupation for permanent structures includes reinforced concrete
facing. rockfill dam of lower reservoir, switchvard, intake/ outlet of upper
reservoir and lower reservoir, dam enforcement work of upper reservoir.
subsidiarx dam at lower reservoir. construction camps of contractor, living
base in co unl  ton.- and npernmnent road. etc. Totally. 675.7mu land shall
be occupied. See Table 4-5 for land type and areas.
TB/E:IAR04                             4 - 16



The land occupation for temporary use includes construction. living and
office. spoil area. material transfer area and temporar- access. etc. Totally.
805 .9mu land shall be occupied. See Table 4-6 for land type and areas.
(2) Land Acquisition Impact
The total land acquisition area of the project is 1281.7mu(includinc
inundation land and permanent land acquisition). involving Baizhang.
Lingciao. Kandinc. Qiaoxia and Baibuvan- villages. See Table 4-7
through 4-10 for inventorn indexes.
From the above. the reservoir inundation and permanent land acquisition
will change the ways of land use and damage the regional ecological
environment on one hand. and on the other hand the original production
svstem rwill be affected and resources lost causina several hundreds people
havinz no materials for living. who have to relocate and find other wavs
for living. During the resettlement and relocation. the activities of living
and recoveery  of production  will brina some  impacts on natural
environment of surrounding area and host area (See Clause 4.62 for
details)
The temporary land acquisition is mainly of cultivated land. orchard and
w oodland. with 805.9mu. The construction period is 5 years and 10
months. In this stage. there will be some pressures for use of local land
resources. Therefore, these lands shall be recovered as soon as complete
of construction to reduce the impact to local land resource.

4.6.2   Resettlement Environment Impact
(1) Policies And Principles For Resettlement
Based on the survev results, Tiantai Counrv Gove=rnent selected the
policy  as: the  resettlement within  the  countv town  accordinc to
`developmental policN for resettlement". The resettlement shall be based
on the condition of havinc essential material for livin_. potential of long-
term development. and possible resources for development. Thus. the
resettled people could be living and working in peace and contentment
(2) Resettlement Planing
The population affected is mainly of rural-registration household for
agyriculture production. There were 779 rural persons required to be settled
by the end of 1995, calculated on the basis of the farm land area per capita
and area impacted by inundation, according to relative rules, of which 572
persons Bill be relocated (529 resettled in other places and 43 settled
locall-'a.
The reclamation of river plain for agriculture production will be adopted
TBEI.AR/04                           4 - 20



for those resettlers moved to other places. There will be 584 persons to
move with 1%zo of natural population =rowth in the design year 2005.
Tne land shall be readjusted and the land acquisition fees used for
development of secondany and tertiary industries for persons settled locally.
277 person as a whole(including 230 persons affected only by land
acquisition without house demolition and 47 persons settled locally). with
1 °/o of natural population grow th in the design year 2005.
(3) Resettlernent Environment Capacity
a.  Resettlernent Scheme
According to the resettlement task, the relative department organized by
Tiantai county government had survev on resettlement environment
capacity. With the registered far-mland data. the existing farmland
resources is not enough. but there are about 9400mu flood plain and reed
field which could meet the land requirement for resettlement. After the
thorough investiuation. analvsis and study. the area from Batouqiao to
Botangqiao at Luoxi was selected as the host area by the special meeting
of directors of County Government. 457mu land(3 15mu for production,
62.5mu for house construction and 79.5mu for standby) is required for the
whole host area. 0.5mu per capita, to settle down 584 persons.
b.  General of Host Area
Luoxi creek is a tributary of Shifenopi river, originated the northern
mountainous area of this countv. 1 5.7km lon2 and catchment area 46.3km2.
being 4.2:/O of Shifengxi river (11115km2 catchment area) . It is one of
main grain production zones of the county. The middle and lower sections
of Luoxi creek is just passing the NE of Chengguan town and the outlet is
link-ed with Shifengxi river, where is under the administration  of
Chengguan  town. Shizhikou  reservoir( 1.47  million  mi) was built
upstream, wvhich is the auxiliar,y works of the north trunk channel. No.66
branch is just cross the flood plain. All farmland in the host area has
drought-def'ving capacity for more than 85 davs. Luoxi creek is a
mountainous river, steep above Shizhikou reservoir section and gentle for
the both bank sides downstream section(within 5.5km). There is a large
scale of flood plain (about 1100mu flood plain can be developed) at the
area (2700m long )between Batouqiao and Botangqiao. After straightening
of river channel, about 818mu land will be created, with a net area of
705mu .
The host LCe: is at the teft bankk of middle section of Botanc creek, near
Hengtan.kan village at the north and Luoxi village opposite side where is
the headquarters of Luoxi township government. The host area is approx.

(4) Impact on Environment around Reservoir
27, affected pe-sons (from Lingiia and Kandinz villages) will be settled
locally. The lands will be reallocated within the village-s zroup. thus the
amount of land resource per capita will be chanced. See Tabie *-1 for
details.

From Table 4- 1 1 it indicates that the land for Lingjiao village is little more
decreased. 0.1365mu/person, but the woodland is more increased with
0.6579mu.Iperson. There is small change for other villages. Therefore.
there is no big pressure for land resources and small impact on ecological
environment around reservoir and the land acquisition funds could be used
for establishment of enterprise, which will be helpful for raising of living
standard of local people.
The construction of Tongbai Pumped Storage Power Project will promote
the development of economy, tourism, transportation, employment in the
peripheral area of reservoir, increase the employment. and be helpful for
the development of the local economy.

(5) Resettlement Impact on Environment of Host Area
a.  Impact on ecological environment
According to the land use survey by the Tiantai Azriculture Bureau in
1984. the total land area of the counrv *as 2.1302 million mu. including
forest land 1.2381 million mu. water surface 82500 mu (includin_ rivers.
lakes. reservoirs. pond. fixed channels. rIver dikes and pond dik-es above
the perennial water levels) and 520300 mu cultivated land.
The resettlement host site at the Potang creek originally% was the cultivated
land. Because of damage of the upper stream forest. the cultivated land
was destrDved by floods and turned to be river plains. In late 1960s. a
reservoiL was formed on the upper stream river section. which basically
controlled the flooding and the Potang creek became a seasonal creek.
Along wvith years of evolution. the wet land at the Potang creek- occupies
an area of 1100 mu.
In 1992. the county government carried out urban construction planning
for the c ount' seat. Approved by relevant environmental protection
departmuent. the 1100 mu wet land has been incorporated into the planned
area of the plan. of which the land on the east side of the creek will be
restored as cultivated land. and that on the west side will be used as
residentia] area. For project resettlement. 408 mu will be used for
resettlement host site (315 mu for production. 75.5 for resident housing.
and 17.55 mu reserved). which is 37% of the-total wvet land.
According to the couny s plan. the 1100 mu wet land      be harnessed
and levci at the time of construction of the Toncbai project. The
ecological environment at the Potang creek will be thoroughly improve
Based on .nformation recorded bv the Tiantai Water Resources Bureau, the
aquatic animals existing in Potangxi river basically are: Leptobotia
tientaiensis (Wu), Leptobotia compressicauda (Nichols), Lateolabrax
japonicus (Cuvier et Valenciennes), Silurus asotus Linnaeus. river crab,
greenish shrimps, spiral shell, freshwater mussel and crucian carp, etc..
Due to Potang creek belongs to ravine which is a small branch of the
Shifeng River. it is shortage of the fisherv resources and without economic
values there. As the aquatic animals in Potang creek belong to a norm.al
species which distributed over Shifena River and its surroundings, only a
small portion of the river course occupied by the resettlement, so. it will
not create the adverse influences both on distribution of the aquatic
animals and ecological environment.
The wila aninals in resemLement host area are Logs, goiuen snaktes. biacLk
tail snakes, hares and sparrows, etc. without precious protective animals
TB/EIAR'04                          4 - 23



there. Forest coverage mainly is mason pines. maple and aquatic bamboo
etc. and also without precious plants to be found. As activinr scope of the
wild animals and distribution rance of terrestrial flora are ver- wide. thus.
only few  influences on local terrestrial animals and plants by the
resettlement.
Durina urban construction plarning. the Tiantai count-. government.
considering the local impact on Lhe ecolocical environment caused by the
construction. decides to afforest 12800 mu land 3 kmr on the east side of
the county seat (aroun2 the resettlement host sit). In tLhat area there are
many small reservoirs and ponds. (only at the top of the mountains., there
are II ponds and resernoirs). and small creek s and zrooves zigzagged with
plent- ofu water. The existing vegetation in the area including mansion
pines (1736 mu), wet-land pines (small in number and man-planted). fir
(9mu). bamboo (16'mu). commercial trees and fruit trees (9i4 mu). and
tea garden and shrubs. The area will be classified into bamboo zone for
tourists (5600 mu). famous tea tree zone for tourists (1000 mu). high
quality fruit tree zone (2800 mu), and local plant zone (3400 mu). so that
the east area of the county will become a countryside shaded with green
leaves. full of trees and bamboo. ripe with fruits and birds ninaing and
heavy with frarance of flowers.
b.  Influences on Water Quality
By the water quality monitoring information supplied from Tiantai County
environment monitoring station between 1992 to 1994 (refer to Table 4-
12). the current water qualitn in section of Potangxi resettlement area is
good. Except fevw items reached water standards of Grade-II and III in
individual monitorinz times. the others monitoring indexes are over Grade-
I of the "Environmental Standards of Surface BWater" (GB3838-88). It
show s that the water quality in this area is perfect.
After relocating into the new resettlement host area, the sewage discharge
will impact on a certain degree on water bodv nearby. Thus, the
concentrated wastewater discharge plan for the host area shall be
considered for the resettlement acting planing to decrease the impact on
the water quality in surrounding water bodies.

c.  Influence on Environment bx Resettlement
Resettlement host areas is located on the middle beach of Potancx;i river,. a
tributarn- of the Shifena River. and an undeveloped flood piain betweer.
Potanaxi BridRe to Batouciao Brid2e. The total area under control bv host
area is about 408 mu. amona which land about -"15  mu is for production.
5.45 mu for residential structure in host areas and 17.:: mu for standbx.
By plan. total 584 persons will be resettled there so that the reclamation
area car meet the requirement for resettlement. Thtou-h reclamation.
resettiers can make farninc based on the reclamation. also they can
develop a diversified economy following on tak-ing the different measures
in line with different conditions. The activities of reclamation of flood
plain will not only promote the local economical development. but also
increased 818 mu farmrland and raised the flood control standards for
villages and farmland at both banks there. Thus. the social enviro=nent
u il' be improved.
d.  Influences on Environment by Resettlement
During the process of development., activities of the human beings are
intensified especially excavation of earth and rocks and discharge of
spoils will certainly impact on the environrnent. The waste soil and debris
caused by the preparation works for power. water and road shall be not
durnped at will, which shall be stored at specified deposit area. The tree
planting and green plan shall be timelv followed to recover and improve
the land view.
e.  Influences on Resettlers' Living Quality
During the initial vears. the livinc level of resettlers will be lightly
decreased due to the construction of new- farmland. But, the host area is
near Chengguan town, w ith convenient traffic conditions. They can do the
secondary and tertiary industries except agriculture production, thus the
living level w ill be up in a shorter period.
The local government shall give preference policies. opportunities and
funds to the host area to avoid decrease of income of resettlers. At the
same time. the effective institutions and mechanism  for resettiers and
mana2ement of funds shall be set to ensure that the economy in host area
can be developed coordinately with the ecological environment.
4.7  Impact On Environment During Construction Period
4.7. 1 Atmospheric Environment
The impact on environment during construction period is mainly from
dust caused by excavation, truck operation and cement loading and

unloading.
B% the meteorolozical information. the principal w ind direction in
summer(Mar.-Aug.) is at EES. and in winter(Nov.-Feb.) is at NWV and
WWN. 'The access road is pass along Linc-iiao villa-e at the South. Durin_
and after construction of the access road. the dust bV trucks will impact
Linajiao villaze in condition of ES. EES wind in surnmer.
The cement storage house is located at area of 200m northwest of Linziao
-illaze. 1he dust by cement loading and unloadin_ will slihht1% influence
Liangijao village and TianyanLjin viliage in summer and a little more
impact in w inter.
The construction area of lower  reservoir is lkm  away to Liangjiao
villa_e. Tianyangin village and living and office area. Tne dust by earth
and rock excavation will slightly influence to the living quarter mentioned
above.
The construction intensity of upper reservoir is relatively small, with
few construction person. inhabitant and dust.
The artificia! watering will be adopted for the heavy dust area for dam
foundation and quarrv construction. Tne spraying car could be used for
dust contr-ol for w-ork surface linaked with road and for pavement of road.
The wet drilling and air ventilation shall be stressed for excavation of
underground powerhouse. water conveyance system and construction adit.
Cement loading and unloading operation shall be performned in a close
w ay to limit completely the impact to air.
The spraying car shall be equipped to spray regularly the road surface.
4.7.2   Water Qualin-
The pollution source is from construction wastewater and livinz sewerage.
(1) Operation 'Wastewater
The operation wastewater is coming from sand and aggregates system,
concrete plant. vehicle and mechanical equipment washinc.
300m3-h wzater will be used for sand and aggregates system and concrete
plant. The content in wastewater from  washing sand and aggregates
svstem is mainly of soil and sand. with concentration of over 30000ppm.
which will directly discharge into Baizhang river. This will result increase
of SS in dovwrztrrea  r.v-r channel. The cointent In waslcwater fiorn
flushing concrete plant is mainly of soil and sand particles and cement,
which will not directly discharge into Baizhang river.
TB/FIAR/04                         4 -27



Accordinz to the construction layout. sand and acaregates system is in
loe e;  reservoir. and separate concrete planm in upper reservoir and lower
reservoir. The sand and azgregates syst.em of lower  reservoir is near the
concrete plant.
The max. wastew ate, discharge of sand and aggrezates svstem  and
concrete plan. of lowrer  reservoir is 446r-1Pe( about 0 13mrr s). A  .rn3
sand basin will be set downstream of vastewater outlet for pre-treatment.
And a 702m3 rectangular stilling pool will be set behind the sand basin.
The max. wastewater dischar-e of concrete plan: of upper reser;oir  is
64mrnh( about 0.0'm3 s). A 703rm  rectanzular stillinc pool will be set
downstream of wastewater outiet. After beinz separated. the clean water
wvil be re-used and the solid waste will be removed TeriodicallIv.
Tne wastewvater fromr vehicle washing (1- I   vehicles of different type) has
marinly oil and silt content. The wastewater directly discharged into the
river is not be allowexd.
It is recommended that all vehicle washing operation shall be done in
construction area of lower  reservoir to avoid pollution to water qualitv
of upper reservoir. If 70%  vehicles are daily washed. there are 121
vehicles to wash per day. 5 vehicle-washing plafforms and 3 bnick;-trpe
oil-separating basins (for C-II011 truck) will be built. The waste oil will
be burned wvay or shipped away. The random wvashing is forbidden.
The wastewater from mechanical ecuipment washing in mechanical plant
has mainlv oil and soda content. The wastewater will be discharged only
after central treatment.
(2  Sewaae
The livina sewage includes sewage coming from dining hall, toilet and
bathroom. etc. with daily discharge of 750t. The sewage content mainly
are COD. BODE and oil which can not be discharged directly.
The manure and living sewage shall be discharged separately. The peak
labor intensity of upper reservoir is of 600 persons. one brick septic tank
of size No.9 will be set on upper reservoir. The peak labor intensity of
lowrer reservoir is of 3200 persons. four brick septic tanks of size No.10
vill be set on lower reservoir. The construction unit shall be responsible
for cleaning of these tanks and the solid wastes w ill be removred
periodicall. The solid waste shall be used as fertilizer by local people.
Sewage from dinning hall w,ill be discharged through oil-separation pool.
The  se-xvaao fr-om the hospital will be clea.ned and sterilized. II will be
discharged without pathozenic bacteria.

4...3   Noise
The construction noise is mainl\ fro=  biastino. sand and ag_re°ates
screening system. Nvibrator and track operation. with hich noise le Vel.
Accordir-g to the general lavout of construction. sand and agTregates
screenmn  system, concrete mixing plant. auxiliarv plant and access is near
Linaiiao village and livinr area at lower  reservoir.  The noise pollution
of concrete mixing plant and auxiliarn plant will be above 90 dB(A).
Along with decrease of distance of noise source. the noise pollution to the
living area  wxill still reach to 80 dBc A). which is over the standard of
liv-ing area.
There will be few-  noise at upper reservoir because the aregates
screening system and auxiliary plant are not there and there are few
workers at upper reservoir.
Accordinz to spoil material volumes. construction schedule (excavation
mainly focus on the first 4 v'ears). construction period (mainly at the time
period between 6:00 (a.m.) to 10:00 (p.m.)) and vehicles' loading (10 m  s
!trucky the anticipation of the truck flowing w ill be 1 1 vehicles per hour.
Due to high frequency for truck operation. the transportation noise will
impact or. the construction temporar- living quarter and the villages along
with the road both two sides.
In order to reduce the noisy infiuences. the construction management shall
be stressed. Earplug shall be used for operators at construction area with
heavy noise pollution. The fixed noise source shall be far away the living
quarter or noise separation. v ibration reducing and noise elimination
measures shall be taken by the construction unit. The night construction
and night running of heavy-duty trucks shall be controlled to reduce direct
impact on living quarter nearby and to reach the Grade-I standard of
"Urban Environment Noise Standard"(GB3 096-93)
4.7.4 Solid "Waste Material
The solid waste material includes rock debris, industrial rubbish and
living garbage.
Total rock and earth excavation for main project and temporarn project is
of .85123  million  m3 (including  demolition), and rock  and earth
embank-ment 1.9879 million m3. After balancing, the spoil material is of
1.9232 million m3. 0.4924 million m3 at upper reservoir and 1.4308
million m3 at lower reservoir. By the topographical condition, 2 spoil areas
is , upper reser.oir and 1 sro;l area at lovwer resenro-r.

spoils. The top elevation is at El.390m. At the later stage. this  spoil area
shal. be erection area of cates of intak'e outilet and sto-age area of
permanent equipment of upper reservoir.
No.2 spoil area al upper reservoir is in the co:rle near Houdaoy uan village.
0.8km  awa- to intakLe outlet. I, will be stored with C.332^' million m
spoils. The top elevation is at El.41 Om.
The spoil area at lower. reser-voir is in a corrie at the left bank. 2.5-3.5km
awa. It is nea. the Tian-tonr road and access of upper reservoir and lower
reservoir, vith convenient transportation condition. It occupies an area of
100000m-. 1.4308 million m3 spoils will be stored there. The top elevation
is at El.125m.
By the viewinc of general lavout of construction drawinrs. the spoil areas
are far from the upper reservoir and lower reservoir. Therefore. the spoils
'ill not infiuenced on water bodies.
By the desian requirement. the spoil shall be compacted by layers. The
drainage facilities and drv masonrv wall shall be built for the stabilitv. The
green works shall be also tak-en to reduce soil erosion.
The industrial rubbish shall be possibly reused and lirving garbage shall be
centrally stored at corrie and depression. It will be embedded by lavers to
prevent breeding of mosquito and f1y.
4.7.5  Impact on People's Health
Bv the construction plan. two concentrated li-ing areas w ill be arranged at
the upper reservoir. Tne No. 1 living area will be arranged inside of access
betuween dam and spillway of the upper reservoir. The No. 2 living area
will be arranged at the Qiandaovuan village which near the right abutment.
Two concentrated areas also arranged for living and working at the lower
reservoir within the range of 1.0 km to 1.5 km. The No. 1 living area is
located on the left side of the road and the No. 2 living and working area
is located on the right side of the road. The total structure area for
temporary living facilities and offices is 28800 m' (amona which 4320m2
is at the upper reservoir area and 2448Gm- at the lower reservoir area).
The land occupation reached 86400 m' (in which 12960m2 is at the upper
reservoir area and 73440m2 at the lower reservoir area). The average
labors in construction period is 2030 persons with the structure area about
14.19m' per capita (among 'which 14.4m2 is at the upper reservoir area and
14.15m2 at the lower reservoir area). The land occupation per capita
reached 42.56 m  (in which 43.2m- is at the upper reservoir area and
42.45m2  at the  lower reservoir area).The  average  labor in  peak

construction period is 3800 persons with the structure area about 7.58m
per capita (among wehich 7.20 m- is a: the upper reservoir area and 7.65 m'
at the lower rese-voir area) The land occupatlon per capita is 22_74 m: (in
which 21.6 m^ is a: the upper reservoi- area and 2.95m: at the lower
res,rrvoi:- area).
Based on that. the lowes, structure area per capita will be reached 7.20m'
in zonstruction pealk period with the low est land occupation per capita
2 1.6 m2. It can satisfy the layout requirement for liv ing acilities.
Due to the construction wvorkers are coming from the different area. the
infectious diseases will be easilv caused within the construction area as
concentrated and poor living condition ir limited area. Therefore. the
attention shall be paid to following aspects:
The physical examination shall be done for labors and those who have
epidemic disease shall be forbidden to enter into construction area. The
phvsical examination shall be done regularly for workers in dinning hall.
Medical treatment shall be performed timely for who has disease to
prevent e pidemic disease.
The drinLing Nater source shall be well selected and protected. The water
shall be sterilized or purified. The septic tank. wastewater pond or rubbish
storage shall be forbidden to set around the drink,ing wvater source.
4. .6  Impact on Terrestrial Organism
(1) Impact On Terrestrial Animal
Accordingt to the records from Tiantai Forests Department, the white-neck-
pheasant (Grade-I state protection animal). pangolin (Grade-Il state
protection animal) and other kind of wvide animal w;ere found at the wvater
basin above dam site of lower reservoir.
The wvhite-neck pheasant is of chicken order of pheasant family. It likes to
habituate in the area with dense wide-leaf or needle-leaf forests, at the
shadow gullv at El.500-800m in the summer, and at the sunny gully at
El.300-500m to pass winter. The storaee water level in lower reservoir is
below El. 144m. The reservoir inundation and noise from construction area
will not influence this animal.
The panrgolin is of scale and shell order of pangolin family. It likes to
habituate in the area with bush and grassland, eating ants. It can climb
trees and swim. The reservoir inundation and noise from construction area
will not influence this animal.
The snake and other wild animal live in large area. The lower reservoir

Durino construction period. hunting and harmful actP\ities for breeding
and habit of wild life shall be forbidd.n to workers to reduce the iolact
on terrestria' animal.
(C)  Impact On Terrestrial Plants
The auxiliary plant. living quarter and spoil area w-ill occup\ a lot of land.
By the construction plan. the land accuisition for temrnorary construction
is of 805.9mu. 61 l .5mu of cultiv ated land. 6 . 'mu of orchard. i .Q.7mu of
economic woodland, plus "three wastes" caused bI  construction. which
will influence at a cert.ain dezree to v egetation.
The total spoil area of upper reservoir and lower reservoir is 280000m,2.
covering all original vegetation. In order to reduce water and soil loss.
spoils shall be compacted by laver and stability- of slope shall meet the
desi_n requirement.  The green works shall be also taken to reduce soil
erosion. After leveling and reclamation. the spoil area shall be reused for
farming. or planting the suitable kind of economic trees.
The land for auxiliary plant. living quarter and spoil area is mostly of
water field and slope field. which shall be reLurned as soon as possible for
farming after completion of the project to reduce the impact to natural
scenic view by water and soil loss.
4.7.-  Impacts on Tourism by Project Transportation
By construction plan, the 9km access frorn lower damsite to intake/outlet
of upper reservoir belongs to permanent road of Grade-II. Among w!hich 6
km existing permanent road (from  Shilian_ to Tourism region) will be
used (at present. the entire line still not be linked together). Per hour only
I 1 truck flowinz case will be in the section from lower reservoir to spoil
area and also less vehicle flowin2 in other road. thus at the construction
period. there will be no influences on the normal communication for
tourism.
4.8  Social Environmental Impact
Tonabai Power Project is a pure pumped storage with daily regulation
capacit,. undertaking the peak regulation and load-rough filling task of
the East China Power System. Therefore, a great influence will be brought
about to the project area. beneficiary areas and resettlement areas by the
benefit of the project, development for the inhabitant resettlement and
construction activities.

4.8.1  Influence on Social Environment bN Project Benefit
The East China Power System is at the coast area of east part of China.
includinzt Jianasu. Zhejiana. Anhui province and Shanchai. which is the
largest over-province power networks. By the end of 19 96. the max. load
of the system was 28053NM    The installed caDacirt above 6MW  is of
37141 1MW. 92.67I  of them is of thermal power. In recent years. the
economical development of Jiangsu. Zhejiana. Anhui province and
Shanahai is very fast. power demand of living and the third industry is
obviously going up. The gap between pea'- and trough is kept widenincg.
The power demand is ov-er the pow er supply of the system. The powver gap
is indicated mainly bx low cycle in peak, period, high cycle in trough
period, frequent power cut-off. shortage of standby installed capacity.
which influence heavilv the development of economy and livino level of
people. The mean daily load rate of,the East China Power System is down
from 91°0/ of 80' to 84,740/0 in 1996. The trend is kept going downward.
The gap between peak and trough was up from 5120MW  in 1990 to
10034MW  in 1996. The water power in 1996 was only 6.52%, in the
svstem. Recently. the peak load regulation is undertaken mainly by
thermal power. The peak load regulation capacit- of thermal power is
limited and can not meet the requirement of the systerm. This mode is
harmful f:r the safety of power systerm and economical operation. By the
load forecast of the East China Power Administration. the power demand
in 2005 of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui province and Shanahai will be 400
billion KWX.h. max. load 66900MW. min. load rate 60%/o, peak-trough gap
40%,0 of rnax. load. If considerina the accident reserve capacity, the peak
rezulation capacity of the system shall be 331 89MW . Therefore, the future
peak regulation capacint will be more serious.
The followinz functions will have in the power system by Tonabai
Pumped Storage Power Project:
(1) PeakL regulation: Supplying peak regulation capacity of 1200MW to the
power system, with daily power output of 6 million KW.h and annual
power output of 2118 million K'Wh.
(2) Trough-fil.linz: 1200MW  of pumping capacity in trough period, daily
power demand for pumping 7.97 million KW.h., and arnnual power
consumption 2813 million KW.h.
(3)  Frequency regulation and phase modulation: Due to the features of quick
starting and fiexibility of reversible pump turbine, it uwill timely adjust the
transient load change of power system and frequency to keep stable
operation of pov, er networks.
TB/EIAR/04                        4 - 33



(4)  Accident reserve: There are 0.9-78 rrmillion mrn accident storage capacinL
in upper reservoir and lower  reservoir. It wvill normall! be served as
standby and supplx xva:er for power generation in dr period of dr- vear.
As a result. Tongbai Pumnped Storage Project w ili produce a grea. social
benefit.
4.8.2  Influences on Social Environment b% Resetledment
(1 ) Around Reservoir Area
Bv the inundation of reservoir. 250 per-sons will remain in the oriainal
village for livingz and takle part in readjusting lands with residents there. so
that the farmland per capita and wvoodland per capita is decreased than
before. An\-vav. the compensation fee for land acquisition could be used
for development of enterprise and the employment opportunities w-ill be
supplied during and after construction of the project. It will promote the
local development  of econormy and raise the living standard of local
people.
2-)  in Host Area
B- the resettlement planing. the original administrative establishment wA-ill
be k-ept. which will wholly be relocated. The resident area shall be built
separately Tiantal County urbar construction plan shall cover this area for
public facilities and social welfare utilities for education. medical and
sanitanr services, drainage. power, telecommunication and transportation.
etc. The social environrmient of host area will be improved while the
essential living condition of resettlers is zuaranteed.
4. 8. 3  Influence of Construction on Social Environment
The project construction period will be 5 years and 10 months. during
wvhich the peak- demand of construction laborers will be 3800 persons.
Quite a large number of employment opportunities will be provided by the
construction. The secondarv industrv, will be developed around the project
sites and the local economy will be booming.
4.9 Soil and 'Water Loss and Its Endangerment
Total land area of 12-81 .7 mu will be occupied by the project permanent
structures, and another land of 805.9 mu being project temporar'
occupation. thus the original facilities for soil and water conservancy- will
be destroved extensively by the reservoir inundation and project
construction.
Under erosion by the rainfall, exposed surface of the steep slope maybe
lost its stability, which caused by the construction for permanent project
TB/EIAR/04                           4 - 34



and the access. etc.. Moreover. it will occur the local landslide so that
endangered the personal safe,, or directly impacted on safetv operation of
the project. therebN formed a new soil erosion.
B% the rock-earth balancing. about 1.9232 million m3 spoils and ballast
may be created at the construction period. Without stronc measures. it will
caused a serious soil erosion and endaner-ment. If soil erosion occurred in
the catchment area. a great quantity sands will enter into the resernoi. area.
Since capacities of both upper and lowe- rese-voirs are not very large, the
sediment deposition will impact on the available capacity and shorten the
project life. Moreover. if soil erosion occurred at the downstream  below
the lower damsite, the river course will be deposited and the river bed wvill
be raised- thus flood prevention in both %vo banks will be retreated to a
standard.

5.     Alternatives
5.1    Comparison of TBP Alternatives
i. 11  Damsite Alternatives
In pre-feasibilitv stud- and feasibility srudy. wvthin a 600Gm lonO river
reach (near Baizhanc villave). tuo damsites about  50rmm apart are
chosen  for the lower reservoir. Comrprehensive  comparison was
conducted for the r%o sites in topographN. geolog%y, wvater power.
project layout. construction conditions and environmental impact. The
conclusions are as follow s.
(1) The Baizhanaxi river valley is of bell-type. The valley at the upstream
damsite is narrow. with a valley bottom  w-idth about 130-140m and
bank- slope of 25°-35K The vallev at the downstrearm damsite is wider.
with a valley bottorrm width abou: 260-?`nm and bank slope of 25z_40`.
Bx topographic and Leomorphic conditions. the upstream  damsite is
more favorable for layout of hvdraulic sLructure.
(2) By comprehensive comparison in rock property distribution, fault scale.
rock weathering detree. scale of weathered trench. slope stability of
abutment. etc.. the upstream  damsite  is found  better than  the
doonstream one, particularly. the river bed at the downstream damsite
has siltstone and mudstone distributed w-idely. For engineering geolog>
reasons, the upstream damsite is proposed.
(3) The surrounding rock of the wvater conveyance system and underground
power house is fresh and hard. which has a geologic condition
favorable for building large-size underground w orks. The geologzic
conditions wvill not affect the selection of the damsite.
(4) In the viewvv of water power utilization. the mean net head of the power
station in the downstream damsite scheme will be 1Gm more than that
of the upstream scheme. Since the comparison is carried out on the
base of same installation, daily power generation ( pumping) and
vearly utilization hours. the difference is that dam height of the upper
reservoir in the upstream damsite alternative will be 30cm more than
that in the downstream alternative. Thus increasing engineering volume
for strengthenina and heightenina dam of the upper reservoir will not
effect alternative comparison quantitatively.
(5) The lavouts in the upstream and downstream alternatives for the lower
reservoir are basically same. The water conveyance system  of the
upstrearm alternative is 90m longer than that in the downstream one.

quantity of the main structures and project cost estimate, the two

alternatives have no bic difference. Since geolo-ical -conditions for the
upstream alte-native are better those of the downstream  one. and it is
possible to further optimize the -ptpe of dam. to make layout of spiliwa!
and  construction  diversion  scheme  nmore  reasorable. thus. in
-cosideration of the proiect la-out, it is proposed to choose the
upstrearr damsite alternative.
(6) The construction conditions for the upstream. and downstream dams.te
alternatives are basicallv same.
( ) From  the view- point of environmen.al impact. river valley at the
downstream damsite is wider than that of the up_stream one. which will
have a more inundation loss (cultivated land). However. the impact in
other respects of the two sites are sirmilar. It can be seen that the
upstream site is better than the lower one.
Based or, the above analysis, the upDstream damsite alternative is
proposed.
.1.2   Comparison in Installed Capacit-
In feasibili-v stud% stage of the TBP. three different altematives.
respectively with an installation of 1000MWO (V4X250M5, 1200MW1
(4 x 3OOMUW) and 1500IMW (6 X 25SONIV). havse been compared. The
following, factors are considered.
(1) In the view  of peak demand of the pow er grid. improving system
operation conditions, and heightening operation reliabilitr of the power
grid. It is necessarv that TBP has an installation of 1OOOMW -
I 50OMW
(2) In the vieN of project characteristics. this project is to take use of the
existinz reservoir of the Tongbai Hvdroelectric Power Station as its
upper reservoir. which has a normal WL. at 395.28m and dead VL at
374.28m at present. If the project is designed with an installation of
1200MNK the water level of the upper reservoir is basically as same as
that of the existing one. It is not necessarN to heighten the existing dar.
and the project will be simple: besides. it is not necessary to relocate
the villages at the end of the reservoir and to rebuild the highwav. and
no inundation loss will occur. Thus. it not only reduces project
investment. but also eliminate problems in resettlement.
(3) In the view of unit operation. because pump-turbines will operate in
-to difference modes, i.e.. as a pump and turbine, If higher efficiency
is required for both operating modes, without vibration and cavitation.
the ratio of max. lift in p.rinp mi  de an,, the m=..  ai-.er head in turbine
mode shaall not be large. The water power calculated results show that
the alte:matives with installations of 1000MW  and 1200MW, although
TB/EIARJO5                         5 - 2



with a less ratio value than that of 1-500MW  wvill! have a hi-h efficiency-
and ensure units to work stable in two difference operating modes.
Iin the view  of uniL cost. the V200NlV'W  alLemative is the least. the
1500MWIV  alternative the second and  OOOM'W the bi-cest. In the
respect of the calculated present value of the total cost of the three
alternatives to satisf- the powver and ener-z  demand of the Carid.
12OOMW alternative is the least. the 1000MW'7- allernative is the second
and the 150MW  alternative is the bizcest. II can be seen that the
1OOMW  alternative is the most favo-able in the respect of economic
analvsis.
() In the view of economical analysis. the uni: cost per kWV for alternative
with an installation of 1500MN-W  is the least. that of 100KW
altemative Lhe second. and that of 1000MW' alternative the lar-est. If
present value of the totai project investment is calculated on the basis
of meeting system  power demand. the  1200MW   and  1500MW
alternatives are close to each other. and are more favorable in economy.
(6) In the view of the construction period. for the 1000M-W  and 1200MW
alternatives. it will take 4 vears and 8 months for the first unit to be put
into operation and 5 years and 11 months for all units to be put into
operation. for 1500MW' alternative. it will take 5 vears and 5 months
for the first unit to be put into operation and  * years and 3 months for
all units to be put into operation. The construction period of the
I000M"W and 1200MW alternatives is less than that of 150OMW. so
the former two are favorable for the project to mak-e the initial benefit
of the project and fast capital pav-off.
(7) In respect of the environmental impact. the 1OOOMW  and 1200MW'
alternatives is rather simple in construction of the upper reservoir and
have no  new  reservoir inundation  and  inhabitants resettlement.
Therefore. they are better than the 1500MW alternative.
Considering the power system  demand. the existing upper reservoir
conditions. stable unit operation, economic benefits and other factors. it
is to choose the 1200MW alternative for the project.
5.2    Project Alternatives
I.2.l  Altematives
Considering the actual situation of the East China Power Grid, the
followving alternatives have been compared.
(1) Tongbai pumped storage altemative
As verified in the TBP feasibility design report, the proposed 1200MW
is the peak regulation capacity required by the power grid. It will
TBEIEAR/05                         S  3



provide a yearly max. pow er of 2. 1 18 billion kWh and trough-fill
power of 2.81 3kWh. The TBP is planned' that the project construction
will be started in 1999. the first unit put into operation in 2003. all the
units installed in 2C004 and the powver station put into normal service in
(2) Therrnal plant alternative
Recentix. some 30OMW  and 600MWN  thermal units are beina built
instalied in tLe grid. To suit the bic load variation amplitude of the arid.
the unit manufacturers are reauired to increase the max. peak regulation
ranae of sinzle units. 'With scientiflc and technical advance and
upgrading of design and manufacturing level. the high voltage and high
temperature thermal units with large capacity have been increase in
peak- -egulation range. As an altemative. the thermal plant is used in
comparison. The installed capacit- of the thermal plant w1ill be decided
according to the requirement of the power grid as the Tongbai pumped
storage alternative w ill meet.
(3) Gas turbines
The rmerits of gas turbines are quick start and stop. flexible operation,
short construction period and easy site selection. etc.. Althouah the
power generation cost is high. the zas turbines are competent in
undertaking  peakL load: thus. this  alternative  is often  used  in
comparison to the pumped storage alternative. Tne installed capacity of
the gas turbine alternative is 1200MW  decided according to the
requirement of the powrer grid  as the Tongbai pumped  storaze
alternative will meet.
5.2 .2  Alternative Comparison
(1) The economic comparison is conducted by least cost method. The total
present value of the yearly investment in each alternative is shown in
Table :5. 1.
Total Present Value of Yearlh Investment in Each Alternative

From Tabie 5. 1. it can be seen that the total present value of the yearly
investment in Tongbai pumped storage alternative is the least. that of
the the:m=al plant the second.

From Table 5.3. it can be seen that the pollutants discharge volume in
gas turbine alternative is the least. which will cause least impact on the
air quality: the Tonzbai alternative the second and the thermal plant
alternative the largest.
Based on the above comprehensive comparison in economy and fuel
consumption, the Tongbai Pumped storage Project is selected.

6.     Analysis Of EcoDomic Loss & Benefit Induced By Environmental
Impact
6.1    Benefit
6.1.1  Social Benefit
(1)  Improving power supply qualit  and mitizatinc conflict in power
supply and dernand
Accordinc to the operation record of the East China Power Grid. the
daily average power load rate have beenr decreasing in the past twenty
years. from 91%/o in 1980s to 84.74% in 1996. and is still in decreasing
momentus. With the continuous increase of power consumption. the
nuclear and thermal power sectors have been developed rapidly . while
the hydropower sector developed rather slow due to many constrains.
and therefore. the hydropower percentage in the grid has been 2aettin2
lower year by y ear. At present. most of the peak and standby capacity
have to be served by thermal plants. Constrained by the economic and
performance requirement. the thermal plants have a limited peak taking
ability. particularly in trough period. the thermal units have to operate
in fire-bankin2 condition. which mak-es the fuel consumption increase.
Furthermore. it is vern often that the load requirement can not be
satisfied. which bring about the condition of high frequency in trouah
period. With the operation of the second and third stage works of
Qinshan Nuclear Power Station and imPorfing the seasonal power from
the Three Gorges. such condition will be more serious.
After the power station is put into the operation, it will provide peak-
taking capacity of 1200MW to the East China Power Grid. and absorb
12001MW  from the grid in the trouah period, serving for both peak
rezulation and trough filling, which will greatly alleviate the grid's
peak regulation burden and upgrade the power supply quality and thus.
contribute much to the safe operation of the thermal and nuclear power
units.
(2)  Benefit to applying peakL power price and promoting reform of power
sale price
The cost of power in peak- and trough load period is different. and the
cost of' products produced in the two periods are also varied. The
adoption of peak power price can reasonably reflect the difference in
cost and use of peakt power. After completion of the TBP. pumping in
the trough load period and providing peakd load to the grid create a
practical condition for pursue the peak pow,ver price policv. thus the
theoreticl benefit of time-effect power price will become real economic
benefit and the management system of the grid can be promoted.
TB/EIAR/06                         6- 1



(3) Improvinc staffs workinc conditions and meetinz the increasing power
demand of the people's lv: nc
In order to reduce the peak load and increase the trouah ioad. the daily
working shift system in the region has been ad&usred periodically in the
past vears. and marn factories and enterprises have had to change one
shift or two shift sy stem to three shifts a da-. Some of w orkers have to
take da% shift and ni_ht shift ir. turn. A, the condiilon of lack-in- of
peaLk load. this is a measure which has to be adopted to mi-rrate the
contradiction in power supplv and demand and is avoidable during
certain period of time. However. it should be seen Lhat the three-shift
seystem brin2 difficulties and impact to workers and staff+s' families
such as bringing up k-ids, taking care of the old and personal health. etc..
Meanwhile. the production cost of factories and enterprises increases
and unfavorable condition is brou_ht abouL to the urban traffic and
social security. With the economic developrnent. the people's living
standard rises continuously: as a result. more and more families use air
conditioners and large-capacit- domestic electric appliances. w hich
will certainly increase the power demand for domestic use year by year.
After the TBP is put into comrnercial operation. it will absorb 1200
MW from the grid in trouch load period at night. part of the workers
can get rid of the trouble of the three-shift system. and meanwhile. the
power supply in peak- period will be increased. and the reliabiliy of
power supply wvill be increased both in day time and at ni-ht time.
(4)  The project locates in the planned Baizhang-Qiongtai Scenic Spot. The
construction of the project will make this area have more tourist spots"
and at the same time. it wxill provide favorable conditions for further
development of this scenic area. promoting tourist industry in this area.
widely  opening  up the  local labor market, creatinc  more job
opportuninirv for local residents. and improving local social conditions.
6.1.2  Economic Benefit
(1)  The project has a good topographical conditions, small engineering
quantity and little reservoir inundation loss. The unit cost of the project
is 2852 YuanikW. Compared with the 1OOMW  simple circulation gas
turbine (if they are adopted to substitute the TBP to take the work-ing
capacity in peak load period, and calculated by 4000Yuan,kW for each
unit), the TBP can save the capital construction cost by 1.4 billion
Yuan.
(2)  The TBP can take the difference between the peak- and trough load, and
has the trouch-filling benefit that the other power sources do not have.
Its operation can greatly reduce the peak regulation amplitude of the
thermal units and the fuel consumption  of the arid. The fuel
TB!EIAR/06                           6 - 2



consumption calculation for the grid wvith and without the TBP shows
that a vearlv amount of standard coal 18800 tons car be saved for the
zrid with the TBP: it means that 7520000 Yuan can be saved each vear
for the Prid. (calculated by 400Yuanrton).
(3)  The TBP can provide a yearly peak powe. of -.118 billion kWVh:
deductin2 the station-service povier and line loss. '.086 billion kvWh
will be sold. Calculated bx  0.7-YuanX Wh (the price recessed
according to the loan conditions). the power revenue will be 1.565
billion Yuan each year.
(4)  After the project is put into operation. the loss due to limiting use of
power will be reduced. the operation rate of industrial enterprises will
be increased, the social output value and taxes will be boosted and
night-shif expenditures will be saved. the economic benefit in these
respects can never be neglected.
6.1.3  Environmental Benefit
A purnped storage power station and a thermal power plant of samre
capacity and function are taken into comparison. although a pumped
storage station generates 3k-W.h b consuming 4kW.h. the thermal units
with low coal consumption Nill be used in the trough-load period and
those with vern high consumption in the peak load period. Operation of
the LBP can greatly reduce the peak regulation amplitude of the
thermal units. thus reduce the fuel consumption of the grid.The fuel
consumption calculation for the grid with and without the TBP shows
that a vearlv amount of standard coal 18800 tons can be saved for the
zrid uith the TBP. It can be seen that, in the same conditions of
meeting load demand and standby requirement of a power grid, the
pumped  storage station wxill not increase but reduce the coal
consurnption. The pumped storage station Nill also reduce discharge
volume of carbon monoxide. hvdrocarbon. hvdronit-rogen, sulfur
dioxide. waste gas and cider. Besides. a series of environmental
probie:ms such as fuel transportation, storage and disposal of fly ash.
etc., will be relieved.
6.2    Loss
6.2.1  Projecl Land Requisition and Resettlement
The land and housing inundated by the reservoir are irreversible loss,
the compensation for project land requisition and resettlement is
47.6905 million Yuan.
6.2.2   Co.mpensaLion for Existing Tongbai Hydropower Sia:ioia
After complement of TBP, the existing TB Hvdropower Station will be
under a centralized management. The compensation for this existing

power generation. bein- 33.88  X IOnkW.h per year. The incomes w-ill
not include the operatior cost of 6.9 million Yuar. co-ering interests
and pumping cost.
6. .S    Environmental Loss durinz Construction Period
The temporan  land  acquisition. excavation. spoil. and  wastexater
discharged from  site durinc construction period will cause unfavorable
impact  on  the  local  environment  for  a  time  being.  Thus. the
en-vironmental protection  investrnent for adopting  and implementing
relative measures and'  mnanagement plans. including monlitorin. etc.. is
regarded as environmental loss.
The above mentioned analysis of benefits and losses show-s that the
environmental  and  social  benefits  are  evident. and  zreater than
environmental losses. (See Table 6.1

7.     Environmental Management Plan & Monitoring Plan
7.1    Environmental Management Plan
Wheri the project client sets up his proiect management organization.
an environmental protection office should be established to monitor
and control the environmental protection w ork during consiruction
period and operation period. The office should be staffed b% 3-4 full-
time professionals.
7.1.1   Environmental Management during Construction Period
The on-site environmental mana-ement during construction period
should be carried out in protecting anc monitoring of water source for
drinkina and domestic use. waste%vater treatment. labor protection.
controllin2 noise and fil ing dust caused bv the transporta:ion and
construction. sanitation  and  epidemic  prevention. environmental
sanita'ion management. and bioio-ical measures adopted for spoils and
wastes in the construction period. as well as vezetation restoration and
zreening work after completior of construction. Al'l those above
mentioned wvill be involved in the biddinc document of "the project.
It is proposed that the sanitation and epidemic prevention plan for the
construction period be implemented w ith cooperation of Tiantai Counto
Sanitation and Epidemic Prevention Station.
I. 1'  Reservoir Water Quality Control
One year before reservoir impoundment. the reservoir should be
cleaned strictlv according to the Method for Reservoir Basin Cleaning
issued bv the former Ministrv of Water Conservancv and Electric
Power. The closing of hillside to facilitate afforestation shall be
implemented in the reservoir peripheries and the upstream area in order
to pre-vent soil and water loss.
It is proposed that water quality monitoring plan be implemented by
Tiantai Countv Environmental Monitoring Station.
7.1.3  Env ironment Management for Resettlement
The prDject affected people will be mainly resettled in other areas. The
resettlement plan mainlv stresses on resettlers' livelihood. and also
takes full account of environmental conditions and environmental
capacity in resettlement host sites. In full consideration of the local
environmental conditions. the development plan for resettlement host
site will be worked out so as to use local soil and water resource
reasonable.
In the resettlement, the resettlement fund should be used only for
TB/EIA.R'o0                          7- 1



resettlement purpose and various resettlement policies be practiced in
time. Efforts should be made in construction of public facilities for
education. medical service and telecommunication. Guidance and
supervision should be made for developing activities ir resettlement
host site. Relative environmntal protection laws and reaulations issued
b- the state and local  0overn.-nent should be followed. And efforts
should be made to strengthen nanagemenrt vith cooperation of local
environ.mental protection bureau so as to avoid deca\ of ecolo-ical
environment.
7.1.4   Administration for Securitv at Resernoir Area
As the operation fearures of the pumped storage powver station. the
dailx wnater level variation in upper reservoir of Tonzba' Power Station
is about 19.56m. and about `9.66m  in lower reservoir. The daili
operation in pumpin_ mode is   hours on arn average and that in
generating mode is 6 hours. The corresnondinz dr2wdown depth is
2.79-3.26 mr'h in upper reservoir and 4.24-4.94mih in lowver reservoir.
Due to large variation of the wvater level. it is suczested to set some
alarming lamps and boards on the reservoir surroundings and along
with the road entrances both to upper and lower reservoir areas. The
residents livin- in reservoir area shall be mivern the necessarv lessons
for safety education. Meanwhile. children and also livestock shall be
forbidden entering into the dangerous area and the recreations such as
the sw imming and fishing at the reservoir area also no, allowed.
7.2    Environment Monitoring Plan
Since the pumped storage power station is a clean power source, no
pollutant will come out of it. Major pollutants are from the construction.
mainly of production wastewater. sewage. noise and flying dust. Thus,
in consideration of the characteristics of pumped storage project, the
environ.mental monitoring plan mainly take account of water quality
monitoring, noise  and  aercshpere  monitoring  plan  during  the
construction period.
,.2.1   Monitoring Plan of Water Quality
A.       Monitoring for Reservoir and Surface W ater Quality
Since reservoir water of the TBP exchanges frequently and in a large
volume. it is planned to set up monitoring sections respectively in
lows-er reservoir and its downstream area. Those sections should be put
into operation prior to project construction in order to know variations
of water qualitv in the reservoir and downstream before and after
construcLion oi reservoir.
(l)       Monitoring section

Twvo monitoring sections %N ill be set up respecli% el\ One is set on the
lower reservoir about lOOm ups:reaI. the damsites. and the olher is set
on lower damsite. upstream oi' Ihe contliuence of the Baizhanaxi RlVe7
and Sanmao River (under a net  hIahwav b-idae) The sampling is
takeen from the line of fastest fio. Durin2 the corstruction period. the
section for the lower reservoir can be set upstream the tailrace runnel
outlet.
(2   Monitorinp time and frequenc%
Two times of monitoring wil! be for each season (f ood. normal and dr,
season), six times for a vear Monitoring should be started before
project construction. and lasted in operation stage of the power station.
(3)  Monitoring items and analytic method
The monitoring items. water sampling and anai-tic method should be
in accordance to Technical Standards of Environmental Monitoring.
and the official document (S )Huanguizhi No.064.
If no volatile phenol. cyanide. arsentice. sexavalent chrome. lead.
cadmium and fluorine matter is found in monitoring for six successive
times in a vear. the monitoring times can be reduced to once a year.
(4)  Expenses
The ex-penses incurred from surface water and reservoir water quality
monitoring is tentativelN estimated to be 35 X I0; RMBS per vear. which
will be included in the project budget before operation of the power
station. and in operational cost after commissionin_.
B.  Surface Water Quality Monitoring durinc Construction Period
During construction period. a large amount of production wastewater
and sewage will be discharged into Baizhanzxi river. In order to control
the pollution in the construction period and protect surface water
environment. it is planned to set up water quality monitoring sections
downsesream the construction sites in the lower reservoir area
(1) Monitoring section
Three monitoring sections will be arranged respectivelv about 100lm
downstream the lower reservoir damsite. about 200Gm upstream the
upper reservoir. and 2000m  downstream  the confluence of the
Baizhanzxi and Sarmao River. The sampling is taken from line of
fastest flow.
(2) Monitoring time and frequencv
Monitoring will start from the beginningJ of the construction and end at

If the actual construction period is prolonaec. so is for the monitoring
period.
The monitorincg frequencies will be decided accordinr to construction
progress and intensir. irn consideratior  of flooI. nora1 and dra
seasons. It is 4 times for a year. w-ith 2 times ;kept for construction peal;
period.
(3) Monitorinz items and analytic method
A total of 9 monitorina items Xwill be monitored. includinc PH value.
suspended matter. oils. chemical oxxgen demand. BOD.. to:a' nitrogen.

of this project from these representat:ves.
Discussed by the specialist Croup. the approval corrmments and relative
miration methods and measures were put fonvards and later approved
by State Environmental Bureau.
(1) Basically agree with pre-approval comments by the specialist zroup.
)With adoption of the environmental protection measures proposed in
the report, the project is feasible from the viewpoint of environmental
protection. The report can be takLen as a base for project design and
environmental management.
(2) The resettiers wNill be mainly resettled in other areas. The resettlement
host site is on the river shoal planned to be reclaimed. In full
consideration of existina environmental conditions and capacitn in the
resettlement host sites. developing plan for the resettlement host site
should be worked out to reasonably use soil and water resource and
prevent the resettlement host sites from deterioration of ecological
environment in the resettlement host sites.
(3) To appropriately treat the project spoils and select spoil area. Cutoff
ditch and drainin2 ditch should be arranged on the top of spoil areas,
and retaining wall on the lower slopes. After the spoil is placed,
bac kflllnz and afforestation xvorkina s' ould be carried ot. int time. in
construction of highway, efforts should be made to minimize the

9.     CONCLUSION OF ASSESSMENT AN'D RECOMMINTE'DATIONS
9.1    Conclusion of Assessment
TBP will server both peak and trouoh load in the East China Power
Grid. providing 2400MW' peak and trough load. wNhich will greatly
alleviate the pealk regulation problem of the East China Power Grid. At
the same time. it w,vill increase standby capacir- for the Power Grid.
thus improving the operation condition of the power grid., and
enhancinc the economic feasibility. safety and reliability of the power
grid. Durinz the construction and operation period. it will bring about
the development of local industry and agriculture and increase tradin2
and the local financial resource. and promote development of local
urban infrastructure. transportation and tourism. II: will generate g-reat
economic and social benefits.
The project is located in the planned Baizhang-Qiongtai scenic spot.
The projeet uill render one more tourist spot after its completion: at the
same time. it will provide favorable conditions for further tapping this
scenic resource and promoting the local tourist industry. and creatina
more job opportunitry for residents.
The upper reservoir is the existing Tongbai reservoir. The inundation
area for the lower reservoir is only 0.45krn2. with less impact. Because
resettlers will be resettled in other areas. basically no impact will be
imposed on the ecological environment of reservoir peripheries. The
resettlement host area is on river shoal. which has been planned to
develop. The resettlers' effort in reclaiming the river shoal will
i.mprove the local environment of society, but maybe caused a little
ecological enviro=ment in this area. And in initial resettlement stage.
resettlers' living will be affected to a certain extent.
Basicallv the project will cause no impact on local climate. terrestrial
animal, aquatic creatures and people's health in the reservoir
peripheries.
After operation of the power station, the water level of upper and lower
reservoirs will up and down frequently, with a large daill water level
fluctuation. this will not be favorable for the slope stability.
The daily exchange rate of water volume of the upper and lower
reservoirs will be 70-87% of total reservoir capacity. resulting a zreat
turbulence in the reservoirs. This will make the reservoir water turbid.
However. the water circulation will be strengthened. and aeration and
oxicaLion vWill also be increased. whicn will be bentle to resoluticn and
degradation of organic and nutritive matter, increase the self-
purfication of reservoirs and improve water quality in the reservoir.

The land acquisition for the construction and excavation for the
construction road will cause impact on vegetation and soil and water
conservation irn the local area.
The  wastewater. dust. noise  and  spoil from  construction  will
temporaril\ cause impact tO a certain extent on the qualit of water and
air. sound environmneni. and soil and wvater conservation in the project
affected area.
As mentioned above. most of impacts of the TBP on environment are
favorable ones. In the report. for the adverse environmental impact.
relativ;e  environmental  protection  measures  and  environmental
management plan are proposed to minimize those impacts. Thus. in the
view point of environment. except the irreversible impact on local
vegetation caused by reservoir inundation and excavation. there will be
no other environmental problem which will constrain the construction
of the project so far as environmental protection measures and
management plan are worked out in project design and implemented
durinz construction and operation of the project.
9.2    Recoimmendation
(1)  It is planned to resettle 572 inhabitants to new resettlement host site.
Great attention should be paid to environmental impact possibly caused
by site preparation. water and power supply in the host sites. It is also
reconmmended that the environment plan should be implemented at the
same time as the resettlement action plan being executed.
(2)  The project construction period will be 5 vears and 10 months. Within
such a long construction period for this large-scale project with high
construction intensit,. the construction w%ill cause rather great impacts
on local environment. A special organization will be established before
construction, staffed by full-time professionals. to superv ise the
implementation of environmental protection.
(3)  Based on the Lavw of Soil and Water Conservation of the People's
Republic of China, and the Notificatiorn of Administration of Soil and
Water Conservation in Project Construction Development (Document
Shuibao _No.513, 1994), issued by the Ministry of Water Resources.
State Plannina Commission and State Environment Protection Bureau.
preparation of the soil and water conservation shall be compiled as
soon as possible for this project.
