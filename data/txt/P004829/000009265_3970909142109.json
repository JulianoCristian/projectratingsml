"Ratings for the Structural Adjustment\n            Credit (SAC) Project for Vietnam were as follows: outcomes\n            were highly satisfactory, project sustainability was likely,\n            Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also highly satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: it was successful in supporting the\n            Government's effort to stabilize the economy and\n            sustain a high growth rate. The SAC helped the Government to\n            frame some concrete steps in the reform agenda by focusing\n            on specific weaknesses that needed to be addressed as\n            prerequisites for further reforms. The principal feature for\n            the success of the SAC operation in Vietnam is that it\n            reflected the strategy of the Government in its reform and\n            adjustment program. This reform program grew out of the\n            close policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government\n            since the late 1980s. These features will continue to serve\n            well in the future for a fruitful cooperation between the\n            Bank and the Government as Vietnam embarks on a more\n            complicated path to sustainable development. The\n            implementation of the measures supported by the Bank's\n            first SAC in Vietnam has led to a strong macroeconomic\n            performance and helped further the transition to a market\n            economy. Nevertheless, sustaining Vietnam's recent\n            economic performance will require further reform to improve\n            investment efficiency and raise domestic resource\n            mobilization, as well as ensure the sustainability of the\n            balance of payments. Further reform measures in these areas\n            will be supported by a second structural adjustment\n            operation, currently under preparation."}, "docdt": "1997-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
