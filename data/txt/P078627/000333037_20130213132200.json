"Ratings for the Economic Management\n            Support Project for Burundi were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            institutional strengthening and capacity building projects,\n            though assessed for their contributory value in a broader\n            reform process, must still be constructed with maximum\n            internal cohesion and coherence. The results framework must\n            always contain target values for project development\n            objective, or PDO and intermediate outcomes and the number\n            of measurable indicators should not be attenuated. The\n            separation of powers constitutionally means distinct\n            governance structures pertain in this sector. If added to\n            this the judicial systems are under severe strain and held\n            in especially low regard by the population (as is the case\n            in Burundi), it must be questionable if the range of issues\n            can be satisfactorily addressed in a project encompassing\n            diverse other sectors. The supervision of big infrastructure\n            works tend to be time-consuming for Project Coordinating\n            Unit, or PCU, affecting the quality of supervision for other\n            activities covered under the project. As recommendation for\n            the future, the procurement process for such high value\n            civil works contract should be handled separately by\n            infrastructures project."}, "docdt": "2013-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
