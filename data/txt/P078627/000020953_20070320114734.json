It specifically is to: a) restore\n            orthodoxy and discipline; b) introduce transparency in\n            economic, financial and human resources management, and to\n            improve national account and macroeconomic framework; and c)\n            modernize management through training, reorganization and\n            introduction of information based management concepts and\n            systems, centered on computerized information management.\n            Impacts will be felt in the planning, approval, and\n            demolition and construction stages. In the planning stage\n            adverse impacts may occur as a result of poor design\n            resulting in high energy consumption. In addition, there may\n            be poor waste drainage resulting in land and water\n            pollution. Corrective measures may be too prohibitive. Lack\n            of proper approval or supervision may result in selection of\n            incompetent firms and violation of building codes. Finally,\n            construction and demolition may create noise, land, water\n            and air pollution, as well as create hazard to public safety."}, "docdt": "2007-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
