By mail ref.\n            no. 540/3622/2009 dated August 26, 2009, the Minister of\n            Finance, on behalf of the Government confirmed to the World\n            Bank that the gap of financing from approximately US$3.3\n            million will be dealt with in the national budget, 2010 and\n            2011. However, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) had\n            not envisaged the option of co-financing of this activity\n            and had to be amended. At the same time, the construction of\n            the building triggered some of the environmental and social\n            policies of the World Bank. Consequently, a consultant was\n            recruited by the Government in order to help update the plan\n            of environment and safeguard management plan (ESMP) and\n            whose preliminary activities will have had to be carried out\n            before beginning of all work related to the construction of\n            the building. This process took several months and\n            construction finally began in January 2010, with a schedule\n            of 18 months. In addition, there was insufficient quantity\n            of the required quality of cement supplies and bricks\n            available in the local market. There was also higher than\n            usual rain fall causing some delays in construction of the\n            foundation. During the implementation mission in November\n            2010, the World Bank was informed that construction was\n            approximately nine months behind schedule due to extensive\n            delays in getting materials to Bujumbura from Dar-es-Salaam\n            port. The new completion date is estimated to be March 2012,\n            thus resulting in the attach request by the Minister of\n            Finance on behalf of the Government of Burundi to extend the\n            closing date of the project for one year."}, "docdt": "2011-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
