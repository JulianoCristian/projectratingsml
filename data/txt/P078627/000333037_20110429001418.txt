1.      The closing date for the above-mentioned project will be extended from July 31,
2011 t o July 31, 2012 t o e nable t he f inalization of t he c onstruction of t he M inistry o f
Finance building. This will be the second extension of the project.

2.      The start of the construction of the building of the Ministry of the finance faced a
number of de lays. F ollowing t he unf ruitful i nvitation t o t ender o f 200 8, t he T ender
Documents ( CAD) w ere r evised a nd l aunched. W hen of fers ha d be en r eceived i n m id
2009, the proposed tenders were well above the budgeted amount in the project. By mail
Ref. no. 540/3622/2009 dated August 26, 2009, t he Minister of Finance, on behalf of the
Government confirmed to the World Bank that the gap of financing from approximately
US$3.3 m illion will be dealt with i n the national budget, 2010 a nd 2011. H owever, t he
DCA had not envisaged the option of co-financing of this activity and had to be amended.
At t he s ame t ime, t he construction of t he bui lding t riggered s ome of t he environmental
and social policies of the World Bank. C onsequently, a consultant was recruited by the
Government in order to help update the plan of environment and safeguard management
plan (ESMP) and whose preliminary a ctivities would have had t o b e c arried out before
beginning of a ll w ork related t o t he c onstruction of t he bui lding. T his pr ocess t ook
several m onths a nd c onstruction f inally b egan i n J anuary 2010, w ith a s chedule of 18
months.

3.       In addition, t here w as i nsufficient qua ntity of t he r equired qu ality of cement
supplies and bricks available in the local market. T here was also higher than usual rain
fall c ausing s ome d elays i n construction of t he f oundation. D uring t he i mplementation
mission i n N ovember 2010, t he W orld Bank w as i nformed t hat c onstruction w as
approximately nine months behind schedule due to extensive delays in getting materials
to B ujumbura from D ar-es-Salaam p ort. T he n ew c ompletion d ate is e stimated to b e
March 2012, thus resulting in the attached request by the Minister of Finance on behalf of
the Government of Burundi to extend the closing date of the project for one year.

4.      There is no f ormal action plan agreed with the Government because construction
of the building is already underway, and procurement for the equipment and furniture for
the MoF building has also begun. It is fully expected that they will be received prior to
the completion of the building but within the extension time period.

5.      There are no bud get i mplications f or s upervision. T here i s a dequate f unding
under t he ong oing F inancial a nd P rivate S ector P roject, a nd s upervision of t his single
remaining activity doe s not r equire m uch a dditional t ime; i t c an be c overed w ithin t he

6.    Delay closing this activity would not delay closing the project and preparing the
Implementation C losing R eport ( ICR). It i s pr oposed t hat onl y t his one a ctivity i n t he

within six months following original closing date (July 31, 2011).

7.     There are no overdue audits or interim financial reports from their entities.
