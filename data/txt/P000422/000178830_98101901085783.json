The\n            technical assistance component would help set up and operate\n            a new Investment Department within BCV and a new Industrial\n            Promotion Unit within SEINE. The project would be closely\n            coordinated and implemented simultaneously with a UNDP/UNIDO\n            project providing technical assistance in industrial\n            planning, policies, sector studies and entrepreneurial training."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
