MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Cape Verde -
Industrial Ftnance and Promotion Pro3ect (Credit 1579-CV)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Cape Verde - Industrial Finance and Promotion
Project (Credit 1579-CV) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. No contribution was received from
the Borrower.
The project was the second IDA operation in the country and the first involving the industrial
sector. Its objective was to promote industrial development through the provision of a line of credit
to the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) to finance small and medium enterprises; and technical assistance to
BCV and the Directorate of Industry to help establish an institutional structure capable of stimulating
industrial development.
Project objectives have been largely met. The line of credit was almost fully utilized and most
of the subprojects financed are reported to be performing well. The two new institutional units created
under the project have evolved into effective institutions for industrial development and financial
intermediation in Cape Verde. In parallel with this project, the Government introduced important
financial sector and regulatory reforms, which have improved the environment for private sector
development.
Overall, the project is rated as satisfactory. Institutional development is rated as substantial and
sustainability as likely.
The PCR is satisfactory. It does not adequately cover the performance of subprojects, because
weak monitoring and evaluation arrangements have made it impractical to reestimate economic and
financial returns of subprojects.
An audit of this project is not planned.

INDUSTRIAL FINANCE AND PROMOTION PROJECT
(CR. 1579-CV)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Industrial Finance and
Promotion project in Cape Verde, for which Credit 1579-CV in the amount of SDR 4.1
million (US$ 4.0 million equivalent) was approved on April 11, 1985. The credit was
closed on December 1992, one year behind schedule.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Division of the Africa Region
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and  D). On May 21, 1993, the Bank sent the
Borrower Parts I and HI with the request to prepare Part II by June 14, 1993. As of today,
June 29, no reply has yet been received.
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the staff appraisal report; the president
report; the supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.

INDUSTRIAL FINANCE AN) PROMOTION PROJECT
(CR. 1579-CV)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Qbjective
The project aimed at supporting implementation of Government's program for
broadening and diversifying Cape Verde's economic base, creating employment, and
establishing an institutional structure capable of stimulating industrial sector development.
Economic diversification and employment creation would be achieved by identifying,
appraising and financing viable industrial projects (para. 9).
Implementation Experience
Appraisal was completed in December 1983. The project was approved on April
11, 1985 and was signed on June 6, 1985. It became effective on November 4, 1985.
Actual implementation of the project started slowly due to difficulties experienced in fully
staffing BCV's new Industrial Department, BCV's unfamiliarity with IDA's disbursement
procedures which necessitated explanations from Bank staff, and difficulties experienced
by BCV in collecting payments by sub-borrowers during the first two years.
Despite these problems, the objectives of the project consistently remained valid,
and project implementation picked up significantly in 1986. Commitment and
disbursement of funds under the line of credit component proceeded smoothly, and by
1990, 87 percent of this component had been disbursed. The final date for sub-project
commitment was extended by one year from June 30, 1989 to June 30, 1990. The
project's closing date was also extended by one year to December 31, 1992, to allow
BCV to complete disbursements of committed funds for approved sub-projects (para 25).
Implementation of the TA components proceeded satisfactorily (para. 20).
The following amendments to the legal documents were made, at the request of
the Government of Cape Verde: (i) On April 29, 1986, a small portion of the credit was
re-allocated to allow financing of a portion of the rental costs of premises for the
Industrial Promotion Unit while its new building was under construction; (ii) in
December 1988, the ceiling for sub-loans financed under the credit line were increased
from US$300,000 to US$650,000 and the ceiling for fixed assets of medium-scale
enterprises was raised from US$1,500,000 equivalent to US$2,000,000 equivalent.
In addition, undisbursed funds originally targeted for financing technical assistance
at BCV were re-allocated. On August 22, 1989, US$30,000 were taken out of BCV's
TA component and used to set up a Special Account as part of IPU's TA component
(para. 17).

Results
The project achieved its expected results of creating the institutional structures
needed to promote and stimulate industrial sector development. The two new units
created by BCV (ID) and by the Directorate of Industry (IPU) performed well and have
since then become effective institutions for industrial development and financial
intermediation in Cape Verde. (para. 17).
A total of 49 sub-projects were financed under the credit, at an estimated total
cost of SDR 3.2 million, which helped to diversify Cape Verde's economy and to create
337 jobs. All of the sub-projects were new ventures, and covered a reasonably broad
spectrum of industrial and service activities (fishing, bakeries, hotels and tourism,
textiles, carpentry) (para. 24).
With the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank,
separation of the BCV into a central bank and a commercial/investment bank is currently
under way. In addition, a new legal and regulatory framework is under preparation, to
promote financial efficiency (para. 28).
Sustainabilit,
Overall prospects for the project's sustainability are good. As mentioned above,
the project succeeded in creating important institutional structures (IPU, ID) which have
become effective instruments for industrial promotion as well as for private industrial
finance. In addition, the improvements in the industrial and financial regulatory and
institutional frameworks that were initiated by the project have set in motion a process of
deregulation and market orientation that will be difficult to reverse (para. 27).
Findings and Lessons Learned
The main lessons that were drawn from this operation were: (a) in order to
accelerate private sector led industrialization process, the need to create the policy
environment and industrial regulatory framework, such as market oriented financial sector
development confronting private sector operators (para. 26); (b) in order to reduce the
excessive use of public sector resources, the need to depend, to the extent possible, on
private institutions to assist private enterprises (para. 25); In Cape Verde, this was not
possible because of the quasi-absence of the private sector initiative prior to the project.
Indeed, this was one of the main reasons to finance the creation of ID and LPU (para. 13);
(c) in order to promote the private sector initiative, the need to provide appropriate
institutional support in the design and follow-up of sub-projects. This was identified as
instrumental to the preparation and evaluation problems of those sub-projects which
experienced difficulties (para. 24).

B.   Background
1.    Cape Verde, an archipelago consisting of ten islands scattered within 165 kms. radius,
is a small country with the land area of 4036 square kilometers. It is located 650 kilometers
off the coast of Senegal and gained its independence in 1975. Nine of the ten islands are
inhabited. The country has a resident population of about 400,000, of which 50% live on
the island of Santiago. Approximately a quarter of the population live in Praia, the capital.
Actually, there are more Cap Verdeans (750,00) outside of the country than in country itself.
This is due to heavy immigration to the USA, Europe and Continental Africa. Difficult living
conditions and limited employment opportunities in Cape Verde have traditionally been
inducing this immigration. Only one-tenth of the land surface area (426 km2) is arable, and
630,000 kM2, which include the maritime area 200 kilometers radius around each of the
islands, have been declared an Exclusive Economic Zone. During the 1980's, the natural
increase in the population was 2.7% per annum (adjusted to 1.5 % for emigration). Per capita
GNP is estimated to have more than doubled from US$ 372 in 1980 to US$ 803 in 1990.
The country has very limited natural resource base. The lack of water resources severely
limit most economic activities and this is especially is acute in the urban centers. In addition,
unfavorable climatic conditions, a small domestic market, and costly internal and external
communications with the outside world create a further obstacles to the development.
2.    The Industrial Sector.   Following independence, Cape Verde's economic
development strategy focused on infrastructure expansion, and advocated a cautious approach



- 2 -
towards industrial promotion. The share of manufacturing and mining in GDP declined from
6.9% in 1977 to 4.2% in 1982, while that of the construction industry increased during the
same period from 16.5% to 24%. The fisheries sector, dominated by large industrial fishing
units in the public sector, also contributed about 5% to GDP though they are still working
below  capacity.  Infrastructure accounts for an estimated 4%  of total employment.
Manufacturing, mining and construction employ about 29%, agriculture and fisheries about
30% and the service sector approximately 37% of the economically active population.
3.    There were no specific instruments of industrial policy prior to 1982, and no
investment code had been published. Industrial policies in Cape Verde were strongly
determined by a dominant public sector and the quasi-monopolistic position of larger and
medium-sized enterprises. Measured by international standards, however, there is practically
no large scale industry sector in Cape Verde. The largest part of industrial production
originates from ten public and five mixed-ownership enterprises. Public and mixed
enterprises have largely been self-supporting in the past and five of them have been
reasonably profitable. Due to the low priority given to private industry, Cape Verde's
private industrial enterprises were smaller than public enterprises. They had little capital and
voice in determining national policies or regulations. They were also less capital intensive
than public or mixed enterprises. However, the Government did not oppose the existence of
the private sector and intended to promote and encourage private as well as cooperative
enterprises.
4.    Despite unfavorable natural constraints such as severe shortage of natural resources,
small domestic markets and unfavorable factor costs, the new Government (1991) believes
that, under the existing conditions, only industrial sector can vitalize the economy by
assuming three major objectives:
a-) reducing the unemployment;
b-) reducing the country's extreme dependance in foreign aid; and
c-) better satisfying basic national needs.
The new Government adopted the objective of minimizing the State's role in the economy
by phasing out its portfolio in productive activities. It hopes to achieve this objective by
shifting its role through:
1-)   streamlining public administration (restructuring, civil service reform and
rationalization, and decentralization);
2-)   reforming the public enterprise sector (i.e. reducing government participation
in the sector through restructuring, privatization, and liquidation);
3-)   promoting the role of the private sector in the economy (including the
establishment of appropriate institutional structures and a competitive
environment);



-3-
4-)  limiting the government investments to the basic infrastructure needed to
facilitate the expansion of private sector activities.
In the Development Plan, areas identified as having potential for the private sector
development were mainly:
(i) fishing, fish processing and processing of agricultural products;
(ii) services to international shipping and aviation (ship repair, bunkering, etc.);
(iii) construction materials; and
(iv) light metal, electrical and electronic engineering.
5.    The Financial Sector. During the appraisal, the banking system in Cape Verde was
very small and unspecialized. The formal financial sector has been operating in an entirely
state-dominated and non-competitive financial environment. The sector comprised three
state-owned institutions:
(i) Cape Verde Bank (Banco de Cabo Verde = BCVM: a monobank performing the
services of central, commercial and investment banking, which continues to be the
dominant financial institution responsible for some 90% of total domestic credit;
(ii) Caixa Economica de Cabo Verde (CECV): a savings bank providing consumer
and mortgage finance mostly to civil servants, the and
(iii) Instituto de Seguros e Providencia Social (ISPS): an insurance and social security
company.
Established in 1976, BCV has combined the function of different banking activities including
the central bank. It has been a well managed institution since its establishment. BCV employs
about 320 staff of which 190 are located in six branches and six small agencies spread
among the islands. In order to play more active role in the economic development of the
country, BCV (advised by IMF and the World Bank) has decided to separate the
development finance activities from its central and commercial banking operations. For this
purpose, the Department of Credit Services and Branches has been transformed into separate
Investment Department (ID) which is in charge of medium and long term investment lending
activities. The staffing of ID was difficult since the professionals knowing sub-project
evaluation were non existing in the country. In fact, the technical assistance component of
the project was mainly designed to finance the training of the future professionals. The
development of the new procedures, policies and operations of ID and BCV has required
intensive consulting and technical assistance which have been provided under the project.
The IDA credit was channeled principally through this new department (ID).
6.    The separation of the BCV into a central bank and a commercial and development
bank is currently ongoing. After nine years, the separation is still not completed. BCV's
overall financial position is rather sound but according to BDO's report (BDO Binder &
Co.; an audit firm), the newly created BCA (Banco Commercial do Atlantico) has 35-40%



-4-
non-performing commercial loans in its portfolio. Before the implementation of the project
and because there was no other institution to undertake private sector promotion activities
BCV was undertaking this role. In fact, this was an auxiliary function and BCV was passive
as regards to the identification, evaluation and, promotion of investment projects. Also, its
project appraisal and supervision procedures needed improvement. The technical assistance
and training components of the project contributed substantially to an improvement in
ID/BCV's procedures and operational standards.
7.   In an attempt to revitalize the economy, reduce unemployment and decrease the
country's dependence on foreign aid, the Government, in early 1980s, adopted a program,
aimed at improving the macro-economic framework and financial intermediation. It has
introduced market signals into economy by promoting private sector development. In the
financial sector, it also proposed to move towards adoption of a positive real interest rate
policy to compensate for the past erosion of deposit and lending rates caused by rising
inflation and fixed interest rates. Financial assistance to develop the private industrial sector
was to be provided by the Industrial Finance and Promotion Project.
8.    Actually, BCV is in the process of being reconstituted as an independent Central Bank
with substantial IMF and bilateral support. Although the new BCA has been established as
a separate unit, the key elements of its ultimate configuration remain unresolved. Overall,
the financial system of Cape Verde remains embryonic. Substantative work is currently being
carried out by the Bank Department in charge to develop this vital sector of the economy.
C.   Project Objectives and Description
9.    Project Objectives.   The project aimed at supporting implementation of
Govemment's program for broadening and diversifying Cape Verde's economic base,
creating employment, and establishing an institutional structure capable of stimulating
industrial sector development. Economic diversification and employment creation would be
achieved by identifying, appraising and financing viable industrial projects. The project
designed to be complemented by a UNDP/UNIDO technical assistance project (US$ 0.5
million).
10.   Components. The SDR 4.1 million (US$4.0 million equivalent) project consisted
of a:
a. US$3.3 million line of credit to the BCV to finance productive investments in small-
and medium-scale industrial enterprises, including artisans and cooperatives;
b. US$0.3 million technical assistance component designed to set up and operate a new
Investment Department (ID) within BCV; and



-5-
c. US$0.4 million to provide the Secretaria de Estado de Industrfia e Energia (SEINE),
under the Directorate of Industry, with the technical assistance required to establish
an Industrial Promotion Unit (IPU), as a well-managed and effective entity.
11.         Beneficiaries US$ 3.3 million would be onlent to BCV by the Government.
Small and medium-size enterprises were the main target of the project. Eligible enterprises
would include existing and new, private, mixed and public enterprises in the manufacturing,
mining, processing, construction agro-industrial sub-sectors; service industries, like repair
shops and hotels; fisheries and commercial farming, like poultry and pig farms. High
priority would be given to the rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of existing viable
or potentially viable enterprises. Medium-scale enterprises would be assisted whenever there
are clear export prospects. In order to ensure financing of a range of small enterprises,
cooperatives and artisans, a subloan ceiling of US$ 300,000 would be established. In
addition, BCV would establish a revolving fund of US$ 500,000 from the proceeds of the
first round of sub-loans in order to provide short and medium-term financing for working
capital and investment needs of very small-scale and artisanal enterprises.
12.   Terms and Conditions of Sub-loans  BCV's sub-loans would finance up to 75%
of the total cost of the projects, with the balance to be met by the sub-borrowers' equity
contribution. Expansion and modernization projects could be financed up to 100%, subject
to adequate equity base. Repayment periods of sub-loans would normally range between
three and twelve years, including a grace period of up to three years. Originally, BCV would
charge an interest rate between 7.5% and 12.5% depending on the size of enterprise and
loans, the loan period and the type and size of the fixed assets. In addition BCV and IDA
would review annually the interest rate structure in order to reach a positive return in real
terms.
13.   Technical Assistance to BCV and SEINE The project proposed a close cooperation
between BCV's new Investment Department (ID) and the Industrial Promotion Unit (IPU)
of SEINE. ID would receive from IPU the sub-project proposals. It would also accept loan
applications directly from prospective borrowers and would develop its own project
promotion, appraisal and supervision capacity. In order to create the functional ID within
BCV, the project proposed US$ 0.3 million technical assistance which provided:
-     two man-year of a development finance expert (US$ 220,000);
-     short-term consultancy services (US$ 50,000);
-     training of ID's staff (US$ 30,000)
The main functions of the new IPU were:
(a)   to identify and prepare industrial projects;
(b)   to identify suitable project promoters and to advise them on all aspects of
project implementation; and



(c)   to provide technical assistance to existing enterprises.
IPU's project preparation work would benefit from the sector and sub-sector studies to be
prepared with UNIDO assistance by the Division for Studies and Planning of SEINE. In
order to provide SEINE with the technical assistance required to establish [PU as a well
managed and effective entity, US$ 0.4 million of the credit would be used for the following:
two consultants as an industrial promotion expert (US$ 220,000);
short-term consultancy services (US$ 150,000);
training [PU staff in industrial promotion, project planning and advisory
services (US$ 30,000).
The project also aimed a close cooperation and simultaneous implementation with the
UNDP/UNIDO technical assistance project which would concentrate on industral planning,
policies, sector studies and training.
D.   Prolect Desifn and Organization
14.   The project's design was appropriate at the time of project appraisal. Given the
urgency of providing financial and technical assistance to a much neglected sector of the
economy (small and medium industrial enterprises), the project was designed to use the
existing institutional structure (BCV and SEINE). These were untested institutions in a
country facing serious economic constraints, and they needed to be allowed to build up
experience in operational and administrative capabilities before being entrusted with the
management of industrial finance. A simultaneous effort was made to improve on the
structure and the intemal functioning of these institutions. This approach entailed certain
risks, mainly implementation delays, as BCV's new Investment Department took time to
develop the necessary mechanisms for providing and administering financial and technical
assistance. In addition, the initial inexperience of BCV staff, and their unfamiliarity with
Bank procedures, reduced their capacity and delayed the implementation of the project.
E.    Implementation Experience
15.   Although the appraisal was completed in December 1983, the credit effectiveness was
delayed for several months due to the requirement of a general increase in interest rates as
a condition of effectiveness. The project was approved on April 11, 1985 and was signed
two months later on June 6, 1985. It became effective on November 4, 1985. Actual
implementation of the project also started slowly, for the following reasons:
(i) difficulties were experienced in fully staffing BCV's new Industrial Department,
because of the limited availability of Portuguese speaking experts;



(ii) BCV's unfamiliarity with IDA's disbursement procedures necessitated repeated
explanations from Bank staff.
(iii) BCV experienced difficulties in collecting evidence of payments by sub-
borrowers to contractors for civil works, thus slowing down disbursements in the first
two years of project implementation;
(iv) it took also close to six months to find adequate housing, and the money to
finance it, for the Industrial Promotion Unit of the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
and this delayed the unit's start up.
16.   Despite these initial problems, the project did not loose momentum and consistently
remained up to date. Implementation picked up significantly in 1986, by which time all nine
staff of the Industrial Department were in place. The project has also been coordinated with
a UNIDO technical assistance project under which two industrial planning experts have been
provided to SEINE. At the beginning, it was extremely difficult to identify suitable
candidates (experts) for SEINE and BCV due to unattractiveness of this 'hardship' country
and the limited number of portuguese speaking candidates. Preparation of an adequate project
pipeline, an objective originally planned to be achieved under PPF, was therefore delayed.
The sporadic and modest lending operations of the past have continued largely due to limited
investment opportunities in Cape Verde and the total absence of a systematic project
promotion efforts.
17.  In 1986, with the assistance of an IDA financed expert, ID was physically separated
from the BCV's head office. However, the total separation of its accounts is still an ongoing
process. The Department was adequately staffed with 23 employees including 7 professionals
operating in Praia and San Vicente. Likewise, the IPU in SEINE was operational but at early
stages, the non availability of adequate facilities for its location was problem. US$ 30,000
of the project were allocated for the rental propriety. The staffing of IPU took more time
than expected and its part time manager devoted inadequate time to manage the unit.
18.   Coordination of the project with the UNDP/UNIDO project (Project CVI/84/002-
Industrie) concluded with satisfaction with the completion of the UNIDO project in 1986.
According to the conclusions and recommendations of the meeting between the Govemment,
the Bank and UNIDO, the coordination was rather successful in creating a management
capacity and an institution building in Cape Verde. The only issue for the Bank was to find
the procedural solution in order to pay UNDP with IDA funds since the same technical
assistance was already provided to SEINE by UNDP.
19.   After a slow start, IDA's organization and operational procedures for sub-project
evaluation, formulated by experts providing the technical assistance, have been implemented
and the pace of project implementation improved substantially. More than 50 projeQts were
in the pipe-line. Four sub-projects were demanding credits (between US$ 450,000 and US$
650,000) over the agreed ceiling of US$ 300,000. Following BCV request, the ceiling for
sub-loans was increased from US$ 300,000 to US$ 650,000 and for fixed assets from US$

1,500,000 to 2,000,000. Also, in order to make the process of the disbursements, the Bank
agreed to a simplified version of "substantiation" for small construction outlays.
20.   Implementation of the TA components also proceeded satisfactorily. However, staff
of the Industrial Promotion Unit at the Ministry of Economy and Finance seemed to have
a better capacity for administering technical assistance than did their counterparts at the
BCV, and this was reflected in faster utilization of [PU's TA component. The Investment
Department at BCV also outgrew its initial inexperience and evolved into a "breeding
ground" for future administrators and managers in public institutions and the private sector.
Modifications were made during project implementation to take advantage of the relative
strengths of these two institutions.
21.   In order to adapt the project to changing circumstances, the following amendments
to the legal documents were made, at the request of the Government of Cape Verde:
*  On April 29, 1986, a small portion of the credit (7%) was re-allocated to allow
financing of a portion of the rental costs of premises for the Industrial Promotion
Unit while its new building was under constructon;
*  In December 1988, the ceiling for sub-loans financed under the credit line were
increased from US$300,000 to US$650,000 and the ceiling for fixed assets of
medium-scale enterprises was raised from US$1,500,000 equivalent to US$2,000,000
equivalent. In addition, undisbursed funds originally targeted for financing technical
assistance at BCV were re-allocated to pay for technical assistance to the Industrial
Promotion Unit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance;
*  On August 22, 1989, US$30,000 were taken out of BCV's TA component and used
to set up a Special Account as part of IPU's TA component.
F.    Reults
22.   Notwithstanding the initial delays in implementation, the project achieved its expected
results of creating the institutional structures needed to promote and stimulate industrial
sector development. The two new units created (the ID at BCV, and the IPU at the
Directorate of Industry) performed well during project implementation, and have since then
become effective institutions for industrial development and financial intermediation in Cape
Verde.
23.   The total of 49 sub-projects financed under the credit, at an estimated total cost of
SDR 3.2 million, helped to diversify Cape Verde's economy and to create 337 jobs. All of
the sub-projects were new ventures, and covered a reasonably broad spectrum of industrial
and service activities (fishing, bakeries, hotels and tourism, textiles, carpentry). Based on
information available from BCV, most of the projects are operating, and only six are



- 9 -
reported as having difficulties, mainly because of insufficient working capital, inexperienced
management, or marketing problems. Sub-project performance seemed to be quite successful
and problem-free, when compared to projects in other countries in the region. Quality of
ID's loan portfolio has decreased and the doubtful loans increased from 8.2% to 11.7%
between 1988 and 1990. As of December 31, 1991, arrears on sub-loans granted by BCV
averaged 14% which is low for sub-saharan Africa standards.
24.    According to the supervision reports, the quality of project reports was generally
good and the performance of the sub-projects was satisfactory. This quality level has been
reached thanks to the technical assistance given by ID and IPU to the private sector
entrepreneurs. The sub-project applications have indicated that the private sector
entrepreneurs were not ready to prepare acceptable feasibility studies and their sub-project
preparations have largely depended on the quality and design of the sub-project preparation
of ID and IPU. The project processed 57 sub-loan applications. 49 sub-project were
approved and fully disbursed and 8 were cancelled. 18 out of 49 sub-project were 'A'
project (US$ 80,000 and over) (Annex-1). In general, the housing construction loans
performed poorly. The approved and disbursed sub-projects have created about 337
employment. In 1990, the line of credit was fully committed and a technical assistance for
financial sector development has been arranged. At the request of BCV, the Bank accepted
that the financial sector study be changed into technical assistance to help BCV formulate a
strategy for financial sector development. The existence of a satisfactory financial sector
development strategy was made a prerequisite for a new Bank financing in the sector.

25.   Commitment and disbursement of funds under the line of credit component proceeded
smoothly. The project agreement had minor modifications (Table C-Part III). At the end of
1990, 87 percent of the credit had been disbursed. In view of the good prospects for
utilization of the credit line, and satisfactory performance of the Investment Department, the
final date for sub-project commitment was extended by one year from June 30, 1989 to June
30, 1990. The project's closing date was also extended by one year to December 31, 1992,
to allow BCV to complete disbursements of committed funds for approved sub-projects.
26.   Parallel to the investment and technical assistance programs introduced by this
project, Government initiated reforms of the industrial regulatory framework, and introduced
measures to make the financial sector more dynamic in order to improve financial
intermediation. In late 1988, the Government prepared a package of enabling legislation to
promote private investment, including an investment code (the Foreign Investment Law), an
Offshore Banking Law, Customs Regulations for Entrepots, an Industrial Development Law,
and an Industrial Statute. These measures increased the potential for the private sector in
general and foreign investors in particular, and introduced much needed transparency into
the regulatory process. In addition, the Government maintained macro-economic stability
and a prudent expenditure pattern throughout the 1980s, so that the relative absence of waste
and corruption set a tone for honest business practices. More importantly, it never interfered
in the internal management of BCV, allowing it to concentrate on its job.
27.   Significant progress was also made in improving the financial sector's regulatory and
institutional framework. As a first step towards achieving positive real interest rates, BCV
agreed on an increase of 2 % in all interest rates immediately prior to credit negotiations in
1985. BCV also reviewed the level and structure of interest rates for sub-loans financed
under the IDA credit annually. As part of its efforts to compensate for past erosion of the
deposit and lending rates caused by rising inflation and fixed interest rates, BCV adopted a
program in 1991 that has moved Cape Verde to a positive real interest rate policy.
Implementation of the program is proceeding in tandem with banking institutional
restructuring (see para. 17) which is expected to be completed by end June 1993.
28.   With the support of the International Monetary Fund (aMF) and the World Bank,
separation of the BCV into a central bank and a commercial/investment bank is currently
under way. Professional training is envisaged for about 60 bankers over a three-year period,
and the Bank of Portugal is providing technical assistance for re-training, as well as for
studies of the different aspects of banking. In addition, a new legal and regulatory
framework is under preparation, to promote financial efficiency by enhancing the prospects
for competition among financial institutions, including insurance companies, and by making
possible the development of market-oriented financial instruments. State monopoly in
insurance ended with the first private insurance company being set up in December 1991 as
a joint venture with a foreign partner. These developments have resulted in lower fees and
premiums, better services, transfer of know-how, and better professional training
opportunities for local staff.

G.   Sustainability
29.   Overall prospects for the project's sustainability are good. As mentioned above, the
project succeeded in creating important institutional structures (IPU, ID) which have become
effective instruments for industrial promotion as well as for private industrial finance. In
addition, the improvements in the industrial and financial regulatory and institutional
frameworks that were initiated by the project have set in motion a process of deregulation
and market orientation that will be difficult to reverse.
H.   The Bank's Performance
30.   About 58.9 staff weeks were spent on project preparation. This is not excessive
considering that this project was the Bank's second operation in Cape Verde and the first one
in the sector. IDA's supervision of the project was adequate, albeit irregularities (See Table
F in Part III). There were nine supervision missions between effectiveness in 1985 and
credit closing in 1992. IDA also fostered a continuous and constructive dialogue with
implementation agencies which greatly facilitated expansion of the scope of Bank and IMF
assistance to Cape Verde.
L.    The Borrower's Performance
31.   As an institution undergoing change, and given the initial inexperience of its staff for
implementing these types of operations, BCV carried out its mandate under difficult
conditions. It was, however, able to overcome many operational and organizational
problems, mainly because of the commitment of its staff and their capacity for hard work.
IPU implemented the promotional and technical assistance components creditably, as BCV
did for the line of credit component.
J.    Findings and Lessons Learned
32.   The experience with this operation, which includes the first IDA-financed line of
credit to BCV, suggests that the operation was reasonably successful in financing a number
of priority industrial small- and medium-scale enterprise (SME) sub-projects. This was
mainly due to the Government's commitment and support. Successful promotion of SME
development requires an integrated package of financial and technical support both before
and after they are launched, and the lessons to be drawn from their implementation have long
been gleamed from similar Bank projects in Africa. This project therefore experienced the
merits and weaknesses attached to its own design as well as those of classical DFC projects.
However, for a small country like Cape Verde, the problems of DFC projects (large scale
portfolio failure; inadequate TA and follow up of sub-projects, etc.) were not as pronounced
as those experienced elsewhere in Africa in the 1980s.



- 12 -
33.   The main lessons that were drawn from this operation were:
* in order to accelerate private sector led industrialization process, the need to create
the policy environment and industrial regulatory framework, such as market oriented
financial sector development confronting private sector operators (para. 26);
* in order to reduce the excessive use of public sector resources, the need to depend,
to the extent possible, on private institutions to assist private enterprises (para. 25);
In Cape Verde, this was not possible because of the quasi-absence of the private
sector initiative prior to the project. Indeed, this was one of the main reasons to
finance the creation of ID and IPU (para. 13);
* in order to promote the private sector initiative, the need to provide appropriate
institutional support in the design and follow-up of sub-projects. This was identified
as instrumental to the preparation and evaluation problems of those sub-projects
which experienced difficulties (para. 24).
K. Project Relationship
34.   Bank relationships with the Government and BCV on the project have been good, and
Bank personnel on mission have had liberal access to available documentation on the
progress of the project.
L. Project Documentation
35.   The legal agreements were quite adequate and appropriate for achieving project
objectives and the appraisal report of the project provided a useful framework for review of
project implementation. However, the information data base on actual sub-project status
leaves room for improvement as a modemized and upgraded system would have allowed for
better monitoring.
