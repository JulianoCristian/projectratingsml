risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also highly satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include: empowering community organizations with\n            resources and enhancing their capacity to manage these\n            directly through community driven development (CDD) approach\n            enhances efficiency and sustainability of targeted\n            poverty-reduction projects. Until the capacity of the poor\n            farmers has been sufficiently developed to improve their\n            limitations and creditworthiness for traditional\n            microfinance institutions, it is inevitable that they should\n            be assisted with grants in order to participate in\n            Fadama-type livelihood activities. Socially-inclusive\n            approach to local development planning (LDP) can be an\n            effective tool for avoiding and managing conflicts arising\n            from competition to access scarce land and water resources\n            for Fadama enterprise. It is the central paradigm shift\n            around which the entire Fadama system revolves. Keep an eye\n            on sustainability of project supported interventions.\n            Selection and management of subprojects by communities and\n            their cost sharing in the matching grant facilitate\n            sustainability. In order to lay a sound basis for\n            sustainability, operations and maintenance of assets should\n            be undertaken by communities and local governments, through\n            operations and maintenance (O&M) plans to be funded\n            partly in cash or in-kind by the community organizations."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
