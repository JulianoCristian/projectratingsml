      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment of the Second Fadama Development Project
that became effective on May 27, 2004 and that closed on December 31, 2009, as
planned. Total actual project costs were US$118 million compared to the appraisal
estimate of US$125 million. The second in a series of three consecutive rural
development projects, Fadama II represented a significant shift in the way the World
Bank framed its approach to service delivery and income generation in rural Nigeria. It
was the first project to introduce the concept of community driven development to
Nigeria’s agriculture sector. A third phase of the project – Fadama III – was approved in
December 2008 and was under implementation at the time of this review. For this
assessment, IEG visited areas that had been supported by the second phase of the project.

METHODOLOGY

This project performance assessment seeks to validate the relevance, efficiency and
effectiveness of the reported results of the second phase of the Fadama project in Nigeria.
Significant limitations in the external assessment of the project and the Bank’s
completion reporting introduced complexities for the design of a comprehensive
assessment of this project’s performance. An Objectives based assessment, this review
developed and implemented fit-to-purpose methods to evaluate three inter-dependent
project objectives.

The primary objective of the second phase of the Fadama program was to sustainably
increase the incomes of Fadama Users -- those who depend directly or indirectly on
Fadama resources (farmers, pastoralists, fishers, hunters, gatherers, and service
providers). This assessment was challenged by the fact that the project’s monitoring and
results framework did not collect income data. An independent beneficiary assessment
conducted one year after the project began also experienced difficulty in collecting recall
data on the change in major components of household income. Owing to these
difficulties, the assessment utilized household composition and size and the change in
major productive assets as the explanatory variable of their exercise while treating
income as a dependent variable. The assessment was challenged by the fact that it
counted the change in major productive assets as an outcome variable while the measured
assets were the explanatory variable, or the input of the project. Neither the monitoring
nor the assessment schemes measured sustainability as a function of the objective. None
of the assessments disaggregated the results at the level of resource user.

To test the project’s critical assumption – that Fadama users had sustainably increased
their incomes as a result of the transfer of project supported assets - IEG administered a
one-on-one survey to a random stratified sample of 10% of the direct Fadama
beneficiaries that had been interviewed for the 2006 impact assessment. The survey was
designed to verify and gauge the present day status of their public and private assets
delivered under the project’s second phase, since data pertaining to the effective
functioning of these assets was used as a proxy to measure incomes by the external
assessment. Sixty private and twenty public assets across six states were validated and
assessed through this exercise.
                                            ix



The second objective of the project was to empower communities to take charge of their
own development agenda. The indicators used to report on the achievement of this
objective were limited, namely, the number of local development plans that were
successfully implemented and the number and types of groups that were formed. The
second purpose of IEG’s survey was to learn more about group dynamics (functioning,
participation in decision-making, heterogeneity of decision-making etc.) and to assess
whether, through this vehicle, communities were empowered to take charge of their own
development agenda. The survey included questions adapted from the “Integrated
Questionnaire for the Measurement of Social Capital (SC-IQ)” from Measuring Social
Capital (Grootaert et al, 2004) and utilized measures derived from the “Search for
Empowerment: Social Capital as Idea and Practice at the World Bank” (Woolcock and
Narayan). The latter discusses ways that teams can quantify social capital for the purpose
of deriving measures that can be aggregated at the community level. It points to the now
commonly used measure of membership in informal and formal associations and
networks – including density and characteristics, group functioning, contributions to
groups, participation in decision-making, and heterogeneity of decision-making etc.

Beneficiary Selection. IEG’s data collection was conducted in 6 of the 12 participating
Fadama II states (four of the twelve states included in Fadama II were inaccessible due to
heightened security risks). Beneficiaries included in this assessment were identified
through their participation in a 2006 mid-line Beneficiary Assessment conducted by the
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) located in Washington DC. A
random stratified sampling method was applied to select 118 direct project beneficiaries –
representing 10 of the direct project beneficiaries that participated in the IFPRI
assessment- covering a total of 64 Fadama User Groups. IEG was careful to ensure that
project beneficiaries were randomly selected from the direct project beneficiary list that
was randomly selected by IFPRI. The random cohort of beneficiaries was then stratified
to ensure that regional, cultural, and religious differences and gender were taken into
account.

The IEG assessment was developed to gather beneficiary perceptions about group
participation, composition, inclusion, and roles in local decision-making, including
choice of and control over the use of the project awarded assets, paying attention to the
project’s inclusive aim of empowering marginalized and vulnerable persons. Recent
work by White & Philips (2012) on using small n data discusses how such methods can
draw on the implicit theory of change to assess whether theoretically predicted changes
occurred as expected, or whether the causes and assumptions set out in the theory of
change varied or whether the observed outcomes were a result, in part or whole, of
external factors.

IEG developed and conducted Semi-Structured Group Interviews with members of local
government in twelve local government areas (two per state), the inter-village level
Fadama Community Associations, members of the Fadama project infrastructure
(Fadama State Coordination offices, local desk officers, and village level project
facilitators) and with villages that had and had not directly participated in the project. The
purpose of the group interviews was to understand present day perceptions about local
development planning, the present status of the Fadama supported local development
plans, local needs and perceptions about financing for local development.

The project’s third objective was to reduce conflict. There were several challenges
associated with the way that conflict data was collected and reported in the project that
necessitated further field validation and inquiry. The most significant challenge relates to
terminology, and the different methods that were used to collect the data at baseline and
endline. Specifically, the recall data purportedly measures the number of actual conflicts
that occurred while the endline data aggregates the number of conflicts that were
reported in the Fadama project system. The project did not define the types or level of
conflict it was targeting and fails to provide a metric that can attribute the reduction of
conflict to the project interventions. IEG conducted interviews in six states and twelve
local government areas with the Fadama project staff that were responsible for
monitoring and reporting conflict. This included interviews with facilitators and desk
officers in each local government area visited to gather information on how conflict was
defined, understood, monitored, reported, and mitigated. IEG also conducted targeted
group interviews with pastoral communities who had participated in the project to
ascertain their perceptions about reported incidences of pastoral-farmer conflicts in the
project areas.

Assessment Limitations. The assessment did not attempt to determine actual beneficiary
incomes as a result of the project - owing to the lack of a baseline (recall data was utilized
to determine pre-project income levels) and weakly constructed proxy indicators during
the project cycle (See Chapter 3). This assessment was also not designed to conduct a
comparative analysis between beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups. This is in part due
to the fact that areas – not beneficiaries - were targeted in the Fadama programs
(beneficiaries “opted-in”) and that there were significant spillover effects observed by
IEG between areas and between phases. Also, Fadama III, launched in 2009, rolled out
the program nationally. A previous attempt by the project to establish a control group was
problematic because the Propensity Score Matching technique used by the evaluation did
not model the participation decision. Rather, the variables chosen for the matching were
likely to have affected the outcome.

Dissemination. Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR have been
shared with relevant Government officials and agencies for their review and comment.
Comments received are included in Annex E of the report.

Executive Summary
This is a Project Performance Assessment of the Second Fadama Development Project
implemented between 2004 and 2009. “Fadama” is a Hausa name for irrigable land--
usually low-lying plains that overlay shallow aquifers that straddle Nigeria's major river
systems. The second in a series of three consecutive rural development projects, Fadama
II represented a significant shift in the way the World Bank framed its approach to
service delivery and income generation in rural Nigeria. It was the first project to
introduce the concept of community driven development to Nigeria’s agriculture sector.

Fadama II had three separate but mutually reinforcing objectives to: Sustainably increase
the incomes of Fadama users -- those who depend directly or indirectly on Fadama
resources (farmers, pastoralists, fishers, hunters, gatherers, and service providers);
empower communities to take charge of their own development agenda; and reduce
conflict between Fadama users. This set of objectives was and remains highly relevant in
the Nigerian context. Individually and collectively, they reflect a sharp course-correction
from the project’s first phase that had trigged conflicts between resource users by
favoring one group over another. Moreover, the former supply led approach to
agricultural service delivery failed to take into account relative needs and farmer
capacity.

The project design – featuring a community driven development approach – was
substantially relevant. The project was designed to foster cooperation between resource
users, through a facilitated negotiation of local needs and a focus on conflict mitigation.
The demand-driven approach was designed to more effectively match rural service
delivery with identified core local needs. It was also designed to be socially inclusive.
The project design would have been more relevant had it been poverty-targeted. Design
also lacked an adequate diagnostic of the income constraints of the more marginalized
groups included in the project. While the project targeted several resource user groups in
its primary objective, implementation arrangements maintained a bias towards farming
and agricultural production. Conflict lacked a clear definition and a theory of attribution.
An emphasis on the reporting of conflict reduction, rather than on rewarding early-
identification, mitigation and resolution resulted in under-reporting by the project.

The project made substantial progress on achieving its first objective of sustainably
increasing the incomes of Fadama users. While data made available from an external
assessment lacks validity, IEG validated the project assumption that sustained assets
could generate additional income that could be saved and reinvested over time. By
revisiting 10 percent of all direct project beneficiaries interviewed by a 2006 external
assessment, IEG was able to validate that 64 percent of their private assets were
generating income, or had since yielded sufficient profits for repair or reinvestment.
Public infrastructure investments were less successful with only 50 percent still
functioning at the time of the IEG visit.

Efforts to empower communities to take charge of their own local development were less
successful and are therefore rated Modest, mainly due to the discontinuation of the
program activities after project close. Support made available to Fadama II villages was
                                           xiv


limited to one project cycle, though the project was scaled up in a subsequent phase. The
project was successful in supporting 95 percent of all community associations formed
under the project to implement their local development plans. But the empowerment
related indicators used by the project were inadequate to measure the project’s
empowerment effects. IEG validated the existence of local development plans in all
twenty-two villages it randomly selected for site visits. But none of these plans had been
updated since 2006 and all of them required additional finance. With few exceptions,
interviews with local government officials revealed that the participatory and negotiated
decision-making promoted by Fadama was not occurring there.

To better understand the contribution that the project may have had on empowering local
communities, IEG administered a survey adapted from the Integrated Questionnaire for
the Measurement of Social Capital (SC-IQ)” (Grootaert et al, 2004) to 118 randomly
selected beneficiaries in the six states selected for the evaluation. The survey revealed
that Fadama was perceived to yield additional welfare benefits and to have increased
savings, but benefits were enjoyed more by group leaders and active members than non-
active members, indicating significant elite-capture. Members with stronger inter-
personal networks had more voice in the choice and control over assets. Fadama
increased female participation in local economic development planning but evidence
suggests that women and other members of vulnerable and marginalized groups were
often not able to afford or obtain their needed assets.

Efforts to reduce conflict between Fadama user groups are rated Substantial. While IEG
cannot validate the pronounced reduction in conflict due to the different benchmarks,
definitions, and data collection methods used throughout the life of the project, IEG
found that there was substantial attention to resource related disputes that took place
within the confines of the project. Interviews revealed that traditionally competing groups
came together under the local develop plan to better understand and negotiate their
livelihood needs. The grievance redress mechanism implemented by the project induced
greater participation by lowering the cost of entry which resulted in the resolution of
several instances of reported conflict in Fadama areas. IEG notes with concern however
that by project close, there were an estimated 171 conflicts that had occurred in Fadama
areas that had not been resolved. Information on their severity or effects was not made
available to the IEG team.

The efficiency of the project is rated Modest owing to a lack of methodological rigor in
determining the estimated rates of returns at project end, inefficient targeting owing to
purposive selection of the states and local governments, and inefficient use of
monitoring, data collection and assessment systems to support implementation and the
design of subsequent project phases.

Bank and Borrower performance were generally satisfactory, with shortcomings. The
Bank built local ownership for the project, by conducting extensive stakeholder
consultations, engaging policy makers in extensive dialogue and carrying out project-
related studies. However a more elongated engagement and sensitization period was
needed at the village level to mitigate risks of elite capture and undue influence by
traditional authorities and village elites. Insufficient attention was paid to building
capacity for environmental management, which proved to be a challenge in this project.
                                           xv


Bank supervision supported external data collection and analysis early on in the project
cycle, but misrepresented these early results as end-line outcomes. A decision to scale up
the project nationally was based on results measured two years after the project became
effective.

Lessons

    Technical interventions that transform land related assets require a socially and
     culturally sensitive project design that -- to the extent possible -- provides
     inclusive development opportunities to all affected parties. The Fadama program
     is illustrative of the risks that are attendant in neglecting social analysis in
     technical work streams. The project’s first phase contributed to conflict between
     natural resource users groups by financing activities that expanded livelihood
     benefits to one user group at the expense of others.

    Community based approaches to local development require sustained and
     phased commitment. None of the Fadama villages visited by IEG demonstrated a
     present day capacity to participate in local development planning in a socially
     inclusive and accountable manner, in despite of the project’s efforts to instill this.
     Fadama II villages were only supported by one project cycle. Villagers
     interviewed for this review expressed a significant level of disappointment about
     the lack of continued access to facilitated negotiation for the provisions of local
     goods and services. The conflict training and mediation module piloted by the
     project was appreciated by stakeholders but ultimately found to be unsustainable
     in the absence of the project architecture. Maintenance of public infrastructure
     has also expectedly emerged as a key challenge.

    The sustainability of community-based initiatives depends crucially on an
     enabling institutional environment, which requires government commitment,
     and on accountability of leaders to their community to avoid “supply-driven
     demand-driven” development (Mansuri and Rao, 2004). This overarching lesson
     on community driven development put forth by the World Bank’s Development
     Economics Groups is very applicable to the Nigerian context.

    Programs designed to change behavior need to be grounded in a deep
     understanding of context; they need to be willing to engage in a study of what
     motivates people. Programs implemented at scale should include a sensitive
     design that takes into account the different cultural, linguistic and ethnic
     characteristics of the targeted population. Programs designed to change behavior
     also require observational and qualitative indicators, that in turn, require capacity
     building and implementation support to tweak project assumptions and project
     adjust design in real time.

1. Background and Context
1.1     The Second National Fadama Development project was prepared towards the end
of the ill-famed Abacha regime, characterized by disastrous economic and social policies
that severely weakened the credibility of the state. Under the regime, the World Bank had
progressively disengaged from the country, with no new lending and very little analytical
undertakings. With the return of democracy, under the Obasanjo administration, the Bank
undertook a major effort to identify and approve new investment loans to support the
development of key sectors. IEG’s Country Evaluation of the World Bank program in
Nigeria (1998-2007) found that this effort was hamstringed by the Bank’s multi-year
absence that resulted in a lack of knowledge about the country and its societal dynamics.
Nigerian government officials, for their part, were unfamiliar with Bank procedures.
While the Bank undertook analytic work in the fiduciary areas, operations in some
sectors, including rural development, moved ahead without the necessary analytical
underpinnings.

1.2      The Second National Fadama Development Project was one of the earliest
projects prepared by the Bank after its reengagement in Nigeria. The project’s
preparation and design was heavily influenced by country and corporate risks facing the
Bank at the time. A community driven development approach was seen as a useful
vehicle to overcome some of the fiduciary risks that were plaguing the portfolio --
including mis-procurement issues that had had led to a moratorium on new sector lending
at that time. It was also seen as a useful vehicle to reduce conflict-related risks that had
emerged as a result of the former project model. Fadama II was classified as a corporate
risk project due to farmer-pastoralist conflicts that had occurred as a result of an ill-
conceived design under Fadama I. 1

1.3     At the Federal level, the concept of community driven development was being
promoted by the Government as a means to empower states, local governments, and
communities to achieve poverty reduction. During the first year of its administration, the
newly elected Government established a national Poverty Alleviation Council and placed
the responsibility for coordinating antipoverty efforts with the National Planning
Commission. Poverty reduction initiatives were to be demand driven, with community
participation and decentralized decision making. They would be implemented directly by
communities. This represented a major shift of strategy from the past top-down approach,
which had been characterized by poor targeting, poor design, inefficient and incomplete
implementation, and increasing popular frustration.

1.4    At the time of project design, an estimated 52 percent of all Nigerians were living
below the poverty line, including 80 percent of the rural population. For rural Nigeria, it
was clear that a new pro-poor service delivery model was needed. But according to the
most recent poverty survey conducted by the Nigerian statistics agency, published in
2012, the total number of persons living in poverty in Nigeria has risen to 61 percent,

1
  Farmer-pastoral conflicts occurred under Fadama I because the project failed to mitigate the risks associated with its
support for expanded farming systems, in areas which were also being used for pastoral grazing. Land related conflicts
were especially pronounced in Bauchi, Gombe, Jigawa, and Imo States where there was a significant loss of life and
destruction of property.
                                             2


with no significant change in the rural areas, especially in the north. This is in despite of
an average growth rate of roughly 7 percent between 2005 and 2013. One of the main
reasons why poverty and inequality has increased in Nigeria over this period is that
growth has been concentrated in sectors that are less labor-intensive, such as oil,
telecommunications, and banking. Agriculture, the biggest employer in the economy, has
been largely ignored by the government, until recently. During the project period, for
example, the federal government’s agricultural expenditure as a share of the total budget
declined from 2.2% in 2001 to 1.7% in 2005 (Mogues et al. 2008). The second phase of
Fadama was designed to address this neglect in the sector by investing in the productive
capacity of local communities, mainly at the farm level. But with a funding level of
U$100 million and thousands of small scale activities planned across twelve of Nigeria’s
states, the task promised to be formidable.



2. Objectives, Design and their Relevance
RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.1     As articulated in the legal agreement, Fadama II has three separate but mutually
reinforcing objectives:

       (1) Sustainably increase the incomes of Fadama users -- those who depend
           directly or indirectly on Fadama resources (farmers, pastoralists, fishers,
           hunters, gatherers, and service providers);

       (2) Empower communities to take charge of their own development agenda;

       (3) Reducing conflict between Fadama users.

2.2     The relevance of each of these objectives is rated High. The objectives reflect a
high degree of learning about what works and what does not work in achieving
sustainable development in rural Nigeria. Individually and collectively, these objectives
represent a sharp course-correction based on learning from the first phase whose
relevance and efficacy were challenged by a socially insensitive supply-led service
delivery model. The prior project had supported an expansion of farming systems into
valuable wetland areas that have traditionally been used by other groups for grazing,
watering, transit etc. It prioritized one user group over others which had the unattended
effect of triggering resource related conflicts. Moreover, the supply led approach was
insensitive to farmers’ ability to adopt or afford the maintenance of the technology.

2.3    By empowering community members to take charge of their own development
agenda, the project sought to enhance the utility of rural services and goods that were
being provided, by taking stock of critical needs at the village level while assuring that
the needs of the most marginalized were also considered. In Nigeria, assets such as seeds
and fertilizers have been highly subsidized and distributed as political patronage. The
project sought to challenge the sense of entitlement that had resultantly emerged by
                                                        3


offering communities a chance to choose inputs that were most needed and to experience
a sense of ownership vis-à-vis the investment required.

2.4     The third objective directly corrects for the resource related conflicts that were
triggered under Fadama I. At appraisal, the Fadama project estimated that roughly 1,262
resource related conflicts had occurred in Fadama areas during the implementation of the
first phase. These conflicts reportedly resulted in some 2,058 deaths and 4,750 injuries, as
well as significant crop and livestock loss in especially in Oyo, Adawama, Ogun, Imo,
Lagos, Bauchi, and Gombe States. Farmer-Pastoral conflicts in Nigeria were so severe in
2013 that they were classified as war by the Heidelberg Conflict Barometer (against a
five point scale that ranks conflict in escalating order: disputes, non-violent crises,
violent crises, limited wars and wars.

2.5     Taken altogether, the objective encapsulates components of a community driven
development model of capacity building and service delivery - the first of its kind in the
rural development sector in Nigeria. It was highly in line with the development vision of
the time, as reflected in the Interim Strategy Note developed during the transition period.

         “[This] CDD approach is consonant with what the Nigerian people want and is
         reflected in the Government's poverty program. CDD involves strengthening and
         financing accountable and inclusive community-based organizations that
         represent the interests of the poor, and forging functional links between
         community based organizations and local governments…this will mean building
         the capacity of both the communities and local governments and policy and
         institutional reform that allows communities and local government more control
         of development activities in their areas” (ISN, 2001).

2.6     The objective could have been strengthened by including select local government
areas as one of the many stakeholders that were targeted by the project, especially
considering the role that it is expected to play in providing and maintaining local public
works and services. Underlying the objective is an assumption that rural incomes can be
increased and sustained through a local development planning process that is inclusive,
accountable and considerate of competing resource needs. In order for incomes to be
sustained, the process has to be maintained. This will require the buy-in and support of
local government. 2

2.7     The World Bank’s FY06-FY09 Country Partnership Strategy also recognizes the
importance of engaging at a decentralized level but focuses heavily on a few “lead”
states. The 2nd Country Partnership Strategy – implemented between FY10-FY13 -
placed a premium on governance, with a focus on transparency and accountability in the
use of public resources, including the participation of communities in decision making
and oversight. Building on the CDD approach, the CPS committed to increase civil
society and community monitoring and evaluation, planning and budgeting at sector and

2
  Nigeria's constitution requires a transfer of 44% of its federal account resources to its 36 states and 774 local
government authorities to fund local service delivery.
                                            4


local levels. Referring to the perceived success of the CDD approach to date, the CPS
recommended moving to a larger scale [CDD] operation that would include more
communities and that would integrate both the Local and State Government in the
process. The integration of State and Local government was viewed as means to achieve
sustainability and maintenance of the social infrastructure. The objective of Fadama’s
third phase, approved in 2008, retained its focus on the Fadama user, but its design also
included capacity development for local governments.

PROJECT FINANCING, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

FINANCING

2.8     The total planned project costs were US$125 million including US$ 100 million
of IDA finance, a Government contribution of US$16 million and projected community
contributions of US$ 9 million. Actual project costs were roughly equivalent to estimated
costs, with the exception of community contributions which were notably lower than
anticipated. The lower than anticipated contributions are linked to the changes made
during implementation to the contribution ratios for productive assets. Actual project
costs were US$124.5 million. This PPAR was only able to identify and validate the
following expenditures: US$103 million from IDA, US$15 million from the Government,
and US$4 million in community contributions, or a total or a total of US$122 million.

DESIGN

2.9      The project concept was based on a community driven development approach. It
first set out to mobilize some 480 facilitators who engaged in social mobilization, group
formation, sensitization, and training on inclusive decision-making and participatory
local development planning. Community groups – or Fadama user groups - were formed
on the basis of economic interests, taking care to mobilize traditionally marginalized
groups, per the project’s operating procedures. Once formed, and once group leaders
were elected, the groups collectively organized into Fadama Community Associations
(FCA) where facilitators would oversee a process of collective bargaining organized
around the development of a Local Development Plan. Overseen by an elected
Association Chair, the FCA was responsible for overseeing the drafting of an inclusive
development plan that allocated sub-project financing across three main investment
categories: (1) Capacity Building, (2) Rural Infrastructure; (3) Private Productive assets.
Individual groups were required to open a bank account to track funds and to enable a
mechanism for the required group contribution towards the public or private assets.

2.10 Group contributions towards the purchase or construction of the assets varied
depending on whether they were public or private and the nature of the asset.
Contributions were not configured based on a pre-determined income level. Rural
infrastructure projects were either public (access roads, culverts, bridges) or club goods
(boreholes and pumping machines, cooling sheds, market infrastructure) that were
approved at or across the FCA level. For rural infrastructure assets, the project provided
90 percent of the finance while the Association was expected to contribute 10 percent.
This was paid either in cash or in-kind (labor) depending on the project arrangement. The
pilot productive assets were mainly private, distributed either individually to group
                                            5


members or as a shared group asset. Typical private goods provided included irrigation
pumps, processing equipment, fishing equipment, honey extraction equipment and
smaller items such as knapsack sprayers, watering cans, wheelbarrows, storage bins,
workbulls and ridgers. The financing ratio for this category of asset changed three times
during the life of the project, from 50:50, to 60 (project):40 (group contribution); to 70
(project):30 (group contribution). The project empowered the FCA with an oversight
function: the FCA would disburse matching project financing to groups once the requisite
contribution was made to the group’s bank account.

2.11 The participatory and inclusive planning process promoted by the project was
intended to facilitate a residual demand for continued participation, accountability and
oversight in local development planning. Oversight of the Fadama Community
Associations was provided by state and local Fadama Development groups, constituted
under the project. At the local level, Local Fadama Desk Officers and Local Fadama
Development Committees were established by the project. The Local Fadama Desk
Officers provided clearing house functions for the Local Development Plans, screening
the plans to make sure that they were compliant with the project’s funding criteria Local
Fadama Development Committees -- chaired and co-chaired by a high ranking member
of local government and a traditional or community leader – reviewed and approved the
plans. Government representation in the Local Fadama Development Committees was
limited to one-third of the committee's total membership in order to ensure a majority
representation of the FCAs, civil society and the private sector.

2.12 At the State level, the state Agricultural Development Program (ADP)
coordinated activities on behalf of the State Agricultural and Natural Resources Ministry.
The state structure included State Fadama Development Offices that resided in the state
Agricultural Development Programs. The State Project Coordinator reported directly to
the Program Manager of the ADP and every six months to a State Fadama Development
Committee (SFDC). SFDCs, chaired by the Permanent Secretaries of the State Ministries
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, provided oversight of the project, including
approval of work plans and budgets, and bi-annual progress reporting to a National
Fadama Coordinating Office.           The SFDC was responsible for executing a
communications strategy, recruiting and organizing training of facilitators, organizing
training of all relevant stakeholders, tracking results, and transmitting these to the
National Fadama office with whom the Bank liaised.

2.13 At the national level, a National Fadama Technical Committee, chaired by the
Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources,
provided technical input and coordination with other relevant programs. It was in charge
of reviewing project progress, approving work plans and budgets. A National Fadama
Development Office was organized as a Program Secretariat for the Committee and was
responsible for day-to-day federal level coordination.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.14 The community driven development approach was and remains substantially
relevant in the rural Nigerian context. The project was designed to foster cooperation
between resource users, through a facilitated negotiation of local needs and a focus on
conflict mitigation. The demand-driven approach was designed to more effectively match
rural service delivery with identified core local needs. It was also designed to be socially
inclusive. The local development plan was a relevant tool to compel competing resource
users to make choices that could, on the one hand, best serve individual needs, while on
the other hand, reject options that too coarsely
abridged the needs of others’.                         Box 1. Fadama II Constituencies % /Total

2.16 The         project’s     social    guidelines, Source : Fadama II MTR 2007
incorporated in the project’s operating manual,
encouraged the formation of marginalized groups (youth, widows, physically challenged,
people living with HIV/AIDS etc.) as a way to ensure that the voices of groups
traditionally marginalized by gender, age, and class were fully heard and that their
interests were reflected in local development planning. While the project design
facilitated the participation of these groups, and successfully integrated their needs into
the local development plan, only 7% of these participants were able to afford the goods
and services requested through the plan (MTR, April 2007).

2.17 Second, while various stakeholders were targeted by the objective, the appraisal
only provides an analysis of income constraints for one user group– the farmer groups –
and the project’s implementation arrangements maintain a bias towards crop production
(the project was hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development). The
constraints to increased incomes in the rural space are listed as mainly inadequate rural
                                            7


infrastructure, weak links between agricultural research, extension, and service providers,
scarce or non-existent access to rural finance, a lack of clear property rights, and
continued reliance on rudimentary agricultural production techniques. Equivalent
diagnostics (analysis of constraints, growth trajectories) were not conducted for the other
resource user groups (non-sedentary pastoralists, fishing communities and other non-
farming activities). Conflict was viewed as a constraint to increased agricultural
investment.

2.18 Third, the idea and definition(s) of the kinds of conflict that could be dampened
by attention to resource competition between Fadama user groups was under-diagnosed,
ill-defined, and inadequately monitored. Activities designed to reduce conflict were
conceived mainly as support for pastoral infrastructure (improved and demarcated
stocking routes and grazing areas etc.) and they were offered against a menu of other
critically needed rural infrastructure choices, such as access to water. Recognizing the
value of achieving a peace dividend in conflict-prone areas, the project could have
offered separate and additional conflict-oriented options underpinned by positive social
and economic incentives. Rather, conflict related activities were bundled with the Rural
Infrastructure Menu and the financial contribution was the same. Further, some of the
rural infrastructure that was developed for pastoral communities (especially increased
access to water) had the unintended impact of attracting new and additional herders who
were not aware of the stock route markers and who lacked built relationships with area
farmers.

2.19 Given that ultimately the agricultural sector strategy seeks to significantly expand
the amount of rural land in Nigeria under irrigation, these activities may have been able
to delay, but not address the drivers of conflict in the Fadama areas. The project was not
able to sponsor or maintain a dialogue with non-sedentary pastoralists, although an initial
attempt was made to engage the Miette Allah of Nigeria at the beginning of the project
cycle. Rather, the project engaged sedentary agro-pastoralists, many of whom have been
settled in the Fadama areas for more than two decades, but mis-represented the identity of
these groups in project documentation. To sustainably reduce conflict in the Fadama
areas, project design could have focused on building in a shared understanding and
analysis of local patterns and critical conditions of land governance and its effects while
addressing some of the structural conditions and socio-political dynamics affecting the
risks of violence in the contested areas. Further risk analysis and mitigation could have
been developed to cope with the effects of transforming existing assets.

DESIGN OF THE MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM

2.20 This section reviews the relevance of design of the project’s Management
Information System and the project’s Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and tools.

2.21 The Second Phase of Fadama, Fadama II, created a new framework and new
instruments for measuring results. The project shifted implementation modalities, so the
shift in data collection methods, monitoring and reporting is appropriate. However, since
nine of the twelve states treated under Fadama I were included in Fadama II, it would
have been useful at appraisal to include information about the farmer organizations that
had been treated under the first phase. The project commissioned a Participatory Rural
Appraisal with the aim of establishing a welfare related baseline, however the data was
neither used as a baseline for the project M&E nor was it used by the mid-line assessment
to track results. The approach was appropriate for the project context. It developed proxy
rural welfare indicators and used these to determine the presence of vulnerable and
marginalized groups in the communities. However the process was not embedded in the
monitoring and reporting systems. It also utilized welfare proxies, where the project
objective directly calls for the measurement of income which in itself was overly
ambitious.

2.22 A Management Information System was put in place, but the system was not fully
operational until mid-term. The system monitored a number of outputs, but fell short of
including indicators that in the aggregate could measure the outcomes envisioned by the
project. The system was not designed, for example, to collect disaggregated data by user
group. Nor was it designed to measure change in income levels. Measurement of
                                            9


empowerment was limited to outputs, namely (1) the number of groups that were formed
and (2) the number of development plans that were implemented. The project did not
include qualitative indicators -- that would have required observation – to measure
participation, inclusion, and representation. More sophisticated questions about the
success of the project were left for the external assessment, however without a baseline,
and with no firm plans for an end-line – it is not clear how the external assessment would
have measured change.

2.23 Conflict lacked a clear definition and an explanation of how it would be linked, or
attributed, to project interventions. There is a mismatch between the project aim of
reducing conflict and project language that sought to lower the number of “reported”
conflicts. The reporting of low-level conflict would have been desirable in order to
dampen its effects. However the system was designed to encourage a declination in the
number of “reported conflicts.” This may have had the unintended effect of allowing low-
intensity disputes to escalate in the absence of effective mitigation prompted by timely
reporting. Project targets associated with the conflict reduction objective also appear
somewhat non-sensible. The project set out to reduce Fadama related conflicts by 50
percent of the baseline value of conflicts that were reported to have been triggered by
Fadama I. But fully meeting this target would allow for a remaining 571 conflicts to
occur during the project period in targeted Fadama areas.



3. Achievement of the Objectives (Efficacy)
OBJECTIVE I: SUSTAINABLY INCREASE THE INCOMES OF FADAMA USERS

3.1     Fadama II aimed to sustainably increase the incomes of Fadama users -- those
who depend directly or indirectly on Fadama resources (farmers, pastoralists, fishers,
hunters, gatherers, and service providers). The project set a quantitative target of
increasing the average real incomes of 50 percent of the targeted project beneficiaries by
twenty percent, but it did not establish a baseline. The project commissioned an external
assessment in 2006, one year after the project began implementation. Using recall data,
the external assessment reported that Fadama II had increased the average real income of
50 percent of the beneficiaries by 63 percent, compared to a 16 percent real income
increase within an identified control group. The implementation completion report
indicates that by project close, Fadama II had increased the average real income of 50
percent of project beneficiaries by 63 percent, however an endline study was not
conducted. None of the results reported included a desegregation of the income effects
across user groups, including the effects on the marginalized and vulnerable. Nor did the
project measure sustainability, a core component of the objective.

3.2     IEG was not able to validate either reported result due to weaknesses in the
construct of the impact assessment and due to the absence of evidence associated with the
results reported in the completion report. A brief summary of the instruments’ limitations
is provided below:
                                                           10


                 The 2006 Impact Assessment demonstrated very weak construct validity,
           since the questions that were asked in the household survey were mainly
           tautological. The assessment did not measure change in income; it measured the
           change in value of the productive assets at the household level, before and after
           the launch of Fadama II. The assessment was conducted just one year after the
           household assets had been distributed. It could be assumed that, in the short run,
           households that receive an additional productive asset would report an increase
           in income, if income is measured against a net change in assets. The IFPRI
           household survey established its baseline by asking participants to recall their
           household composition and size, major productive assets, and major components
           of household income. It then counted assets - or the change in major productive
           assets - as the outcome variable even though the household asset was the
           explanatory variable, or the input of the project. The construct of the treated
           versus control groups was also problematic because the Propensity Score
           Matching technique used by the evaluation did not model the participation
           decision. Rather, the variables chosen for the matching were likely to have
           affected the outcomes. 3

       The National ICR is candid about the fact that by 2009, “most of the State
        Fadama Development Offices [had] not conducted the impact evaluation study at
        the end of the project life…and the few States such as Ogun, Oyo, Bauchi,
        Kaduna, Taraba that started the study have not concluded for the results to be
        available” (National ICR p.52). The National Implementation Completion
        Report uses the mid-line data, in most cases, to report results. The World Bank’s
        Implementation Completion Report then inexplicably reports this data as
        progress made at end-line. IEG reviewed all participating State Implementation
        Completion reports and the National Implementation Completion report and
        found no evidentiary basis for the end-line results reported. 4

IEG’s Asset Verification and Sustainability Exercise

3.3     Assumptions about the project’s income effects are linked to the reported benefits
that have been derived from the public and private assets that were distributed by Fadama



3
  The internal validity of the evaluation was also challenged by the fact that nine of the twelve Fadama II states had
also participated in the first phase. Fadama II did not give special preference to or bias against Fadama I beneficiaries.
However, former Fadama I beneficiaries might have derived an advantage because of their membership in Fadama
User Associations supported under the prior project. This could have introduced some selection bias in sampling
Fadama II beneficiaries in the sense that fadama user association members would have been more likely to join Fadama
II beneficiaries and thus more likely to be sampled. The double-difference estimator that was used in the impact
evaluation helps to address the impacts of such differences in initial conditions by differencing out any additive fixed
effects of such differences but does not completely solve the potential problem of selection bias because the impacts of
Fadama II may interact with participation in Fadama I.

4
  The National ICR includes a table on income impacts for all states treated that compares mid-line achievement to
baseline, and end-line to mid-line. As discussed in the design section of this review, the mid-line assessment discarded
the base-line assessment owing to the quality of the data collected. Baseline data was collected in the form of a
participatory rural assessment; it did not collect income related data. Regarding end-line data, the table indicates that
the data is sourced from the 2006 assessment.
                                                        11


II. 5 Since the project objective explicitly aims to sustainably raise incomes, the IEG
post-project assessment offers a unique opportunity to learn about the sustainability of the
assets that underlie the reported increase in incomes in Fadama II villages. Since the
income effects were assessed against a randomly selected sample of project beneficiaries
in 2006, IEG revisited 10% of these beneficiaries to assess whether the effects that were
reported were still being enjoyed by this subset.

3.4     IEG administered a one-on-one survey to a random stratified sample of 118
persons representing 10 percent of the direct project beneficiaries that had participated in
the 2006 assessment. The random cohort was stratified to ensure that regional, cultural,
and religious and gender differences were taken into account. Within this cohort, IEG
collected data on 163 pilot acquisition assets and 20 shared rural infrastructure projects
(including site visits to 60 of these private assets and all 20 rural investments). Through
the survey and the site-level asset verification exercise, IEG collected data on the choice,
control, use and status of the assets.

3.5      Sustainability of the Private and Public Assets. Of the 163 pilot acquisition assets
reported to have been received, information concerning their status was available for 149
assets. 6 Of these, 64 percent were reported to be either (1) presently operational or (2)
presently in disrepair, bur useful in having generated enough savings or a profits to
replace the asset or purchase additional ones. Site-visits to 49 privately owned assets
validated this reported finding. Of the 49 private assets visited, 60 percent were either (1)
presently operational, including repair or (2) had been replaced through profits and
savings generated by the asset(s). Rural Infrastructure was less sustainable. IEG visited
twenty rural infrastructure projects and found 50 percent of these to be operational at the
time of the visit in November 2013. Of all the public assets visited, boreholes were the
least functioning (40% were operational), followed by rural roads (50%). All of the
culverts visited, on the other hand, had been maintained.

3.6    Several preliminary lessons emerged from the asset verification exercise that
could be explored further for future project planning purposes. These lessons include:

     The Fadama model was more effective in Rural Areas than Urban and Peri-
      Urban areas. Of the thirty randomly selected beneficiaries that reside in peri-
      urban or urban areas (FCT and Lagos), only six or 20% of the urban beneficiaries
      had access to functioning assets. In rural areas, the percentage of beneficiaries that
      had access to functioning assets was 71% (or 60 out of 84 beneficiaries). This
      finding coincides with the empowerment literature that generally finds that social
      cohesion is an integral ingredient to successful social capital formation and
      associated welfare gains. In FCT, interviews with beneficiaries and Fadama staff

5
  According to the ICR, the project supplied some 73,599 pieces of equipment through 7,766 subprojects, and that by
project close, more than 90 per cent of the productive assets micro-projects/subprojects had been implemented.

6
  These assets included processing machines (gari/ground nut, etc.), work bulls/ridgers, irrigation pumps, milling
machines, wheelbarrows, knapsack sprayers, seeds/fertilizer, storage bins, refrigerators, market stalls, animal pens,
beehives, grinders, graters, hydraulic jacks, fish ponds, and water storage containers.
                                            12


       revealed that the requisite community contributions had been paid for by one of
       the State Ministers. FCT Fadama staff suggested that this act may have decreased
       the level of ownership of the assets and responsibility for their maintenance. The
       price and value of land also significantly affected the success of the productive
       assets. Land rental prices are higher in urban and peri-urban areas and Fadama
       beneficiaries pointed to the fact that this differential was not taken into account in
       project design.

    Interventions that require behavioral change require a different assistance
     strategy than technical interventions designed to support existing practices.
     This was found to be especially the case for fish farming projects, where the
     project sought to increase productivity by introducing caged fish. While the
     project introduced new technology, it was introduced in a vacuum without taking
     into account existing cultural practices and norms in the fishing communities.
     There was also a lack of technical assistance provided for these projects and their
     operations and maintenance costs were especially high.

    Capital intensive equipment, such as cassava grinding machines were removed
     from operation due to complaints about noise and air pollution. In many of the
     unsuccessful cassava milling operations visited, machines had been removed or
     not maintained owing to complaints about the diesel exhaust. Other concerns were
     linked to cassava mill effluent effects on the soil.

    The heavy subsidy provided for rural infrastructure may be one of many factors
     explaining their lack of upkeep. This lesson is in line with the IFPRI Impact
     Assessment that found that while the subsidies had produced positive near term
     impacts on beneficiaries’ access to markets and transportation costs, the high level
     of subsidy offered to communities for rural infrastructure (10% community: 90%
     project subsidy) may have induced construction of public goods that could not in
     the medium to long run afford to be maintained.

3.7     Based on the additional evidence collected as part of this assessment, progress
made against the first objective of sustainably increasing the incomes of Fadama users is
rated Substantial.

OBJECTIVE II: EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR LOCAL
DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

3.8      The project’s second objective was to “empower communities to take charge of
their own development agenda.” A single indicator was used to measure and report on the
project’s empowerment objective: the number of local development plans that were
successfully implemented. The indicator was used as a proxy for measuring the
empowerment process, since participatory and inclusive criteria were established for the
formulation and financing of the plans. A target was set at 60 percent. The project
reported that an average of 94.5 % of all Fadama Community Associations had implemented
their local development plans and that more than 90 percent of the investments awarded
were completed by project close.
                                                         13


3.9     IEG utilized several evaluation tools to validate the achievement and assess the
sustainability of this objective. IEG convened village level meetings in twenty-two local
government areas to ascertain the status of the local development plan and to inquire as to
whether the plan had been updated. IEG was able to validate the existence of a local
development plan in each of the village settings it visited while learning that none of the
plans had been updated and that none of the villages had engaged in a Fadama style
participatory planning process after project close. 7 In all cases, villagers cited a lack of
finance and the absence of the Fadama style facilitation to explain the current lack of
participation in the Fadama style process. 8

3.10 IEG also conducted one-on-one interviews with representatives of the twelve
local government areas. With one exception (in Niger State), none of the local
governments visited were currently aware of or using the local development plans that
had been developed under Fadama II. 9 While the local representatives have changed
since the project was implemented, there was no evidence that the project had had an
effect on the way that development decisions were being made at the local level. In some
of the local government areas visited, there was an awareness of the operations and
maintenance needs of the infrastructure built under Fadama but there were ongoing
discussion about who would pay for its upkeep.

Social Capital-IQ

3.11 The project also tracked the number and types of groups constituted under the
program, but did not report on group dynamics. In the “Search for Empowerment: Social
Capital as Idea and Practice at the World Bank” authors Woolcock and Narayan
reviewed and reported on several ways to quantify social capital for the purpose of
deriving measures that can be aggregated at the community level. The review points to
the now commonly used measure of membership in informal and formal associations and
networks – including density and characteristics, group functioning, contributions to
groups, participation in decision-making, and heterogeneity of decision-making.
Qualitative information derived from the World Bank’s Social Development’s
Department Local Level Institutions study conducted in Indonesia, Bolivia, and Burkina
Faso has also helped to link these social capitol indicators to household welfare.

7
  Village level meetings consisted of members of the a representative of the State Agricultural Department, State
Fadama coordinating office staff, Fadama Community Association chairs and members, Local Fadama Desk Officers,
local Fadama facilitators, members of the Fadama user groups, and non-Fadama village residents.
8
  This assessment was designed to understand the present day effects of the Fadama II program on a randomly selected
cohort of 10 percent of the beneficiaries included in the 2006 IFPRI assessment. Interviews with the FCAs visited
indicated that all of the Local Development Plans validated by IEG were prepared between 2004-2006. In all FCAs
visited, there was no evidence that a new Local Development Plan had been prepared, and all beneficiaries indicated a
desire to update their plan and to receive further financing. They also indicated the need for further support by
“fadama-like” facilitation services which were no longer being formally provided. This is a testament to the perceived
benefits of the program as well as to the challenges of changing the beneficiary schemes in-between fadama phases.
According to Management comments, Fadama II villages that also received support under the third phase have
continued to engage in participatory local development processes. However, IEG did not assess present day effects of
the 3rd Phase, since this was ongoing at the time of the assessment.
9
 Management comments reinforced this finding, noting that the Niger state government is currently implementing a
performance-based CDD type rural-service delivery model at the Ward Level and that synergies have been created (the
Niger State Fadama Coordinator is also in charge of the state’s rural development program).
                                           14


3.12 IEG administered an adapted version of the “Integrated Questionnaire for the
Measurement of Social Capital (SC-IQ)” from Measuring Social Capital (Grootaert et al,
2004) to 10%, or 118 of the direct project beneficiaries that participated in the 2006
assessment. The questionnaire was developed to gather beneficiary perceptions about
group participation, composition, inclusion, and roles in local decision-making, including
choice of and control over the use of the project awarded assets, paying attention to the
project’s inclusive aim of empowering marginalized and vulnerable persons (see Annex
C).

3.13 Because group formation for social welfare purposes, and in more affluent cases,
for economic purposes is a commonly adopted risk-mitigation and wealth creation tool in
rural Nigeria, the IEG assessment sought to compare the dynamics and effects of the
Fadama group formation to other pre-existing groups and to assess whether Fadama had
influenced the manner by which groups were formed and functioned after project close.
The assessment found that:

    Group Participation in Fadama II yielded individual welfare benefits, increased
     access to savings, and similar to non-Fadama Groups, acted as a buffer in times
     of emergency (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows that almost 90 percent of all
     respondents reported that membership in a Fadama User Group had improved
     their household, livelihood or had provided greater access to basic services, as
     compared to just under 50 percent for Non-Fadama User Groups. Female
     respondents (55%) were more likely to respond that their FUG provided access to
     savings compared to male respondents (44%).

          But Fadama benefits seem to have been enjoyed more by group leaders and active
           members indicating a certain degree of elite capture in the program (Figure 4).

3.14 The IEG assessment asked all 118 beneficiaries about their role in choosing and
controlling the assets obtained under Fadama II and categorized the responses on the
basis of their membership in the groups. The assumption was that all members of the
groups – whether relatively better-off or very poor – would have had a representative
voice in the decision-making process and that assets would be controlled either by the
group (in the case of group assets) or by the individual (in the case of individual assets).
                                                                                              16


The surveys were administered individually and to the best extent possible, away from
other group members. The survey reveals that:

       Fadama members with stronger inter-personal networks appear to have had more
        voice in the choice of assets and greater control over their use.

3.15 As shown in Figure 5 and 6, perceptions about who chose and controls Fadama
assets varies on the basis of status in the group. Group leaders (Chair, Treasurer, or
Secretary) predominantly recalled that the group had chosen the asset, active members
recalled the choice being made by the group as well as individuals, while non-active
members also recalled that the group leader had chosen the asset. 10 Group leaders and
active members also appear more in control of the use of assets than inactive group
members.

   Although the IEG beneficiary survey was randomized, it was randomized on the basis of an earlier randomization
run by the IFPRI impact evaluation. IEG found that elites, as identified by their leadership functions in the groups, had
been oversampled by the impact evaluation, and this had some effect on the results reported by the IEG assessment.
Since elites and active group members were oversampled, it may be expected that the results of IEG’s survey are
somewhat overestimated.

Social Inclusion: Women and Vulnerable Groups

3.16 The Local Development Planning Modules encouraged and achieved
representation of women’s groups (43% of all groups) and vulnerable persons (widows)
in the Fadama Community Associations. IEG was
only able to administer the adapted social capital
survey to a small subset of women beneficiaries,
however these beneficiaries were randomly chosen
and stratified across the states. Interviews with
women’s groups revealed:

3.17 Fadama increased female inclusion in
local economic development planning. Of the
thirty-six women beneficiaries randomly selected for
the IEG assessment, 81% reported that they had not
been represented in an economic group prior to
Fadama II. At the time of the assessment – five years
after project close – 94% of these women reported
belonging to the same group and 31% of these
women beneficiaries belonged to a second economic
interest group.

3.18 Fadama was less Cost-Prohibitive on average compared to other non-
Fadama Groups, as measured by Price of Entry and Dues Assigned. The average
entry fee, or registration fee for Fadama User Groups was roughly ½ the average
registration price of other economic interest groups. The average registration fee for a
Fadama User Group was reported as 620 Naira versus 1,081 Naira for other groups.
Monthly dues were also higher for non-Fadama Groups, with members paying an average
of 249 Naira compared with 145 for the Fadama Groups. Non-Fadama groups were also
more erratic in their pricing, with membership fees ranging from zero to 30,000 Naira.
Fadama Group registration ranged from Zero to 5,000N. Women also reported that, on
average, their Fadama group fees were roughly a half the amount paid by men.

3.19 However, while there was a high rate of female participation in Fadama II,
more information is needed to understand how women are actually benefitting from
the assets they acquired. The project’s mid-term review found that many women and
vulnerable persons found it difficult to contribute the requisite contribution needed for the
asset acquisition. The review also found that in many cases, the equipment that was
acquired by women was being operated by hired hands who benefited more from the
assets than the beneficiaries. The mid-term review recommended lowering the
beneficiary contribution for women and vulnerable groups to 10 percent, however this
recommendation was not taken up by the current phase.

3.20 Recent research undertaken during Fadama III on Women’s Empowerment
suggests that while there are limitations to women’s participation and access to goods and
services under the Fadama model – owing to the role that interpersonal networks play in
accessing the project’s goods and services – women with less access benefit from
exposure to their more powerful peers in the Fadama groups formed (Box 2).

 Box 2. Unpacking Women's Empowerment in the Fadama Program
 Recent analysis undertaken on the participation and performance of female farmers groups in the Fadama
 program provides a sophisticated assessment of the project’s contribution to women’s empowerment in
 rural Nigeria. While pointing to the many important contributions that women make to the production,
 processing, and marketing of agricultural commodities in Nigeria, the authors point to the many
 constraints that women face in trying to make a living from the sector, namely the lack of land ownership
 and access rights, credit, labor, inputs and extension services. Membership in the Fadama User Groups
 provides women with an opportunity to overcome some of these constraints, but only a few women,
 relatively, are offered the chance to participate since group access is highly correlated with interpersonal
 networks and the support of men. Men have helped women gain access to the project because of the high
 level of interdependency between men (farming) and women (processing) in the sector. Women have also
 benefited from the gender related program criteria, which had facilitated a higher degree of participation
 than most other World Bank projects (44%).

 Interviews with 105 female group members and 8 focus groups in Ogun State revealed that there are at
 least three important factors that have impacted female group performance including:
           (i)     social cohesion, generally stemming from pre-existing geographic or community ties;
           (ii)    economic needs and ties, specifically finding that groups that share economic activities
                   and perform them frequently perform more effectively; and
           (iii)   financial and technical support- from men - including administrative (men tend to be
                   more literate) and technical assistance. The most successful women were those in co-
                   productive arrangements with their husband or a male relative.

 Women reported feeling empowered at the community level due to increased opportunities to invest in
 social (rites of passage) and productive initiatives provided by the Fadama program. However for many
 women beneficiaries, this benefit did not extend to the household.

3.21 Based on the additional evidence collected as part of this assessment, progress
made against the second objective of empowering communities to take charge of their
own local development is rated Modest.

OBJECTIVE III: REDUCING CONFLICT

3.22 The project’s third objective was to “reduce conflict between Fadama users.” A
key assumption put forth by the project was that facilitated negotiation over the use of
common pool resources could reduce conflict between competing groups. Reduced
conflict would then translate into increased livelihood opportunities and enhanced
welfare effects.

3.23 Based on a reported number of conflicts that occurred in Fadama areas during the
first phase of the project, Fadama II set a target of reducing conflict by 50%. The target
was set against a baseline number of 1,142 conflicts that reportedly occurred between
1996-2002 in the areas treated by Fadama I. The data made available suggests that these
conflicts resulted in 2,058 deaths and 4,750 injuries, as well as significant crop and
livestock loss. Conflict was reported to be particularly severe in Oyo, Adawama, Ogun,
Imo, Lagos, Bauchi, and Gombe, States (See Annex C). The data was collected by recall
                                             20


at the beginning stages of Fadama II. None of the methods used to collect the data was
made available to IEG, including a description of the identification of the types of
respondents or how these conflicts were attributed to the Fadama interventions. Conflicts
were reported at the level of the state, rather than the local governments, where the
Fadama programs are situated.

3.24 The target set for the project was and remains unclear. Interviews with the
Fadama staff were not able to provide a rationale for why the project sought to reduce
Fadama related conflicts (those that would presumably be triggered by project
interventions) by only 50 percent. If effective, the project still would have contributed to
some 571 conflicts in the project areas. By project close, the project reported: “an
aggregate 85 percent reduction in conflict, with no conflict in 6 of the 12 states, and only
a few isolated cases of minor conflicts in the remaining states.” IEG was not able to
obtain the source data for these reported results but notes that a reduction of conflict by
85 percent would result in 171 conflicts having occurred in 6 of the 12 Fadama states,
rather than “a few isolated cases of minor conflicts” as was reported.

3.25 To validate the results reported, IEG tracked the reported results through the
M&E system, including a review of the national and state completion reports (Annex D).
The National Completion Report indicated that conflict related data was available for ten
of the twelve states at project close, and that nine of the ten states report incidents of
conflict. While in some cases many or all of these conflicts were mitigated or resolved,
the data reported by the national completion report negates the outcome level data
reported by the Bank (that there was “no conflict in six of the twelve states.”) To further
validate and assess the conflict related data reported, IEG reviewed the state level
implementation completion reports. Here, IEG found that the only conflicts included in
the M&E framework were those conflicts that had been “reported” rather than those that
occurred. This suggests that the definition of conflict and the manner by which it was
being reported may have varied significantly between the baseline and endline of the
project. Data reported by the States was collected from various and inconsistent sources
and references to the types of conflict that were mitigated included everything from
stakeholder conflict to institutional conflicts, encroachments, and minor conflicts, etc.

3.26      Interviews with Desk Officers and Facilitators further validated this finding. The
interviews revealed that opinions differed as to whether a conflict should be reported if it
was able to be mitigated by the project teams – in some cases local project staff attested
that if a case of crop trampling was able to be resolved than there was no need to report it
in the MIS, for example. Others attested to recording and reporting each of these low-
level conflicts.

3.27 This perceived proclivity to downplay both the nature and frequency of resource
related conflicts was pervasive throughout the project reporting structures. The tendency
to underreport conflict is likely linked to the nature of the indicator, which
inappropriately asked project staff to report on conflict reduction as opposed to conflict
identification, mitigation, and resolution. If the indicator had been reversed, and an
“early-warning” system was rewarded, it is likely that the reporting would have looked
differently. The project supported conflict training and equipped local level staff with
tools to report and mitigate conflict, by organizing and supporting dedicated conflict
                                            21


committees. Qualitative data collection concerning the techniques used to negotiate,
mitigate or resolve conflicts could have contributed to a greater degree of learning about
the added value of the Fadama approach vis-à-vis traditional methods.

Findings from IEG’s Perception-Based Interviews on Fadama’s Conflict Related Tools

3.28 To better understand the role that Fadama II played in affecting resource-related
conflicts between different user groups, IEG conducted one-on-one interviews with the
Fadama staff and the local Fadama conflict committees that were constituted for the
purpose of supporting conflict reduction in the project areas. IEG posed conflict-related
questions in group interviews with State and Local Fadama Staff, the Fadama
Community Associations, and village beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the project. It
also met with select pastoral groups near or around their reserve sites.

3.29 IEG learned that there was a general appreciation for the attention paid to conflict
in the Fadama program and all parties interviewed attested to the value of the grievance
mechanisms that were introduced by the project. Stakeholders present in the town hall
meetings convened by IEG in the twenty-two villages visited by the mission revealed that
Fadama participants appreciated the opportunity of getting to know one another, and that
this experience had increased their awareness about each other’s needs. Another
perception shared by all stakeholder groups interviewed was that Fadama II lowered the
cost of reporting grievances. Traditionally, grievant parties would report to one or more
of Nigeria’s traditional chiefs, and if violent, to the police. Each of the grievant parties
would be taxed, or would have to pay a fine. Under Fadama II, the conflict mediation
team worked with the traditional authorities to facilitate dialogue. And under Fadama II,
there was no tax. Interview responses from triangulated sources suggested that Fadama
had the effect of supporting increased reporting of low-lying tensions, because the
activity was free of charge. However, this does not bear out in the quantitative data
provided. After project close, in areas no longer treated by Fadama, the system has
reverted to the original one.

3.30 In several of the states visited by IEG, conflict was framed mainly as one between
the non-sedentary pastoral groups and the sedentary farmers. In arranging interviews with
participating pastoral groups, IEG learned that the project did not engage transhumant
pastoralists. Most of the pastoralists that participated in the Fadama II project had been
settled for more than a decade, and even this group was underrepresented. Pastoral
groups were not included in the vulnerable group classification, which required increased
recruitment efforts on the part of the facilitation teams to fulfill the project guidelines.
Vulnerable Groups in total represented 12 percent of the project population; pastoralists
represented 3 percent.

3.31    The Fadama conflict committees were comprised of dedicated but youthful
Nigerians who, in order to avoid nepotism or undue influence, were asked to work in
areas where they had no societal ties. Many of their local efforts were effective in dealing
with non-violent grievances and disputes over Fadama related resources, as revealed by
the data on conflict resolution and interviews in twenty-two villages where conflict
related questions were posed. However, interviews with members of the conflict
committees revealed that engagement with the transhumant groups would have required
                                            22


very different project arrangements and specific attention and support to the issue by both
the State Governments and the World Bank.

3.32 The project utilized pastoral rural infrastructure as a conflict mitigation tool.
Interviews with pastoral groups that participated in the program revealed that while the
project interventions produced benefits, they also led to some unintended impacts that
increased risks. Increased access to water in pastoral grazing areas tended to attract new
users to the area who were unfamiliar with local relationships, customs and informal
farmer-pastoral agreements. If pastoral rural infrastructure was envisioned as a conflict
mitigation tool, then the menu option could have been offered separately, in the form of a
peace dividend, whereby the contribution could have also been lowered. The pastoral
infrastructure was also hard to incentivize, since it would often require cross FCA
cooperation and since it was one option offered alongside a menu of other critical rural
infrastructure options, such as boreholes, and roads. There was also an inadequate
amount of land provided by the Government for this purpose.

3.33 Project efforts to reduce conflict between Fadama user groups is rated
Substantial. While IEG cannot validate the pronounced reduction in conflict due to the
different benchmarks, definitions, and data collection methods that were used by the
project, IEG found that there was substantial attention to resource-use disputes that
occurred within the boundaries of this project, with specific attention paid to mitigating
conflict between participating resource-users.



4. Efficiency
4.1     The project conducted a cost-benefit analysis - including estimates of various
economic rates of return related to the project as a whole - at appraisal. The standard
measures of project viability, the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Economic Rate of
Return (ERR) were computed based on assumed best practices in agricultural and non-
farm enterprises for a 15-year period. For the whole project, the ERR and NPV were
computed as 40 percent and US$2,374 million respectively assuming an opportunity cost
of capital of 12 percent.

4.2     The key quantifiable benefit expected from the subproject investments was
income from the incremental production of high value horticultural and livestock
products. The smallholder household was expected to increase its income by 400 percent
on average. Livestock production (especially cattle fattening and high-value horticulture
production) was assumed to generate the greatest increases in income. The annual
incremental revenues were expected to be derived from improvements and expansion of
existing production practices and from diversification into nonfarm activities.

4.3     Production benefits were expected either from an expansion of cultivated area (on
average, farm sizes double from 0.5 hectare to 1.0 hectare in the south and from 0.8
hectare to 1.6 hectares in the north) or through increases in the cropping intensities. The
total output of high value crops was expected to increase by 400 percent, almost all of it
accounted for by intensification. Cereals production would increase by 300 percent (to
                                            23


6.3 million tons per year), with 20 percent of this increase coming from increases in
productivity. With regard to the main enterprise subsectors of the project, investments in
crop-livestock production systems were expected to generate an ERR of 43 percent, and
investments in agro- processing enterprises generate an ERR of 41 percent with palm oil
and rice processing generating the highest returns, and investments in aquaculture
generate 31 percent. Among all production activities, the farm enterprises with large
ruminants, especially cattle and ram fattening, generate the highest return, while farm
enterprises with poultry and small ruminants produced marginal returns.

4.4     By project close, the ERR and FRR were reported to be 43 percent and 48 percent
respectively, representing a marginal increase of 7.5 percent and 6.7 percent over and
above the baseline (PAD) values. Factors that are reported to have contributed to the
higher rates of ERR and FRR were: (i) the choice of subproject investments by
beneficiaries, which indicate a preference for the most profitable activities; and (ii) the
training and advisory activities provided by the project in association with these
activities.

4.5      The project conducted a benefit-cost analysis and an internal rate of return (IRR)
analysis for 25 economic enterprises. The analysis found that benefit-cost ratios for all
enterprises were profitable except for those of conventional livestock where the ratio was
less than 1, indicating that for every naira expended, 0.5 naira was obtained as benefits.
IRR values for the enterprises showed very high returns. The return on investment for
irrigation pumps was estimated at 1.83; grains processing was 1.16 for 2 tons/8-hours
capacity; and for groundnut oil extractor 1.74. Aquaculture and artisanal fisheries
yielded an IRR of over 61 percent and for Fadama roads, the IRR was calculated at 56
percent.

4.6     Although the returns reported are plausible for individual activities, there is no
information provided in the analysis as to how many observations were used to generate
the economic rates of return or the representativeness of the samples that were used to
generate the data. The economic analysis indicates that the “results were generated from
data collected from the project at the end of its life.” However, the project helped
beneficiaries to acquire 73,599 pieces of equipment through 7,766 subprojects under the
productive assets component and 5,000 rural infrastructure investments (representing
some 35% of project finance) under the rural infrastructure component. Without better
understanding the methods by which the analyses were conducted, it is not possible to
validate the reported returns.

4.7     Data collected by the external assessment (2006), the mid-term review (2007) and
the IEG assessment in some ways challenge some of the conclusions made by the
economic rate of return analysis issued at project close. For example, whereas the ICR
indicates that the training and advisory activities provided by the project may have
contributed to the higher returns, both the external assessment and IEG found very little
uptake of these activities. By April 2007, only 12 percent of all Fadama user groups had
accessed the training and advisory activities provided by the project. IEG’s field visits
revealed a high demand and need for advisory services. Most of the failed enterprises
encountered by the assessment could be linked to a lack of expert technical assistance,
especially after the project ended. Several attempts to diversify away from the original
                                                              24


enterprise – including poultry, pig or fish farming – were undermined by a lack of
training or access to disease surveillance or treatment, accounting, and marketing
expertise.

4.8     The ICR also does not explain how the project achieved many of its high rates of
return despite the fact that the outcomes differed from the assumptions made by the PAD.
The data collected across two dry season cropping cycles at mid-term suggests that for
Fadama beneficiaries, crop production increased while livestock production and other
non-farm activities decreased (See Figure 7). According to the PAD, livestock production
would generate the greatest income increases and annual incremental revenues were
expected to be derived from improvements of existing production practices and from
diversification into nonfarm activities. Other evidence suggests that the reported returns
on crop production would mainly be derived from an expansion of cultivated areas as
opposed to an increase in cropping intensity. Between 1997-2008, the contribution of
agriculture to GDP increased from 4.2 to 7.2 percent, driven by an expansion in areas
planted with staple crops rather than high value commodities. Productivity has remained
flat or declining (IFPRI 2010). The PAD based its cropping estimates on a high rate of
return from high value crops as opposed to staple crops and that almost all of it would be
accounted for by intensification.

4.9    The ERR/IRR generated disaggregated data on commodities rather than the
beneficiary groups. From the data it is not discernable whether the vulnerable and
marginalized groups experienced a positive rate of return. The data provided by the
                                                         25


external assessment, for example, suggests that there was no significant increase in
income derived from other activities supported by the project – such as bee keeping, fish
farming, hunting etc. Many of these activities would have been targeted at the
marginalized groups.

Other Aspects of Efficiency

4.10 Targeting. The project was implemented in twelve states purposely selected by
the government of Nigeria in collaboration with the World Bank. Within the states, local
government areas were also purposely selected. Viewed as a poverty reduction tool by
the government of Nigeria (and the World Bank), this purposive selection was an
inefficient method to reach the very poor. The poorest states in Nigeria, for example,
were not treated during this phase. 11 While this was a project that was being piloted with
a view towards scaling up, most of the states selected were in the humid and dry
savannah zones, a factor that limited the project’s ability to determine whether activities
could be replicated elsewhere. The project sought to support resource users across the
Fadama value chain – from production to marketing. But the criteria for selecting these
end-users were unclear. How would a facilitator choose from amongst the many
marketers in highly populated urban areas who were selling Fadama related goods? The
dilemma resulted in urban groups being chosen who either did not need the assistance or
whose participation did not have a measurable effect on users downstream of the
marketing chains.

4.11 Integrating Learning. Although a Participatory Rural Assessment was conducted
at appraisal in 2004, by 2006 the mid-term assessment judged the data to be too poor to
use as a baseline. The PRA data was thus discarded and new data on groups and
perceptions about welfare vis-à-vis the project distributed assets was collected. By 2008,
the project had begun preparing the third phase, and did not commission an end-line
study to measure attributable change between mid-term and endline. Since the project
was moving into a third phase, findings from the end-line study could have been useful in
informing the design of the third phase. The project’s third phase, planned three-quarters
of the way through the second phase, included a design that left behind the villages
treated in the second phase. In a CDD operation where villagers have been newly
exposed to the principles and practices underlying this approach, the decision to abruptly
end treatment is likely to undermine much of the investments made to date.

4.12 Efficiency is rated Modest owing to a lack of methodological rigor in determining
the estimated rates of returns at project end, inefficient targeting given the implicit
poverty objective of the program, and inefficient use of data to inform implementation
and the design of subsequent project phases.




11
   The 2006 IFPRI Assessment notes that, “As with Fadama I, selection of states to participate in Fadama II was not
random. The 12 Fadama II states and the local Fadama resource areas where the project operated were purposely
selected by the government of Nigeria in collaboration with the World Bank.”

5. Ratings
Outcome
5.1    The outcome of Fadama II is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2     Its three objectives are rated Highly Relevant. Taken in tandem, the objectives
reflect a high degree of learning about what works and what does not work in achieving
sustainable development in rural Nigeria. The objectives represent a sharp course-
correction based on learning from the first phase and are fully in line with the poverty and
empowerment objectives enshrined in Nigeria’s national, state and local development
strategies. The relevance of the project objectives could have been strengthened by
including local governments, at least as a pilot exercise. The project design – featuring a
community driven development approach – was Substantially Relevant. The project was
designed to foster cooperation between resource users, through a facilitated negotiation of
local needs and a focus on conflict mitigation. The demand-driven approach was
designed to more effectively match rural service delivery with identified core local needs.
It was also designed to be socially inclusive. Project design would have been more
relevant had it been poverty- targeted, included other groups in the original growth
diagnostics, and more clearly defined the types of conflict the project was seeking to
reduce and how conflict would be reported.

5.3     Progress made against the first objective of sustainably increasing the incomes of
Fadama users is rated Substantial in despite of the paucity of evidence that was made
available at project-close. However, since most of the assumptions about the project’s
income effects are linked to the presence of sustainable assets, IEG can verify that the
assets recorded were distributed and that 64 percent of the private and 50 percent of the
public assets visited were still operational or had yielded sufficient profits for repair
and/or reinvestment as of November 2013.

5.4     Efforts to empower local communities to take charge of their own development
agenda were less successful and thus rated Modest. IEG verified that all randomly
selected villages treated by Fadama II had developed a local development plan but found
that none of these villages have reconvened a Fadama style process in support of
participatory and inclusive decision-making, or negotiation amongst resource users over
competing land use needs since project close. With the exception of one local
government visited, none of the local governments were utilizing the Fadama
development plan or the planning apparatus (facilitated negotiation among competing
resource user groups) to make decisions about local development planning and financial
allocations. While beneficiaries interviewed reported that group participation in Fadama
II yielded individual welfare benefits, increased access to savings, and similar to non-
Fadama Groups, acted as a buffer in times of emergency, Fadama benefits appear to have
been enjoyed more by group leaders and active members than non-active members, or the
elite versus the non-elite members of the groups. Fadama members with pre-existing
strong inter-personal networks appear to have had more voice in the choice of assets and
greater control over their use. Fadama increased female inclusion in local economic
development planning. However, while there was a high rate of female participation in
                                             27


Fadama II, findings from the project’s Mid-Term Review indicate that women, along
with vulnerable and marginalized groups, were often not able to afford or obtain their
assets of choice.

5.5    Project efforts to reduce conflict between Fadama user groups is rated Substantial.
While IEG cannot validate the pronounced reduction in conflict due to the different
benchmarks, definitions, and data collection methods that were used by the project, IEG
found that there was substantial attention to resource-use disputes that occurred within
the boundaries of this project and between specific Fadama group members. Interviews
in twenty-two villages revealed that due to the conflict module in the project, competing
groups met and negotiated with one another for the first time. The grievance redress
mechanism implemented by the project induced greater participation by lowering costs of
entry.

5.6     Efficiency is rated Modest owing to a lack of methodological rigor in determining
the estimated rates of returns at project end, inefficient targeting given the implicit
poverty objective of the program, and inefficient use of data to inform implementation
and the design of subsequent project phases.

Risk to Development Outcome
5.7    There is a very high risk to sustaining the development outcomes achieved under
Fadama II. IEG visited the Fadama II areas that were not currently benefitting from
Fadama’s third phase. In all of these areas, while former beneficiaries demonstrated a
high level of exuberance for the community driven development approach, the
communities were no longer empowered to influence the local development agenda. All
of the communities visited were able to physically reproduce and speak to the
achievements of their 2006 Local Development Plan. However none of the communities
had, of their own volition, re-engaged in a participatory and socially inclusive local
development planning process. None of the communities had revisited or updated their
Fadama facilitated local development plan.

5.8      The IFPRI impact assessment did not measure sustainability since the evaluation
was conducted one year after the distribution of assets. The evaluation did however point
to several prevailing trends at the time that could heighten the risk of sustaining the
income streams supported under Fadama. One of these risks relates to the very low
uptake of advisory services. Project reporting (the project mid-term review) observed
collusion between advisory service providers and FCA/FUG officials, so that the
independent recruitment of providers was compromised, potentially signifying a degree
of elite capture in the project and a risk over time to fostering sustainable enterprises. IEG
found, based on interviews with beneficiaries, that most of the failed enterprises
encountered by the assessment could be linked to a lack of expert technical assistance,
especially after the project ended. Several attempts to diversify away from the original
enterprise – including poultry, pig or fish farming – were scuttled due to the lack of
exposure to modern techniques, disease surveillance or treatment, and/or by accounting
and marketing expertise. As noted by the IFPRI impact assessment, Fadama II increased
the demand for postharvest handling technologies but did not have a significant impact
on the demand for financial management and marketing expertise.
                                             28


5.9     A decision to scale-up the Fadama program - made half-way through the project’s
 nd
2 Phase - tripled the number of states included in the program – from twelve to all
thirty-six States. The decision was partly due to a then growing national discontent
surrounding donors’ decisions to favor “lead” States. The roll-out significantly stretched
the program’s capacity and significantly diluted available resources. It also prevented the
program from reinvesting in the beneficiaries who had engaged in the second phase.
While there was some effort to reinforce the capacity of the beneficiaries that had
received support under Fadama II, the third phase purposively selected new villages that
had not been treated under the second phase, leaving many phase II beneficiaries
disappointed.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

5.10 Quality at Entry was rated Satisfactory by the Quality Assurance Group in 2003
and is rated Moderately Satisfactory by this review, with some notable weaknesses. The
Bank built local ownership for the project, by conducting extensive stakeholder
consultations, engaging policy makers in extensive dialogue and carrying out project-
related studies. PHRD funds were obtained to ensure that relevant analytical and
technical work was conducted, including a gender assessment. Conflict mitigation models
implemented by DFID in a wetlands project in Jigawa state were also studied and
replicated in the Fadama approach.

5.11 Interviews with the state offices revealed that more could have been done to
sensitive staff of the Agricultural Development Programs within the State Agricultural
ministries given the dramatic shift in approach that was being introduced and the
associated political economy implications. Supervision reports of “interference” by ADP
staff who were, by agreement, charged with the oversight of the project, are reflective of
tensions that would have been expected in moving from one PIU approach to another,
with different staff.

5.12 The Fadama II project was designed at a time just before the World Bank began
synthesizing lessons on its approach to community driven development. Since then, many
aspects of Bank assistance in this area have been scrutinized and improved upon by the
Bank’s own teams. One such area is the attention paid to the quality of the facilitation
team – recruitment, training, institutionalization, etc. The original facilitation recruitment
strategy lacked an accurate communication strategy about the nature of facilitation (low-
wage, deployment and placement issues). The Bank supported decentralized training at
entry, in partnership with the World Bank Institute on issues relevant to the project. But
the lack of a standardized module for the local development plans initially created
confusion among the facilitators who were tasked to deliver these plans under a very tight
timeline.

5.13 As discussed in the Relevance of Design section of the report, while there was
ample time for preparation of this project, the program was not poverty targeted. Rather,
the initial community contribution ratios led to a high level of participant exclusion, even
though socially marginalized groups were targeted by the project. There was also a lack
                                            29


of a diagnostic of the barriers and constraints facing groups other than farmers. While
relevant, the project’s conflict related objectives should have been defined and designed
in a way that encouraged identification, appropriate reporting, and fair redress.

5.14 Inadequate attention was also paid to the program’s capacity to comply with the
World Bank’s Safeguard Policies. Section 9 of this review details how the program fell
short of fulfilling these standards, especially with regard to environmental management in
the sensitive Fadama areas.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

5.15   Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.16 Owing to the many corporate risks present in the project portfolio at the time of
design, the World Bank supervision team paid placed a premium on overseeing the
financial management of the project. Supervisory oversight of procurement performance
was generally satisfactory. An independent procurement audit was conducted, and the
procurement team participated in the mid-term review exercise of the project. The overall
assessment was that the project’s procurement operations, which were decentralized were
well managed. Financial management risk -- assessed as high at appraisal -- were
managed by the effective use of a Project Financial Management Unit which received
adequate resources and which was supported with standardized written procedures and
training. Project activities were periodically reviewed by the Internal Audit Unit (IAU) in
the PFMUs and the Internal Auditors within the project administration. Challenges
identified during problem-solving supervision missions were properly resolved. And
audit reports were timely and of acceptable quality. Overall, the project’s financial
architecture was sound and the financial management aspects of the project received
adequate attention during project preparation and implementation. Satisfactory oversight
of the procurement of goods and services in this project is noteworthy, since in total, the
decentralized procurement system oversaw the purchase of some 73,599 pieces of
equipment and the construction of 5,000 rural infrastructure investments.

5.17 This was a fast disbursing project vehicle that allowed the project and its disparate
parts to maintain momentum on the ground. Project credibility and its early viability was
based on making the promised matching funds available for use. While attention to the
disbursement cycle was critical, the emphasis seemed to have detracted from the
supervision of the quality of the facilitation with regards to the communication of
community driven development principles. Implemented for the first time in the
agricultural sector in Nigeria, none of the facilitation staff recruited had previously been
trained or expose to CDD concepts. There was a lack of oversight, for example, of the
quality of the facilitation process, the quality of communication, and the integrity of the
group formation. There was also a lack of sensitization of the state level agricultural
development program staff who were, in effect, side-stepped as part of this new service
delivery approach.

5.18 The project cycle should have been longer, with more attention paid in the first
two years to the quality of facilitation, communication and group formation. Fadama II
was approved in December 2003, it became effective in July 2004, and was officially
                                            30


launched in the State of Bauchi by then Bank President Wolfowitz in October 2004. By
September 2004, some 500 Nigerians had been recruited and trained with the expectation
that individuals could be deployed to sensitize communities on such topics as community
driven development, local empowerment and conflict mitigation and to effectively induce
representative and inclusive group participation. By October 2004, project supervision
expected that fully functioning Fadama user groups (FUGs) and representative
community associations (FCAs) would be formed. By November 2004, project
supervision expected that a first batch of Local Development Plans could be ready for
review. Remuneration incentives and/or suspensions of non-performing facilitators were
introduced on the basis of the delivery of the plan.

5.19 In sum, within weeks of being trained and deployed, facilitators had to navigate
complex social relations in new environments where they were expected to induce
inclusive and participatory group formation and decision-making while cobbling together
a village’s first local development plan. With very little time to complete these tasks,
facilitators were often unable to avoid undue influence by local traditional authorities or
village elites.

5.20 World Bank supervision engaged in an independent assessment to collect
beneficiary assessments early on in the project cycle. As a beneficiary assessment
launched one year after the distribution of project financed assets, the exercise would
have been very useful to establish a project baseline. However, due to pressure to expand
the program, the early findings were conveyed as impacts and used to justify the
expansion of the program nationally. Attention was turned towards the preparation of
phase III more than a year prior to the close-out of the second phase. Inadequate
resources and incentives were made available to the Fadama II team to properly close the
project. By project close, the project had not conducted an endline study to assess results.
The World Bank implementation report misrepresents the 2006 beneficiary assessment
findings as endline results and provides inconsistent information on conflict as compared
to national and state level reporting.

5.21   Overall bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
5.22   Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

The active participation of the Federal and State Governments enabled the effective
implementation of the project, and the roll-out of a new approach to rural service delivery
in the agricultural sector in Nigeria. Resources from various agencies were made
available to the project team to allow for their active participation in project design
throughout the protracted preparation period. The government was also instrumental in
facilitating stakeholder consultations. Counterpart funding was prompt and the
government actively participated in project preparation and implementation. The
President of the Republic chaired the wrap-up meeting of one of the preparation missions
and was the presiding officer of the project's formal launch workshop. The Government
                                           31


fulfilled all its legal obligations towards the project, but records on environmental
compliance are lacking, especially with regard to the expansion of the irrigation systems.
There was somewhat less support from Local Governments, some of whom did not
provide the project with timely counterpart contribution, delaying implementation of
some activities.

5.23 Enthusiastic about the early results of the project, the Government requested that
the program scale-up from 12 to all 36 states. While the desire to reach underserved areas
is appropriate, the request had the undesirable effect of ending support to the Fadama II
beneficiaries in a premature way. With project funding withdrawn, neither the
Government nor the States moved towards fully institutionalizing the Fadama approach
or funding to support demand-driven local development planning after project end. So
that while there was much enthusiasm and high level support for the Fadama project,
there is less evidence that its approach will be sustained.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY

5.24 Implementing Agency performance is rated Satisfactory. Fadama II was situated
within a Projects Coordinating Unit of the supervising ministry (FMARD) tasked with
ensuring convergence of policies, approaches, criteria and operating procedures among
similar government and externally-funded poverty-reduction programs and projects in the
sector. Day to day implementation involved a National Fadama Coordination Office, the
twelve state Fadama offices, the 126 Local Fadama Desks within the participating local
governments, and 1,470 FCAs. Fadama II was one of the first community driven
development projects implemented in Nigeria. Project implementation was characterized
by a learning-by-doing approach, with regard to social mobilization, group formation,
local development plan formulation, monitoring and reporting. New roles were created
by the project, new staff were recruited and indoctrinated into a development paradigm
that had not been experienced before. The project was administered in a very efficient
manner, although this was due in part to the output based expectations of the project
(opening bank accounts, forming groups, drafting LDPs, overseeing financing criteria
etc.). Nevertheless, there is evidence that all of these parts worked together to deliver
timely results. Whereas the World Bank, based on its experience should have been in
charge of quality review, the implementing agents oversaw multiple project level
assessments that reflect a high degree of effort and willingness to learn from
implementation. Interviews with the State Fadama Offices that oversaw Fadama II
revealed a high level of commitment and passion for the community driven development
approach. Agents – at the state and local level – were very familiar with the Fadama
constituents and evidenced congenial working relationships, and care about their
wellbeing. More could have been done at all levels to sensitize and build the capacity of
local governments with the aim of mainstreaming the approach into local development
planning over time. The Government ICR notes that civil society requested independent
validation of the data collected and the project assessments at the FCA level. This
practice of transparent social auditing has been incorporated into many of the World
Bank’s current generation of community driven development programs.

5.25   Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND UTILIZATION OF THE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION
SYSTEM

5.26   Monitoring Design, Implementation and Utilization are rated Modest.

5.27 Project design was complex and multi-layered. To monitor, track, report and
internalize learning in real-time, Fadama II would have needed a robust monitoring and
reporting system, with forward and backwards linkages throughout the various
implementing channels. At appraisal, the Bank team helped to put in place a
computerized Management Information System and a Participatory M&E system that
involved several stakeholders groups in the Fadama structure. The system was designed
to track and report on key technical, financial and socioeconomic information pertaining
to the program. IEG was not able to assess the system since it was not in working order at
the time of the mission visit, four years after project close.

5.28 IEG was able to assess tenants of the system, through interviews with the M&E
officers at the national and state levels and through a review of relevant historical
documents. The MIS was difficult to get up and running. By mid-term, although general
implementation information was being made available through quarterly and biannual
reporting, it was found inadequate to handle all the data requirements and tracking of a
complex and rapidly expanding CDD project. Moreover the capacity of staff had not been
fully built in some states. The MIS was reported to be non-functioning by mid-term.
Recommendations made at mid-term, and corrections made to the system, reportedly
made the system more-user friendly. However, interviews with Fadama staff engaged
with the MIS indicated that at some point before the project closed, the system crashed.

5.29 This assessment finds that the Management Information System, the Participatory
M&E system and associated training was underfunded and under-prioritized by the Bank.
All M&E activities – the MIS, external assessments, including the mid-term review and
the impact evaluation, quarterly and biannual reporting, and close-out reporting – were
funded at a level of US$1.6 million or 1.4% of total project funding. The capacity of the
Fadama staff, including the facilitators and the desk officers, to implement the
Management Information System was overestimated. According to the mid-term review,
capacity was lacking since this was one of the first projects in Nigeria to introduce the
concept of participatory monitoring and evaluation. M&E Officers lacked the capacity to
design and implement monitoring and evaluation studies and to carry out the different
types of assessment introduced by the project.

5.30 The MIS components were better aligned with project implementation than
tracking, aggregating and assessing progress towards the project’s objective. Priority was
placed on tracking inputs (group formation) and outputs (LDPs) and oversight of the
procurement and disbursement, rather than on tracking outcomes. Four different
assessment methods were used to collect baseline, mid-line, impact at mid-line, and at
close. None of the outcomes can therefore be considered to have a baseline, which for a
project that set percentage and numerical targets against “a baseline” proves problematic.
The close-out assessment planned for the end-line was reengineered to develop a baseline
                                            33


for the third phase, which was approved one year before the close of Fadama II. Since
Fadama III supported different local government areas, the IE team that had conducted
the mid-line assessment moved its assessment to new areas to conduct the new baseline
for the third phase, rather than repeating the mid-line exercise at close for the second
phase.

5.31    Overall, the Management Information System developed for Fadama II appears
to have been too cumbersome for the project context. At the time, only 32.8% of
Nigeria’s rural communities were connected to the National Power Grid and less than 5%
of these communities could afford to purchase power off-grid (MTR, 2007). While
project staff welcomed an automated system, stakeholders at each level reported
transmission problems – especially from the level of the local Fadama desk to the state
Fadama office. Lessons from Fadama II were used to course correct some design
elements of Fadama II – such as the benefit contribution for the productive assets – and
were also used to inform the design of Fadama III.



6. Compliance with the World Bank’s Policies
Safeguards
6.1    The FADAMA II was classified as a Category A Project. It also triggered six of
the World Bank’s Safeguard Policies including Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01),
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Forestry (OP/GP 4.36), Pest Management (OP 4.09),
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) and Projects in International Water Ways (OP/BP
7.60)

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (OP 4.01)

6.2     The Implementation Completion Report was wholly unsatisfactory in its
treatment and reporting of the mitigation of the negative environmental effects that were
identified by the project’s Environmental Management Plan. According to the ICR, “the
environmental and social management plans were adequately funded and properly
implemented” (p. 9). However there is insufficient evidence that the potentially negative
environmental effects of the subprojects implemented through Fadama II were mitigated.
Rather, project documentation points to neglect of some of the key aspects of the
environmental mitigation plan.

6.3     Decreased soil fertility was one of the main risks identified by the Environmental
Management Plan. The project required soil monitoring during the third and fifth year of
the project cycle. According to the Mid-term review, undertaken in 2007, these
monitoring activities were not carried out. The IFPRI Impact Assessment found that
Fadama II had reduced the demand for soil fertility management technologies, owing to
the fact that the project offered mainly postproduction advisory service. Surface and
ground water quality monitoring was supposed to be carried out by the Federal Ministry
of Water Resources (FMWR). Mitigation activities were to include: construction of
monitoring wells and hydrological situations, the procurement and installation of solid
                                             34


state loggers, the procurement of water quality sampling equipment and reagents, and
routine data retrieval from monitoring wells and hydrological stations and interpretation
including water collection and analysis twice annually. By project close, many of these
activities had not been systematically carried out and IEG was not able to obtain data on
soil fertility or water quality in the Fadama areas treated by project level interventions.

Pest Management (OP 4.09)

6.4     A Pest Management Plan was developed for Fadama II which contained a list of
agrochemical to be used in Fadama areas, methods of handling and recommended
dosages. The plan was supposed to be supported and implemented by the advisory
services component. However, since only a fraction of the Fadama User Groups (12% by
2007) had access to the advisory services component of the project, it is not clear how the
remaining 88% of users technically implemented the pest management plan in their sub-
project areas. The ICR does not provide any assessment of the project’s compliance with
this operational policy.

Financial Management and Procurement
6.5     The project’s financial architecture was sound and the financial management
aspects of the project received adequate attention during project preparation and
implementation. At appraisal, financial management risk was assessed as high due to the
inherent risks associated with the CDD approach. Financial risks were mitigated by
establishing a Project Financial Management Unit that implemented financial controls.
Throughout implementation, supervision was also focused on the FM risk rating and
challenges identified during supervision missions were resolved. Project activities were
periodically reviewed by the Internal Auditors. The audit reports were timely and were
satisfactory in terms of scope. When qualifications arose they were adequately addressed.
The project also demonstrated strong procurement performance. Procurement was
decentralized and subject to periodic reviews. Post procurement reviews were conducted
on a regular basis and an Independent Procurement Audit was also carried out.




7. Lessons
    Technical interventions that transform land related assets require a socially and
     culturally sensitive project design that -- to the extent possible -- provides
     inclusive development opportunities to all affected parties. The Fadama program
     is illustrative of the risks that are attendant in neglecting social analysis in
     technical work streams. The project’s first phase contributed to conflict between
     natural resource users groups by financing activities that expanded livelihood
     benefits to one user group at the expense of others.

    Community based approaches to local development require sustained and
     phased commitment. None of the Fadama villages visited by IEG demonstrated a
     present day capacity to participate in local development planning in a socially
                                        35


   inclusive and accountable manner, in despite of the project’s efforts to instill this.
   Fadama II villages were only supported by one project cycle. Villagers
   interviewed for this review expressed a significant level of disappointment about
   the lack of continued access to facilitated negotiation for the provisions of local
   goods and services. The conflict training and mediation module piloted by the
   project was appreciated by stakeholders but ultimately found to be unsustainable
   in the absence of the project architecture. Maintenance of public infrastructure
   has also expectedly emerged as a key challenge.

 The sustainability of community-based initiatives depends crucially on an
  enabling institutional environment, which requires government commitment,
  and on accountability of leaders to their community to avoid “supply-driven
  demand-driven” development (Mansuri and Rao, 2004). This overarching lesson
  on community driven development put forth by the World Bank’s Development
  Economics Groups is very applicable to the Nigerian context.

 Programs designed to change behavior need to be grounded in a deep
  understanding of context; they need to be willing to engage in a study of what
  motivates people. Programs implemented at scale should include a sensitive
  design that takes into account the different cultural, linguistic and ethnic
  characteristics of the targeted population. Programs designed to change behavior
  also require observational and qualitative indicators, that in turn, require capacity
  building and implementation support to tweak project assumptions and project
  adjust design in real time.

COMMENTS ON IEG DRAFT                          PROJECT        PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT REPORT:
NIGERIA: SECOND NATIONAL                       FADAMA         DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT IDA 38380

The project has carefully reviewed the report of the external assessment done
by IEG on the closed Second National Fadama Development Project. The high
professionalism exhibited by the review team is hereby greatly acknowledged.
However, there are some few observation on key components of the report as
shown below:

Paragraph 1, line 2on Page X: “To test whether Fadama users had
sustainably increased their incomes due to the second phase of the Fadama
program, IEG administered a one-on-one survey to a random stratified
sample of 10% of the direct Fadama beneficiaries that had been
interviewed for the 2006 impact assessment…..” The IEG study included
randomly selected 118 beneficiaries of the 1281 beneficiaries who were
included in the sample. The study did not include a control group, which could
have given a much better picture of performance of the Fadama II
beneficiaries. A lot has changed since Fadama II Project ended and assessment
of impact of the Project would have been much more rigorous by comparing
performance of beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries with matching
characteristics. Plus the sample size is small and could lead to serious biases.
There are plans to revisit all Fadama II beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries to
assess the sustainability of the Fadama II Project. This approach will verify
most of the results that were drawn in this Project using methods and data that
are insufficient to draw such strong conclusions.

On page x, the IEG report claimed that “An independent beneficiary
assessment conducted one year after the project began implementation assessed
incomes as a function of the asset.” This is not true. The IEG team made
reference to an old version of the report; the correct version is in this book . In
the correct report income was assessed and productive assets separately:

      a. income (from crops, livestock, non-farm activities, etc) and these
      were collected directly by asking respondents their income before and
      after Fadama II support. Data was not collected using asset. Use of
ANNEX G                               84



      expenditure as a measure of income was avoided because of difficulty for
      respondents to remember such data after one year.

      b. Productive assets – the change in the value of group and private
      productive assets were assessed.
This misunderstanding has led to conclusions that need to be corrected. For
example even though IEG reports “project made substantial progress on
achieving its first objective of sustainably increasing the incomes of Fadama
users” (page xiv), this is based on the observation that 64% of the productive
assets are still generating income. An assessment of the income of the
beneficiaries could have produced a better assessment of the change of income
of beneficiaries – rather than the current assessment that uses productive asset
to                                 assess                               income.

Last sentence on Page xiii: “The assessment did not attempt to determine
actual beneficiary incomes as a result of the project - owing to the lack of a
baseline and weakly constructed proxy indicators during the project cycle
(See Chapter 3). This assessment was also not designed to conduct a
comparative analysis between beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups” The
Impact Assessment conducted by IFPRI in 2006 made use of Comparative
analysis between beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups; while the IEG
assessment did not employ this method. The results from the two assessments
therefore may not be the same. The IEG study included randomly selected 118
beneficiaries of the 1281 beneficiaries who were included in the sample. The
study did not include a control group, which could have given a much better
picture of performance of the Fadama II beneficiaries. While the IFPRI report
indicated a 58.5% income increase for all beneficiaries at MTR, at ICR income
of beneficiaries increased by 63%. A lot has changed since Fadama II Project
ended and assessment of impact of the Project would have been much more
rigorous by comparing performance of beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries
with matching characteristics. Plus the sample size is small and could lead to
serious biases. We are planning to revisit all Fadama II beneficiaries and non-
beneficiaries to assess the sustainability of the Fadama II project. This
approach will verify most of the results that were drawn in this project using
methods and data that
are insufficient to draw such strong conclusions.
Page xiv paragraph 3 line 6-11:        “….Design also lacked an adequate
diagnostic of the income constraints of the more marginalized groups
included in the project. While the project targeted several resource user
                                     85                              ANNEX G


groups in its primary objective, implementation arrangements maintained
a bias towards farming and agricultural production. Conflict lacked a clear
definition and a theory of attribution. An emphasis on the reporting of
conflict reduction, rather than on rewarding early identification,
mitigation and resolution resulted in under-reporting by the project…”
There was no bias towards farming and agricultural production in the
implementation of Fadama II Project as claimed in the report judging by the
fact that the content of the LDP evolve through participatory process, thereby
recognizing the priority projects of different economic interest groups (crop
farmers, livestock farmers, fisher folks, processors, gatherers, hunters,
vulnerable groups, etc).

Page XV, first Paragraph last sentence: “With few exceptions, interviews
with local government officials revealed that the participatory and
negotiated decision-making promoted by Fadama was not occurring there”
       This should be related to political instability and staff turnover at this
level of governance. However, the project made tremendous effort by
establishing the Local Fadama Desk Office (LFD) and Local Fadama
Development Committee (LFDC) chaired by the LGA chairperson. In addition,
capacities of the relevant staff (Desk officers and members of LFDC) were
strengthened to perform their expected roles. The sum of $3.5 was allocated
and utilized for this purpose.


Page XV, second Paragraph: “…Members with stronger interpersonal
networks had more voice in the choice and control over assets. Fadama
increased female participation in local economic development planning but
evidence suggests that women and other members of vulnerable and
marginalized groups were often not able to afford or obtain their needed
assets” Group benefit is usually a function of individual participation and
contribution. The project identified this challenge during implementation where
the required community contribution for assets was reduced twice to
accommodate women and other vulnerable & marginalized members of the
group. In addition, the project supported about 20% of the beneficiaries who
were vulnerable and marginalized (i.e widows, physically challenged, aged,
PLWHA, etc) with 0% beneficiaries’ contributions.

Page XV, third Paragraph last sentence: “..IEG notes with concern
however that by project close, there were an estimated 171 conflicts that
had occurred in Fadama areas that had not been resolved. Information on
ANNEX G                               86



their severity or effects was not made available to the IEG team...” But
without a baseline, it is not easy to assess impact of Fadama II on conflict
resolution. So again, IEG approach has shortcomings in its assessment.


Page XV, fourth Paragraph last sentence: “The efficiency of the Project is
rated Modest owing to a lack of methodological rigor in determining the
estimated rates of returns at project end, inefficient targeting owing to
purposive selection of the states and local governments, and inefficient use
of monitoring, data collection and assessment systems to support
implementation and the design of subsequent Project phases” Selection of
participating States and LG for in the project was based on predetermined
criteria among which Fadama Resources Potential was key. (see copy of letter
to Federal Character Commission(FCC) attached as annex 1).


Page xv, fifth Paragraph last sentence: “…Insufficient attention was paid to
building capacity for environmental management, which proved to be a
challenge in this project..”.It should be noted that capacities of the
Environmental Officers under the Fadama II Project have been adequately
built under the project with several specialized training organized for them both
within and outside Nigeria. Based on the capacity building, the project
Environmental officers were able to prepare and implement safeguard and
mitigation measures. The project also, received technical assistance from FAO
on execution of stock routes and grazing reserve sub-projects, though not
implemented under the LDP arrangement, but 100% supported under EMP.
This intervention greatly assisted in reducing resource use conflicts.

Page xvi line 2: “A decision to scale up the project nationally was based on
the result measured one year after the project became effective..”. Fadama
II became effective in May 2004 and the assessment took place in October,
2006 – i.e. 2 years and not one year as claimed in the report. The actual
reasons for follow up project are stated in paragraph 10, page 8 of Fadama III
PAD “…The justification for a follow-on operation is two-fold: FGN has
requested it, and the measured success of Fadama II Project supports it …”

Page xvi under lessons para 2: “The conflict training and mediation module
piloted by the project was appreciated by stakeholders but ultimately
found to be unsustainable in the absence of the project architecture” Even

created by the project, e.g. Eriti in Ogun state.



Paragraph 2.4, page 3: “Farmer-Pastoral conflicts in Nigeria were so
severe in 2013 that they were classified as war by the Heidelberg Conflict
Barometer (against a five point scale that ranks conflict in escalating
order: disputes, non-violent crises, violent crises, limited wars and wars”
Most of the reported cases of conflict after the close of Fadama II Project were
mainly due to reasons (cattle rustling and reprisal attack) other than the
common resource use that was addressed during Fadama II implementation.
Moreover, Fadama II operated in only 12 states and 120 LGAs out of 36 States
and FCT, and 774 LGAs respectively.

Paragraph 2.9 page 4:     “Overseen by an elected Association Chair, the
FCA was responsible for overseeing the drafting of an inclusive
development plan that allocated sub-project financing across three main
investment categories: (1) Capacity Building, (2) Rural Infrastructure; (3)
Private Productive assets” Advisory services and later on Input support
(which was included in the design at the midterm of the project) are the fourth
and fifth investment categories;

Paragraph 2.12     lines 6 and 9:    “SFDO” should be changed to “SFDC”.
Paragraph 2.13     line 2: “Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development” should be changed to “Federal Ministry of Agriculture and
Water Resources”.
Paragraph 2.16 page 6: “While the project design facilitated the
participation of these groups, and successfully integrated their needs into
the local development plan, only 7% of these participants were able to
afford the goods and services requested through the plan (MTR, April
2007)”. The 20% of vulnerable and marginalized groups that participated in
the project has surpassed the MTR figure of 7% at ICR.
Paragraph 2.17 page 6: “…the appraisal only provides an analysis of income
constraints for one user group– the farmer groups – and the project’s
implementation arrangements maintain a bias towards crop production…”
The same constraint applies to other resource users since they all operate
within the same socio-economic environment and project framework;
Paragraph 2.19 page 7: “…The project was not able to sponsor or maintain
a dialogue with non-sedentary pastoralists, although an initial attempt was
ANNEX G                               88



made to engage the Miette Allah of Nigeria at the beginning of the project
cycle..” Miette Allah of Nigeria and Sedentary Agro-Pastoralists are the same
group made up of pastoralist and agro-pastoralist. The target of the project was
actually trans-human and that was why the stock route, watering point and
grazing reserve were executed under EMP.

Paragraph 2.21 Page 8: “…The project commissioned a Participatory
Rural Appraisal with the aim of establishing a welfare related baseline,
however the data was neither used as a baseline for the project M&E nor
was it used by the mid-line assessment to track results..” Baseline was done
which formed a basis for the project RMF, but IFPRI did not utilze it because it
does not … In addition, CDD project usually assume a baseline of zero because
FCAs/FUGs were not yet constituted.

Paragraph 2.23 page 9: “…The project set out to reduce Fadama related
conflicts by 50 percent of the baseline value of conflicts that were reported
to have been triggered by Fadama I. But fully meeting this target would
allow for a remaining 571 conflicts to occur during the project period in
targeted Fadama areas…”. The project was designed to reduce conflict
amongst resource use. It should be noted that there is a significant correlation
between reduction in reported conflict and reduction in total conflict because
reduction in the part will lead to reduction in the whole. Moreover, the project
operated in maximum of 120 LGAs out of the 774 LGAs in Nigeria.
Paragraph 3.19 page 18: “…The mid-term review recommended lowering
the beneficiary contribution for women and vulnerable groups to 10
percent, however this recommendation was not taken up by the current
phase…” The mid-term review recommendation of lowering the beneficiary
contribution for women & vulnerable groups was actually taken up in the 3rd
phase as outlined in the PAD and PIM.
Paragraph 3.23 page 19-20: “Conflicts were reported at the level of the
state, rather than the local governments, where the Fadama programs are
situated..” The respective SFDOs used Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) to
collect conflict data in all Project areas using the project developed monitoring
format as contained in annex II.
Paragraph 3.24 page 20: “…IEG was not able to obtain the source data for
these reported results…”The source data for reported conflict figure is
available with the project and the tool used to collect the data at FUG, FCA,
LGA and State levels was shared with IEG during the PPA exercise. (see copy
attached as Annex II). The project had definition of conflict, facilitators were

trained, and conflict resolution committees were established and trained to
mitigate and address common resource use conflicts. It should also be noted
that conflicts, once occurred cannot be hidden.
Paragraph 3.29 page 21: “…IEG learned that the project did not engage
transhumant pastoralists. Most of the pastoralists that participated in the
Fadama II project had been settled for more than a decade…”. Fadama III
engaged transhumant pastoralist through their umbrella association; Miette-
Allah of Nigeria with whom the Project actively worked and coordinated the
activities of the highly mobile group whose movement changes with season.
Paragraph 5.8 page 27: “…One of these risks relates to the very low uptake
of advisory services…” Incidences of low uptake of advisory services were at
the beginning of the Project. The trend was reversed with the introduction of
the input support sub-component that supported provision of critical factors on
risk sharing basis thereby inducing more uptake of advisory services activities
by user groups.
Paragraph 5.17 page 29: “There was a lack of oversight, for example, of the
quality of the facilitation process, the quality of communication, and the
integrity of the group formation. There was also a lack of sensitization of
the state level agricultural development program staff who were, in effect,
side-stepped as part of this new service delivery approach..” serious
sensitization was organized for policy makers (ADP inclusive) before the
project became effective. Complain of being side-stepped is purely that of
attitude and mind set leading to resistance to change; top-down vs bottom-up.
However, many ADPs/staff were involved as public service provider under the
Fadama II project. By the official launch of the project, Facilitators were
significantly trained to commence the preparation of the LDPs.
Paragraph 5.18(line 3)& 5.19 pages29 and 30: “ … The project cycle should
have been longer, with more attention paid in the first two years to the
quality of facilitation, communication and group formation. Fadama II was
approved in December 2003, it became effective in July 2004, and was
officially launched in the State of Bauchi by then Bank President
Wolfowitz in October 2004. By September 2004, some 500 Nigerians had
been recruited and trained with the expectation that individuals could be
deployed to sensitize communities on such topics as community driven
development…” Change “July 2004” to read “May 2004”. Training of
Facilitators: Intensive training and deployment of Community Facilitators
began in December, 2003 and January, 2004 using the PPF (a scanned copy of
Certificate issued to one of the trained Facilitators is attached as annex V) with
a follow up training in April, 2004 before the official launch in October

2004.Refer to one of the training report attached as Annex III and the Response
letter (Annex 1) to query made by the Federal Character Commission and
Agency of Government responsible for ensuring federal nature of the country is
complied with in all its ramification. Also, see Minutes of meeting with the TTL
held at the Commissioning of NFDO office highlighting the progress of
implementation at the take off of project as Annex IV.
Para 5.20 Page 30: “World Bank supervision engaged in an independent
assessment to collect beneficiary assessments early on in the project cycle.
As a beneficiary assessment launched one year after the distribution of
project finance Fadama II …” The FGN engaged IFPRI and not the World
Bank.
Para 5.20 Page 30 : “Attention was turned towards the preparation of
phase III more than a year prior to the close-out of the second phase.
Inadequate resources and incentives were made available to the Fadama II
team to properly close the project. By project close, the project had not…”
Fadama II was not abruptly closed and FGN set up different team to look at
Fadama III while NFDO continued with Fadama II.
Para 6.2 Page 33: “However there is insufficient evidence that the
potentially negative environmental effects of the subprojects implemented
through Fadama II were mitigated. Rather, project documentation points
to neglect of some of the key aspects of the environmental mitigation
plan…” it should be noted that ESMPs were properly prepared, implemented
and supervised.
Para 6.3 Page 33: “The project required soil monitoring during the third
and fifth year of the project cycle. According to the Mid-term review,
undertaken in 2007, these monitoring activities were not carried out.” …
soil monitoring activities were conducted after midterm by the Federal
Department of Land Resources, water loggers were constructed and installed in
all the participating State to monitor water quality and ground water level.
Para 6.4 Page 34: “However, since only a fraction of the Fadama User
Groups (12% by2007) had access to the advisory services component of the
project, it is not clear how the remaining 88% of users technically
implemented the pest management plan in their subproject areas. The ICR
does not provide any assessment of the project’s compliance with this
operational policy.” PMP trainings were conducted for all Groups in the
participating States, for instance cleared TOR for such training in Lagos State
is hereby attached as annex 6. Also, social analysis was undertaken under the
EIA of the Project.

RATINGS
Outcome: The rating should have been at least satisfactory. Because as
observed by IEG team the objectives were highly relevant, the approach of the
CDD is substantially relevant, while progress against the first objective of the
PDO substantial. However, empowerment of local community cannot be said
to be modest, because the IEG team seems not to adequate understanding of the
empowerment as it relates to the Project. The concept of empowerment under
the Project is for the people to come together to identify their needs, prioritise
them and be able to prepare their development plan, implement and monitor it.
Specifically an analysis of how the LDPs were prepared and implemented using
the PRA tool would have provided the IEG team an insight into the extent to
which the beneficiaries were empowered. In addition, the communities for the
first time have been given a voice through the implementation as they could
now question local authorities over their developmental issues. Women also,
were observed to be holding public positions, participating in community affairs
and decision making. There is also the linking of communities to rural banking;
saving and team culture was enhanced by the Project. Furthermore, as a result
of empowerment of the Project some community members were appointed into
sensitive Government positions, for instance, In Adamawa State, a leader of a
vulnerable group was appointed as Special Assistant to the Governor, a position
he is holding till today. As part of the expressed capacities of the empowered
communities under the Project some state Governments such States include
Niger, Ogun and Imo have adopted the Fadama approach in rural development.

Borrower: Given the pioneering efforts of Fadama II as the first productive
CDD Project in Nigeria with the observed impact as attested by the IEG report
5 years after Project closure, the IEG team is hereby invited to review the
ratings of the Project based on the aforementioned comments and clarifications
from moderately satisfactory to at least satisfactory.
