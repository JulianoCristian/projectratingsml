"Ratings for the Second National Fadama\n            Development Project for Nigeria were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the Fadama program is\n            illustrative of the risks that are attendant in neglecting\n            social analysis in technical work streams. The\n            project's first phase contributed to conflict between\n            natural resource users groups by financing activities that\n            expanded livelihood benefits to one user group at the\n            expense of others. The sustainability of community-based\n            initiatives depends crucially on an enabling institutional\n            environment, which requires government commitment, and on\n            accountability of leaders to their community to avoid\n            'supply-driven demand-driven' development.\n            Programs designed to change behavior need to be grounded in\n            a deep understanding of context; they need to be willing to\n            engage in a study of what motivates people. Programs\n            implemented at scale should include a sensitive design that\n            takes into account the different cultural, linguistic and\n            ethnic characteristics of the targeted population. Programs\n            designed to change behavior also require observational and\n            qualitative indicators that in turn, require capacity\n            building and implementation support to tweak project\n            assumptions and project adjust design in real time."}, "docdt": "2014-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
