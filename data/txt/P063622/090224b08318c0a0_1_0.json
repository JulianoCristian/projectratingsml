The land is fertile and\n            water is easily accessible, but the Fadamas have also been\n            the scene of conflict among farmers, fishermen, and\n            pastoralists who are vying for land, water, and grazing\n            resources. The Fadama II project introduced, Local\n            Development Plans (LDP) which brought resource user groups\n            together in identifying the development priorities of their\n            respective communities and translating these priorities into\n            investment. Through community empowerment, participatory\n            development planning and support for demand-driven\n            productive investments in farm and nonfarm activities,\n            Nigeria has boosted incomes for over 3 million farm families\n            by 63 percent."}, "docdt": "2010-09-22T08:22:00Z"}
