The key lessons learned are: 1) Financial\n            intermediary lending is likely to fail, if implemented\n            before basic macroeconomic and structural reforms are firmly\n            in place. 2) Projects relying on planned reforms or on the\n            impact of jointly implemented projects are built on shaky\n            ground. 3) The impact of technical assistance should not be\n            over-estimated. 4) The lack of financially strong, well\n            managed and supervised banks, able to assess and manage\n            risks, is a problem impossible to resolve in the short run;\n            during the life time of a credit line project. 5) Where\n            institutional weaknesses are systemic, any efforts to\n            strengthen individual institutions may be futile. 6) Credit\n            line operations require deeper appraisal and early\n            contracting of a large number of well performing financial\n            intermediaries. 7) Credit line projects require fully\n            committed and participating counterpart institutions. 8) If\n            the design of a project turns out not to fit a given\n            situation, the project should be redesigned or canceled as\n            quickly as possible."}, "docdt": "1998-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
