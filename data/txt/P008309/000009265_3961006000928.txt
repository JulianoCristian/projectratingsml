MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THIE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA
FOR THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Bulgaria for US$50 million
equivalent. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 17 years'
maturity, including a four-year grace period, and would help finance the
Agricultural Development Project.
2.          Country and Sectoral Bagkaround.  Since the economic reform program
was initiated in February 1991, a major objective of the Government of Bulgaria
has been to create a market-oriented agriculture based on private ownership of
land and privatized input supply, processing and marketing sectors.   This
objective is consistent with the broad goals of a reform aimed at reallocating
resources in line with comparative advantage and developing an internationally
competitive economy.   To reverse economic decline, restrictive monetary and
fiscal policies, including sharply higher interest rates, were adopted and
combined with a tight incomes policy and a market-based floating exchange rate.
Important structural and institutional reforms were initiated and preliminary
agreements with foreign official and commercial creditors on the restructuring
of foreign debt were reached in 1993.
3.          Delays in policies promoting structural adjustment threaten to
undermine macroeconomic stability and prospects for economic growth. The budget
deficit reached 9% of GDP and inflation remained at about 70% in 1993. There has
been substantial progress in private sector development through restitution of
small businesses, urban property and agricultural land.   However, delays in
privatization and banking reform, and the adverse impact of the embargo against
the former Yugoslavia have increased pressure on the budget and the balance of
payments.   The financial losses of state-owned enterprises continue to grow
rapidly and only a few have been privatized. During 1993, the economy declined
by about 3% and unemployment increased to about 15.5% by year's end.
4.          Agricultural GDP declined by about 3% in 1993 partly due to ongoing
decollectivization and land reform and partly due to a severe drought. This
follows a decline of 7.7% in 1992. However, the private sector has performed
better than expected by official forecasts and its share in agricultural
production increased to more than 50% by 1993. Agriculture and agroindustries
employ about 16% of the labor force, contribute 20% of GDP and account for 22%
of exports. The total land area of Bulgaria is 11.1 million ha, of which about
4.7 million ha is cultivated and 1.5 million is used for pastures and meadows.
Agriculture is adjusting to the emerging market environment and is becoming more
efficient and competitive. While the supply of food on the domestic market and
food exports improved considerably, farm employment has been reduced by more than
30%, consumption of inputs has declined to more efficient levels, farm
inventories were reduced, livestock numbers declined, adjusting to market demand,
and new private agricultural enterprises are being established. However, the
reform process is still incomplete, and unlocking Bulgaria's considerable
agricultural potential requires continued progress in four key strategic areas:
(i) restoration of private property rights in agriculture and the agro-processing
chain; (ii) further liberalization of prices and trade; (iii) promotion of a
sustainable finance and credit system; and (iv) strengthened institutional
support for private agriculture.



- 2 -
5,          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Since becoming a Bank member in
September 1990, Bulgaria has looked to the Bank for assistance in the
transformation and revival of its economy. In response, the Bank has prepared
a country assistance strategy focusing on: (a) support for the design and
implementation of market reforms and mitigation of the impact of reforms on the
poor through an adequate social safety net, through adjustment operations and
technical assistance; (b) the restoration of creditworthiness by aiding in a debt
reduction deal with the country's commercial and official creditors ar.d through
aid coordination; and (c) the generation of an adequate supply response from the
productive sectors by promoting the private sector and by modernization of
Bulgaria's infrastructure through investment operations. The presposed project
is consistent with the most recent country assistance strategy (CAS), presented
to the Board on March 9, 1993. One of the key CAS objectives is to stimulate a
supply response from private enterprises through lines of credit to agricultural
and industrial sectors. The centerpiece of the Bank's initial activities in
Bulgaria was the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) (Ln.3397-BUL) approved in August
1991. The second tranche of the SAL was released in March 1994.
6.          A basic rationale for the proposed project,  the Bank's first
operation in the agricultural sector, is to help mobilize medium- and long-term
credit for private sector needs generated by the transition.   The country's
foreign debt moratorium has limited access to international financial markets and
reduced the availability of foreign exchange credits. This situation is likely
to persist even after the recent preliminary agreements with foreign creditors,
since it will take time to reestablish Bulgaria's creditworthiness and to improve
access to international financial markets. The project would provide some relief
for the agricultural sector while debt restructuring is arranged, and supply
medium- and long-term funds to support growing private activity in the sector and
begin the process of strengthening financial institutions involved in market-
oriented rural credit. Lessons learned from OED performance audits for similar
projects have been incorporated in project design with emphasis, in particular,
on financial discipline of participants and quality preparation of sub-loans.
7.          The proposed project is considered the most suitable for conditions
now prevailing in Bulgarian agriculture. It is expected that private investors
would respond relatively quickly to the opportunities created by the reforms.
Public investments would need to be targeted to areas with strong "public good"
justification and only to the highest priorities, because of limited Government
resources and difficulties in restructuring of public sector organizations. As
the transition in agriculture proceeds and the most pressing credit requirements
are met, future Bank support for agricultural infrastructure (e.g., irrigation
rehabilitation) and support services (e.g., research, extension), may be
warranted.
8.          Proiect Obiectives.   The project aims to improve access of the
private sector to medium- and long-term credit for investments in primary
agriculture and agribusiness. Medium- and long-term foreign exchange resources
would be made available through Bank-approved participating financial
intermediaries to finance imports of farm machinery and other equipment. The
project would help to strengthen the capacity of PFIs for appraisal and
supervision of investment projects in agriculture and agribusiness.
9.          Proiect Components.   The proposed project would consist of two
components: (a) investment credits (US$47.0 million equivalent) for the financing
of medium- and long-term sub-loans exclusively for eligible private investments.
These would finance imports of fixed and movable assets and associated permanent
worinow caot%4-alI:~ for   fianci4allv.  andA   a -nmAA.l  v;.. .nv.4un -in- --4--4   .



agriculture, agribusiness and related activities such as transport, trade,
handicrafts,  rural tourism,  and associated services;  and (b) institutional
development to PFIs that would include (i) TA to strengthen their capacity in the
appraisal and supervision of sub-loans by training to be financed by grants
(US$600,000 equivalent); and (ii) the financing of part of PFI equipment needs
from project proceeds (US$3.0 million equivalent).
10.         Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements with the Government
were reached regarding:
A.    Loan Covenant.   The Government would phase out the
existing short-term farm credit interest subsidy
programs by December 31, 1996 according to the following
schedule: (a) the maximum contribution by the Government
to interest payments due by the farm credit recipients
to the banking institutions would be set at half the BNB
basic rate for short-term farm credits granted on of
after JanQary 1, 1995 and one-thirds of the BNB basic
rate for short-term farm credits granted on or after
January 1, 1996; and (b) the state budget amount for the
farm credit interest subsidy program would be limited to
Leva 1.5 billion for 1995 and Leva 1.5 billion for 1996.
B.    Conditions of Loan Effectiveness.  (a) the Government
would sign Subsidiary Loan Agreements, satisfactory to
the Bank, with, at least, two eligible PFIs; and (b) the
boards of directors of PFIs would adopt Policy
Statements and Corporate Strategy Statements, agreed
with the Bank.
C.    Other Agreements.  (a) the Government would further
liberalize agricultural prices and trade. Specifically,
it would lift the export ban on major food and feed
grains and, over time, phase out export taxes on these
products; (b) the Government would agree to an annual
policy review related to progress in agricultural price,
trade, and lending policies with the Bank; (c) PFIs
would participate in the staff training and systems
installation for project appraisal and supervision; and
(d) PFIs would ensure that sub-project appraisals be
undertaken in accordance with appropriate environmental
standards satisiactory to the Bank.
11.         Environmental Asnects. All sub-borrowers under the proposed project
would be required to comply with environmental protection regulations of the
country, acceptable to the Bank.  In appraising sub-projects, the PFIs would
ensure that sub-borrowers have received clearance from the relevant regulmtory
agencies regarding the environmental impact of their investments. Environmental
agencies in Bulgaria, while relatively new and inexperienced, are being
strengthened. Sub-borrowers would be required to submit evidence of clearance
as part of standard sub-loan processing. The PFIs would review compliance with
environmental regulations and requirements of sub-projects in the course of
normal sub-project supervision. The PFIs would report and coordinate regularly
with the environmental regulators, who are ultimately responsible for monitoring



- 4 -
compliance.   This approach to environmental protection by the PFIs would be
reflected in their policy and corporate strategy statements to be agreed with the
Bank.
12.         Benefits.  The project would improve credit supplies to support the
transition of agriculture to a market ecornmy and strengthen key financial
institutions necessary for sustained development of the sector. Improved access
to credit would help stimulate private farming, establish private agricultural
cooperatives, and foster privatization of agro-processing enterprises.   The
establishment  of  new businesses  would  contribute  to  a more  competitive
environment, with benefits to both producers and consumers.  New investments
consistent with market forces are expected to increase efficiency of production,
improve the volume and quality of the domestic food supply, expand exports and
improve incomes for newly-independent farmers and entrepreneurs.   Increased
economic activity would generate tax revenue to the Government and emphasis on
institutional strengthening would facilitate long-term sustainability of market-
oriented banking operations.    The project would also  contribute  to the
development of the banking sector by introducing medium- and long-term fixed-
rate instruments and obliging BNB to manage currency and interest rate risk and
the PFIs to gain experience with foreign currency lending.
13.         Risks.  Perceived project risks are of several types.  The major
economic risk is the possibility of macroeconomic destabilization which would
undermine the reform program and adversely affect the agriculture sector and the
demand for credit. Risks specific to agriculture includet (i) delays in the
implementation of the Land Law; (ii) delays in the process of decollectivization
and privatization; and (iii) reversals and/or delays in moving toward more
liberal agricultural price and trade policies.   They will be addressed by
implementation assistance and progress monitoring. The main proiect risk is that
sub-borrowers will fail to repay their loans in full and on time because of
inadequate  preparation  and  supervision  of  sub-projects,  macroeconomic
destabilization, adverse price developments, lack of credit discipline, etc.
This risk will be addressed bys (i) provision of professional expertise and
technical assistance to the PFIs to ensure high quality appraisals; (ii) close
supervision by the Bank; and (iii) monitoring of PYle by BNB. A related risk is
that GOB would continue to emphasize farm credit subsidies and thus ma'-s project
funds less competitive. This risk is being addressed by conditional; ies under
the project. There is also a risk that Prls may have d,.fficulty in identifying
groups of sub-borrowers among Primarv Producers able to prepare sub-loan
applications of a size large enough to be of interest to the PFIs. Political and
economic uncertainties in Bulgaria are likely to remain significant. To help
contain risks, the project would be subject to a "project launch workshop* early
In the period, a comprehensive "mid-term review", and close supervision.
14.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the loan.
