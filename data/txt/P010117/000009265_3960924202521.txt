PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NEPAL
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 772-NEP)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Education
Project in Nepal, for which an IDA Credit was extended to the Kingdom of
Nepal in April 1978.    The  Credit  became  effective  in  July 1978.  The
estimated total cost of the project was US$7.82 million of which US$5.70
million was covered  by  the  Credit.    The  Credit  Account was closed on
September 30, 1986 and the undisbursed balance of US$1.01 million was
cancelled.
This report was prepared by a UNESCO mission for the Goversiment of
Nepal under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement concluded between UNESCO
and the World Bank.    At  the  invitation  of  the Government, the missiou
composed of Messrs. G. Dolbnin, technical educator (mission coordinator),
and L. Secco, architect, visited Nepal from June 14-28, 1986. The mission
met with  the  appropriate   authorities,   particularly  in  the  project
implementation unit and the  project  institute.   The mission also visited
Washington,  D.C.  and  reviewed   all   relevant   project  files  at  IDA
headquarters. This PCR is therefore based on: (i) the discussions held
and data received by the mission in Nepal; and (ii) file research conducted
at IDA headquarters and discussions with relevant IDA staff. Nevertheless,
the conclusions of the report are based on the judgements of the mission.
The valuable assistance  provided by the Government, particularly
the project implementation unit staff, in the preparation of the report is
gratefully acknowledged.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies for comments in January 1988. No comments
were received.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE COMPETION REPORT
NEPAL
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 772-NEP)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project, the first IDA-assisted education project in Nepal, was
the result of a lengthy and intensive preparation effort spanning three years
and involving 65 staff weeks of UNESCO/IDA input. The project was appraised
in November 1977 and a credit of US$  5.7 million  equivalent was  approved in
February 1978 to meet 73Z of the estimated total costs of US$ 7.82 million.
The remaining US$ 2.12 was to be financed in roughly equal proportions by
ODM/UK  and  the  Government.    It was anticipated that the project would be
completed by September 1982.
Obiectives and Prolect Content
The need to strengthen the education system became manifest during
the early 1970s when the implementation of basic infrastructural development
projects  waS  hampered  by  a  shortage  of  trained  manpower, particularly
engineering  technicians.    The  Fifth  Plan  (1976-80) assigned considerable.
importance to the development of technical education, and the project
supported this objective by strengthening the Pulchovk c&ipus of the Institute
of Engineering (IOE)  of  Tribhuvan  University.    Specifically,  the project
sought tot (a) Improve the quality and expand the existing teaching programs
at the certificate level (grades 11-12), allowing for an eventual enrollment
of 1,200 (including 200 enrolled in a certificate level remedial course) by
1983; and (b) establish. a civil engineering program at the diploma level
(grades 13-15) for 430 students.
The Credit was to finance the construction and equipping of physical
facilities--including  classrooms,  laboratories,  a  workshop  and  library,
dormitories and  staff housing.   UK/ODA  would finance  the staff development
program and provide technical assistance for developing teaching programs and
materials  and  strengthening  administrative  practices.    Special covenants
included the preparation of three feasibility studies, development of a
monitoring and evaluation system, establishment of a maintenance and repair
workshop, and adoption of policies on student admissions and student/teacher
ratios appropriate to project objectives. A Project Implementation Unit was
established in the IOE, with the Dean acting as Project Director.
Implementation Experience
In the early 19809, the Borrower began to introduce substantive
changes  to   the  university   system, eventually   expanding  the  two-year
certificate program to three years and replacing the diploma by a degree
program. These changes were introduced after the commencement of physical
implementation and after considerable work had be undertaken to improve tho
existing programs.  During  this time,  IDA did not send a technical educator



- vi -
Into the field to determine the degree to which original project objectives
were being compromised and to suggest ways of minimizing adverse consequences
of the changes.    Thus,  the  project  was  executed  basically  as designedt
buildings were built and equipped, curricula developed, and teaching materials
procured. The staff development program was underutilized, in part because It
ov.rlapped with a similar program being funded by ILO/UNDP.
Implementation took twice as long as anticipated, and the Closing
Date was postponed twice, to September 1985. Final disbursement was made six
months later, at which time USS 1.01 million equivalent (or 182 of the Credit
proceeds) was cancelled. The delays resulted mainly from the Inexperience of
the local contractor and of the implementation unit, whose director changed
four times owing to  the rotation  of the  deanship.   Despite the  delays and
attendant cost increases, the total project costs were some 172 below
appriisal estimates owing to lower costs than had been anticipated at
appraisal  and   some  reduction   to  the  staff  development  and  equipment
components.
Results
Despite its relatively successful implementation, the project has
not achieved its objectives of improving the quality of engineering programs
or meeting manpcwer needs. The physical facilities and equipment provided are
underutilized because they do not match current needs and becausa certain
program areas remain weak.   Attention  to  staff  development,  divorced from
comprehensive staff development and remuneration policies, proved too feeble.
Less than 702 of the approved staff positions have been filled, and. the
laboratory technician position proposed at appraisal has not come into being.
Although the number of staff holding advanced degrees has increased, their
proportions have declined, contributing to the overall deterioration of the.
calibre of the staff. Measures to improve certificate level education by
Increasing the time devoted to practical activities and introducing a remedial
program were not introduced, and internal efficiency remains poor. Covenants
concerning admissions  policies and  student/teacher ratios  were not complied
with, and academic regulations remain insufficiently rigorous and haphazardly
enforced.    Enrollments  and  output  are below appraisal estimates.  Despite
these poor results, the monitoring and evaluation system is functioning, and
tracer studies indicate that those who have graduated from the Pulchowk campus
do find ready employment and perform to the satisfaction of their employers.
Sustainabilitv
Given  that  project  objectives   concerning  specific  engineering
programs were derailed during implementation, the issue of the sustainability
of their benefits is moot, and it is premature to assess the impact and
functioning  of  the  successor  programs.    However,  four  observations are
possible which do not auger well for educational quality in the longer term.
First, the deletion of the maintenance workshops included under the project,
the  insufficient  budgets  for maintenance  and  repair  of   buildings  and
equipment, and the lack of laboratory technicians to perform the maintenance
function point toward rapid deterioration  of  the  physical  plart.   Second,
persistent problems in recruiting and maintaining high calibre staff with both



- vii -
pedagogic and Industrial experlenco will be roflected sooner or later in the
quality  of  Instruction  provided.   Third, a weak administrative environment
will contributo to poor performance and low morale for both staff and
students.   Finally, the  need to  Insure entrants of a certain calibre, which
the remedial component was to address, has been further undermined by the
remowal of science as a compulsory subject In secondary education.
Findings and Lessons
The proj3et aimed to address imediate manpower neods by trying to
develop a university. As such,  It attempted  too much.   It  assumed, in the
*vent Incorrectly, that recently-established cortificate and diploma programs
would remain the basic building blocks of the university system.   It *ssumed,
also Incorrectly, that adequate policies governing staffing, administration
and student admissions would be implemented.   It  did not  take Into adequate
consideration the Implications of developing university programs, either In
meeting  future  manpower needs  or  in  Institutional  development   of  the
university Itself. Thit absense of a broader manpower development perspective
with a longer time horizon was the undoing of the  project and  casts doubt on
the sustainability of the inputs provided. Had the project focused on crash
training programs to address labor needs or on comprehensive univorsity
development placed in the context of a specific and agreed development plan,
results might have been better.
Other general lessons or points of interest include:
(a) the need to secure precise and early agreement on the operating
policies of autonomous higher education institutions on the programs,
their lnternal efficiency and external productivity, where these are
essential to the achievement of project objectives;
(b) where new positions are being created, such as the laboratory
technicians, the need to assure some fit between the proposal and
existing personnel structures;
(c) where innovations are being introduced or policy changes attempted,
as in requiring industrial experience for teachers and students, the need
to  insure   agreement  by  all parties  and  develop  a  timetable  for
Implementation;
(d) the need to staff supervision missions appropriately.

CHAPTER I
PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Setting
1.01    Nepal has one of the lowest per capita ikicomes in the world - only
US$170 (1983). A low adult literacy rate (19%) - the lowest in South Asia,
low average life expectancy (46 years) and high infant mortality (about 150
per thousand) indicate the extent of deprivation of basic needs.
1.02    The agricultural sector contributes about 60 per cent of GDP, 75
per cent of exports and 90 per cent of employment; industrial activity accounts
for about 10 per cent of GDP, and services make up the remeining 30 per
cent. During the 1982/83-1984/85 period, Nepal achieved an annuak real
GDP growth rate of 2.4 per cent (against an annual average population growth
of 2.7 per cent), wit'i the agricultural sector growing at 2.5 per cent and
the non-agricultural sectors at 3.4 per cent.
1.03    The small industrial sector comprises consumer goods (footwear,
textiles, processed foods), construction materials and simple *Issembly items.
Larger-scale manufacturing is undertaken by public enterp. -es in or near
Kathmandu Valley. Private investment is concentrated in small and cottage
industries. Outside Kathmandu, industrial production occurs almost exclusively
in cottage industries which service the rural subsistence economy, providing
wool and cotton handloom textiles, food products, forest-based and simple
metal products.
1.04    At the time of appraisal, national development efforts were directed
toward the establishment of basic infrastructure, (e.g. irrigation, power,
transportation, communications) and supporting key related institutions (e.g.
agricultural extension and research, financial institutions, trading corporations,
national construction  company, industrial estates).  Implementation  of
development projects, however, was hampered by: (a) difficult topographical
conditions; (b) unreliable supplies of basic raw materials and building materils;
and (c) a shortage of qualified administrative, supervisory, and technical
manpower, particularly civil engineers, at all levels.
Sector Setting
1.05    The acute manpower shortages being experienced in technical fields
reflect the historical neglect in developing Nepalese education. At the end
of the Rana regime (1951), which opposed schooling of the general population,
only 10,000 children were in school, less than 1 per cent of the school age
population. Fewer than 2 per cent of the population wereV}iterate. From
the early 1950s onwards education expanded at a rapid rate-. By the early
1970s a number of serious shortcomings became clear, low rate of participation
of women, low quality of teachers, and the inadequacy of attention to training
persons in the kinds of technical skills most needed by the country.
1/     By 1984/85, Nepal achieved a total primary school enrollment ratio
of about 80 per cent and secondary school enrollment ratio of about
20 per cent.



-2 -
1.06   in 1976, only 0.5 per cent of the labour force (or 25,000 persons),
were categorized as "professional, technical and related workers", of whom
23,000 were engaged in service sectors (government, community or personal).
There were indicators of deficiencies in particular skills. Some 80 posts tor
senior engineering technicians in the major government departments concerned
with development projects were vacant. In 1975 almost all senior technicians
(about 780) had been trained abroad, since senior technician (diploma) courses
were not available locally. At the time of appraisal It was estimated that
for the Fifth Economic Development Plan (1976-1980) the additional
requirements for senior technicians (diploma level) would be 1,100, and for
junior technicians (certificate level), 2,170.
1.08   In 1971, the Government introduced the New Education System
Plan (NESP) which aimed at enlarging access to basic education and relating
education more closely to the needs of development. AU post-secondary
education was assigned to Tribhuvan University and divided into three segments:
certificate (grades 11-12); diploma (grades 13-14); and degree (grades 15-16).
1.09    The Institute of Xngineering (IOE), established in 1971, became
responsible for providing or supervising technical/vocational training at all
levels. At the time of appraisal, the principal activity of the IOE was the
training of junior technicians at certificate level. The bulk of this training
was concentrated at its 1,000 place central campus at Pulchowk (near
Kathmandu). Excelent employment prospects for graduates had contributed
to strong competition for admission. However, inadequate preparation of
the entering students in mathematics, science and language, poor training
facilities, and a lack of practical work in the curriculum contributed to the
low examination pass rates in the certificate programme. No diploma level
programme In engineering existed.
,he Project
1.10    The project was prepared by the Government of Nepal with the
assistance of Unesco in July/August 1976. It was appraised in November
1977. The Development Credit Agreement was signed on 14 April 1978, and
the Credit became effective on 11 July 1978.
1.11    Project Objectives. Through the provision of physical facilities
staf. training and specialist services, the project aimed at:.
(a)    improving the quality of and expanding the existing teaching
programmes at the certificate level (grades 11-12); and
(b)    estyplishing a programme in civil engineering at the diploma
level (grades 13-15)- for 430 students.
1.12    Project Description. The project consisted of the following parts:
Part A - Physical Facilities
(i)    site development, construction of about 14,000 square meters
and equipping of physical facilities for the enrollment of about 1,000 students
at the certificate level, about 200 students for the certificate level remedial
1/ The appraisal mission observed that diploma courses required an extra
year beyond the usual two. Moreover, additional periods in mathematics
and science were suggested because of the low quality of entering students.

course and about 430 students at the diploma level. This programme of
construction and equipment comprised: (a) 15 additional classrooms/lecture
theatres, 22 laboratories, 4 drawing rooms, I architect's studio, 1 workshop,
1 library and a canteen/dining hall; (b) teaching equipment and materials
(books and journals); (c) boarding facilities for 560 students from all regions
outside the Kathmandu Valley (40% of total student places); and (d) staff
houses for 30 staff (as an incentive to attract and retain qualified senior
staff) to accommod0e administration department heads and half of the diploma
level teaching staff-.
(ii) the preparation of future education projects, including
architectural and other technical drawings and equipment and furniture lists.
Part B - The establishment of about 53.5 man-years of a staff training
programme including:
(i)    overseas fellowships for teaching staff at diploma and
certificate levels, focussing on curriculum development, teaching methods
and, in appropriate cases, the acquisition of industrial experience; and
(ii)   study tours for administrative staff to similar institutions
in developing and developed countries.
Part C - The carrying out of the following:
(i)    evaluation and development of teaching programmes with
regard to skill requirements of development projects in Nepal;
(ii)    preparation of detailed teaching manuals; and
(iii)   training of staff for effective teaching and administration.
1.13    The project included some 16.5 man-years of services of expatriate
specialists who were expected to work in conjunction with Nepalese
counterparts, assisting in the procurement, installation and operation of
equipment under Part A above and in the achievement of objectives under
Parts B and C. Financing out of Credit proceeds was included only for Part A
and the UK Government was expected to supply technical assistance for Parts B
and C. In addition, the 13orrower was expected to undertake three feasibility
studies on (i) primary education, with special reference to female participation
and retention rates; (ii) trade level skils preparation of a plan to rationalise
trade training on a national basis; and (iii) the need for a trade and certificate
level enRneering institute in the Western Development Region. Outside
sources of funding were to be sought for helping with these studies. The
Government and IDA agreed as well that the Government would establish
a monitoring and evaluation system covering the certificate and diploma
courses at IOE.
1/      This description is at variance with the appraisal report, which in
paragraph 3.02 gave the following details of the construction
programme: (a( buildings: 15 additional classrooms/lecture theatres,
18 laboratories, I workshop, I library and a canteen/dining hall would
be constructed and furnished; ... However, as can be seen in paragraph
2.07 of this report, the appraisal report was in error.



CHAPTER U
PROJECT IMPLEMMiTATION
Overview
2.01   The project was originally scheduled to be completed in four years
but took eight. The Closing Date was postponed twice, from 30 September
1983 to 30 September 1985. Civil works were delayed for about three years
from the original deadline, mainly because of difficulties experienced by
the building contractor, a local construction company. At the time of the
completion mission, about 95 per cent of the physical facilities proposed
at appraisal had been completed, and related equipment installed. The
technical assistance programme has been provided (as expected) as a grant
by the UK. However, while all specialist services were provided, the staff
training programme was not fully implemented. (see Implementation Chart
in Annex 11.01)
ProJect Manairement
2.02   A  Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was established at the IOE
Pulchowk Campus even before Credit Signature in April 1978, comprising:
(i) a project director who was the Dean of the IOE; (ii) a project coordinator;
(iii) a project architect; (iv) a project engineer; (v) a procurement officer;
(vi) an education officer; and (vii) an accounts officer.
2.03   The IOE Dean changed every three years and this entailed other
changes in the PIU staff. Throughout the implementation period there were
four directors,. three coordinators, three educators and three accounts officers,
as shown in Table 2.1 below.
Table 2.1

Thus there was some lack of coherence during implementation as well as
difficulties in preparing well-organized records on educational and architectural
indicators and accounting data.

Professional Services and Building Design
2.04    A local consultant architectural firm  was appointed on time. They
were responsible for the architectural design of the project physical facilities
and encountered difficulties at the beginning. They obtair.ed substantial advice
from Bank supervision missions on simplifying designs, improving the orientation
of buildings, space allocation, providing adequate storage areas in laboratories,
and so on. The completion mission noted that, in general, the physical facilities
had been satisfactorily designed. Some problems were noted, however, as follows:
(a)    corridors in classroom blocks are too narrow (about two meters
of usable space);
(b)    the area per student place in classrooms is generous (two square
meters per place instead of the more usual 1.5 square meters) and;
(c)    several laboratories, such as mechanics and building sciences,
have insufficient space (3.7 square meters per place instead of seven or more
square meters which is usual). It is also noted that the percentage of circulation
over net areas in academic buildings has been reducecr from an acceptable
standard of 33 per cent suggested at appraisal to 18 per cent, while in the hostels
it has been increased from 37 per cent to an unacceptably high 75 per cent
(Annexes 11.02 to 11.06).
Civil Works and Maintenance
2.05    The contract for civil works was awarded to a local firm. Civil works
were completed four years later than planned at appraisal for the following
reasons:
(a)    Problems of coordination among electrical contractors, civil
work contractors and PIU staff.
(b)    Poor -nanagement and limited experience and capacity of
the building contractor responsible for the major part of project civil works.
(c)    Shortage of basic materials (timber, cement, pipes for water
distribution).
(d)    Slowness of the PIU and consultant architects in reviewing
and taking decisions on extra work requirements.
2.06    Structurally, the quality of buildings and roads is acceptable. The
following problems exist regarding the finish of the work: deficient drainage
on hostel balconies and flats, poor quality of doors and windows, poorly finished
structural joints and bad distribution of light fixtures. Glass panes on the upper
part of the cafeteria, that had been cracked as a result of structural roof
movements, had not yet been removed at the time of the completion mission,
making the cafeteria unusable. Kitchen equipment, not included in the project,
had still not been acquired.
2.07    The number of rooms planned at appraisal was almost achieved (21
laboratories instead of 22, deletion of maintenance workshops and architect's
studio) as shown in Annexes 11.02 to 11.05. The additional capacity is
approximately equal to the 854 new places foreseen at appraisal (Annex 11.05).



-7-
2.08    However, the change in educational objectives (paragraphs 4.03 and
4.04) resulted in an inetficient use of the physical facilities. Educational
programmes and curricula do not resemble those proposed at the time of appraisal
for which the training facilities were established. Furthermore, the Institute
has not yet achieved its enrolment targets. Utilisation rates at the time of
the completion visit were more than 90 per cent for classrooms but very low
(ranging from  3.5 per cent to 11.9 per cent) for laboratories (Annexes IV.01
and N.02). This situation is a result of the lower share of practical activities
in the curriculum (less than 25 per cent instead of the foreseen 50 per cent).
In addition, the construction of new  laboratories for radio electronics,
electro-engineering and electricity was deleted and two science laboratories
were added. At the time of completion, some other laboratories (structures,
materials, public health, soil mechanics, and building construction) had not
as yet begun to be used.
2.09    The budget for maintenance and repair of buildings and equipment
(excluding vehicles) comprises only 0.6 per cent of the operating expenses of
the campus (Annex 11-09). This low level of provisioni does not augur well for
sustained usefulness of physical plant.
Eauipment
2.10    The equipment, which was procured in line with appraisal expectations,
Is adequate for the purpose of certificate and diploma curricula but it is not
entirely suited to the degree course which has replaced the diploma course.
Equipment for the laboratories for radio electronics, electro-engineering and
electricity was deleted from the project and supplied instead by ILO in existing
buildings. Utilization of equipment is low, since the curricula specify few
laboratory and workshop periods and students regularly fail to attend these
classes.
Furniture
2.11    Furniture has been acquired as proposed at appraisal. The quality
of design and workmanship of furniture for the laboratories and library is good,
but the classroom and office furniture is too rigid and heavy. Mlost of the stooli
procured for laboratories and workshops have been transferred to classrooms
or other rooms of the Institute.
Technical Assistance
2.12    Staff Training. The project originally included 642 man-months of
a staff training programme and about 198 man-months of expatriate specialist
services. As envisaged at the time of appraisal, these services have been financed
as a grant by the Government of the United Kingdom and provided by a College
of Technology in Scotland.
2.13    The staff training programme in the United Kingdom  consisted of:
(i) 6-8 month courses of technical teacher training (including mathematics and
science); (ii) study tours for senior administrators of the IOE; (iii) post graduate
fellowships for advanced degree studies for selected teachers; and (iv) 3-6 month
courses for laboratory technicians, specialized courses for teachers of English,
the Ubrarian, and some other staff (guidance officer, examination officer, etc.).
2.14    The mission found that only 62 per cent of the man-months included
for staff training were utilized. As shown in Annex 11.07, the only item fully
implemented was the post-graduate fellowship programme - in this case, the
targets of persons and man-months were exceeded. Only between 29 and 76
per cent of the man-months planned for other programmes was actually utilized.



-8 -
2.15    The main reasons for the shortfall are: (a) the training programme
overlapped with that of a ILO/UNDP project which provided 467.5 man-months
of fellowships for the IOE staff, including 180 man-months of fellowships in
similar subject areas (1982-1986); (b) there were difficulties in selecting
laboratory technician staff for training because the Nepal University Service
Comnmission does not recognise the position of technicians and has not provided
posts for them at a level commensurate with the required training, and (c) IOE
officials were disenchanted with the way in which the CoUege handled the
fellowship programme and so reduced the duration of some fellowships.
2.16    Expert Services. Performance in the specialist services programme
as far as content and duration are concerned, was relatively good. These services
were provided in two phases. During the first phase, specialists from the
collaborating CoUege provided assistance on curriculum design, equipment
identification and specification, laboratory layout and service requirements,
through a series of short assignments in Nepal together with some detailed
work in the United Kingdom. The second phase concentrated on course and
laboratory development, and in-service training of staff. On the whole, 167
man-months have been spent in Nepal, and 31 man-months in the United Kingdom.
2.17    Under the programme, more than thirty subject reports for laboratory
work were prepared for both certificate and diploma courses. However, most
of these manuals are not in use because of changes in the curriculum - the diploma
course being changed into a degree course, and the certificate level course,
for which a 2.5 year programme was prepared, being changed into a three-year
course.
Teaching Materials and Books
2.18    During project implementation, 11,424 books were ordered under Credit
financing. However, at the time of the completion mission, the IOE had received
only 9,173 books (Annex 11.08); further deliveries were expected. Some suppliers
failed to deliver the books in time or did not deliver them at all. At the time
of completion, about 18,000 books and journals were available in the IOE library.
A shortage of text-books for the certificate level courses stil exists and an
estimated 60 per cent increase is required in the number of books. For the
degree course, there are only five reference books for each subject, which is
much below requirements.
Feasibility Studies
2.19    The three feasibility studies (on primary education, trade skills and
an engineering institute - paragraph 1.13) have been undertaken. The study
on the development of a regional technical institute in the Western Development
Region of Nepal undertaken by IOE with assistance from Paisley CoUege (ULK)
was completed in 1980. The study on the future educational development in
respect of primary education was undertaken by Unesco substantially completed
in 1979 and finalized in 1983. Both these studies haviprovided esfntial inputs
in the identification of components for the Second- and Third- Education
Projects in Nepal. The third study on rural skill training in Nepal was undertaken
in 1979 by an ODA expert; however, its findings were considered by IDA to
be inconclusive, and it has never been finalized.
Covenants
2.20    All covenants have been satisfactorily fulfilled with three exceptions:
1/      Approved by IDA in December 1981.
2/      Approved by IDA in April 1984.



-9 -
(i) According to one covenant (section 3.08), the Borrower was supposed
to establish a maintenance and repair workshop, with properly trained personnel,
to maintain aad repair the physical facilities and equipment provided under
the project. Although this maintenance and repair workshop was established,
it is staffed by one technician and about five tradesmen. Owing to the lack
of experience and shortage of funds (Annex 11.09), this staff is not able to carry
out the necessary maintenance and repair tasks.
(ii)    According  to  another covenant (section 3.10), a student
admission policy consistent with purposes of the project was to be adopted so
as to ensure that students admitted to the diploma level course after January
1981 would have not less than one year of prior related work experience. This
admission policy was never adopted. In 1984, related work experience for the
new degree level programme was indicated as a criterion of eligibility for entry
into this course. However, this criterion was waived in that year.
(iii)   According to a third covenant (section 3.11), the student/teacher
ratio was supposed to be 10:1 for the certificate level course and 9:1 for the
diploma level course. The mission found that the overall student/teacher ratio
is almost on target. There were 296 posts for the 2,2821/students at the two
levels oi- 7.7:1 but, with 91 vacancies, the net ratio was 11:1-.
1/ It is impossible to estimate the student/teacher ratio for certificate and
degree programmes separately because most of the staff teach both
programmes simultaneously.

1. Costs and Financing
3.01   The total actual project cost is estimated at US$6.51 million, which
is US$1.31 million, 16.7 per cent below the original estimate of US$7.82 million.

1/ This itemr was supplied, as originally foreseen, by ODA, UK. The completion
mission does not have data on actual costs to ODA but has imputed a cost
to it by reference to appraisal unit cost estimates and the number of
man-years actually supplied (Table 3.2).
3.02   The main reasons for the lower project cost relate to equipment and
technical assistance. The lower cost of equipment (US$1.87 million instead
of US$2.93 million) arises because (i) most of the equipment was bought from
the United Kingdom at a US$/£ exchange rate well below the appraisal estimate;
and-(ii) some laboratories included in the equipment list prepared at appraisal
such as: radio electronics, electro-engineering power and electricity were
not actuaUy built (Annex 11.02). Deleted equipment alone accounted for a
reduction of about US$300,000. ILO financed equipment for electronics and
electricity laboratories at an approximate cost of US$280,000. Technical
assistance provided by ODA was less in terms of fellowships (33 man-years
instead of 53.5).

3.03    The delay in implementing the project resulted
in actual price increases of. US$1.80 million or 43 per cent over base costs by
comparison with the original estimate of US$1.33 million or an average of 25
per cent (Annexes 1II.01 and 111.02).
3.04    The gross areas built, the construction quality and the total cost of
construction were not substantially different from appraisal estimates (see
Table  3.1  and  Annex 111.03).  However, during  the  unexpectedly  long
implementation period the price increase was almost double the level foreseen
at appraisal (Annex  111.02).  This increase wal, offset by the appraisal
overstimation of unit oase costs by about 33 per cent-J (Annex III.03).
3.05    The cost of furniture was underestimated at appraisal. Actual costs
of furniture were equivalent to 30 per cent of classroom and hostel construction
costs by comparison with an appraisal estimate of a level of 14 per cent. One
of the reasons for that difference was.the high cost of furniture designed
for laboratories (special tables, storage areas, etc.). In other projects these
are usually fabricated in concrete or masonry and included in construction
contracts.

3.07    As Annex II.01 shows, actual disbursements lagged behind the appraisal
estimates. This was because of (a) the delays in physical implementaition and
(b) the lower than expected project costs.

CHAPTER IV
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES
4.01   Viewed as a whole at this early stage, the educational impact of this
project would have to be considered less than what was expected at appraisal.
It is, however, clear that a later impact study would be needed to assess the
effects of some of the trends set in motion with the assistance of this poject.
Both teaching programmes have undergone change - the certificate course being
lengthened and the diploma course being replaced by a degree course. Enrolments
have not reached appraisal expectations but can be expected to build up. In
terms of equity - geographical distribution and male/female distribution - there
is considorably need for improvement. While staff development has occurred,
there are still deficiencies in the overaU level of training and industrial
experience among staff and a serious lack of essential laboratory technicians.
Teaching loads are inequitably sharei and, on the average, low. Internal
efficiency is low because of the weak academic background of students,
insufficient attention  to academic regulations, insufficient teaching and
insufficient use of available practical work facilities. External productivity
is said to be generaUy acceptable but could be improved.
1. Education Programmes and Curricula
4.02   Certificate Programme. At the time of appraisal, it was agreed that,
for certificate level programmes (grades 11-12), improvements in the quality
of instruction would be sought (a) by increasirg the proportion of instructional
time devoted to practical subjects in laboratories, workshops, and drawing rooms,
and (b) through the introduction of a six-month remedial programme for students
with weak educational backgrounds in science, mathematics and languages.
However, in spite of the fact that preparations for both developments were
completed in 1982, the Institute still followed the programme used at the time
of appraisal (with minor modifications) until 1986. As seen from Annex IV.03,
this modified programme provides for laboratory work and workshop practice
to an extent that was well below appraisal expectations.
4.03   The new three-year programme introduced in 1986 makes better provision
for science subjects (thus incorporating some of the objectives of the originally
proposed remedial programme) and more emphasis on laboretory work. However,
it is too early to assess its functioning and impact.
4.04   Diploma Programme. The project aim  was to establish a teaching
programme in civil engineering at the diploma level (grades 13-15) through
the provision of facilities, equipment, staff training and specialist sarvices.
IOE established a diploma programme in Civil Engineering in 1978. Throughout
the project implementation period, the necessary activities concerning curriculum
development, training of teachers and procurement of equipment and of the
buildings were undertaken in the context of training technicians at the diploma
level. However, in 1982, the University Council replaced all diploma level (three-
year) programmes in Nepal with bachelor degree (four-year) programmes.
Accordingly, a provisional degree course was introduced by IOE in 1982 which
consisted of the old three-year diploma course expanded by one year. A new
degree programme in Civil Engineering, was approved by subject committees
of the IOE in 1985.



- 16 -
4.05   Under this new programme, first year students are separated according
to whether they have a proficiency certificate in Civil Engineering or the
intermediate proficiency science certificate. The physical facilities provided
by the project do not fully meet the requirements of the degree programme,
and the time allotted for utilization of the available laboratories and workshops
has been low, as is reflected in Annex IV.04. As with the certificate programme,
it is too early to provide a full assessment of the impact and functioning of
the new degree, programm.e.
2. Admission Policy and Enrolments
4.06   The central aim  of the project was to establish a reliable supply of
technical manpower with the practical skills needed to execute national
development projects, most of which are located outside Kathmandu Valley.
Geographical representation of the student body was considered, therefore,
to be an important selection criterion.
4.07   The admission policy at the time of appraisal was that of giving applicants
from remote areas some extra points in the entrance examinations. IOE has
continued the policy and has reserved 25 student places at the certificate level
courses for such applicants. In June 1986, out of 1,011 students enrolled in
the two-year certificate level course, 50 students (about five per cent) were
from the remote Far-Western and Mid-Western regions of the country, 18 per
cent from Western, 21 per cent from Eastern, and 56 per cent from Central
regions of the country. Courses are open to both male and female students;
however, the intake of female students each year ranges from six to nine per
cent only. There are few female students in the engineering courses, but more
are attracted to the architectural course. Thus, problems of inequity remain,
although the trends appear positive.
4.08   The mission found that the enrolment at the IOE (Pulchowk Campus)
is still below the level planned at the time of appraisal. As seen from Annex
IV.05, the enrolment limit of 1,600 students agreed under the project was not
achieved during implementation and in 1986 this enrolment was only 1,271.
The main reasons for the shortfall are: (i) a four-year interruption in intake
for the diploma/degree courses (1980 to 1984); and (ii) non-utilization up to
1986 of 220 places at the certificate level established for the remedial course.
In 1984, the certificate level target of 1,200 was exceeded but it has declined
to 1,011 in 1986. With the 1986 lengthening of the two-year certificate level
programme to three years, these 220 places are expected to be fully utilized
'Prom 1987.  The degree programmes appear to be building up rapidly and may
soon attain the level envisaged originally for the diploma programme.
3. Teaching Staff
4.09   The IOE (Pulchowk Campus) has focused on improvements in staff quality
since its creation. Nevertheless IOE does not have a comprehensive staff
development policy in terms of training requirements and programmes. Much
of the achievements in this context at IOE can be traced to bilateral assistance
(mainly from India and the United Kingdom), as well as to technical assistance
programmes financed by UNDP (paragraphs 2.10-2.13). During the last six years,
the Pulchowk Campus staff has grown from 111 to 205, producing a net student
staff ratio of 1:11. However, there are two key problems - one of quantity
and the other of calibre of staff.



- 17 -
4.10   Quantity of Staff. At present, out of 296 approved staff positions (giving
a staff student ratio of 1:7.7), only 205 positions or less than 70 per cent (including
52 with temporary contracts) have been filled, giving a staff student ratio of
1:11 (Annex IV.07). No positions or persons exist at the level of laboratory
technician. The low fill ratio, which is explained both by the level of salaries
and by the insufficiency of highly qualified persons in Nepal, has implications
for the conduct of classes. With weak administration and insufficient enforcement
of university regulations during the early eighties, staff morale declined. At
that time as many as 40 per cent of classes at a given time could be found
cancelled by teachers. Even now, many teachers remain demoralised by the
lack of student discipl.ne regarding class attendance and homework. At the
time of the completion mission, 60 of the 205 staff were on leave or did not
come to work regularly. This reduced the effective staff student ratio to 1:16.
As a result, the actual class sizes remain unacceptably large, frequently exceeding
60 students.
4.11   One of the  problems which  has not been solved during project
implementation is the status and recruitment of laboratory technicians. To
date, the University Service Commission's grades do not provide for the equivalent
of a laboratory technician (at the salary level of the instructor) as proposed
at the time of appraisal. Instead, in 1984 a new position was established, i.e.,
an assistant technician, but its salary scale - between 1,095 and 1,415 Rs
(US$51-$67) per month - is well below that of the proposed position of laboratory
technician - between 1,470 and 2,150 Rs (US$69-$10l) per month. As a result,
there has been a recruitment problem of technician level staff. By May 1986,
out of 51 approved positions of assistant technician, only eight positions were
occupied and these were with temporary contracts, and 43 positions were vacant
(Annex IV.07). This results in inadequate maintenance (and exploitation for
learning purposes) of the modern educational equipment installed in the
laboratories and deprives laboratory classes of their necessary support. The
experience in this case suggests that it would have been desirable to have taken
measures to ensure creation of the posts of laboratory technician at an early
stage (as, for example, by making this a condition of Board presentation) and
to ensure their filing before the laboratories were provided (as, for example,
by making this a condition of disbursement of Credit proceeds for construction
and equipment).
4.12   Calibre of Staff. As shown in Annex IV.06, the staff holding Ph.Ds
have increased from 3 to 11, and those at Masters Degree level from 40 to 68
(Annex IV.06). The majority of the teaching staff have either certificate or
bachelor level qualifications, and there is great shortage of professors and readers
in most of the engineering disciplines. In percentage terms, master's degree
holders declined from 36 per cent of total staff in 1980 to 33 per cent in 1986
and bachelors degree holders from 38 per cent to 22 per cent. The difference
has been made up with certificate holders who rose from 23 per cent (1980)
to 39 per cent (1986) Thus, overall there has been a deterioration in the average
level of academic qualifications in the past six years. The   present   staff
lacks the experience needed for teaching at the degree level and most of them
have had very little or no industrial experience. There has been no attempt
by the Institute to establish a formal industry/institute relationship. No serious
attempts have been initiated by the IOE to provide induction training in



- 18 -
educational technology and teaching techniques for the newly recruited teachers,
so as to enable them to adapt easily to their new job and the teaching
environment.
4. Teaching Loads
4.13   The  distribution  of class periods among  the  teaching  staff is
unsatisfactory. The recently appointed staff in some cases teach as many as
18 periods per week, while more experienced staff generally teach as few as
eight periods per week, and undertake consultancies in some enterprises,
ostensibly in order to obtain industrial experience, but certainly also to
supplement their relatively low salaries which range from about US$ 52 per
month for assistant instructor to about US$ 145 per month for professors
(Annex IV.08). The mission found that at the IOE no major initiative has as
yet been taken to promote research, and all the research conducted at the
Institute so far, is by and large the result of individual enthusiasm rather than
institutional policy and support.
S. Quality
(a)    Internal Efficiency
4.14   The pass rate of the students for the degree level course is acceptable
- over the last two years, from 66 to 70 per cent of persons completed within
the normal duration prescribed for the course. For the certificate level course,
however, the results have been disturbing. From 1979 to 1982 under the semester
system, the percentage of students successfully completing the certificate
course within one year of prescribed duration varied: from 37 to 80 per cent
for the electrical course, 55 to 75 per cent for the air conditioning/refrigeration
course, 30 to 65 per cent for the architectural course, and from 28 to 58 per
cent for the radio and electronics course. The situation was better in the civil
engineering course, from 65 to 79 per cent (Annex IV.09). When the semester
examination system was replaced in 1983 by the annual examination system,
the student: pass rate became even worse. In 1983, for example, all students
of the electrical and air conditioning/refrigeration courb-s failed to complete
the course within one year of prescribed duration. The average pass percentage,
considering all courses was only nine per c- and this improved to only 20 per
cent the following year.
4.15   In the view of the mission, the main reasons are the weak academic
background of entering students, inadequate academic regulations and control
concerning student performance, and problems regarding teaching materials.
4.16   Academic Background. In spite of the surfeit of applicants for admission
to the certificate courses, competition has not led to higher admission standards
because of the uniformly low quality of candidates.  It was proposed at appraisal
that the remedial science and mathematics component of the certificate level
curriculum would raise the proficiency of incoming students in these subjects.
However, this remedial component was not introduced. Furthermore, since
1980, science ceased to be a compulsorw - ubject in secondary education because
of the lack of teachers and facilities for science. A second weakness is language.
At present, one third of the teachers at the Pulchowk Campus of the IOE teach
technical and other subjects fully in English, and the others in Nepali with
technical terms in English. From a student survey conducted by IOE, it is clear
that about 25 per cent of the students do not adequately understand the teachers
who teach these subjects in English.



- 19 -
4.17   Academic Regulations. University regulations require that students
attend at least 70 per cent of the classes in each subject, otherwise they are
not entitled to sit the annual examination in the subject. However, at the
Pulchowk Campus only 60 per cent of the teachers keep attendance records
regularly and many do not submit the records to the administration since the
administration does not insist on this. Consequently, much student absenteeism
goes unrecorded, and actually all students. are allowed to sit for annual
examinations. In addition, current university regulations do not require students
to complete their studies in a reasonable time frame, and they are allowed
to repeat examinations indefinitely. Absenteeism and examination failures
have at this time no disciplinary consequences.
4.18   Apart from the lectures, the curriculum of the certificate programme
requires other classes such as tutorial sessions, drawing classes, and practical
work in the laboratory and workshop. -rne mission found that the institution
does not accord high priority to these other classes. For example, the curricula
of all certificate courses specify a certaOn pirsmber of tutorial hours per week
for all theory subjects (for which it is fotiid to be necessary). In practice,
however, no tutorial class is scheduled in the weekly timetable.
4.19   The situation concerning the conduct of drawing classes varies from
course to course. In the architectural course, and the first year of the civil
engineering course, the drawing work is conducted satisfactorily. The second
year civil engineering drawing classes are scheduled but, in practice, do not
take place.
4.20   In addition to the problems of curriculum design (paragraph 2.08) and
staffing (paragraph 4.1 1) which affect workshops and laboratories, the
administration of workshops is poor; in some workshops, a lot of time is spent
in issuing and taking back tools; store keepers have become irregular and
laboratory sheets are not fully prepared.
4.21   Teaching Materials. Although there is adequate audio-visual hardware
at the IOE, it is not used simply because many teachers do not know how to
use it and whom to contact in order to obtain these teaching aids for their classes.
The shortage of textbooks (paragraph 2.18) is a formidable obstacle to improved
teaching effectiveness. 13udgetary practices constitute another obstacle. Of
the total expenditure on teachers and teaching materiels onlv four per cent
goes to teaching materials (Annex 11.09). This is extraordinarily low in a post
secondary institute, especially in technology.
(b)    External Productivity
4.22   A monitoring and evaluation unit established under the project at the
IOE in 1979 has prepared and sent to IDA quarterly and annual progress reports
on educational indicators in broad terms, as well as an occasional analysis of
output. In 1982, the unit conducted a tracer study in which there was a 30 per
cent return of the questionnaires (Annex IV.1O). According to the study, about
90 per cent of the trainees from civil and architecture engineering cou'rses
and about 60 per cent from electrical engineerinq,courses. found employment
within 6 months after completing their training -. However, owing to the
deterioration of economic conditions in the country, the employment prospects
for the certificate holders were expected to decline.
1/     For radio/electronics and air conditioning courses data were not sufficient
for analysis.



- 20 -
4.23  In 1985, the unit conducted another external efficiency study for the
certificate level output and secured responses concerning about 200 persons
who graduated during the last five years (Annex IV.11). According to the study,
which was based on the employers' evaluation, on the average, the graduates
generally appear to meet the requirements of employers for all disciplines (except
in civil engineering where 25 qer cent of the graduates are considered to perform
their duties unsatisfactorily)-. The study concluded that the improvement
of quality at the IOE would require strict adherence to rules and regulations.
1/    The  report  "Manpower Implications  of  Education  and  Training
Development in Engineering, in the Kingdom of Nepal", May 1983, World
Bank prepared by Norman C. McEvers, indicated, however, that both
internal and external efficiency was low.

CHAPTER V
EDA PERFORMANCE
1. Project Generation
5.01    Experience so far with this project demonstrates that, as conceived,
prepared and appraised, it was in line with the urgent needs of the country.
Overall, the project generation effort was considerable - 65 staff-weeks devoted
to it in the field or 67 per cent of the total field work in the entire project
cycle. This compares with 38 per cent in Credit 892-PAK and 46 per cent in
Credit 621-BD, to cite two other projects in the Region. Nevertheless, the
shortcomings of project generation were not surprising in view of the lack of
operational precedents in the sector in the country to guide the tasks. The
main shortcomings were two-fold - in overestimating costs (paragraphs
3.02-3.04); and in the inadequacy of attention to securing agreement on policy
measures for qualitative improvement (paragraphs 6.05-6.08).
2. Project Implementation
5.02    Of the 27.5 staff-weeks devoted to field supervision of the project,
only five (18%) were carried out by technical educators. The absence of technical
educators from supervision missions occurred during a crucial four-year period
(1979-1983) when fundamental changes in educational programmes were being
made by the IOE and dialogue on these changes and on the adjustments to physical
facilities was urgently needed. The table below shows the extent of participation
in supervision by various specialists.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSIONS
6.01   The design and implementation experience with this project reinforces
the lessons of other projects and stresses some which are more particular to
this project. It is evident, in view of the relatively recent start on the new
certificate and degree programmes, that an impact study should be undertaken
at a later stage, perhaps in four or five years' time. The more important lessons
which can be drawn from this case relate to planning and academic policy.
Planning
6.02   The conception of a project is ideally done in the context of a plan,
and successful planning in the education sector,. depends on a long-term horizon
because of the length of time required for introducing change. In the case of
higher education, the graduates of a new four-year programme may begin to
be produced some eight or ten years after initial planning for the programme.
In this case, this long-term horizon appears to have been missing and the project
was conceived as a response to a short-term, immediate need seen in almost
static traditional terms. At appraisal, it was recognised that foreign training
for engineers was not entirely appropriate and did not serve areas outside the
Kathmandu valley. Yet no planning study was proposed to explore introducing
the degree course at some future date. The viability of the concept of a senior
technician, whose profile is close to that of the graduate engineer, has been
challenged in some countries on grounds of economy. In this case it needed
close scrutiny in the context of development of a degree programme. In 1982,
within four years of Credit Signature, the senior technician had been eclipsed
by the engineer in development thinking in Nepal. When the World Bank report
on manpower was prepared in 1983, the need for seniqr1 technicians over the
entire succeeding 10-year period was estimated at 182-, by comparison with
the programme under the project to produce about 1,000-1,200 senior technicians
over the same period. On the other hand, the need for graduate engineers was
estimated at the same time at 3,628. Thus this project item suffered from
insufficiently thorough exploration of the needs in a dynamic and long-term
context.
6.03   A second aspect of planning is related to staff development. By
comparison with the expected staff needs, the staff development programme
included in the project was meagre, especially in regard to advanced degree
training - the only category that was fully utilised. Allowing for the high rate
of attrition of teachers that would normally apply in a sector which was already
short staffed as a whole, the training needed for a staff of about 163, in terms
of industrial exposure and advanced degrees and allowances for attrition, was
grossly understimated at 53.5 staff years. By contrast, in the Second Education
Project, some 58.3 staff years were provided for a total staff of 45 in the
technical/vocational training institution. As the experience showed in this
project, even with extensive support from another fellowship programme and
the achievements under this project, the staffing situation was weaker at project
completion than it had been four years earlier (paragraph 4.12).
1/    See McEvers Report cited in footnote to paragraph 4.23. This estimate
was for the period 1983/84-1994/95.

6.04   Thus, it is clear that two things were needed: (a) a long-term  staff
development programme, extending beyond the period of implementation of
this project, in order to ensure full understanding of the magnitude and long-term
nature of the process of staff development; and (b) a slice of that long-term
programme for implementation under this project that was substantially larger
and more aggressive in the pursuit of advanced studies than the programme
included in the project.
6.05   Academic Policy. Given the degree of autonomy that higher education
institutions usually enjoy, it is essential to ensure that the policy climate of
the institution being assisted is conducive to the kinds of improvements being
pursued under the project. Under this project many items of academic policy
were correctly addressed. In hindsight, however, it is clear that there was
inadequate attention to (i) the acceptance and utilization of the laboratory
technicians (paragraph 4.11): (ii) the preservation of a stable staff for project
management in the face of a system of rotating deans (paragraph 2.03); (iii)
the question of academic regulations (paragraphs 4.15-4.19); and (iv) the
industry/IOE relationship (paragraph 4.12-4.13). Only the fourth of these points
requires elaboration here.
6.06   Industry/1OE Relationship. The project design needed to be more specific
on the necessity for some institutional link with industry so as to enhance the
opportunities for staff industrial exposure and research, strengthen the relevance
of programmes (especially in regard to practical work) to the needs of industry
and facilitate the absorption of graduates. In the case of the Second Education
Project, the design included an Advisory Committee for the training centre
which would include public and private employers. A similar arrangement was
clearly needed in the First Project.
