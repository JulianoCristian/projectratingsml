F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

As stated in the PAD for the original project, the objective of the Health Sector Support and
Multisectoral AIDS Program (HSSMAP) is ‘to support implementation of the Recipient’s program
which aims at improving health and fight against HIV/AIDS on the Recipient’s territory.’

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The first AF did not change the PDO but changed the Results Framework, as discussed below. For
the second AF (approved June 30, 2011), the PDO was revised “to improve access and quality of
priority health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS services.”
  (a) PDO Indicator(s)
In the table below, the original project had 12 indicators. The 2008 AF-1 refined 7 indicators
(including added 1 new) and dropped 5 indicators. The 2011 AF-2 dropped 3 indicators and added 3
new indicators. Baselines and targets of 4 indicators were updated. Data comes from the following
sources: MOH administrative reports;
Biological Surveillance Survey (BSS) - financed by the project;
Demographic Health Survey (DHS) - co-financed by the project (2003, 2010);
Knowledge, attitude, and practice - for AIDS and nutrition;
Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) - co-financed by the project (2010);
Multisector survey - 2014 field surveys - co-financed by the project;
Health Management Information System (HMIS);

The survey done in 2014 was a Continued Multisectoral Survey which followed the same
methodology as the DHS, but only some health indicators were considered (AIDS was not covered).
The data from the Continued Multisectoral Survey (CMS) are used.

I. Disbursement Profile




1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Country context. Despite GDP growth of 5.6 percent per annum between 1994 and 2004 and
an estimated 8 percent decline in the poverty headcount between 1998 and 2003, Burkina remained
among the poorest countries in Africa, with an annual per capita income of $350 and a poverty
incidence of 46 percent in 2003. The country’s Human Development Index (HDI) rose by a relatively
high positive ratio of 0.055 over the period 2000-2006, but Burkina still placed near the bottom of the
HDI. Burkina’s social welfare indicators lagged behind even modest Sub-Saharan African averages.
2.     Health sector situation. Based on the results of the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey
(DHS), Burkina lagged significantly behind the progress needed to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) for health. Improvements in maternal health since the 1998 DHS were
noted for antenatal consultations (from 59 to 73 percent) and assisted delivery (from 42 to 57 percent),
but total fertility remained high (at 6.2), the contraceptive prevalence rate barely changed (from 8 to
10 percent), and the maternal mortality rate remained unacceptably high (440 per 100,000 births).
3.     During the period 1998-2003, mortality rates declined for infants (from 105 to 81 per thousand)
and children under 5 (from 217 to 184 per thousand), but immunization rates for measles worsened
(from 60 to 56 percent) and the proportion of underweight children (weight for age) increased (from
30 to 38 percent). Though malaria was the leading cause of mortality for children, preventive
strategies (long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets or LLIN) and curative measures (Artemesinin-
based Combination Treatment or ACT) were not widespread. Modest improvement in infant mortality
resulted from: improved antenatal coverage and gradual progress in assisted birth delivery; less
positive trends in under-5 mortality were the result of worsening nutrition status, declining
vaccination coverage, and continued high incidence and mortality from malaria.
4.     The political will to strengthen the health system and fight against diseases took the following
forms:

                                                                                                     16
      Successive creation of several structures, including the Population/AIDS Control project in
       1994; and the Central Office for Coordinating the National Multisectoral Program to Combat
       HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs): i) Elaboration of several relevant
       programs, including elaboration of ten-year health plan and first Medium-term Expenditure
       Framework (MTEF), but more needs to be done to align spending with the poverty reduction
       strategy paper (PRSP) and MDG priorities. ii) Improvement in the reliability of budget
       transfers to health districts.
      In 2000, the government adopted the National Health Policy as well as a sectoral approach for
       implementing the National Health Development Strategy 2001–10 (Programme National de
       developpement sanitaire-PNDS) and the MTEF 2005–2010. The PNDS identified key
       priorities and health service objectives, including increased accessibility, improved quality,
       and increased financial access for the poor. The MTEF provided the overall financing
       framework as well as the basis for annual budgets and work programs, for the increasing
       integration of priority expenditures into the government budget. Though health expenditures
       increased at an average annual rate of 14.5 percent from 2000 to 2005, total health expenditure
       was only US$20 per capita, including the contribution of external assistance.
5.     The multitude of bilateral, multilateral, and nongovernmental donors in HIV/AIDS and health
sectors, as well as various vertical disease control programs, had created a significant coordination
burden on the government. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and National AIDS Council (NAC), as
well as donor partners, took a number of steps to improve coordination, but harmonization remained
a priority, including moving toward common procedures and pooled funding to the extent possible.
This dialogue resulted in the establishment of two institutions for the integration of priority programs
and harmonization of external financing: Programme d’appui au développement sanitaire (PADS)
for health and the permanent secretariat of the NAC for pooled funding for AIDS. The government
demonstrated its commitment to combating HIV/AIDS through the establishment of the NAC,
chaired by the President of Burkina Faso, and through the adoption of a five-year HIV/AIDS strategy
(2001–2005).

6.     HIV/AIDS situation. At the end of 2003, there were differing assessments of HIV prevalence
among the adult population: the United Nations Agency to Fight AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated
prevalence at 4.2 percent while the 2003 DHS estimated prevalence at 1.8 percent but with significant
urban/rural variations. However, among the highest HIV rates in the subregion, there were signs the
epidemic was stabilizing. New HIV infections among young women (15–24 years old) at urban
antenatal sentinel surveillance sites had declined (from 3.3 percent in 2001 to 1.9 percent in 2003).
Among commercial sex workers (CSWs), new infection rates had also declined (from over 60 percent
in the mid-1990s to 20 percent in a 2002 survey). However, among youth (15–24 years old), the DHS
data showed the limited extent of HIV/AIDS knowledge (only 25.4 percent of males and 12.3 percent
of females had comprehensive, correct knowledge) and behavior change (only 66.9 percent of males
and 53.8 percent of females had used condoms during their last at-risk sex).

7.      Progress was achieved in reducing HIV Burkina Faso also benefited from the Bank-funded
Treatment Acceleration Program (TAP) to test different approaches for scaling up existing treatment
initiatives through an action-orientated learning process. At the end of 2005, 8,136 persons infected
with HIV, including 420 children, were receiving infections through measures taken to establish (a)
a multisectoral approach involving public and private sectors as well as civil society; (b) an
institutional framework promoting decentralization and participation from all levels of society in the
fight against HIV/AIDS; and (c) an effective partnership with the technical and financial partners.
                                                                                                     17
Comprehensive five-year strategies were adopted for the periods 2001–2005 and 2006–2010 and
focused on surveillance, prevention, and treatment. Beginning in 2004, antiretroviral (ARV)
treatment, but up to 30,000 persons remained in need of such treatment.

8.     As in many other African countries, the health and HIV/AIDS programs faced two important
problems: (a) the multitude of multilateral, bilateral, and nongovernmental partners constituted a
significant coordination burden on the government and (b) the constraints on effective service
delivery posed by a centralized government administration. At appraisal, Burkina Faso had made
strides to address the two problems. First, in collaboration with the partners, the MOH and the NAC
had improved coordination and begun discussions on harmonization, including moving toward
common procedures and pooled funding to the extent possible. Second, following the health sector,
which had been a leader in the channeling of resources to health services at the district level,3 the
national HIV/AIDS program had established HIV/AIDS committees at provincial and village levels,
with funding from the HSSMAP for 13 (of 45) provinces. While there was a general consensus on
the issues and the way forward, a number of obstacles remained, including progress on harmonization
of fiduciary procedures, administrative arrangements for effective decentralization, and
accountability through performance contracting to encompass budget transfers as well as external
financing.

9.     Country Assistance Strategy/rationale for Bank involvement. In 2000, Burkina Faso
became one of the first countries to prepare a full PRSP to take advantage of the country's eligibility
for the Highly-indebted Poor Country Initiative. A revised PRSP for 2004–2006 maintained the
objectives of the earlier strategy to accelerate equity-oriented growth, increase access of the poor to
basic social services, expand income and employment opportunities for the poor, and promote good
governance. In addition, the PRSP process introduced a number of innovations to increase ownership
and promote results-based management by (a) regionalizing the PRSP; (b) introducing a priority
action program to ensure greater consistency; and (c) adopting common indicators to measure
progress and increase public visibility. With these measures, the government signaled its intention,
within the general framework of budgetary support (signed with the development partners in 2005),
to take the lead role in coordinating budgetary aid.

10. The Bank responded by approving a results-based Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2006–
2009 for Burkina Faso’s program in July 2005. Two of the four major CAS objectives (improved
access to basic social services and better governance with greater decentralization) specifically
supported the pillars of the revised PRSP. Bank engagement in the health and HIV/AIDS sectors was
justified by (a) the imperative for achieving the MDGs, to which both the government and the Bank
were committed; (b) the Bank’s comparative advantage in helping the government address
fundamental sectoral issues, including human resources, sector financing, decentralization,
performance contracting, and so on; and (c) the Bank’s critical role in financing HIV/AIDS prevention
and treatment and addressing funding gaps in the health sector.




3
 In 1998, the Bank-funded Health and Nutrition Project initiated the channeling of resources directly to 55 health
districts and 13 health regions on the basis of monitorable annual action plans; the approach was continued after
project closing in 2001 (with bilateral support) and further was extended to hospitals in 2005.
                                                                                                                  18
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as approved)


11. As stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the original PDO of the Health Sector
Support and Multisectoral AIDS Program (HSSMAP) was ‘to support implementation of the
Recipient’s program which aims at improving health and fight against HIV/AIDS on the Recipient’s
territory.’

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    Reasons/Justification

12. In 2011, underAF-2, the PDO was revised to “improve access and quality of priority health,
nutrition, and HIV/AIDS services.” The change was “deemed necessary to clarify the intent of the
original project development objective” as expressed in the FA.

13. The key performance indicators are presented in the ICR Datasheet above. The result
framework has been changed during the AF-1 and AF-2.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries and Benefits

14. There were to be two categories of beneficiaries: (a) the health sector (public and private) and
the civil society recipients of project funds who were the direct beneficiaries and (b) the users of
public and private health services and the populations targeted by the civil society groups (360 NGOs,
associations and community-based organizations) to receive preventive and curative services as
indirect beneficiaries. The AF-2 in 2011 included an expansion of the community nutrition which
covers the whole country.

15. Through these direct beneficiaries, the health component was expected to benefit some seven
million people: (a) women of child-bearing age (approximately four million of which roughly one
million pregnant women annually) through improved reproductive health (RH) services; and (b)
children aged under five years (some three million) through improved vaccination and nutrition and
better management of childhood illnesses, including malaria and diarrhea. These were considered to
be the most vulnerable groups, those most likely to suffer from the effects of epidemics and common
diseases and most dependent on the public sector for access to health services. Of these beneficiaries,
more than three-quarters were expected to be female.

16. The HIV/AIDS component was expected to address the 15–49 year old population, but more
specifically youth who were 15–24 years old, HIV+ mothers, and their children, People living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and those children affected by HIV/AIDS.

1.5 Original Components

   17. The original project included two components, as follows:

18. Component A: Support for health sector progress toward the MDGs (estimated cost:
US$26.7 million). The objectives were to:

      improve the quality and utilization of maternal and child health services through support for
       (a) basic training and equipment in the health districts; (b) increased quality and reduced costs
                                                                                                     19
       for normal deliveries and emergency obstetrical; and (c) integrated management of child
       illness;
      strengthen the response for malaria and other communicable diseases through support for (a)
       malaria control, particularly the distribution of key commodities for malaria prevention and
       treatment and (b) a comprehensive response to epidemics, including meningitis, cholera, and
       bird influenza;
      expand prevention, medical care, and support services for persons infected with HIV/AIDS
       and sexually transmitted diseases through improved training, supervision, and monitoring of
       treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs in public and private sectors; and
      Strengthen project management through communication, planning and coordination,
       monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and supervision (including for the improvement of medical
       waste management (MWM).
19. Component B: Support for the National Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Strategy (estimated
cost: US$21 million). The objectives were to:

      support HIV prevention and behavior change through support for (a) increased coverage of
       HIV prevention activities among high-risk groups (CSWs, miners, truckers, youth); (b)
       development and implementation of an integrated HIV/AIDS behavior change
       communications strategy; (c) expanded voluntary testing and counseling; and (d) improved
       HIV/AIDS and reproductive activities for in-and-out-of-school youth;
      mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of the epidemic through improved capacity of (a)
       public actors (at the central and decentralized levels) to implement and monitor interventions
       and (b) NGOs and other associations and communities (at local level) to expand care and
       support for persons infected and affected by HIV/AIDS; and
      Strengthen coordination, M&E, supervision, and project management.

20. Within the broader context of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs), the project also
had certain crosscutting objectives, including (a) the development of an integrated approach to
community participation; (b) the distribution and motivation of health personnel; (c) support for
decentralization and performance contracting; (d) sector financing, performance monitoring, and
surveillance; and (e) harmonization of external funding.

1.6 Revised Components

21. The first AF in the amount of US$15 million (approved June 5, 2008) modified Component A
to (a) finance vaccines to control the spread of a meningitis epidemic, and (b) implement essential
nutrition interventions at health facility and community levels. The objectives of the community
nutrition subcomponent were to (a) develop a community health and nutrition strategy, (b) enhance
the management capacity of the civil society organizations (CSO) and networks of implementing
agencies selected to implement the decentralized strategy, and (c) establish contracts for the delivery
of community health and nutrition services in five of the 13 regions.

22. The second AF in the amount of US$36 million (approved June 30, 2011) provided further
support to the nutrition subcomponent of Component A (US$18 million) by (a) expanding the
geographic scope to all 13 regions, and (b) increasing the range of activities (and inputs) to be
financed. Similarly, activities (and inputs) for Component B (US$18 million) were increased to
address the growing financing gap, reoriented to emphasize high-risk groups, and expanded to include
                                                                                                    20
the activities to be co-financed by the Bank-administered Spanish Program for Africa Trust Fund
(refurbishment, equipment, and furniture for 10 laboratories and three regional antennas of the SP-
CNLS).




                                                                                                21
1.7 Other significant changes

23. The closing Date of the original project was July 30, 2010. The project Closing Date was
extended by six months (under the first AF) from July 31, 2012 to January 31, 20134 and by an
additional 23 months (under the second AF) to December 31, 2014. This second restructuring also
included an expansion of the community nutrition activities and AF for the HIV/AIDS activities.
Project proceeds were reallocated on several occasions: (a) in May 2011 for Component A, from
Category 1 (subprograms) to Category 2 (procurement through international competitive bidding),
and (b) in November 2014.

2.   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

24. Project preparation. A project concept note was discussed in March 2005; the project
appraisal was carried out in December 2005; negotiations were held in February 2006; and the project
was approved on April 27, 2006. Project preparation was built on solid ground as explained below.

25. Soundness of the background analysis. Background analysis for the two components relied
on a combination of (a) ongoing implementation experience of the MOH; (b) current information on
the health sector; and (c) extensive discussions between the government and the technical and
financial partners over the modalities for pooling funds.

26. First, project preparation drew on the experience of varied Bank support to the health sector,
which contributed to each of the project’s priorities: health services development (PADS); HIV/AIDS
(MAP and TAP); disease control (specifically, onchocerciasis); and health systems reform (PRSC).
Previous experience showed that (a) Bank support was essential to promote harmonization and
coordination among partners according to the principles of the Paris Declaration (2005), and (b)
flexible procedures to channel funds to districts could improve accountability, raise staff motivation,
and improve the response to local needs. Lessons from the previous health projects in the country had
also shown that greater attention was needed to understand and address the factors contributing to the
persistently low utilization of health services, while raising the quality and coverage of primary health
care services. 5 Unfortunately, this analysis, which could have improved project preparation and
implementation, was not done at the time of project preparation.

27. Second, current health information was available from the DHS (1998 and 2003), a public
expenditure review (2004), and a National Health Accounts process (initiated in 2005), as well as
from the improving health management information system (HMIS).

28. Third, assessments by the government and its partners (including the Bank) had concluded that
(a) the institutional arrangements and project management teams for implementing the PNDS and the
National Strategic Framework for the Fight against AIDS were effective in spite of some
shortcomings, (b) local performance management and accountability for funds can enhance the results

  The 23-month extension went beyond the then three-year threshold under OP 13.20 and required a waiver before
submission of the AF to the Board.
5 See ICR, Health and Nutrition Project (2002), p.16.

                                                                                                            22
achieved, and (c) pooled funding, which had been introduced by PADS in 2002, can be extended to
HIV/AIDS and promote harmonization and coordination.6

29. Government commitment. For both health and HIV/AIDS, the government’s commitment
was demonstrated by the existence of: (a) long-term policies and strategies (a national 10-year Health
Sector Strategy approved in 2001 and 5-year HIV/AIDS strategies for the period 2001–2005 and
2006–2010; (b) legislative and regulatory decisions (for example, decentralization and hospital
reform) as well as institutional arrangements for decision making at the central and decentralized
levels; (c) financial measures to mobilize and (transparently) allocate adequate funding (through
pooled funding for health and substantial allocations of the national budget for HIV/AIDS) to
implement the strategies; and (d) modalities for measuring agency performance of the approved work
plans and the impact of on service delivery and health status.

30. Assessment of project design. Beginning in 2002, Burkina Faso adopted the PRSC as a
substitute for direct project lending to the health sector. 7 PRSCs had been shown to be effective
instruments for policy and structural reforms, but the project team argued that their effectiveness
could be enhanced by flexible sector support for implementing the PNDS. Specifically, additional
investment support would (a) advance sector coordination based on MTEFs, harmonized procedures
for planning and budgeting, pooled funding, and strengthened M&E systems, (b) provide greater
flexibility for institutional reforms and finance key priorities essential for the MDGs, and (c) help
manage the risks associated with national reforms to enhance decentralization and budget support.

31. By addressing both the health sector and HIV/AIDS, the project was to be (a) fully aligned
with the national disease profile and proposed reforms (for example, decentralization), and (b) able
to capitalize on technical synergies and sector dialogue (between the MOH and NAC). A key to the
success of the operation was the use of pooled funding to adapt financing priorities based on
demonstrably effective interventions and policies, including performance contracting.

32. From the outset, it was agreed that implementation will use pooled funding mechanisms for
each of the components:8 (a) with support from the Bank and various bilateral agencies (including
from Netherlands, France, and Sweden), the MOH had already established and managed pooled
funding; and (b) under the proposed project, the NAC was expected to set up a comparable
mechanism. 9 By establishing separate health and HIV/AIDS accounts within a single operation,
project implementation arrangements were integrated into existing institutions, fiduciary procedures
from previous Bank projects were maintained (and strengthened), and transaction costs were reduced.
Other partners were encouraged to participate in pooled funding; their contributions over the duration
of the project are indicated in Annex 11.


6 The pooled funding mechanism for the health sector was based on the framework adopted by the Bank-financed
Health and Nutrition Project in 1998.
7 The PRSC series envisioned continued support for health system reforms, including better allocation of financial

and human resources, strengthened performance contracting, and increased financial access among the poor.
8 To avoid any confusion, the QER advised the project team to use the terms ‘pooled health fund’ and ‘annual

disbursements’ rather than ‘Sector Wide Approaches’ and ‘annual tranches’. Each component’s pooled account
comprised categories to allow for procurement of items (a) in accordance with national law and country systems;
and (b) for which procurement in accordance with national law will result in a violation of the Bank’s
Procurement Guidelines.
9 The MOH had produced a Program Document (June 2004) providing the overall orientations for the second

phase of PADS; the document was expected to serve as a model for the NAC.
                                                                                                                23
33. The PAD was more ambitious than the FA with respect to both the PDO and the performance
indicators: (a) the PAD aimed at accelerating progress toward the MDGs and comprised 28 outcome
and intermediate outcome indicators (IOIs) (including at least one indicator for each of the relevant
MDGs); and (b) the FA aimed at supporting implementation of the country’s efforts to improve health
and fight against HIV/AIDS and selected a subset of 10 outcome and IOIs.10 The PAD acknowledged
that the use of pooled funding to finance multiple annual action plans precluded the possibility of
establishing direct linkages between inputs, outputs, and achievement of the project’s objectives.
These discrepancies between the PAD and the FA was identified during the first implementations
support which decided to restructure the project a year after the launch of the project. It impacted on
implementation target (action plans) and on PDO outcomes indicators and IOI.

34. Risks and risk mitigation. The PAD assessed the overall project risk rating as Moderate but
did not provide a detailed analysis of risks or risk mitigation measures. Important risks which might
have merited more consideration include (a) the difficulties of sustaining reliable funding through a
pooled approach in the face of evolving donor agency priorities, (b) the assumed linkage between
increased resources or donor harmonization and improved health outcomes without very targeted
resource allocations, (c) the effects of disparities in administrative and implementation capacity on
results at the central, regional, and local levels, and (d) the difficulties of coordinating multiple
stakeholders and implementing sectoral reforms.

35. Quality at Entry. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) for the project was held on October
5, 2005. The QER confirmed the proposed project approach but requested that (a) more information
be provided on the amounts and allocation of Bank funding relative to the government budget and
other external financing, (b) priority activities (including for malaria and nutrition) be more clearly
defined and integrated into district work plans, and (c) greater responsibilities be delegated to the
regions. Reviewers also noted the importance of establishing an independent system to verify key
performance indicators.

2.2 Implementation

36. The project was approved on April 27, 2006 and the FA signed on May 16, 2006. Two
conditions for effectiveness were included in the FA: (a) opening of a Designated Account; and (b)
recruitment of a consultant to adapt the computerized information system for the financial
management (FM) of the PADS management unit and participation of all staff of the PADS
management unit in a training on FM. The project was declared effective on November 14, 2006
following an extension of the effectiveness deadline.11 This has consequently resulted in a slow start
of the project implementation and a slow disbursement.

37. For Component B, five effectiveness conditions for approval of a pooled HIV/AIDS fund
similar to the pooled health fund were included as follows: (a) organize a training on FM and all staff
of the CNLS management unit and Provincial and Regional AIDS Committees, shall have
participated in it; (b) recruit an internationally qualified consultant to strengthen the procurement
capacity of the MOH and PADS management unit; (c) enter into an agreement with one or several
duly qualified institutions or NGOs for the provision of technical assistance to the villages
participating in the implementation of Component B of the HSSMAP, in form and substance

10
 See annex 10 for details.
11
 Bank clearance for recruiting a consultant to revise the relevant manuals for the health-pooled fund was delayed
when the MOH submitted a single source request, which the Bank rejected, resulting in delays.
                                                                                                               24
satisfactory to the Bank; (d) develop an action plan for the strengthening of the capacities of the
department responsible for the administration and finances of the SP-CNLS-IST, in the medium term;
and (e) develop an action plan for the strengthening of the capacities of the department responsible
for the administration and finances of the MOH, in the medium term.

38.     Initial disbursements for Component B were authorized at the end of February 2008. The
World Bank chose not to participate directly in the pooled fund. A specific disbursement system was
set up for the project. As shown in Annex 10, modifications in the project design (particularly for
nutrition) resulted in considerable variation over time in the indicators; less than 20 percent of the
original indicators were maintained over the project life time.

39. Disbursement overview. Project disbursements for Component A (health) were slower than
planned through the end of 2007 but, accelerated quickly over the period 2008–2010, with
Components A and B averaging about US$9.5 million each, annually. During the preparation of the
second AF in 2011, disbursements declined by more than 50 percent for the Component B but,
recovered over the period 2012–2014, averaging US$9 million for Component A and US$7 million
for Component B. The project had disbursed 99.7% percent of its funds by project closing.

40. Pooled funding had mixed results. First, the recipients of funds for implementing annual work
plans viewed pooled funding positively based on its transparency and flexibility (for example,
predictability, availability, amount, and uses of funds), but they also criticized the implementation
arrangements for being burdensome (and costly). Approval of annual plans and budgets was delayed
during the first two years and improved thereafter.

41. Second, the providers of pooled funding seem to have viewed the approach with decreasing
enthusiasm over the project implementation period. As shown in Annex 11, the number of participants
remained steady, but the amount of pooled funding for health declined steadily, from 83 percent in
2007 to 11 percent in 2014. For HIV/AIDS, the number of participants increased initially but has
dropped since 2009 and the amount of pooled funding managed through the common fund has
declined steadily as well, from 24 percent in 2009 to five percent in 2014. The Bank’s contribution
to pooled funding has varied with respect to the health component, averaging 21 percent, but its
contribution to pooled funding for HIV/AIDS has been much more significant, averaging 76 percent.
Stated somewhat differently, as donor priorities evolved and concerns emerged about pooled funding
(even for the Bank among fiduciary staff), sustaining active involvement in pooled funding proved to
be difficult.

42. Implementation overview. The project was implemented for eight years since the Board
approval of April 27, 2006 of the original operation. This period can be generally broken into three
separate distinguishing reference points, each representing and explaining key factors behind
implementation progress and changes made during the course of the project. Though the basic
principles of the project (harmonized arrangements, decentralization, performance contracting, etc.)
remained in effect throughout project implementation, there were several significant modifications of
the project’s scope, objectives, and targets over the period. These are summarized in Annex 10 and
comprise: (i) a first Additional Financing with non-pooled funds for sub-components to respond to a
meningitis epidemic and to initiate a community nutrition program; and (ii) a second Additional
Financing to better target HIV/AIDS interventions and to scale-up the community nutrition program.



                                                                                                   25
43. Original project (2006-2008): The original project’s implementation was mainly implemented
as health system’s strengthening and HIV/AIDS prevention, covering the whole country. The initial
changes in the project resulted from a series of joint Bank-partner missions in late 2007-early 2008,
which were intended to resolve slow disbursement but concluded as well that the project’s response
to malaria, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS needed strengthening. The later changes were based on lessons
learned from other Bank operations showing that better results were more likely to be achieved with
targeted interventions (community-based nutrition) or with a specific population (high risk groups for
HIV/AIDS).

44. The implementation after the AF-1 (2008-2011) targeted six regions out of 13 for the nutrition
component, though the meningitis section had a national coverage. It targeted meningitis vaccines
and community nutrition based on a request of the authorities to the World Bank and because of a
widespread meningitis epidemic in the Sahel in 2007. During the early period of implementation of
the first restructuring, one technical breakthrough in the treatment of HIV/AIDS emerged, which
required a substantial amount of attention from both the Government and Bank teams. This also
affected the implementation of Component B and contributed to the subsequent restructuring.

45. The second AF (2012-2014) had a national coverage for both HIV/AIDS and nutrition. To
improve the achievement of the MDGs, the Bank has gradually targeted some specific areas of the
health sector such as nutrition, RH, and meningitis, which the second restructuring (2011) continued
the targeted. Despite the targeting of the project, the Bank remained a main player in the pooled fund
and continues to plan, harmonize, and implement projects with all partners and the MOH. Bank
support for pooled HIV/AIDS funding was continued under the second AF, but the Spanish Trust
Fund support targeted laboratory strengthening. The second donor of the pooled fund in HIV/AIDS
(the Dutch cooperation) left Burkina Faso for political reasons in 2012. Nevertheless, all donors and
stakeholders acknowledge the key role and contributions of the implementation untis PADS and SP-
CNLS in harmonizing, coordinating, and managing the HIV/AIDS response and health activities in
Burkina Faso.
46. Though PDO achievement and implementation progress were rated Satisfactory or Moderately
Satisfactory throughout project implementation, shortcomings were identified at different times. In
2006-07 (Original project), there were concerns about slow disbursement. In the period leading up to
the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in June 2009 during AF-1, there were concerns about: (i) the overly-
centralized nature of project decision-making (particularly for Component B); (ii) the fiduciary
performance (discussed below) of the project management units; and (iii) the availability and quality
of data to monitor project progress. Action plans were adopted after the MTR to address these
concerns. Finally, during AF-2 in 2011-2012, progress was slowed by: (i) inadequate performance of
the NGOs and village associations implementing the community-based nutrition program; and (ii)
insufficient resources for HIV/AIDS (until the second Additional Financing was approved in
February 2012).

47. Mid-term Review (MTR). It was a joint review led by the Government of Burkina Faso and
was very participatory. It had a significant and positive effect on the future course of project
implementation by laying out the issues impeding implementation and recommending several key
changes which were eventually made and improved implementation effectiveness. In the period
leading up to the Midterm Review (MTR) in June 2009, there were concerns about (a) the overly-
centralized nature of project decision making which affected the pace of implementation (Particularly
for Component B), (b) the low fiduciary performance (ref. para. 65) of the project management units

                                                                                                   26
which created delays during implementation, and (c) the availability and quality of data to properly
monitor project progress. Action plans were adopted after the MTR to address these concerns, which
affected positively the overall implementation capacity andallowed to streamline implementation and
improve the chances for the project to meet its objectives. Specifically, the following changes were
made: i) decentralization of the AIDS component; ii) a better coordination of the project management
units; iii) improved disbursement system of both components; and iv) an improvement of the nation
health management information system from traditional data collection system to a more
computerized, information management system (DISH2).

48. Finally, despite the delays in disbursement and implementation shortfalls the implementation
was smooth and allowed Ministry of health to deliver critically important health, AIDS and nutrition
activities, a results-based health pilot, and continued prevention activities through five NGOs, under
performance-based contracts.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

49. Design. The proposed measures for project M&E comprised a large number of indicators for
the original project (2006-2008), a broad range of data collection instruments, and separate
arrangements for use of the results for each component. The original project included 12 outcome
indicators (OIs: the number of OI was reduced from 12 to seven indicators (including 4 new) and 28
IOIs; baseline measures as well as annual and final targets were provided.

50. During the first AF (2008-2011), the Results Framework was adjusted to: (a) include new
performance indicators on nutrition outcomes (infant under six months in the intervention areas
exclusively breastfed in the past 24hrs) and effective meningitis control measures; (b) remove some
of the original OIs that had limited relevance and reduce them from twenty-eight to seven; and (c)
adjust the targets to reflect the new closing date. In addition to the routine data collection system
namely HMIS, the M&E was enhanced by progress reporting from the implementing Community-
based organization (CBOs and capacity strengthenin NGOs). As a result during the AF-1, for the OIs,
one new indicator was added as replacement (mainaining the total OI to seven). Similarly, two
intermediate outcome indicators have been added; i) the percentage of rural children under two
participating in the monthly community-based health and nutrition activities (growth monitoring and
promotion), and ii) the percentage of children under five with diarrhea in the last two weeks who were
correctly treated with oral rehydration therapy.

51. During the AF-2 (2012-2014), three new performance indicators on nutrition and HIV/AIDS
were proposed to replace indicators that were difficult to monitor (those were dropped from the
Results Framework that was adopted with the first AF) and/or do not reflect the scope of the second
AF. These three new core indicators are: i) pregnant woment receiving antenatal care during a visit
to a health provider (number) and ii) children under five with severe acute malnutrition being treated
according to the protocol (proportion) and iii) pregnant women being tested for HIV/AIDS (number).
Similarly, the number of IOI has been increased to 15 indicators (of which 5 are core sector
indicators); i) Children immunized (number); ii) Children receiving a dose of vitamin A (number); iii
)Post-partum women receiving a vitamin A supplement within the 8 weeks of delivery (proportion);
iv) Newborns put to the breast within the first hour of birth (proportion); v) health personnel receiving
training (number); vi) Men having sex with men reached with preventive interventions (number); vii)
Commercial sex workers reached with targeted interventions (number) and viii) People with access
to a basic package of health, nutrition or population services (percent increase based on number of

                                                                                                      27
people (number). Baselines and targets of all indicators were also revised during the 2008 and 2011
AF. Several new IOIs were added to replace and complement the initial Results Framework. These
changes were made as a result of the enhanced experience in nutrition programming and monitoring
of previous years’ implementation and the selected focus in support of the HIV/AIDS Strategic
Framework.

52. With a few exceptions, the Results Framework used standard indicators, which were well
understood by those collecting the data; the exceptions were three indicators for i) the correct
diagnosis and treatment of STI, ii) the number of children under the age of five with access to a basic
package of services, and iii) the case fatality rate for meningitis. The Results Framework reflected the
priorities of the project and included annual as well as final targets. The PAD acknowledged that
while medium- to long-term progress of the national program will be measured according to these
OIs, changes in these indicators will occur slowly and cannot be attributable to Bank financing alone.

53. Project monitoring tools included (a) semiannual interim financial reports (IFRs) on physical
and financial results as well as internal and external audits at all levels; (b) semiannual and annual
reports on the results of annual work plans and contracts/agreements with public entities at national,
provincial, district, and health facility levels and with NGOs and associations; and (c) the national
HMIS on the health service delivery results achieved.

54. Project evaluation instruments included periodic surveys and studies to evaluate project
outcomes and impact: the DHSs; Multi-indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS); National Nutrition Surveys
(Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions [SMART]; and the biennial
UNAIDS reports, EMC: the multisectoral survey; and the Behavioral Surveillance Survey (BSS).

55. Implementation. For the original project, the adoption of the M&E framework was followed
by an action plan for both components, guides for indicators, training tools and manuals. However,
the data for many indicators was difficult to collect, analyze and process. For the first and second AF
M&E was strengthened: technical and financial data for all indicators were available, namely: (i)
sufficient qualified technical staff, supplies, and working tools, and (ii) capacities of central and
decentralized bodies to document and analyse data.

56. Data collected by the MOH and the project are available for almost all of the original and
modified indicators, and a complete series of IFRs and annual reports were available for each of the
components. Finally, annual statistical summaries for the health sector were produced for the entire
period 2006–2014 and United Nations General Assembly (UNGASS) updates on the HIV/AIDS
situation and the national response were similarly available for the period 2003–2014. Though
concerns were occasionally expressed by various supervision missions about the availability and
quality of the data, the ICR mission found the information to be mostly complete and generally
consistent (with inconsistencies related in large measure to delays in receiving the data before the
publication of reports).

57. The following planned surveys and studies were regularly conducted: (a) the DHS/MICS in
2003 and 2010; (b) the Malaria Indicator Survey in 2009 and 2014; and (c) the National Nutrition




                                                                                                     28
Survey annually between 2009 and 2014. Finally, an MTR was conducted in 2009,12 and Project
Completion Reports for each component (as well as for the entire project) were prepared in 2014.13

58. The project strengthened the national M&E system by contributing to the review of the national
HMIS system: revision of the data collection tools; harmonization and integration of the various
collection tools associated with HMIS subsystems; achievement of total consensus on relevant
indicators considered priority for strengthening the HMIS and for monitoring the national health
strategy; development of a new Master Plan; and development of a dictionary of metadata which
takes into account all data from the HMIS.

59. Other important analytical initiatives were carried out, including studies (for example, health
expenditure tracking and health service quality) and technical support (for M&E, central drug
purchasing, and so on). Perhaps most importantly, operational research to pilot results-based
financing (RBF) was implemented in three health districts.14 A summary of the organization, results,
and conclusions of the pilot is presented in Annex 12.

60. Utilization. M&E results were made widely available (and in many instances posted online by
the MOH and SP-CNLS) and used by the different project management and coordination structures
to organize planning and supervise implementation of the annual work plans, specifically with respect
to the community nutrition program and the HIV/AIDS interventions for high-risk groups. The results
of the RBF pilot were incorporated into the Bank-funded RH operation in 2011 and will be scaled up
in 15 health districts. The project also provided support for key surveys (such as the DHS, MICS,
EMC, and BSS and research on AIDS and STI) to closely monitor the epidemiological and behavioral
trends.

61. M&E is rated as Substantial. The range and quality of the information collected, analyzed,
and disseminated during project implementation was significant for assessing the project’s progress
and for more in-depth analysis of sectoral issues (for example, financing and drug purchasing).
Shortcomings involved the project indicators (number, definition, and modification) and the possible
underutilization (for example, through secondary analysis) of the rich information available.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

62. Environment. Based on considerations of contaminated health care waste handling, storage,
and disposal, the original project was classified as a Category B operation. Subsequently, the first AF
was classified as Category C (as activities supported by the AF have no potential negative impacts),
while the second AF was classified as Category B (because of the AIDS treatment included in the
restructuring).

63. In 2005, an assessment of the existing policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and
practices was conducted, a Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP) formulated, and a detailed

12 The findings and recommendations of the MTR are summarized in Denise Vaillancourt, Leadership and
Governance in Burkina Faso’s Health Sector: Unleashing the Potential for Enhanced Sector-Wide Management &
Results (March 2013).
13 A final, comprehensive health survey (but with no HIV/AIDS component) was conducted in 2014, but the

results were not available as of May 2015.
14 The RBF pilot was jointly funded by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (payment of consultants

and child health issues) and the Bank (tool development, training, supervision, and district financing through the
annual action plans).
                                                                                                                  29
action plan prepared with the broad participation of future stakeholders in its implementation. The
plans emphasized the need for (a) changes in attitudes (among health workers and decision makers),
(b) adoption of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework, and (c) development and adequate
financing of measures for effective and efficient management of medical waste.

64. Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) throughout project implementation rated
project compliance with environmental safeguards as Satisfactory or (for a limited period around the
MTR) Moderately Satisfactory. However, though the strategy was adopted in 2005 and disseminated
in the regions between 2006 and 2008, the basic tools for implementing the strategy at hospital level
were not adopted (by decree) until 2008 and staff sensitization and training was sporadic. In 2008,
the MOH identified poorly defined responsibilities and a lack of resources as reasons for the slow
implementation. Measures were introduced to: (a) ensure better planning and coordination between
the two MOH structures responsible for MWM; (b) strengthen MWM capacities of regional, district,
and hospital personnel; and (c) improve reporting on the implementation of the MWMP.

65. In 2011, the MWMP was evaluated and updated for the period 2011–2015. Important progress
was noted, particularly the acquisition of 52 incinerators (for the 11 regional hospitals and other large
health facilities) and other material, but many of the problems (organizational, financial, technical,
and attitudinal) noted in earlier assessments persisted. In October 2014, a supervision mission
assessed MWM in each of the 13 regions and concluded that (a) appropriate MWM structures were
not present in most health facilities (except for hospitals); (b) maintenance of the incinerators was
absent and the majority15 were not functioning; (c) materials, training, and financial resources were
inadequate; and (d) transport and disposal were poorly organized. A Bank assessment of the 2011–
2015 plan found that only two third of the planned activities had been achieved or partially achieved.

66. Fiduciary compliance: Procurement and FM were generally rated Satisfactory and
Moderately Satisfactory except for FM, which was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory throughout 2009
(details provided below).

67. Procurement. Arrangements were straightforward; based on previous experience, the
procurement capabilities of the PADS management unit, to be complemented by recruitment of an
internationally qualified procurement consultant, were judged to be satisfactory. Periodic reviews of
both units by the Bank fiduciary services indicated persistent shortcomings: delayed procurement
planning, lengthy bid evaluations, weak contract administration, and poor document management.
Action plans were regularly prepared, implemented, and monitored. Risk was generally rated
Moderate but elevated to Substantial during the assessment of May 2014. It was mitigated by the
recruitment of a new experienced procurement specialist for the project.

68. Financial Management. At appraisal, the required project accounting policies and procedures
needed to be strengthened for Component A and were not yet fully in place for Component B.
Consequently, the risk associated with the accounting policies and procedures was rated Moderate
for PADS and High for SP-CNLS. For Component A, PADS maintained the existing arrangements
with the project FM unit managing the pooled funds while capacity for the MOH’s Directorate of
Budget and Finance was being strengthened. For Component B, the MAP project management unit
was to be integrated (with other project units) into the reorganized SP-CNLS to form a common FM


15
  Though data are incomplete at the health center level, 14 of the 25 incinerators at the regional and hospital
levels were not functioning.
                                                                                                             30
unit. A capacity-building action plan was agreed to with SP-CNLS, to strengthen the Directorate of
Budget and Finance to better manage and monitor funds of the SP-CNLS. Standard periodic reviews
were carried out by national authorities and annual reviews by private, external auditors.

69. FM assessments over the life of the project were generally positive for Component A;
weaknesses were noted for Component B, including in staffing, record keeping, and financial
monitoring. In addition, Component B had issues with ineligible expenditures in 2008, but these were
resolved and not repeated.16 All of the audits for both components were unqualified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

70. The Bank assisted the government in the creation of the PADS and promoted harmonized
implementation arrangements and pooled funding, including all major health partners such as United
Nations agencies (UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO), the Dutch cooperation, the German cooperation,
the Global Alliance for Vaccin and Immunization, the Global Fund, and the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation (with several other key contributors as noted in Annex 11).Overall, the post completion
situations for Component A and Component B are good. The current Reproductive Health Project 17
(approved December 20, 2011) focuses on mother and child health services but also includes
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and nutrition services (which are among the outputs to be remunerated under the
RBF). In the pool, the Kerditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), Agence Francaise de Développement
(AFD), and UNFPA also fund the same activities. The community nutrition activities are also
supported by UNICEF, the World Food Programme, the European Union, and the government of
Burkina Faso.

71. The government recently launched its National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan for 2015–2020. The
plan aims to (a) reduce the number of new infections in the general population; (b) achieve universal
treatment and care for PLWHAs; and (c) reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS on orphans and vulnerable
children (OVC). The new strategic plan will be financed by the Ministry of Finance (in 2014 the
government contributed up to US$16 million) and development partners such as the Bank, the Global
Fund, and United Nations agencies. As a follow-up project in health and AIDS, a first AF of US$25-
US$60 million (to be confirmed) to the Reproductive Health project is under consideration.
HIV/AIDS activities will be implemented with resources secured from the Global Fund (Round 10
for US$35 million) to scale up the existing national response in prevention, treatment, care, and
support for those affected.

3.   Assessment of Outcomes

72. The outcomes of this project are rated on the basis of results for three separate phases: 2006-
2008, 2008-2011 and 2011-2014.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation




16
   Ineligible expenditures amounting to approximately US$110,000 involved outstanding balances of
advances not accounted for by the subprogram beneficiaries after several Bank reminders.
17
   The Reproductive Health Project comprises an IDA Grant (in the amount of US$28.9 million) and a grant
from the Multi-Donor Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (in the amount of US$12.7 million).
                                                                                                       31
73.    Relevance is rated Substantial, based on a high relevance for project objectives and a
substantial relevance for project design and implementation

74. Relevance of project objectives. Overall relevance of the project’s objectives is rated High.
For the original project relevance of objectives is Substantial, the PDO was consistent with Burkina’s
commitments to: (i) the MDG; (ii) the poverty reduction and health development strategies adopted
by the Government; and (iii) the promotion of reforms (decentralization, governance, etc.),
harmonized external assistance, and results-based management. These commitments were included
in the PNDS (2001-2010) and the CSLS (2006-10) and were reiterated in the most recent PNDS
(2011-20) and CSLS (2011-2015).18

75. For AF-1 relevance of objective is High, the project was consistent with the Bank’s CAS 2006-
09 and maintained in the CAS 2009-12, which supported: (i) increased use and quality of primary
health services, emphasizing vaccination coverage, prenatal care, assisted births, and contraceptive
use and ii) scaling-up of malaria prevention and treatment programs, especially by expanding the
coverage of treated bed-nets. During AF-2, while redesigned, the PDO remained consistent with CPS
2013-2016 and country strategies. It focused on (i) improved coverage and effectiveness of
HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs; and (iii) strengthening multi-sectoral
interventions to address persistent child malnutrition. Therefore, relevance of objectives for AF-2 is
High.

76. Relevance of project design and implementation. Design strengths included: (a) financing
of the recognized best practices for interventions in each of the priority areas: health system
strengthening, health financing through result-based financing, mother and child health, HIV/AIDS,
malaria, and nutrition (beginning with the first AF); and (b) implementation arrangements, which
respected already established governance and stewardship responsibilities for the MOH and SP-
CNLS and built on existing institutional arrangements and capabilities within functioning units at
national and subnational levels. In addition, the investment in M&E provided an unprecedented
amount of information on the evolution of the health sector and the national response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. Therefore, on balance, relevance of design was Substantial for original project
(2006-2008), Substantial for AF-1 (2008-2011) and Substantial under the AF-2.

77. Implementation: Burkina Faso’s health pooling fund has encouraged and supported during
its implementation, a joint approach to three strategic sector management tasks: (i) evidence-based
sector dialogue to inform sound, coherent policy and strategy; (ii) resource allocation (planning,
programming, priority setting) to ensure rational, equitable use of sector resources; and (iii) the
monitoring, review, and evaluation of sector performance for improved results focus and outcomes.
The project contributed significantly to smooth and efficient implementation of regional- and district-
level plans and as well as to high predictability of all available technical and financial support.
Therefore, relevance of implementation is Substantial for the original project, AF-1 and AF-2.

78. Based on the assessments above, the rating for relevance for each of the three phases is
Substantial.




18
  Other laws and policies were adopted during project implementation, e.g., a nutrition policy (2007), a law
protecting the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS (2008), a gender policy (2009), etc.
                                                                                                            32
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

79.    The achievement of the project development objective is based on the original and revised
PDO. The original PDO was to “support implementation of the Recipient’s program which aims at
improving health and fight against HIV/AIDS on the Recipient’s territory.” The assessment of this
objective is based on progress against key performance indicators and overall project implementation
during original phase 1, AF-1 and AF-2. Original project and AF-1 were impleneted under PDO#1,
while AF-2 was implemented under PDO#2. Overall, project achievement is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. Two-thirds of the project’s targets were fully achieved (the proportion for Component
A was higher than for Component B), and almost half of the MDG targets were either fully or partially
achieved.

80. PDO #1: Original & AF-1 project 2006-2008 and 2008-2011): The PDO focused
successively on (a) accelerating progress toward the MDGs for health and nutrition and for combating
HIV/AIDS, (b) improving health and combating HIV/AIDS, and (c) improving access and quality of
priority health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS services. The medium and long term objective was to support
the country to contribute to progress toward the health, nutrition, and HIVIAIDS MDGs, including
reducing child and maternal mortality, combating child malnutrition, strengthening family planning,
and decreasing HIV prevalence (particularly among young adults). For the first phase of the PDO,
original project (2006-2008), the PDO was Moderately Unsatisfactory, while the PDO for the AF-
1 is rated Moderately Satisfactory. As the health pooled funding and HIV/AIDS Control Strategies
framework were a national endeavor involving many partners and stakeholders, the achievement of
development objectives cannot be attributed solely to the World Bank Project, but it nevertheless
provided a sizeable portion of the funds and technical assistance used to implement the strategies.

81. Improving access and quality of priority health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS services. Project
funding supported two types of outputs: (a) performance agreements with public and private agencies,
NGOs, CSOs, and communities to provide services to the targeted beneficiaries; and (b) procured
goods and consumables to implement the performance agreements. The outputs are summarized in
Annex 10. Linked to these outputs were targets to measure project achievement of IOIs and OIs for
maternal and child health services, nutrition, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases (malaria,
meningitis, and TB). The results are presented by area in Annex 13.

82. Maternal and child health services. The project contributed to the improvement of access to
health services by training 8,500 community health workers (IOI 25: Number of community health
workers trained) and contributing to an increase from 75 percent to 90 percent of health centers
meeting staffing norms for qualified personnel (IOI 26: percentage of health centers meeting staffing
norms for qualified personnel).

83. Based on HMIS results, the quality of RH services improved over the project period. The
proportion of women receiving two or more prenatal consultations during pregnancy increased from
57.4 percent (2006) to 93.00 percent (CMS 2014) (OI 2); and the proportion of births attended by
skilled personnel at health facilities almost doubled, from 44.5 percent (2006) to 82.2 percent (CMS
2014) (OI 1). Referral care has improved with the rate of cesarean sections increasing by more than
50 percent, from 1.4 percent (2009) to 2.2 percent (2014) (IOI 1). The proportion of women using
modern contraceptives increased considerably, from 18.6 percent (2006) to 34.3 percent (2014) (IOI
3).


                                                                                                  33
84. A number of child health indicators improved over the project period. Access to a basic
package of health and nutrition services improved steadily for children under the age of five years,
from 1.65 million (2010) to 1.92 million (2014) (IOI 4). Immunization rates improved (a) for children
under the age of one year, the proportion receiving a third dose of pentavalent vaccine (DTC3)
hovered around 100 percent throughout the period (IOI 4); and (b) for children 12–23 months old the
proportion of completely immunized exceeded the target (IOI 6). The proportion of children under
the age of five years receiving oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea did not improve, declining from
23.3 percent (2006) to 21.2 percent (2010) (IOI 13).

85. HIV/AIDS. Project financed interventions emphasized awareness and prevention, testing, and
treatment and care. Awareness activities at the community level were financed throughout, but the
focus shifted to the most at-risk populations: sex workers and men who have sex with men (MSM).
Between 2006 and 2010, 6,000 communities on average were implementing HIV/AIDS activities;
thereafter, the shift to a more focused approach reduced the number of communities to 1,546 annually
(IOI 18).

86. Disease control: Progress has been made on controlling malaria and TB, but no data are
available on the impact of the project’s meningitis support (IOI 15), for which the project financed
vaccines. For malaria, bed net coverage has increased: the project’s target was achi eved (IOI 10), and
more than nine million treated bed nets have been distributed since 2006. The proportion of children
sleeping under treated bed nets has increased from 9.6 percent (2006) to 44 percent (2010), according
to the DHS/MICS and from 59.6 percent (2009) to 76.8 percent (2014), according to the Malaria
Indicator Survey (OI 6). The proportion of malaria cases treated according to recommended protocols
(that is, with ACT) reached 90.5 percent in 2014 (IOI 11). HMIS data show that over the period 2006–
2014, the case fatality rate for children under the age of five years who were treated for severe malaria
declined at both health center level, from 5.55 percent (2006) to 1.41 percent (2014) and at hospital
level (but much less dramatically), from 8.71 percent (2006) to 7.68 percent (2014) (IOI 12). The cure
rate for TB remained steady (between 73 and 78 percent) throughout the entire period (IOI 14).

87. The proportion of children under the age of five years who are sleeping under insecticide-
treated bed nets has been achieved, increasing from 9.6 percent in 2006 to 75.3 percent in 2014
(against a target of 70 percent). The case fatality rate for severe malaria has declined annually since
2006 (from 6.3 percent to two percent, against a target of four percent). The proportion of TB cases
detected has not been achieved (21.7 percent in 2010 against a target of 70 percent, but progress has
been made on the proportion of TB cases cured under directly observable treatment (75.6 percent in
2014 against a target of 85 percent).

88. Nutrition. Phase one of nutrition implementation was carried out in six regions of the country.
According to project data, access to community-based services has increased; the proportion of rural
children under the age of five years participating in monthly community-based health and nutrition
activities has increased from 23 percent (2011) to 79 percent (2014) (IOI 7).

89. Nutrition practices have improved for the three principal targeted groups. For newborns, the
proportion put to the breast in the first hour of birth increased from 20 percent (2009) to 41.6 percent
(2014) (IOI 7). For infants under six months of age, the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed in
the previous 24 hours increased from 16 percent (2009) to 50.1 percent (2014) (OI 10). For children
6–59 months old, the proportion receiving vitamin A supplements in the previous six months


                                                                                                      34
increased from 33 percent to 63 percent between 2006 and 2010 (according to the DHS/MICS) and
to 91 percent in 2014 (according to the National Nutrition Survey) (IOI 9).19

90. PDO #2: AF-2 (2012-2014): The revised PDO under AF-2 was to “improve access and quality
of priority health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS services.” The main part of the support during the AF-2
was (i) the scaling up of a basic package of essential direct nutrition actions at family and community
level as defined in the National Health Development Plan to all 13 regions through support to the
annual outsourcing to NGOs and CBOs and of regional and district health plans; and (ii) coordination,
monitoring and evaluation of nutrition actions; and iii) funding for the strategic priorities and
objectives focused on prevention and promotion activities. The overall rating of PDO#2 nder AF-2 is
Moderately Satisfactory.

91. Since 2011 for HIV/AIDS, approximately 20,000 sex workers on average have been reached
annually (IOI 19); over the same period, 2,200 MSM on average have been reached annually with
preventive interventions (IOI 20).

92. Over the project’s implementation period, HIV/AIDS’ prevention measures progressed slowly.
An annual average of more than 22 million condoms were sold or distributed, but the number did not
increase significantly (IOI 17). In addition, the proportion of young adults (15–24 years old) using
condoms during sexual intercourse with a non-regular partner increased only slightly for females (52
percent to 66 percent between 2003 and 2010) but not at all for males (69 percent to 70 percent) (OI
7). Reported condom use among sex workers with paying clients has, however, exceeded 98 percent
(OI 3).

93. Voluntary counseling and testing advanced with the number of persons getting tested
increasing from approximately 200,000 (2006) to more than 330,000 (2013) (IOI 21). Testing for
HIV among pregnant women has increased dramatically from 45,000 or 45 percent of antenatal care
(ANC) women to 706,000 or 86 percent of ANC women (OI 12).20

94. Diagnosed cases of STI increased from 109,000 cases (2006) to 172,000 cases (2012) and have
remained at that level since. Similarly, the proportion of correctly treated cases increased to 100
percent (2011 and 2012) before declining to 88.3 percent (2013) and 76.4 percent (2014) (OI 8). As
a result of changes in the MOH’s treatment protocol, STI treatment kits were not procured after 2006
and stock outs were not measured (IOI 16).

95. Treatment of people infected with HIV has expanded rapidly. The number of women testing
positive for HIV has more than doubled, from 2,383 (2006) to 4,872 (2014), but the proportion
receiving treatment for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) has increased from 78.9
percent (2006) to 92.1 percent (2014) (OI 4). Over the same period, the number of infected people
receiving ARV drugs has increased from 8,136 (2005) to 45,980 (2014) (OI 9).

96. Care and support for persons infected and affected (particularly OVC) by the epidemic has
varied considerably with the availability of project funding. Between 2006 and 2010, 41,786 PLWHA
received psychosocial support; since 2011, 41,058 PLWHA have benefitted from support (OI 5). Over

19
   No data were available on the proportion of postpartum women receiving vitamin A supplement within 8 weeks
of delivery (IOI 2).
20 The proportion of pregnant women testing positive for HIV declined from 5.3 percent in 2006 to 0.69 percent in

2014.
                                                                                                              35
the period 2006–2010, an average of 134,896 OVC received care and support; the average annual
number increased to 160,777 over the period 2011–2014 (IOI 22). Over the period 2010–2014, an
average of 47,990 OVC received free schooling or reduced school fees (IOI 23).

97. Dring AF-2 (nutrition phase 2) activities covers the whole country and contributes to decrease
malnutrition. The project funded nutritional survey each year. Acute malnutrition among children
under the age of five years has declined from 2.4 percent (2011) to 1.7 percent (2014), and the
proportion of these children being treated according to the new protocol has increased from 30 percent
in 2010 to 89.6 percent in 2014 (according to the HMIS) (OI 11).

98. Accelerating progress toward the MDGs. The principal MDGs targeted by the project were
MDG 1, MDG 4, MDG 5, and MDG 6. The overall results are presented in Annex 14 and show that
the project contributed to fully achieving six and partially achieving three of the 20 targets. Some
progress was made on six additional targets and a comparison of Burkina Faso’s results with other
countries in the subregion indicates that the country’s performance matches that of other countries.21

99. MDG 1 (Halve the 1990 proportion of people suffering from hunger). The proportion of
underweight children less than the age of 5 years actually increased over the period 1990–2010, but
has declined since and is currently estimated at 20.1 percent (against a target of 17 percent). This
decline coincides with the investments in community health and nutrition.

100. MDG 4 (Reduce under-five mortality rates by two-thirds). The childhood immunization rate
for measles has been achieved at 99.3 percent (against a target of 80 percent), but infant mortality per
1,000 (estimated in 2010 at 65 against a target of 40 is now 42.68 per 1000 in 2014) and under-five
mortality per 1,000 (estimated in 2014 at 81.61 -CMS 2014- against a target of 68) have not.

101. MDG 5 (Reduce maternal mortality by three-quarters and achieve universal access to
reproductive health). The proportion of women with at least two ANC visit was 84.8 percent in 2014
(against a target of 100 percent), and the proportion of total births attended by skilled health staff was
85.4 percent in 2014 (against a target of 60.0 percent). Other measures of maternal health have not
been achieved: (a) maternal mortality (341 per 100,000 in 2010 against a target of 141.5) and (b)
contraceptive prevalence (15 percent against a target of 45 percent).

102. MDG 6 (Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases). Though knowledge of the disease
and condom use by 15–24 year olds has not been achieved, the prevalence rate among this target
population (as well as for the larger group of 15–49 year olds) has been achieved (0.72 percent against
a target of 0.77 percent). The proportion of the population with advanced HIV having access to ARV
treatment has increased dramatically (from 24.7 percent in 2006 to 59.7 percent in 2014) but the target
of 100 percent has not been achieved.

3.3 Efficiency:

103. While an analysis was conducted for the preparation of the HSSMAP in 2006, mostly
analyzing the overall expenditures for the sector and cost-effectiveness of health interventions
according to literature, an economic analysis was not conducted. It was explained by the fact that the


       21
1.          The countries which served for comparison were Benin, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Togo.

                                                                                                        36
resources allocated by the project were pooled and the project supported the overall health and
HIV/AIDS programs.

104. For instance, advocacy on HIV/AIDS was done through contracting with communities and
existing NGOs. Partnerships with local councils have been fostered, not only for efficiency but also
for sustainability. Similarly, the Project has implemented some “task -shifting” to increase the
capacities of existing health workers (i.e. nurses) for providing high-quality HIV/AIDS treatment. As
for the efficiency of the interventions as implemented by the Project, there are several facts suggesting
that HIV/AIDS interventions have been implemented by the Project in an efficient way. In general,
for its implementation, the Project has not created new entities but rather built on existing
organizations. The project played an essential role in preparing the sector funds pooling and sector
wide-approach through enhancing institutional capacity at the MOH, strengthening decentralized
levels of the health system, and improving allocative efficiency of resources to improve health
outcomes. Despite these positive contributions to efficiency, the project faced the inherent difficulties
of: (i) planning and budgeting work programs for more than 300 entities a year on average (see Annex
10); (ii) disbursing resources and accounting for expenditures and results; (iii) organizing central
procurement (using Bank and country procedures) and distribution of the goods acquired; and (iv)
monitoring and reporting on the results achieved. Therefore, for all these reasons, efficiency for the
original project is rated as Modest.

105. With the first AF in 2008, the analysis demonstrated the high cost-effectiveness of
interventions to be funded, for example, economic returns of nutrition interventions with cost-benefit
ratios above five. To the extent possible, the data available to conduct an analysis was used to
highlight (a) the development impact of the project and (b) the efficiency of the completed activities.
The project investments created both direct and indirect benefits for the population. However, due to
the approach of the project (to fund the health and HIV/AIDS programs partly through common
funds), it is difficult to make the attribution of results and the estimation of the costs and benefits of
the project’s approach (that is, to link the funds allocated, the goods and services procured, and the
achievements of the different agencies involved). Thus, efficiency for the first AF is Modest.

106. The PDO (as revised by the second AF of 2011) was to “Improve access and quality of priority
health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS services.” To achieve this objective, the project supported
implementation of the national health strategy and the national HIV/AIDS strategy through its two
components; 58 percent of project investments went toward implementation of Component A
(support to the health strategy including nutrition) and 42 percent for implementation of the
Component B (support to the national multisectoral HIV/AIDS strategy). Interventions of the project
targeted funds to the most vulnerable of the population (poor, children, and pregnant women) and
therefore help improve not only their health status but also help increase labor productivity and
contribute in the medium term to the growth of the economy. For example, malnutrition has an impact
on economic growth through three paths: (a) direct loss of productivity from poor physical status
(estimated at 10 percent of lifetime earnings for individuals); (b) indirect loss from poor cognitive
function and deficits in schooling; and (c) increased health care costs. Though the analysis reveals a
positive return on investment, making the interventions economically worthwhile, efficiency for this
second AF rated as Modest.

107. From 2007 to its closure in 2014, the project led to several measures of direct impact, which
included, among others, a higher utilization of maternal health services, increased coverage of high
impact child services (nutrition, immunization, and malaria care), better prevention and care of
                                                                                                       37
HIV/AIDS, and improved nutrition status (as detailed in the Results Framework analysis). While
indirect benefits are difficult to quantify, the development impact is potentially substantial. Synergies
between health status, poverty, and growth have been well established.

108. Allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency of the project is considered as high as interventions
funded by Components A and B are key strategic priorities for the development and health sector of
Burkina Faso. Moreover, by its design the project aimed to strengthen allocative efficiency by (a)
prioritizing interventions known to be cost-effective and to disproportionately benefit the poor, (b)
using transparent criteria to determine funding amounts by program, level, and service delivery
characteristics (population, facilities, and so on), and (c) allowing flexibility for agencies to plan and
budget priority interventions and activities based on the local disease burden.

109. Productive efficiency. The project was expected to be implemented using the most cost-
effective ways such as competitive bidding processes for key public health commodities, to achieve
the desired outputs. As shown in Annex 2, the project focused on key public health commodities
(contraceptive materials, vaccines and vaccination supplies, bed nets, ACT, HIV test kits, first-line
ART, TB treatment, and so on) and procured goods and services at the national level to ensure that
the procedures were correctly followed and that the lowest cost was obtained. The project negotiated
fixed costs with the NGOs and community based associations for the kinds of services and budget
ceilings for the quantity of services they were to provide. This ensured both economies in
implementation and ease of monitoring results and expenditures.

110. Implementation efficiency. Project implementation arrangements contributed in important
ways to project efficiency with (a) utilization of pooled funding (and certain harmonized procedures)
and (b) reliance on a mix of existing public and private (mostly nonprofit NGOs and CSOs) agencies
with comparative advantages for delivering services to communities. Implementation efficiency was
however affected by the fact that, the project financed the work programs of more than 300 entities a
year on average, excluding the communities (almost 4,000 on average). These arrangements increased
the transaction cost for coordination and supervision (especially for Component B).

111. Technical efficiency. The interventions included in the project are technically sound and
consistent with the scientific literature about recommended priority, high-impact interventions to
reduce child and maternal mortality rates (detailed in Annex 3 with cost per disability-adjusted life
year [DALY] saved). Health interventions that cost less than US$100 per DALY are considered
highly cost-effective by international standards. Thus, interventions funded by the project can be
considered Subtantially cost-effective.

113. Relevance was Substantial throughout. Efficacy was Modest during the initial phase (as
disbursements for Component A were low and for Component B were negligible). Beginning in 2008
and for the rest of the project, efficacy was Substantial. For the reasons indicated above, efficiency is
rated Modest for all three periods of the project: original phase, AF-1 and AF-2). Based on these
ratings, the overall project outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

114. Based on the project’s original and revised PDO and indicators and the ICR guidelines
(requiring separate ratings, weighted in proportion to the actual disbursements before and after the
formal restructurings), Table 2 presents the split evaluation analysis which also confirms the overall
project rating as Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
115. By supporting reproductive and child health care, community nutrition services, and disease
prevention and control, the project focused on (a) the poorest and most vulnerable populations which
are most likely to be disproportionately affected by poor health services and (b) the most
demonstrably effective health interventions for these targeted populations. In addition, the
community-based focus was essential, given (a) the importance of social and cultural beliefs that
influence maternal and child care, nutritional practices, and sexual behavior and (b) the demonstrated
benefits of community mobilization to legitimize the proposed interventions and monitor
achievement.

116. The project’s impact on HIV/AIDS resulted from: (a) its emphasis on policies and guidelines
for prevention, treatment, and protection; (b) its support for a multisectoral response to the epidemic
by mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities into the action plans of key public sector ministries, private
sector enterprises, and CSOs; and (c) its recognition of the importance of including socially
marginalized groups (CSW, MSM, inmates, PLWHA and their families, OVC) in the national
dialogue about the epidemic and the response to its spread.

117. Finally, by defining specific activities and performance indicators, the annual action plans
prepared by the various recipients of project funds contributed to establishing expectations for
progress in the health sector and ways to measure the progress. While the agreements did not include
penalties for nonperformance, there was improvement in leadership, transparency and stewardship.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
118. The project contributed to several key institutional changes, including (a) arrangements for
more effective use of external assistance through pooled funding; (b) improved implementation
capacities of public and private agencies; (c) decentralization of and accountability for financial
resources through support for annual, performance-based action plans at regional, district, and health
facility levels; and (d) use of Burkina Faso’s extensive network of local organizations and associations
to contract for health and nutrition service delivery at family and community levels. In addition, new
structures (for example, the National RBF Technical Unit) were created to implement the RBF pilot
and subsequent RBF scale-up within the Reproductive Health Project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
121. Over the past decade, Burkina Faso has demonstrated political commitment to and ownership
of (a) appropriate national policies, sectoral strategies, and programmatic guidelines; (b) functional
institutional arrangements and participatory mechanisms at all levels; (c) adequate fiduciary

                                                                                                     40
management (though difficulties with planning, budgeting, procurement, and FM persist); and (d)
complementary survey and routine data collection systems to track progress in health and HIV/AIDS.
From this perspective, the risks would seem to be negligible to low.

122. Though the Bank-financed RH project addresses many of the concerns of Component A, there
are, however, potential risks linked to financing, that is, (a) overall funding for health and HIV/AIDS;
and (b) the use of harmonized arrangements (and particularly pooled funding). First, the completion
of the project poses risks for the continuation of nutrition activities (Component A) and for the range
of preventive HIV/AIDS activities (Component B). In both cases, alternative available funding will
not replace the amounts previously provided by the project. Second, for both components, the
proportion of funds managed through the pooled accounts has progressively declined to about 10
percent. Consequently, one of the essential principles of Burkina Faso’s approach to health sector
leadership may need to be reinforced.

123. In addition, because the project addresses issues so closely related to sociocultural attitudes,
there are concerns about how quickly awareness can be translated into behavioral change. Some
project interventions seem to have changed behavior significantly and perhaps permanently (ANC,
Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission, and so on, but others have proven more difficult to
change (contraceptive prevalence, nutritional practices, condom use, management of biomedical
waste, and so on).

5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
124. The PAD preparation was consistent with Burkina Faso’s ambitious commitments (to the
MDGs, the Paris Declaration, and so on); the Bank’s strategies (for country assistance through the
PRSCs and the use of sector-wide approaches, including pooled funding); the country’s
implementation experience (Health and Nutrition Project, MAP, and TAP); and the detailed sector
information available (the 2005 project expenditure review, the 1998 and 2003 DHS, and the 2003–
2005 UNGASS reports, among others). The PAD thoroughly addressed health sector strengths and
weaknesses and the PDO reflected CAS objectives, government policies, and sectoral priorities and
strategies. Design alternatives were carefully considered, a broad range of stakeholders was consulted,
a consensus on fiduciary arrangements was reached, and a thorough analysis of environmental
elements was prepared.

125. There were several shortcomings, which included: (a) a relatively broad range of objectives
and activities to be planned and budgeted annually; (b) a large number of indicators, a few of which
were not sufficiently clear; and (c) insufficient linkages between the sectoral reforms (in the PRSC)
and the service delivery improvements (in the project).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
126. Bank supervision was characterized by (a) the constant in-country presence of Bank staff; (b)
the continuity of the task team leader (after 2009); and (c) the ongoing dialogue with the government
and the other partners active in the common fund. Project supervision was regular and missions
                                                                                                     41
comprised a good mix of technical and program implementation specialists. Given the national scope
and the number of implementing actors, on-site supervision was necessarily limited, but the missions
provided meticulous follow-up on outstanding project issues in each aide memoire. As indicated in
the project’s completion report, the quality of the advice and the timeliness of the recommendations
were appreciated by the project stakeholders. The supervision was generally flexible and proactive.
The periodic revision of the indicators and targets made project monitoring through the ISRs difficult;
and the ratings in the ISRs did not always seem to correspond with the (more critical) findings of the
aide memoires with respect to the FM assessments, the post-procurement reviews, and the
environmental evaluations.

127. Finally, more attention might have been paid to the associated sectoral reform issues,
particularly human resources and sector financing, which were among the early indicators and
essential for the overall success of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
Since April 2010, the task management has been stable in-country. The day-to-day dialogue and
implementation support involving relevant specialists have been valuable. The Bank was flexible in
accommodating the request of the Government on the meningitis epidemic, though there was a delay
in providing the first AF.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
128. Government ownership and institutional oversight were established at all levels through the
adoption/updating of policies and strategies and the functioning of the various institutions set up to
regularly review the results of the health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS interventions. In addition to the
development of a common enabling environment, three additional government contributions were
important to the success of the project: (a) productive relationships with donors, partners, and other
stakeholders; (b) commitment not only to youths and pregnant women but also to the specific drivers
of the epidemic—CSWs, drug users, and MSM; and (c) investment in studies and surveys to monitor
the health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS situation in the country.

129. Though counterpart financing was not required at any time during project implementation, the
government’s contribution to SP-CNLS for the national HIV/AIDS response was significant,
averaging approximately US$600,000 annually.22

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
130. Component implementation units. Both project components benefited from the continuity
and experience of the project management units established under previous projects: PADS for
Component A and SP-CNLS for Component B. Though the units operated independently from each
other, coordination was enhanced by a Memorandum of Understanding, signed in 2010. Both units

22
     Civil unrest in 2011 and political unrest in late 2014 do not seem to have greatly affected performance.
                                                                                                                42
were (a) staffed by qualified professionals with minimal turnover and (b) committed to the project’s
technical objectives and organizing principles. Both units worked effectively with the oversight
bodies established by the government and with their financial partners; program reviews were
conducted regularly and credible information was available for examination.

131. There were some difficulties decentralizing implementation: (a) for Component A, the district
health teams and the NGOs experienced ongoing tensions with respect to the nutrition program; and
(b) for Component B, the SP-CNLS was unable to effectively decentralize fiduciary matters to the
regions. Regular supervision missions and annual audits were conducted.

132. Administratively, the implementing agencies complied with the dated covenants, the IFRs and
audits were (generally) submitted on time, and informative annual reports were prepared promptly.
The ISRs did not distinguish between the implementing agencies’ performance, but the aide memoires
suggest that fiduciary performance of the PADS was better than that of SP-CNLS. The supervision
mission aide memoires indicate that agreed-upon actions were carried out, though sometimes with
delays.

133. Other implementing agencies. The performance of the other implementing partners was
generally adequate. For Component A, a single NGO (Renforcement de capacities-RENCAP)
provided the agreed-upon nutrition services through its affiliated community-based associations. For
Component B, six NGOs organized community-based services for specific populations (CSWs,
MSM, OVC, and so on) throughout the country. In both cases, budget allocations were regularly
disbursed and services provided as scheduled. Timely submission of program reports and financial
receipts was a problem throughout project implementation. Occasional communication problems with
communities and coordination difficulties with MOH structures improved over time.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The client demonstrated great leadership and ownership that created a genuine enabling environment.
The first AF was granted upon request from the Head of State to the WBG. Though counterpart
financing was not formally required, the Government’s contribution to HIV/AIDS activities averaged
approximately US$600,000 the first two years and US$16 million annually since 2013 (national
budget). In addition, the authorities developed key strategic documents including National Health
Development Strategy for the respective periods of 2001-2010/2011-2020 and National Multisectoral
HIV/AIDS Strategy for 2001-2005/2006-2010. The overall donor coordination and funding improved,
thanks to pooled funding approach. The established institutional arrangements performed well, but
some shortcomings were registered, especially concerning the decentralization of activities towards
the health district. Finally, the 2014 political turmoil did not have any impact on the funding and
implementation of the operation as this situation coincided with the closure of the project.


6.   Lessons Learned

134. Establishing an enabling environment for program achievement may be easier than
sustaining it. Projects are most effective when political leadership provides an enabling environment
for program achievement and program achievement provides a justification for continued political
commitment. Burkina Faso succeeded in combining several reinforcing elements for the enabling
environment: political and strategic orientations (PRSP, PNDS, CSLS); institutional arrangements
                                                                                                  43
(harmonized procedures, participatory decision making including all stakeholders); fiduciary and
administrative modalities (pooled funding, decentralization); and programmatic decisions and results
(community-based services, results-based contracting).

135. Sustaining a contribution to these mutually reinforcing relationships is particularly difficult for
external funding agencies since over time: (a) changing leadership within these agencies requires
constant consensus building; (b) perceptions of the utility of investing time in sector coordination and
harmonization differ; and (c) pressures to link individual agency financing with specific results can
become critical. Despite Burkina Faso’s continued support for the strategic orientations above, there
has been a gradual attrition of support from the partners for certain key elements (and for pooled
funding in particular). Such evolving priorities may have potential implications for the expansion of
the RBF initiative currently being financed by the Bank.

136. Government ownership and leadership is a core requirement for successful institutional
arrangements and therefore establishing the institutional framework for program implementation is
an essential step during the preparation phase. Project implementation arrangements may also
compensate for a lack of sectoral reform, at least in the short term. Because key country reform
elements (such as decentralization, human and financial resource management, procurement, and so
on) advance slowly, projects often provide a means to achieve the reforms, at least in a limited
fashion. Many of the project’s initiatives were in advance of the country’s general politico -
administrative agenda and enabled the sector to demonstrate both the potential strengths and
weaknesses of the proposed reforms. This was the case, for example, in the successful effort to
decentralize management in the health sector and the less successful results for SP-CNLS and
HIV/AIDS.

137. In the long run, however, project implementation arrangements cannot replace sectoral and
country-level reforms. The establishment of two project accounts was intended to be an interim
measure until the national procurement law was adopted (tentatively in 2009) but remained in place
to the end of the project while the law continues to be deliberated.

138. The project demonstrates the importance of donor harmonization/alignment through
pooled funding to increase donor trust and reduce transaction costs for both authorities and donors
while improving partners’ dialogue with the government on the timeline for reviews of its key policy
agenda/reforms. The success of PADS (among which, good results, efficacy, efficient, transparency,
and good governance) attracted more funding agencies (such as GAVI; United Nations Agencies; the
Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and the French, German, and Dutch
cooperations). It has been a good example of pooled fund agency (funding up to 25 percent of the
intra-sectoral budget and disbursing up to 98 percent of its funds), leading to its replication in Niger.

139. Public-private approaches and partnership with non-state actors (such as NGO,
Community based organizations) have shown to be useful on one hand to quickly scale-up community
based nutrition products distribution and Anti-Retroviral treatment programs for AIDS; and on the
other hand to strengthen the quality of HMIS and governance through third party verification

141. The pooled fund was composed of UNICEF, the Dutch cooperation, UNFPA, Agence

(to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) and GAVI. For both international partners and local
partners (community-based organizations and NGOs), the project was relevant and played an
important role in strengthening contracting with CSOs and communities. As World Bank and
UNICEF funding were the only source for support to the community nutrition activities and nutrition
surveys, the 2015 survey was not done.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

   A. Context and Initial Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita gross national
income of US$350 in 2014 (current U.S. dollar, Atlas method). 1 Burkina Faso’s economic growth
averaged approximately 4.5 percent annually over the duration of the project despite (a) the overall
global economic crisis beginning in 2008; (b) devastating floods in 2009; and (c) the massive influx
of Malian refugees in 2012.

2.       Health outcomes in the country are still very low. Child health indicators are among the worst
in Africa; notwithstanding some areas of progress (81 percent of children 12–23 months old are
completely immunized in 2010, DHS-MICS IV, compared to 39 percent in 2003), among every 1,000
children born, 65 will die before reaching their first birthday and the risk to die between birth and the
fifth birthday is 129 deaths per 1,000 live births (DHS-MICS IV). Only 56 percent of children with
acute respiratory infection (pneumonia) have access to health centers for treatment and 47 percent
among them received antibiotics. The maternal mortality ratio is 341 deaths per 100,000 live births
(2010 DHS-MICS IV). The HIV epidemic is still a generalized one and the national prevalence rate
is estimated at its lowest level at 1 percent, with 1.2 percent for women and 0.8 percent for men (2010
DHS-MICS IV).

3.     The HSSMAP was designed to support implementation of the borrower’s health sector and
multisectoral HIV/AIDS strategies, to accelerate progress toward the MDGs for health, nutrition, and
combating HIV/AIDS.

4.      While an analysis was conducted for the preparation of the HSSMAP in 2006, mostly
analyzing the overall expenditures for the sector and cost-effectiveness of health interventions
according to literature, an economic analysis was not conducted. It was explained by the fact that the
resources allocated by the project were pooled and the project supported the overall health and
HIV/AIDS programs. With the AF in 2008, the analysis demonstrated the high cost-effectiveness of
interventions to be funded, for example, economic returns of nutrition interventions with cost-benefit
ratios above 5. To the extent possible, the data available to conduct an analysis was used to highlight
(a) the development impact of the project and (b) the efficiency of the completed activities.

   B. Development Impact of HSSMAP: Costs, Benefits, and Efficiency

5.      The project investments created both direct and indirect benefits for the population. In this
section, the project costs, the direct and indirect benefits, and project efficiency are assessed.
However, due to the approach of the project (to fund the health and HIV/AIDS programs partly
through common funds), it is difficult to make the attribution of results and the estimation of the costs
and benefits of the project’s approach (that is, to link the funds allocated, the goods and services
procured, and the achievements of the different agencies involved).

Project Costs and Interventions

6.      The PDO (as revised in 2011) was to “Improve access and quality of priority health, nutrition,
and HIV/AIDS services.” To achieve this objective, the project supported implementation of the
national health strategy and the national HIV/AIDS strategy through its two components as described
in table 3.1.

                                                                                                      49

                Total                                                  100.10          100

7.    As indicated in table 3.1, 58 percent of project investments went toward implementation of
Component A (support to the health strategy including nutrition) and 42 percent for implementation
of Component B (support to the national multisectoral HIV/AIDS strategy).

8.      Component A supported interventions to (a) improve the quality and utilization of maternal
and child health services; (b) strengthen the response for malaria and other communicable diseases
(c) expand prevention, medical care, and support services for persons infected by HIV/AIDS and
sexually transmitted diseases through improved training, supervision, and monitoring of treatment
and prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs in public and private sectors; and (d) strengthen project
management through communication, planning and coordination, M&E, and supervision (including
for the improvement of MWM). With the AF, Component A also supported interventions to finance
vaccines to control the spread of a meningitis epidemic and implement essential nutrition
interventions at health facility and community levels.

9.      Component B supported interventions related to (a) HIV prevention and behavior change; (b)
mitigating the socioeconomic consequences of the epidemic through improved capacity; and (c)
strengthening coordination, M&E, supervision, and project management.

10.     The project’s investments were used to fund the health program and the HIV/AIDS program
directly, either through common funds or through direct interventions, as indicated in tables 3.2 and
3.3. Over the course of the project, from 2007 to 2014, for Component A, the project contributed to
21 percent of the common fund and 33 percent of the total program. For Component B, the project
funded 76 percent of the common fund and 12 percent of the program. Finally, according to the final
evaluation report of PADS (draft 2014), PADS contributed 19 percent of funding for Ministry of
Health structures between 2009 and 2012.

    Direct and Indirect Benefits

    11.    From 2007 to its closure in 2014, the project led to several measures of direct impact, which
    included, among others, a higher utilization of maternal health services; increased coverage of high
    impact child services (nutrition, immunization, and malaria care); better prevention and care of
    HIV/AIDS; and improved nutrition status (as detailed in the Results Framework analysis). Table 3.4
    summarizes key achievements on maternal and child health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS.

                                                                                                     51

12.    While indirect benefits are difficult to quantify, the development impact is substantial.
Synergies between health status, poverty, and growth have been well established. The project
interventions targeted funds to the most vulnerable of the population (poor, children, and pregnant
women) and therefore help improve not only their health status but also help increase labor
productivity and contribute in the medium term to the growth of the economy. For example,
malnutrition affects economic growth through three paths: (a) direct loss of productivity from poor
physical status (estimated at 10 percent of lifetime earnings for individuals); (b) indirect loss from
poor cognitive function and deficits in schooling; and (c) increased health care costs.

Measures of Economic Efficiency and Cost-effectiveness Analysis

13.     In this section, the efficiency of the project considering its costs and health benefits is assessed.
Efficiency of a project can be assessed along several dimensions—allocative efficiency, productive
efficiency, implementation efficiency, and technical efficiency (definitions provided in table 3.5) —
and each of these is discussed in this section with respect to the project.


                                                                                                          52

            Efficiency                                        Definition
    Allocative efficiency           The use of resources to meet strategic development priorities
                                    and improve welfare of population.
    Productive efficiency           Producing services with the optimal combination of inputs to
                                    produce maximum output for the minimum cost.
    Implementation                  The effectiveness of implementation arrangements to achieve
    efficiency                      the project’s activities.
    Technical efficiency            The effectiveness with which a given set of inputs is used to
                                    produce an output.

14.     Allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency of the project is considered as high as
interventions funded by Components A and B are key strategic priorities for the development and
health sector of Burkina Faso. Moreover, by its design the project aimed to strengthen allocative
efficiency by (a) prioritizing interventions known to be cost-effective and to disproportionately
benefit the poor; (b) using transparent criteria to determine funding amounts by program, level, and
service delivery characteristics (population, facilities, and so on); and (c) allowing flexibility for
agencies to plan and budget priority interventions and activities based on the local disease burden.

15.      As explained in this ICR, both PADS implementation body and SP-CNLS used transparent
criteria to allocate their funds. For Component A, PADS used a series of criteria to allocate funds to
(a) structures (central directorates, hospitals, regional directorates and health districts, and the project
management unit); and (b) functions (training, common expenditures, and operations). While the
proportions (and particularly the amounts) varied over the project period, the overall allocations
virtually matched the allocation criteria, as shown in table 3.6.

                  Table 3.6. PADS Funds Allocation by Structure and Function
                                                                     Allocation      Actual
                                    Structures/Functions              criteria    allocations
                            Central directorates                      5.0%          6.6%
                            Hospitals                                 4.0%          3.5%
                            Regional directorates/Health districts    46.0%         50.4%
                            Project management unit                   5.0%          4.6%
                            Training                                  4.0%          2.7%
                            Common expenditures                       36.0%         32.2%

16.    While the project’s success in decentralizing resources seems clear, the project’s adherence
to the set of allocation criteria based on population, distance, number of health facilities, and
performance is impossible to determine from the available data.

17.      For Component B, SP-CNLS did not use explicit criteria to allocate resources but did set
estimated budget provisions by axes of the national strategy and by project intervention. A
comparison of the amounts planned in the strategic framework for 2011–2015 and the amounts spent
by Component B over the project period indicates wide variation between the planned and actual
results, at least for certain axes.




                                                                                                         53

                             Axis   1: Prevention       42.8%        34.3%
                             Axis   2: Care             35.9%        12.2%
                             Axis   3: Support           4.8%         6.9%
                             Axis   4: Coordination      8.0%        39.8%

18.     Additionally, the fact that both Component A and B allowed flexible planning based on
‘bottom-up’ planning exercises, which depended on local priorities, strengthened the allocative
efficiency of the project. However, different constraints hindered application of this principle. For
Component A, there were several problems: (a) the analysis of the local problems was not always
done with the needed participation; (b) the process of compiling and transmitting the plan was time
consuming; and (c) the need to review and reconcile the various plans from the different levels
contributed to a process that was more centralized than intended and sometimes perceived as more
‘top-down’ than desirable. In addition, because the lengthy annual planning process reduced the time
for implementation, a multiyear plan would have allowed for more flexibility during implementation.
For Component B, the annual planning exercise was complicated by the limited fiduciary capacity at
the regional and local levels, which resulted in a more centralized budgeting and FM arrangement
than for Component A.

19.     Productive efficiency. The project was expected to be implemented using the most cost-
effective ways such as competitive bidding processes for key public health commodities, to achieve
the desired outputs. As shown in annex 2, the project focused on key public health commodities
(contraceptive materials, vaccines and vaccination supplies, bed nets, ACT, HIV test kits, first-line
ART, TB treatment, and so on) and procured goods and services at the national level to ensure that
the procedures were correctly followed and that the lowest cost was obtained. The project negotiated
fixed costs with the NGOs and associations for the kinds of services and budget ceilings for the
quantity of services they were to provide. This ensured both economies in implementation and ease
of monitoring results and expenditures.

20.     Implementation efficiency. Project implementation arrangements contributed in important
ways to project efficiency with (a) utilization of pooled funding (and certain harmonized procedures)
to make funds available in a timely manner, reduce transaction costs, and increase disbursement rates
and (b) reliance on a mix of existing public and private (mostly nonprofit NGOs and CSOs) agencies
with comparative advantages for delivering services to communities. As noted previously, the
proportion of funds allocated to the pooled funding declined over the project period (a) from 83
percent in 2007 to 11 percent in 2014 for Component A and (b) from 28 percent in 2009 to 10 percent
in 2014 for Component B. Data do not allow for a comparison of disbursement rates. A comparison
of disbursement rates for Component A between the Common Fund and the targeted Bank funds for
nutrition indicates that disbursement rates were not constrained by targeting: Common Fund
disbursement rates averaged 67.2 percent over the period 2008–2012 while nutrition disbursements
averaged 97.7 percent over the period 2009–2013. Additionally, both Components A and B promoted
a broad array of service delivery agencies, which contributed to the reach and the quality of the
project’s benefits.

21.     Technical efficiency. The interventions included in the project are technically sound and
consistent with scientific literature about recommended priority, high-impact interventions to reduce
child and maternal mortality rates. Table 3.8 presents average costs of health and HIV/AIDS
interventions funded by the project per benefit (cost per DALY saved). Health interventions that cost
less than US$100 per DALY are considered highly cost-effective by international standards. Thus,
interventions funded by the project can be considered substantially cost-effective.

22.     Due to the approach of the project (to fund the health and HIV/AIDS programs partly through
common funds), it is difficult to make the attribution of results and the estimation of the costs and
benefits of the project. Based on cost-effectiveness estimates of the different interventions funded by
the project and the costs of each component, an estimate of the DALYs gained with support of the
project interventions is proposed for measuring the benefits. These estimates are approximate and are
used as indicative of the health benefits of the project and are based on diverse hypothesis. The low
and high cost-effectiveness ratios for each component were calculated considering the lowest (or
higher) value and considering that for Component A each intervention (RH, child health and nutrition,
and malaria were funded equally) and limited to the list provided in table 3.8.

Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results: Assessment of Stakeholders Involved in the
         Implementation of the HSSMAP

1.       Background and rationale. The project to support the health sector and combat HIV/AIDS
is jointly managed by PADS (Component A) and SP-CNLS-IST (Component B).

2.      In accordance with various FAs and the manual of administrative, accounting, and finance,
project implementation was assured by several actors and structures, including the central directorates
of the MOH (mainly the Direction Generale des Etudes Statistiques de la Sante and Direction de la
Nutrition); the regional directorates and health districts; NGOs/associations); and the PADS
implementation unit which was responsible for the management of funds. This analysis concerns the
assessments of those involved in the implementation of Component A; it comprises a literature review
(reports and evaluations at different levels) and targeted interviews with officials of some components
including nutrition but also with the actors in charge of implementing the project, namely the
community based organizations, NGOs, and the Bank.

3.     Main findings. The main findings of the assessment address (a) knowledge of the project; (b)
relevance of the project; (c) value added of the project; and (d) implementation difficulties and fears.

4.       Knowledge of the project. Overall, the implementing actors at the peripheral level (health
districts, NGOs/associations) as well as some of the central actors have a relatively limited knowledge
of the existence of the project. In fact, in the annual action plans of the FAs, the MOH/PADS is known
and referred to but not the project (HSSMAP). Thus, for instance, funds for nutrition are labeled ‘on
behalf of funds PADS/ NUTRITION’ and not on behalf of the HSSMAP. Beneficiaries are aware
that funding just comes from the MOH/PADS. The situation is somewhat different at the Nutrition
Directorate where the project is known as the main source of funding to enable it to conduct an
ongoing and systematic implementation of its action plans including conducting SMART surveys.

5.      Relevance of the project. There is some unanimity of views on the relevance of the areas
targeted by the HSSMAP. The assessments are justified mainly by the alignment of strategic
directions of the project with the PNDS, which constitutes the overall strategic direction for the sector.
At the district level, however, while some stakeholders noted that increased flexibility over the years
has allowed them to expand the eligible activities, the overall opinion is that the targeted nature of the
interventions often requires limiting initiatives in the development of the annual plans. At the
Nutrition Directorate, the project’s relevance is highly appreciated because nutrition had received
very little financing before the HSSMAP, even in the face of the increasing prevalence of chronic
malnutrition, stunting, and acute malnutrition.

6.       Value added of the project. At all levels (Nutrition Directorate, health districts, NGOs/
associations), the implementing agencies recognize that the project allowed them to fill a large
funding gap, particularly for nutrition. Without the project, the extension of community nutrition
outreach and the conduct of the annual nutritional surveys (SMART) would have been difficult or
impossible. Furthermore, the NGOs/associations indicate that project support helped them strengthen
the institutional framework of contracts, resulting in (a) enhanced communication between the NGOs
and the local authorities to facilitate the implementation of activities; (b) better organization of NGO
and association interventions at health district level; and (c) increased participation in the different
local, regional, and national health forums. Finally, in the opinion of the beneficiaries of the project’s
support, the institutional capacity building and technical skills development were key results of the
project.
                                                                                                       58
7.       Implementation difficulties and fears. The interviews revealed a number of difficulties which
are not specific to the HSSMAP but apply generally to the implementation of programs and projects
in the health sector. Among these are delays in (a) submitting requests for the release of funds; (b)
transmitting reports and supporting receipts and documents after the implementation of activities; and
(c) producing financial statements. These delays are due to weak planning skills and report writing
abilities. There is also a lack of information on lessons learned and best practices, in particular in the
contracting process.

8.      Under these apprehensions, the issue of sustainability of targeted funds is a widely shared
concern by authorities at both central and operational levels. Fears were expressed by all on the
possibility of maintaining operational activities: strong involvement of NGOs/associations; better
monitoring of patients; particularly regarding TB, conducting of periodic surveys; and financing of
costs related to the distribution of vitamin A. There were particular concerns expressed by all of the
participants that the common basket of funds is in continuous decline.

9.      Future prospects. The various beneficiaries are unanimous in their opinion about the need to
continue the project so as to ensure the implementation of interventions in the field of nutrition and
the involvement of NGOs/associations. In addition, a majority indicates the need for the project to
strengthen the common basket and orient it toward health system financing as a complement to GAVI
funding for health systems strengthening. Finally, the respondents indicated the need for capacity
building for greater efficiency in planning and M&E of interventions.

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. The borrower’s Project Completion Report comprises (a) reports on Components A (70 pages
including annexes) and B (69 pages including annexes) and (b) a synthesis of the two reports (20
pages). The synthesis has been summarized below; complete versions of the component reports are
available in the project file.

2. Component A. The presentation of Component A describes (a) the successive amounts and dates
of project financing; (b) the initial and revised PDO; and (c) the different subcomponents with their
specific objectives. These details are available in annex 10 of this ICR. The Component A synthesis
also provides a description of the content of the full Component A report and the process used to
prepare the report.

3. The Component A synthesis focuses on (a) the initial technical context (Programme National de
la Sante, PNDS, PADS) and subsequent institutional aspects of the project and (b) the project’s
contributions to the sectoral approach, the contracting process, improved nutritional status, better
management of biomedical waste, and disease control. The synthesis presents a table indicating the
project’s results; these results are incorporated into the table in annex 12.

4. The synthesis presents a list of the key activities financed by the project and their cost. This
information is included in annex 2.

5. The synthesis suggests the key factors contributing to the project’s success: (a) the relevance of
the priorities and strategies; (b) the consensus and strong working; (c) the effectiveness of the Bank’s
support for harmonization and coordination with the other partners in the health sector; and (d) the
Bank’s support in specific technical areas (for example, essential medicines and governance). The
synthesis concludes with suggestions for future Bank action in the areas of nutrition, disease control
(including HIV), integrated management of childhood illness, and targeting of interventions through
improved planning.

6. Component B. The presentation of Component B describes (a) the PDO; (b) the successive
amounts and dates of project financing; and (c) the different subcomponents with their specific
objectives. These details are available in annex 10.

7. The Component B synthesis succinctly summarizes the project’s contributions to each of the
subcomponents: (a) action plans of public sector structures (health, social welfare, and other key
institutions); (b) decentralized (especially community-based) organizations and for private sector
enterprises; and (c) national coordinating structures.

8. The Component B synthesis provides a description of the content of the full Component B report
and the process used to prepare the report. The synthesis summarizes the project’s two financing
phases (see annex 10) and the results achieved (see annex 12).

9. The synthesis suggests that leadership (especially from the highest levels of government) was
essential in the achievement of the project’s objectives. The synthesis concludes with the suggestion
that sustainability of the project’s achievements through new funding is crucial for continuing the
fight against HIV/AIDS.

Annex 12: Summary of the Performance-Based Financing Pilot

1. Organization. With project financing, the MOH implemented the performance-based financing
(PBF) pilot in the districts of Boulsa, Leo, and Titao from April 2011 to December 2013. The PBF
pilot defined a package of key maternal health services and contracted health facilities at primary
(Centre Santé Promotion S) and secondary (Centre Medical and Centre Medical avec Antenne
Chirurgicale) levels to provide these services. Payments were made to contracted facilities based on
the quantity and quality of health services provided.
2. Quarterly site visits to the contracted health facilities were used to evaluate performance and
determine payment amounts. The visits included at least one physician and two other members with
experience in providing primary care services and disease surveillance. The evaluators (a) verified
the quantity of services provided by the health facility and (b) used a quality checklist to measure
structural and process indicators related to the quality of services provided by the health facility. The
quality score included items such as how well patient documentation was completed, the availability
of health supplies and equipment, the availability of essential medicines, and respect for patient
confidentiality.
3. Several verification mechanisms existed in the pilot. First, the number of services declared by
the health facility was checked and verified by the verification agents by counting services written in
the facility registers. Second, a sample of patients was drawn for each type of service, with sampled
patients being visited and interviewed (a) to ensure they received the services declared by the health
facility and (b) to assess their satisfaction with the services provided.
4. Results. Before the start of the PBF the trend data (presented in figure 12.1) on the quantity of
services are similar in PBF and non-PBF facilities for most maternal health services (births, ANC
visits, postnatal care visits, and pregnant women treated for malaria). For other services (obstetric
interventions and abortions), the overall quantity of services is lower, perhaps because only higher-
level facilities have been included.
5. After implementation of the PBF, the trend data show the differences between PBF and non-PBF
facilities. Increases in the PBF facilities were noted for (a) the number of ANC visits (and the
proportion of ANC visits occurring in the first trimester); (b) the monthly number of facility births;
and (c) postnatal care visits. These results indicate that the PBF may have had an effect on health
service utilization. However, there was no difference between PBF and non-PBF facilities in (a) the
number of pregnant women treated for malaria; (b) the number of obstetric interventions; and (c) the
number of abortions.
6. Using difference-in-difference estimation indicated (a) increases in the 4th and 5th ANC visits,
postnatal care visits, and the proportion of ANC visits occurring in the first trimester but (b) no
increases in the number of facility births, obstetric complications, abortions, and pregnant women
treated for malaria.
7. The quality of facility services declined during the initial quarter after the introduction of the
PBF but recovered thereafter and remained stable over the period of the pilot.
8. Conclusions. The number of services performed increased for three out of six maternal health
services examined: the proportion of first ANC visits conducted during the first trimester of
pregnancy, women attending the 4th or 5th ANC visits, and women attending postnatal care visits.
Additionally, the proportion of ANC visits that occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy
increased in PBF facilities. The number of institutional deliveries appeared to increase in the PBF
compared to control facilities during the intervention period; however, deliveries were not statistically
                                                                                                      70
significant in regression models. These findings are robust to inclusion of a time trend as well as the
controls for seasonality.
9. The study was unable to determine why ANC and postnatal care visits increased while other
maternal health services did not change as a result of the PBF. One possible explanation may be
linked to the existence of government-subsidized obstetrical services in all health facilities dating
from 2007.
