"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Health Sector Support\n            and Multisectoral Aids Project for Burkina Faso were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            sustaining a contribution to these mutually reinforcing\n            relationships is particularly difficult for external funding\n            agencies since over time: (a) changing leadership within\n            these agencies requires constant consensus building; (b)\n            perceptions of the utility of investing time in sector\n            coordination and harmonization differ; and (c) pressures to\n            link individual agency financing with specific results can\n            become critical. Despite Burkina Faso\u2019s continued support\n            for the strategic orientations above, there has been a\n            gradual attrition of support from the partners for certain\n            key elements (and for pooled funding in particular). Such\n            evolving priorities may have potential implications for the\n            expansion of the RBF initiative currently being financed by\n            the Bank. Government ownership and leadership is a core\n            requirement for successful institutional arrangements and\n            therefore establishing the institutional framework for\n            program implementation is an essential step during the\n            preparation phase. Project implementation arrangements may\n            also compensate for a lack of sectoral reform, at least in\n            the short term. Because key country reform elements (such as\n            decentralization, human and financial resource management,\n            procurement, and so on) advance slowly, projects often\n            provide a means to achieve the reforms, at least in a\n            limited fashion. Many of the project\u2019s initiatives were in\n            advance of the country\u2019s general politico-administrative\n            agenda and enabled the sector to demonstrate both the\n            potential strengths and weaknesses of the proposed reforms.\n            This was the case, for example, in the successful effort to\n            decentralize management in the health sector and the less\n            successful results for SP-CNLS and HIV/AIDS."}, "docdt": "2015-12-21T01:43:03Z"}
