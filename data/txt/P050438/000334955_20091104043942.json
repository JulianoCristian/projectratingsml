           an eligible borrower country. Two annual PRSCs were approved\n            for the Government of Uganda (GOU) in 2001 and 2002. The\n            PRSCs are expected to serve the country's strategy of\n            reducing poverty and improving public service delivery by\n            addressing public sector issues and initiating institutional\n            and policy reform measures. As part of the reform measures,\n            efforts were undertaken to induce transparency and reduce\n            corruption in government proceedings. Public access to\n            government information was improved and social and internal\n            accountability mechanisms were put in place. Simplified\n            versions of the budget and budget performance reports were\n            published for citizen access, public notices on fiscal\n            transfers were posted at service delivery points, and key\n            policy issues were disseminated through the media. Public\n            service delivery was monitored through performance and\n            expenditure tracking surveys. A few policies on citizen\n            participatory mechanisms were also approved. Although\n            progress has been noted in many areas, sectoral reforms may\n            take a long time to materialize and will require a\n            coordinated effort across ministries and departments. An\n            immediate challenge for Uganda is to reduce the population\n            growth rate as it poses a serious threat to\n            poverty-reduction and economic development efforts."}, "docdt": "2004-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
