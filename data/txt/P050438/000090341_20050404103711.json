The findings and implications\n            indicate that the First Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC1) has provided the basis for a continuation of the\n            PRSC approach with a high degree of continuity. Therefore it\n            provides an excellent basis for learning from experience and\n            translating these lessons into improved focus, strategies,\n            and mechanisms for future PRSC operations. This simplified\n            ICR however, is written after the completion of the series\n            of the three PRSCs. For the future, simplified completion\n            reports should be written immediately after the completion\n            of the program in question in order to have an impact on the\n            design of the next operation. As discussed above, an\n            implementation completion report of the full program has\n            been developed and it discussed findings and implications\n            for the design of future PRSCs in Uganda, as well as for\n            PRSCs in other countries. Also, a stocktaking report of the\n            first series of PRSCs has been written and discussed\n            extensively in Uganda. Both of these reports have spurred\n            discussions and have had an impact on the further\n            development of the PRSC program."}, "docdt": "2005-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
