Improving Public Services in Uganda                                                                       September 17, 2002
In May 2001, Uganda became the first country to benefit from a Poverty Reduction Support Credit, a new approach to World Bank lending
aimed at improving the delivery of basic social services.  A year later, noticeable strides have been made in improving the quality of
education, health care, and water and sanitation services.  Having struggled in recent years to recruit teachers, the Ugandan government
now is adding 1,000 teachers to the payroll each month. New health care reforms, such as greater advocacy of contraception, have
helped to reduce the number of people infected with HIV.  The rate of tuberculosis infection is also decreasing. 

Water availability has steadily improved both in rural and urban areas.  In the past two years, 1.5 million rural people have been provided
with access to water, under one  of the largest rural water and sanitation programs in Africa.  Also, more than 6,000 new water
connections a year have been recorded in 12 major towns, many of which are home to Uganda’s poor families.
