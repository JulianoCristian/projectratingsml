A year later, noticeable\n            strides have been made in improving the quality of\n            education, health care, and water and sanitation services.\n            Having struggled in recent years to recruit teachers, the\n            Ugandan government now is adding 1,000 teachers to the\n            payroll each month. New health care reforms, such as greater\n            advocacy of contraception, have helped to reduce the number\n            of people infected with HIV. The rate of tuberculosis\n            infection is also decreasing. Water availability has\n            steadily improved both in rural and urban areas. In the past\n            two years, 1.5 million rural people have been provided with\n            access to water, under one of the largest rural water and\n            sanitation programs in Africa. Also, more than 6,000 new\n            water connections a year have been recorded in 12 major\n            towns, many of which are home to Uganda\u0092s poor families."}, "docdt": "2002-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
