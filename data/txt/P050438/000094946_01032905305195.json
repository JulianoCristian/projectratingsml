Strategy Paper\n            (PRSP) in Uganda. The reform program focuses on improving\n            basic service delivery, through efficient, and equitable use\n            of public resources, essential for improving public resource\n            allocation, and raising the productivity, and\n            cost-efficiency of public investment, and other\n            expenditures. In addition, improved governance, through\n            cross-cutting public sector reforms, such as reforms in\n            public service, public procurement, and financial management\n            will be adopted to increase transparency, and fight\n            corruption. Moreover, improved access to, and quality of\n            education, health care, and water/sanitation services will\n            enhance the effective delivery of basic services, provided\n            sector-specific constraints are tied to improvement\n            measures. However, many problems in basic service sectors\n            are beyond the mandate of a particular sector, and require\n            collaboration across agencies, and departments. Risks\n            include pervasive institutional, and human capacity\n            weaknesses; corruption, which could inhibit private sector\n            confidence, and investment, and hamper improvements in\n            service delivery; and, the high fiduciary risks."}, "docdt": "2001-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
