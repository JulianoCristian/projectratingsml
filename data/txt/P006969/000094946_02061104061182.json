assessment of outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, and institutional\n            development impacts substantial. Nonetheless, lessons\n            reinforce the need for Government commitments at all levels,\n            to succeed in the implementation of sectoral reforms. In\n            this case, key aspects of educational reforms, should have\n            been framed in the broader context of a civil service\n            reform, to achieve the desired reforms in organization, and\n            management of the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, the\n            lack of coordination between the Ministries of Finance, and\n            of Education, prevented construction of a new building for\n            the education ministry, determined as key to achieving the\n            ministry's management strengthening. Despite initial\n            consultations with stakeholders, disappointment was\n            expressed on project design, and objectives, leading to\n            unfulfilled expectations on its final outcome. The project\n            thus failed to incorporate stakeholders' inputs;\n            therefore, improved dialogue with stakeholders during\n            implementation, would also strengthen ownership, and\n            overcome difficulties (such as teacher union position on\n            adjustment of teacher/student ratios). Moreover, project\n            design would have better succeed, had the design of\n            infrastructure works - assigned to a renowned architectural\n            firm, but proven not sufficient - been prepared at an early\n            stage, allowing time to adjust considerable aspects during\n            implementation, and reduce cost overruns."}, "docdt": "2002-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
