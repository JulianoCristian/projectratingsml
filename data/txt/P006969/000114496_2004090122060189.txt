The Honorable  
Minister Ronald Green 
Ministry of Education, Sports and Youth Affairs 
Government Headquarters 
Roseau, Dominica
Re:
Credit No. 2803-DOM
(Basic Education Reform Project)
First Amendment to Development Credit Agreement
Dear Minister Green:
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement, dated March 14, 1996, between 
the Commonwealth of Dominica and the International Development Association for the 
above referenced Project, and to the letter dated August 20, 1997, from the Basic 
Education Reform Manager at the Ministry of Education, Sports and Youth Affairs, 
requesting an amendment to certain procurement provisions of that Development Credit 
Agreement.
We agree with such request and propose to amend the Development Credit Agreement 
as follows:
1. Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 is amended to read as follows:
“4.
The Association may require withdrawals from the Credit 
Account to be made on the basis of statements of expenditure 
for:
(a) 
expenditures for contracts for goods and works costing 
less than the equivalent of:
(i)
$50,000 in the case of goods;
(ii)
$100,000 in the case of works;
(b) 
services of consulting firms costing less than the 
equivalent of $60,000;
(c)
services of individual consultants costing less than the 
equivalent of $30,000; and
(d)
payments under Categories 4 and 5 of the table set forth 
in paragraph 1 of this Schedule.”
2. In Section II of Schedule 3, the existing paragraph becomes paragraph 
1 and the following paragraph 2 is inserted therein:
“2.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this 
Section, the provisions of the “Guidelines for the Use of Consultants 
by World Bank 
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executive Agency”  published by the Bank in August 
1981, requiring prior Association 
review or approval of budgets, short 
lists, selection procedures, 
letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation 
reports and contracts, 
shall not apply to: (a) contracts for the employment of 
consulting 
firms estimated to cost less than $60,000 equivalent each; or (b) 
contracts for the employment of individual consultants estimated to 
cost less 
than $30,000 equivalent each.  However, said exceptions to 
prior Association review 
shall not apply to: (a) the terms of 
reference for such contracts; (b) 
single-source selection of 
consulting firms; (c) assignments of a 
critical nature, as reasonably 
determined by the Association; (d) amendments to 
contracts for the 
employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to 
$60,000 
equivalent or above; or (e) amendments to contracts for the employment 
of individual consultants raising the contract value to $30,000 
equivalent or 
above.”
