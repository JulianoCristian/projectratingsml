to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the project's development objective and the\n            key outcome indicators were too broad and not measurable.\n            This created severe challenges during implementation and\n            monitoring outcomes. The project design put too much\n            emphasis on the commitment and support of an executive\n            authority with limited legitimacy and a few top reformers\n            (who were replaced during the course of project\n            implementation). Inconsistencies between Nepal's\n            National Procurement Act (NPA) and the International\n            Development Association (IDA) procurement guidelines were a\n            key factor in explaining slow disbursement as sub-project\n            managers were compelled to follow extra steps/procedures in\n            line with the NPA (even if not required by the IDA\n            guidelines). This seems to be a common obstacle in many\n            projects in Nepal, which needs to be resolved. The\n            requirement for the World Bank to provide no-objection for\n            each procurement transaction under this project was very\n            cumbersome and process-intensive. It not only slowed down\n            the project implementation, but also was costly in terms of\n            staff time from both the authorities and the Bank side. The\n            Challenge Fund is an innovative and flexible implementation\n            tool, and could be replicated. However, it is important that\n            there should be an overall strategic direction and result\n            orientation to guide its allocation decisions and\n            implementation. These types of funds need to have a thematic\n            focus and the sub-projects chosen should address key\n            bottlenecks in this area of focus."}, "docdt": "2010-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
