F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The PDO is to strengthen public sector capacity to implement the national economic
reform agenda.

  The Development Grant Agreement, Schedule 2, Description of the Project states that:
The Economic Reform TA project will strengthen government's capacity to implement its
economic reform agenda. This will be achieved by funding priority technical assistance
that will provide government with the executive capacity required to implement its
reform agenda. The implementation of government's economic reforms will in turn
expand the role of the private sector in the economy and put the country on the path of
higher economic growth.

F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from the Project Appraisal Document)
The Development Objective (DO) is "to strengthen public sector capacity to implement the
national economic reform agenda." The Development Grant Agreement, Schedule 2, Description
of the Project states that: "The Economic Reform TA project will strengthen government's
capacity to implement its economic reform agenda. This will be achieved by funding priority
technical assistance that will provide government with the executive capacity required to



                                                        2
implement its reform agenda. The implementation of government's economic reforms will in turn
expand the role of the private sector in the economy and put the country on the path of higher
economic growth."

None

I. Disbursement Profile

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance)
Country Context. With a GNI per capita of US$ 400 in 2008, Nepal is a low income country with
31 percent of the population living below the poverty line. Nepal's ethnically and linguistically
diverse population of 29 million--with more than 103 different ethnic and caste groups--is
spread across a landlocked and a largely mountainous area of 140.8 thousand square km.

Politics. Nepal has been in political transition for the past two decades. In 1991, the hereditary
monarchy, which ruled the country throughout its modern history, was replaced by a
constitutional monarchy. However, this welcome change did not translate into an improved
political climate; instability continued as political fragmentation intensified--Nepal had 12
coalition governments from 1991 to 2005. A Maoist insurgency started in 1996 in the mid-
Western region--one of the most deprived areas of the country--and progressively spread to all
parts of the country; escalating sharply in November 2001 when the Royal Nepal Army was
mobilized to counter the insurgency and a state of emergency was imposed. In 2002, the King
dismissed the Parliament and started appointing prime ministers by royal decree. In February
2005, the King formally suspended democratic rule, took over executive powers and imposed a
state of emergency (which was subsequently lifted in April 2005). In November 2005, the Seven
Party Alliance (which together made up 194 of the 205 seats allocated in the legislative elections
in 1999) and the Maoist formed an alliance against the King; with wide-spread popular protests in
April 2006 the King was forced to restore the Parliament. An interim government was formed;
and, a comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed between the Seven Party Alliance and the
Maoists in November 2006. The elections for a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution
and serve as a transitional legislative body were successfully held in April 2008. The first meeting
of the Constituent Assembly abolished the monarchy and established the Federal Democratic
Republic of Nepal.

The Maoists, who won the largest number of seats (220 out of 601) in the CA elections, formed a
new coalition government in August 2008. The government fell in May 2009 pushing the Maoists
into opposition. The current ruling coalition under CPN UML (United Marxist-Leninist)
comprises more than 20 parties. The relationship between the government and the UCPN
(Maoists) in Opposition has been characterized by mistrust and mutual suspicion creating
problems for both the ongoing peace process and the new constitution. On May 28, 2010 political
parties agreed to extend the Constitutional Assembly for one more year in order to finalize
drafting of the new constitution.

Economic Performance. Nepal's growth averaged about 3 percent annually in the 2000s, with
population growing at 2.3 percent, improvements to per capita income have been limited.
Remittance inflows fueled private consumption growth; with little positive spill over on
production in the real sector due to the structural constraints. Government consumption growth is
limited due to budgetary under-spending. Crop-growing conditions are a significant determinant
of growth dynamics in Nepal as agriculture makes up more than one-third of the economic
activity and employs the majority of the population.


                                                 6
Economic Policies. Notwithstanding the major political transition and limited political stability,
Nepal has maintained macroeconomic stability--it has been mostly consistent in implementing
prudent monetary and fiscal policies aided by rapid growth in remittance inflows. During the
project implementation period, revenue mobilization improved, while expenditures remained
relatively constant as share of GDP. Also in this period external debt dynamics have improved -
the country is considered under moderate debt distress, with most of its public debt in
concessional terms. The Procurement Reform Law and the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF)--which aims to redirect public spending toward social and infrastructure
needs--have been key components of the reform of the public financial management systems.

IDA Strategy in Nepal. The first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was adopted
in May 2003, and, Nepal's 2003 CAS were structured around four pillars: broad­based economic
growth, social sector development, social inclusion and targeted programs, and good governance.
Among the key components of the 2003 CAS were a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits
complemented by sector investment operations. The CAS focused on strengthening government
to own and lead the coordination of the development assistance among donors. However,
following the Royal coup, the development partners became increasingly skeptical of providing
budget support to a government with limited legitimacy and doubted the realism in achieving the
objectives of such operations under these circumstances.

A second PRSC, which was under consideration for fiscal year 2005, was suspended, although
discussions between the Bank and the authorities continued under the assumption that if
conditions improved the series would continue. The Bank continued its engagement and sector-
specific dialogues as the ERTA project was being prepared.

As 2003 CAS expired in 2007, the Bank's strategy had to be flexible as new political order was
expected to emerge within a year or two. Therefore, it was agreed that an Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) would be better suited than a full-fledged CAS. Nevertheless, the ISN continued to focus
on a longer term developmental agenda for Nepal. The 2007 ISN adjusted the development vision
to recent political developments, in particular, the prospect of a peaceful transition brought about
by the end of the Maoist insurgency and the restoration of democracy in April 2006. The goals of
the Bank assistance program over the project period remained broadly aligned with the 2003
PRSP: a focus on improving governance by bringing resources to grassroots levels and improving
development effectiveness, with further emphasis on inclusion.

Rationale for Bank Assistance. According to the Project Agreement Document (PAD), the
World Bank aimed to support authorities' ability to implement a sound economic reform program,
which would ultimately help end the conflict. The PRSC would provide resources to back the
reform process; in addition to budget support, however, additional resources and technical
assistance would be needed to expand the administration's limited capacity to implement these
reforms. The PAD stated: "In all reform areas, the proposed project will support existing
initiatives. Rather than driving the process from the center it will create a hub that can provide
additional human and financial resources to facilitate ongoing sectoral reforms." Therefore, the
PAD argued that the technical assistance would facilitate the implementation of the economic
reform program by providing additional resources to augment public sector capacity; an area
where the World Bank had a comparative advantage. The second key aspect of this project was to
help harmonize donor efforts. According to the PAD: "The Bank can help HMGN to further its
donor harmonization efforts. More important than providing additional resources, the Bank can
use this project as a vehicle to establish an appropriate mechanism through which HMGN can
ask other donors to also channel their assistance... Establishing a broad pool of untied TA funds


                                                 7
and encouraging other donors to contribute would effectively achieve donor coordination; relieve
the reporting burden on government and also ensure government leadership and ownership in the
use o f TA resources."

Context at appraisal: During the appraisal stage the King suspended the Parliament, and the new
government appointed by the King asked the project team to expedite the preparation of this
project. This government was in charge during appraisal, negotiations, board approval, and
signing until April 2006 (five months after project effectiveness).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project development objective was to strengthen public sector capacity to implement the
national economic reform agenda. The progress towards achievement of the project development
objectives was to be measured by key reforms implemented in improving governance and public
sector management; improved service delivery; accelerated privatization; and improved strategic
communications. The project's objectives were ambitious for a US$ 3 million. The PAD
specified a limited number of actions/results to be achieved under each outcome indicator
(without specifying neither the baseline nor how to measure these results), as follows:

 (a) Improving Governance and Public Sector Management - two actions/results including:
passing the Governance and Civil Service Amendment Acts; and, implementing the Mid Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
(b) Improved service delivery ­ three actions/results, including: conducting a legislative review of
health and education sector decentralization initiative; improved community management of the
health facilities; and, creation of an autonomous HIV/AIDS unit
(b) Accelerating Privatization ­ two actions/results including: privatization of a stake in at least
one of the three identified public enterprises (the Royal Nepal Airlines, the Nepal Oil Corporation,
and the Nepal Telecom); and the creation of a separate office to lead privatization process in the
MoF.
(d) Strategic Communications ­ two actions/results, including: completion of the communications
audit and the commencement of the strategic communication program

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The Project Development Objective was not revised. The PAD did not specify baselines or end-
of-target values for the outcome indicators. The project was designed in 2005 when emphasis on
measuring results in technical assistance projects was not as well defined as it is at present,
following the push for the Results Agenda which started after 2006. The project was prepared
expeditiously; and project's goals were very broad, as it was intended to support the PRSP
process, which together did not create the right environment for the appraisal team to prepare an
adequate Results Framework.

Consequently, the results framework was modified by adding baseline values for the outcome
indicators and revising the target values for these indicators following the external Mid-Term
Review (May, 2008). This was done for several reasons. First, the results for the outcome
indicators in the original results framework were limited to achieving actions/results/outputs in
two or three sub-projects for each outcome indicator, and had no baseline. Second, given that
many more sub-projects were pre-identified or newly identified (through the Challenge Fund)
especially under the first two outcome indicators, there was a need to measure the results of the
outcome indicators in a more comprehensive manner, by gauging the success in achieving sub-
projects results/outputs under each outcome indicator. Therefore, following the external Mid-



                                                8
Term Review (MTR), the Bank team and the EASU attempted to make output values more
measurable and monitorable as per the revised results framework in section F above. This
restructuring of baselines and end-of-project targets was discussed with the authorities during the
fourth implementation support mission of May 2008. It was agreed upon, and was taken on by the
EASU. The revised results framework (RF) was included in the mission Aide-Memoire as an
annex. The revised RF basically did not replace the old KPIs, it kept them but added to them and
consolidated them, since the old KPIs were for 3 or 4 sub-projects only.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)
The project funds would enable reform-minded public sector agencies to design and implement
better selected reform measures to improve economic management, governance and pro-poor
service delivery. In addition, indirectly, the people of Nepal would benefit from the expected
outcomes of improved transparency, less corruption, and better use of public resources. The PCR
of the GoN, identified the beneficiaries as the civil servants the central level as well as district
level and stakeholders of the private sector working in public private partnership models.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The PAD uses the two terms "key outcome indicators" and "project components" interchangeably.
According to the PAD and the Project Cost Table, the project consisted of two components with a
total cost of US$ 3 million: Pre-identified TA, and the Challenge Fund. However, the PAD's
results framework (annex 3) and detailed project description (annex 4) use the four outcome
indicators as the project's components.

During implementation, the EASU and the Bank team, considered the two "implementation arms"
­the pre-identified TA; and, the Challenge fund-- as the project components, while treating the
four indicators--improved governance and public sector management; improved service delivery;
accelerated privatization; and improved strategic communications--as project outcome indicators,
in accordance with the revised results matrix. Please refer to section 1.3, the Revised PDO and
indicators for a more detailed discussion.

The two components as identified in the PAD and the Cost Table (Annex 5) were: Pre-
identified TA: Appraisal US$ 1 million (Actual US$ 1.2 million), and, the Challenge Fund:
Appraisal US$ 2 million (Actual US$0.6 million).

The PAD states that the ERTA project will be structured in such as way that it provides flexibility
in sourcing and capacity building through hiring of skilled professionals, consultants and
undertaking training and exposure visits. At the outset, a set of well-identified reforms will be
implemented (under the pre-identified component), while flexibility will be built-in to allow for
other reform initiatives under the challenge fund.

Component 1: Identified Priority Areas for Support (Pre-identified Component)
During preparation and appraisal, Bank support was requested in the following areas, with a
specific set of proposed reforms under each:

       (a) Improving Governance and Public Sector Management
It was suggested that the project focuses on the following areas, where needs analysis and
groundwork had been completed and where there was strong reforming leadership.



                                                 9
Governance. The Governance Act (2008) to be passed which establishes and demarcates the
roles and responsibilities of the political and bureaucratic arms of the executive branch of the
government; the Civil Service Act to be amended in favor of a more professional civil service,
and in order to incorporate the principle of affirmative action within the civil service for social
inclusion. In the medium term an Umbrella Public Administration Management Act to be
prepared to create an integrated civil service and to provide general norms of the public
administration that is focused on service delivery.

Civil Service Reform. Immediate priorities for government action included wage decompression,
health insurance, a contributory pension scheme and an effective promotion and transfer policy.
Expanding the inclusiveness of the civil service through effectively targeting minorities through a
program of affirmative action was a priority. In the medium term, a potential Voluntary
Retrenchment Scheme was considered as part of the decentralization program.

Public Expenditure Management. In order to broaden and deepen the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) process additional measures were identified in the areas of aid
harmonization, and building institutional capacity.

Systems improvements. A comprehensive Human Resource database within the Ministry of
General Administration was in the process of being prepared. The TA would help roll out this
database and the Management Information System (MIS) across central government and then to
the districts. The TA would also support the establishment of modernized records and file
management system and performance and grievance management systems.

Combating corruption. One key aspect was to bring the procurement legislation at par with the
international practices. In addition, the TA also aimed to strength the Commission for the
Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).

Statistical Upgrading. The TA would provide support for the National Accounts, the Trade
Statistics, and other statistical series based on the identified areas by the Central Bureau of
Statistics and in accordance with the consolidated national statistical plan.

Tax and Customs Administration Reform. The Department of Customs started implementing a
Three Year Custom Reform and Modernization Action Plan in FY04 in line with the international
norms and best practices. The PAD listed that the potential areas that the TA could support were
in training, developing human resources to meet the WTO requirements, and computerization and
automation of strategic customs offices.

Improved Financial Accountability. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) of 2002 identified a number of areas for improvement. According to the PAD, the
steering committee was reviewing the action plan and was to identify the priority areas where the
TA support was needed.

Key actions/results identified for this area included passing the Governance and Civil Service
Amendment Acts; and, implementing the Mid Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).

       (b) Improved service delivery
Some suggested areas of TA support for improving service delivery included:




                                                10
Private Health Sector Assessment. This assessment would be conducted to recommend
appropriate public private partnership models in the health sector.

Health Sector Legal Review. The Review would summarize the current situation and provide
recommendations on: the health policies, reform programs and actions; service delivery including
training and deployment of the service providers; environmental and occupational hazard aspects
in the existing health system; regulation of the private health care providers in terms of quality,
standards, pricing and other practices that affect the poor.

Capacity Building for Community Management: This component would help develop capacity
of the public sector officials, the school management committees, including the Community
School National Network.

Establishment of a new HIV/AIDS Trust: Development of the legal and institutional
framework for this new autonomous entity including a comprehensive assessment of the
institutional capacity of all the organizations currently working on the HIV/AIDS field;
developing suitable institutional options; listing associated cost implications; and staffing issues.

Key actions/results identified for this area included conducting a legislative review of health and
education sector decentralization initiative; improved community management of the health
facilities; and, creation of an autonomous HIV/AIDS unit.

        (c) Accelerating Privatization
Under this area of reform, it was proposed that the TA should focus on providing its resources to
help support the privatization of the three most important public sector enterprises, namely, the
Royal Nepal Airlines, the Nepal Oil Corporation, and the Nepal Telecom. The TA would also
help the creation of a separate office to lead privatization process in the MoF; and, support
changes to the legislative and institutional framework to facilitate the privatization process.

        (d) Strategic Communications
Under this area of reform, it was envisioned that the strategic communications campaign would
disseminate the potential benefits of economic reform in order to de-politicize reforms and to
build consensus. The Public Information Center (PIC) and the PRSP Resource Center were
chosen as the focal points. A communications audit will assess the communications needs in
support of the reform initiative.

Component 2: Providing Flexible TA (Challenge Fund)
The challenge fund was seen as a pool of unified resources that could be flexibly allocated to new
reform ideas and initiatives (in the four areas covered under Component 1) once they were
prepared, appraised and approved. In order to access these resources, reforming agencies were
supposed to submit well-developed concept notes to the Steering Committee. This TA was
envisaged to focus more on the implementation of reforms (rather than studies) and the proposals
were to be assessed based on merit and the feasibility of these reforms with objective and
transparent criteria.

Project Extension. The original project closing date of December 31, 2008. The project was
extended once, by one year, through December 31, 2009. The extension was aimed at addressing
implementation delays/issues through detailing and implementing an Action Plan that focused on:
scaling-up of existing successful sub-projects, reallocating resources and closing/finalization of
the underperforming sub-projects, institutionalizing periodic monthly review meetings to improve
the quality and the speed of implementation, as well as planning for recognizing and rewarding
successful sub-projects.

Amendments. Following the first supervision mission (February 2006), an additional category
was added to the Development Grant Agreement (DGA) allowing the Government to equip and
staff a fully-functional support unit.

Cancellation. By December 2009, US$ 0.8 million remained undisbursed due to: cancellation of
some sub-projects, under-spending in some sub-project, and savings due to exchange rate gains. 2
The undisbursed project amount was cancelled and re-allocated to other projects in Nepal within
the project's closing fiscal year.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)
This project was prepared in response to the demands by the authorities to build capacity to
support the PRSP; help meet some PRSP triggers; and, to avail the remaining grant funding
allocated for Nepal under the IDA 13 envelope that would expire by June 30, 2005. The project
also aimed to create a platform to pool donor resources for TA in the area of economic policy
reform in Nepal. Some donor and stakeholder consultation did take place. Nevertheless, as
mentioned in the PAD, the authorities requested this TA to be prepared expeditiously.

The task team met at the end of 2004 for a Project Concept Note review. The first preparation
mission arrived to Kathmandu on the day of the palace coup in February 2005--a period which
was followed by considerable uncertainty--and the appraisal mission was fielded in April 2005.
The project team tried to prepare the project expeditiously as per the Government's request.
Given that the preparation and appraisal missions took place when the country was under a State
of Emergency; the overall political and security uncertainty limited the extent of the participatory
process during the project preparation phase.

A number of project risks were identified during appraisal. The project team reviewed relevant
TA operations in Nepal and elsewhere in the region in order to incorporate the key lessons to this
project's design.



2
  Two MoUs were not signed--Capacity Building of the Public Procurement Monitoring Office; and,
HIV/AIDS Institutional Capacity Assessment and the Development of Institutional Framework--because
these received funding from other sources instead. Three projects were stopped--Self-governance
Strengthening; Preparation for the Implementation of the Tahagat Pranali (Level System) under Civil
Service-Second Phase; and, Automated Finger Print Identification System Establishment Project.


                                                12
The key risks and challenges to the project identified during appraisal were:
- Governance and increased conflict: The PAD recognized challenges in improving
   governance in the context of political instability. It also recognized the escalation of conflict
   as an impediment to the implementation of the reform programs especially with respect to
   decentralization and pro-poor service delivery. The project design did not necessarily include
   any specific strategies to cope with such contingencies. The PAD suggests that, as exit
   strategy to the escalation of conflict, experts be hired on one-year renewable contracts; which
   in retrospect was not as relevant as an exit strategy to the risks that materialized during the
   course of the project.
- Tariff increases: The PAD recognized that the tariff increases for basic utilities and
   petroleum were not popular and needed better communication strategy to the public
   explaining the regressive nature of subsidizing utilities.
- Mismanagement of resources: The PAD strategized that involving a high authority such as
   the Cabinet and/or collective decision-making body (the Steering Committee); as well as
   limiting the number of studies, analysis and reports, would guard against mismanagement of
   resources.
- Timely delivery: It was envisaged that the implementation of any proposal should not take
   more than a few weeks; requiring the steering committee to meet regularly and that the
   Bank's internal team providing "no objections" within a few days.
- Quick Wins: The PAD stated that there was a narrowing window of opportunity to
   implement these reforms, and some "quick wins" were needed in a few key areas to maintain
   credibility and broaden support for reforms; a 4-5 year project would not be in line with
   government's objectives or national needs. In the PAD it was argued that, therefore "for fast
   tracked TA support and a project cycle that is either shortened to 2-3 years or heavily front-
   loaded with emphasis on reform communication."
- Lack of management capacity: A strong project coordination unit and providing support to
   line ministries were identified as means to make this TA work within the limited public sector
   capacity.
- Duplication: Several donors were engaged in economic reform technical assistance in Nepal.
   The project was designed with the intention to pool donor TA funds in the challenge fund; the
   Nepal public sector to take leadership of the Challenge Fund as the TA requests by public
   agencies would be evaluated and prioritized by a central steering committee. The PAD
   argued that the project team consulted widely with other donors to avoid duplication during
   preparation mission; however, there is no mention in the PAD regarding donors' concerns
   about providing budget support (and related TA support) following the King's suspension of
   democracy.

Lessons from relevant TA operations were taken into account during the design phase; the
PAD refers to the Bank's experience in channeling technical assistance to Nepal especially
through the Financial Sector Restructuring Project and the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory
Facility (PPIAF), as well as the TA operations in India, Sri Lanka (the ERTA, and Central Bank
Restructuring Project) and Pakistan (Public Sector Capacity Building Project). These lessons
were listed in the PAD as:
- Reform Timing and Management Capacity: the PAD recognized that the authorities may
    over-promise on reforms not taking into account the capacity limitations and the political
    capital needed to push certain reforms. In order to mitigate this, the PAD argued, this project
    would create a reform unit within the ministry and a steering committee--"empowered to
    take hard decisions to move the reform process forward", which were already in place for
    various reform initiatives in Nepal. And that "the TA would be flexible enough with a large
    amount of unallocated funding so that it could be directed to sectors that are able to progress


                                                13
    with urgently needed reforms. The project would support the effort to address reforms in a
    few areas and make progress where possible."
-   Government Commitment and Management Turnover: The PAD recognized that the
    commitment to tackle difficult reform initiatives had so far been limited in Nepal--in areas
    such as the tariff increases, privatization, and changing the labor legislation. It was also
    recognized that frequent changes of governments had a disruptive impact on reform
    initiatives in the past. It was argued in the PAD that "the new government is keen to
    implement its reform program within its current window of opportunity"; and the new
    government's commitment to carry out reform is signaled by the appointment of reform-
    minded bureaucrats.
-   Ineffective Project Monitoring: The state roads TA from India was used as an example of
    inadequate resources devoted to overall project monitoring. The PAD suggests that the
    appointment of a fulltime project monitoring staff within the project management unit would
    improve the effectiveness of project monitoring.
-   Clear Eligibility Criteria for sub-projects: The ERTA project in Sri Lanka highlighted the
    need for clear identification of up-front eligibility criteria, and expected outputs.
-   Procurement Challenges: The PAD states that the sub-project procurement issues would be
    handled by the project management unit within the National Planning Commission, while the
    World Bank could support the authorities on larger procurement issues.

The PAD also discussed why this TA modality was more appropriate to achieve the objectives set
out by the authorities. Single-sector credits were ruled out as their scope would be too narrow to
address the broad reform agenda targeted by this project. Institutional Development Funds and
other trust funds were also ruled-out; as they would be too small in value to address the broad set
of needs identified by the authorities, and too numerous to administer.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Implementation arrangements and challenges: The Steering Committee of the ERTA project
comprised of eight members with important portfolios in the government headed by the National
Planning Commission Vice-Chair. The Economic Advisory Services Unit (EASU) and the sub-
projects implemented the project and the respective sub-projects based on the guidelines of the
project's implementation directive - which was a comprehensive document covering institutional
arrangements and procedures. The EASU issued calls for proposals which would fit in one of the
four key outcome areas/indicators of the project. Proposals were first reviewed by the EASU
based on established evaluation criteria, which weighted projects by: contribution towards
poverty alleviation and national goals, contribution towards achieving sector-wise goals, duration
of the sub-project, sustainability of the sub-project, and implementation approach. Selected
projects were forwarded to the SC for approval and the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
was drafted by the EASU and sent to the World Bank for concurrence. After obtaining no-
objection from the World Bank the sub-project manager and the EASU signed the MoU. Given
the uniqueness of this process, it was natural that the capacity within the GoN agencies to prepare
and submit high-quality bids was limited, and required targeted training by the EASU. To build
this capacity took time, but by the time of the project closing, the agencies which benefited from
the ERTA funds reported that their capacity in these areas had improved considerably (as
highlighted during the ICR workshop). In addition, in many relevant government agencies there
was limited awareness about the possibility of tapping into ERTA funding.




                                                14
The ERTA project included 31 sub-projects; 20 sub projects were selected under the pre-
identified component, and 11 sub-projects under the challenge fund. When the project closed 26
of the sub projects were completed. Two sub-projects under pre-identified component did not
sign MOUs (since they received funding from other sources); one sub project under the pre-
identified, and, two sub-projects under the challenge fund component were stopped by their
respective implementing agency.

The project implementation period (including the extension year 2009) were fraught with periodic
Government changes, political instability, overall weakening of governance and security
environment in the country, as well as the commodity price crisis and financial crisis. These
provided many challenges during the project's implementation. Despite these challenges,
according to the GoN's assessment 21 of these projects were rated as satisfactory; three partially
satisfactory; and, two were unsatisfactory.

Mid-Term Review: A Bank mid-term review mission took place in June 2007, which identified a
number of challenges and implementation issues, recommended hiring a permanent M&E officer
at the EASU (which the GoN quickly addressed by appointing an M&E officer), and called for
an external mid-term evaluation. The external mid-term review was indeed included as one of the
monitoring mechanisms in the project design and agreed to during negotiation stage in order to
review the implementation and the results because the project was prepared expeditiously.
Subsequently, the Bank hired a Nepali consulting firm to conduct an external mid-term review of
the project. The Mid-term review took place between November 2007 and February 2008. The
ensuing report included a set of detailed recommendations for improving and expediting
implementation, as well as improving monitoring and compliance. EASU prepared an Action
Plan to implement the recommendations of the report. As was mentioned earlier, following the
external Mid-Term Review (MTR), the Bank team and the EASU attempted to make output
values more measurable and monitorable. This restructuring of baselines and end-of-project
targets was discussed in the fourth implementation support mission of May 2008, and the revised
results framework was included in the Aide-Memoire, which followed that the mission.

Project Extension: In July 2008, given that only 17 of the approved 29 sub-projects had
completed their activities, the GoN requested an extension of the project closing date for one year.
The delays in implementation--hence the need for extension--were attributed to political
instability, security problems, logistical issues, delays in budgetary allocation, and staff turn-over
at the sub-project manager level. The Bank approved the extension and the new project closing
date became December 31, 2009. The extension would expedite implementation of sub-projects
with the aim of helping the overall project achieve its objectives, and was conditional on
implementing an updated Action Plan that focused on: scaling-up of existing successful sub-
projects, reallocating resources and closing/finalization of the underperforming sub-projects,
institutionalizing periodic monthly review meetings to improve the quality and the speed of
implementation, as well as planning for recognizing and rewarding successful sub-projects.

Despite many challenges during the extension period, several implementation issues were
addressed such as: scaling-up existing successful sub-project, reallocating resources between sub-
projects, closing underperforming sub-projects, undertaking monthly review meetings, organizing
an awards ceremony to recognize high performing sub-projects, and most importantly, finalizing
the implementation of the remaining sub-projects.

Delays in sub-project implementation were mainly due to: delays in budget authorization,
lengthy procurement processes (due to inconsistencies between IDA and GoN procurement
requirements, limited resources/capacity within the GoN, and delays in obtaining no-objection


                                                 15
letters from the World Bank), and, frequent transfers of sub-project managers as well as EASU
staff and management. The implementing agency and the civil servants, collectively, also listed
political environment, frequent transfer of staff, limited capacity, and lack of training
opportunities, and complex procurement guidelines as key impediments during implementation.
These challenges are common across most Bank projects in Nepal.

On the Bank side, the TTL for the project changed in September 2007. Co-TTL remained until
October 2008.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The project design did not incorporate monitorable baseline indicators, and in the
absence of such baseline indicators for the overall project; the success of the project was assessed
by evaluating the performance of the sub-projects. According to the project team, it was not
possible to incorporate baseline indicators for the pre-identified projects; nevertheless these were
priorities of the government and had champions in the bureaucracy. Therefore, during both
project design and implementation, the focus of the results framework and the monitoring and
evaluation efforts has been more on the sub-project outputs and outcomes rather than the overall
project outcomes and results.

Although it was not planned in the project design, one monitoring officer was appointed after the
Mid-term review. In every trimester the progress of each project was reviewed and presented in
the review meeting at the center and progress was reported to the government and Bank.

The M&E framework consisted of supervision reports, trimesterly reports, site-visits, monthly
meetings of sub-project managers, and external reports.

Implementation. The ERTA project was implemented by the EASU unit under the National
Planning Commission. EASU had the following staff strength: one Program Coordinator, one
Deputy Program Coordinator, one Procurement specialist, one Finance Officer, one Planning
Officers, and one Monitoring and Evaluation officer, one office assistant, and two other support
staff. The M&E officer used to perform desk reviews and site-visits of all sub-projects under
implementation. The Steering Committee evaluated the progress of sub-projects in attaining their
outputs and made decision related to those.

The EASU did the monitoring of the sub-projects against the approved work plan as per the
signed MoU and against the agreed Results Framework (also called Monitoring and Evaluation
framework) for every sub-project. The monitoring of sub-projects was based on the trimesterly
reports received from each sub-project, as well as site visits.

Initially, before the M&E framework was put in place, little by way of M&E was taking place.
There was always shortage of staff and whoever was available to do the M&E was not
sufficiently trained. In early 2007, based on the recommendation of the second implementation
support mission, a strengthened monitoring and evaluation capability and process was put in
place for the project with the assistance of an external consultant. This included guidelines for
sub-projects on developing detailed results framework for each sub-project with detailed
baselines and monitorable indicators, along with training to sub-project staff on how to develop
such frameworks. Following that, the EASU completed a round of site visits for every project
under implementation. The sub-projects started providing trimester reports on a timely basis,
keeping minutes of their internal meetings and providing an update of progress against agreed
timetables. However, site-visits remained patchy due to the time constraints of EASU staff.


                                                16
The M&E framework included:
- Trimesterly progress report from the sub-projects;
- Desk reviews by the EASU while compiling the progress report for submission to IDA;
- Field visits to sub-projects, followed by field visits reports;
- Issues/progress of all the sub-projects discussed in the SC meeting (sub-project managers of
   sub-projects achieving less than 50% progress called upon to present in SC meetings);
- Issues/progress of all the sub-projects have been discussed in the NPC progress review
   meeting;
- Pursuant to desk review the sub-projects are instructed to give written responses of late
   progress or slow disbursements.

Following the recommendation of the external MTR, an M&E officer was appointed at EASU
and trained on M&E. The Monitoring officer made periodic site visits to the sub-projects. Also,
following the external Mid-Term Review (MTR), the Bank team and the EASU attempted to
make output values more measurable and monitorable. The results framework was modified by
adding baseline values for the outcome indicators and revising the target values for these
indicators. This restructuring of baselines and end-of-project targets was discussed in the fourth
implementation support mission of May 2008, and the revised RF was included in the Aide-
Memoire that followed that the mission.

By the time of project's extension, EASU was undertaking site-visits twice a year for each sub-
project under implementation. The sub-projects were providing trimesterly progress reports on a
timely basis, following which progress review and feedback was conducted with sub-project
managers (also trimesterly). In addition, periodic (monthly) brief reporting was required from the
sub-projects, as well as reviews by the concerned Ministerial Development Action Committee.
Finally, the initiation of monthly review meetings with sub-project managers in late 2008 was
instrumental in monitoring sub-project results and expediting implementation.

While these engagements improved the EASU's capacity to monitor the sub-projects, at times,
follow up was not adequate; the required corrective actions were not taken on a timely basis
despite the information was available due to the monitoring. Some of the corrective actions
needed the Steering Committee's intervention, which meant at times delays in taking decisions
and required action. And, the overall security and political instability related challenges were also
the reason behind delayed action.

Moving beyond monitoring on sub-project level to overall project M&E was only undertaken by
EASU during project's extension when the monitoring framework was enhanced to take-stock of
the satisfactory or lack-there-of completion of sub-projects and achievement of sub-project
outcomes.

Finally, at the sub-project level itself, monitoring was supposed to be part of each sub-project
staffing, however, in many cases this did not materialize because of limited resources and staff as
well as lack of understanding of clear monitoring concept and tools. It is important to highlight
however that such sub-projects (funded by donor TA executed by government agencies) were
implemented for the first time and contributed to substantial learning on project management and
evaluation on part of the government agencies' staff. As such it contributed to capacity
development within these agencies.

Utilization. Data was collected from various sub-projects and discussed in the review meeting
that facilitated decision makers to make changes, accelerate project activities and allocate needed


                                                 17
budget. Data was collected to show physical progress and financial progress of each sub-project.
Efforts were made to raise the progress by the trimester review meetings, Bank missions, and
EASU.

Recognition. In order to recognize the best performing sub-projects the Steering Committee met
and selected three projects that met a set of performance criteria. These projects were the
Strengthening Civil Service Personnel Information System through e-Governance,
Computerization of Land Revenue Document of Shyangja District; and, the Establishment of
Securities Data Management System in Security Board of Nepal (SEBON), which were selected
among the 26 completed sub-projects. The National Planning Commission organized the award
ceremony on December 31, 2009; Dr. Yubaraj Khatiwada, Vice Chairman of National Planning
Commission gave the awards to the winning project teams.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Environmental and social aspects. No environmental and social safeguard policies were
triggered by this project.

Fiduciary compliance
Financial Management. The overall financial management arrangements for the Project were
fully harmonized with the government financial management system. The Project prepared
Operational Guidelines for the recipients of sub-project grants from the Project which had a
dedicated section on financial management. It basically emphasized the arrangements in the
government system, and also highlighted some additional assurance arrangements to ensure that
funds provided were used for the purpose intended. Such arrangements included review of books
of accounts by the Project and the need to ensure that expenditures incurred for sub-projects were
audited. The Guidelines also specified the formats for reporting back to the Project Coordination
Team so that all expenditures under the Project were consolidated. For all signatories of sub-
projects, the Project Coordination Team arranged an orientation and briefing session during
which a dedicated session on financial management arrangement was also included. The Project
Coordination Team has been judicious in ensuring a good financial management system in the
Project. As a result, the Implementation Progress Reports and audit reports which also include a
section on Financing Monitoring Reports were submitted reasonably on time. Although there
have been a few changes of the Project Coordinator and also of the Accounts Staff during
implementation, this did not have a major impact on the compliance part of the financial
management. In terms of disbursements, the Project could not absorb all allocated funds, and this
is attributable mainly to the slow implementation and exchange rate gain.

Procurement. The procurement guidelines for this TA required all procurement to be approved
by the World Bank. This procedure involved the Bank providing a "no objection" letter to every
procurement decision for every sub-project and the EASU. Both the Bank and the Borrower staff
working on this project emphasized that this arrangement was burdensome and inefficient.

In addition, the difference between the GoN regulations and the Bank guidelines for competitive
bidding has lead to coordination problems hence delays for the sub-projects. The ERTA work
directive allowed the National Procurement Act (NPA) to be followed, some aspects of which are
different from the IDA procurement guidelines. For example, the NPA allowed a threshold of
RS150,000 for off-the-shelf procurement whereas the IDA guidelines required obtaining 3
quotations for the same threshold level. Having two different procurement guidelines at times
also created incentives to err on the side of caution. According to the fifth ISR, for example,


                                                18
"although the World Bank procedures are for the most part straight forward, many government
entities prefer to follow government (procurement) procedures `to be on the safe side'. There are
instances where sub-project managers are going for public tenders where no such requirement
exists for the Bank side."

The procurement procedures were followed in accordance with the EASU guidelines at most
times, however the MTR found a few occasions where there were exceptions, 3 which were
corrected following the MTR.

As specified in the PAD, the EASU staff included a procurement specialist (para 52, page 13) in
order to provide advice and guidance on procurement procedures and review the procurement
carried out by sub-projects. During the ex-post review, in a few occasions some procedural
deficiencies were noted; in some of the reviewed cases key contractual provisions were either
missing or incorrectly formulated, and procurement filing was inadequate, and did not contain the
relevant documents for some procurement stages.

In conclusion, while procurement under this project was done in accordance with the guidelines
and met the fiduciary requirements; for a small budget TA project with many sub-projects the
procurement modality was not the most efficient. The no-objection requirement was a very
cumbersome process, and made the implementation excessively process-intensive for the Bank
team as well as the government authorities. And, having two procurement guidelines in parallel
unduly slowed down some procurement decisions as it created incentives for sub-project staff to
be overcautious.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

According to the PAD, the project did not have a long term horizon; it was offered on a sunset
clause basis as it was designed to support and implement a set of reform initiatives, which needed
to be implemented quickly. Still, at the sub-project level, many of the sub-projects' outputs and
outcomes (especially those involving legislative changes, accounting/auditing standard setting,
computerization and automation, and improved services) will remain sustainable in the future.
The reforms to the civil service legislation and regulation will have long-term effects in the form
of improved access to the civil service for women, and traditionally underrepresented groups. The
new standards for auditing and accounting will improve transparency and bring reporting up to
international standards. The computerization of the civil service and police personnel records and
HR actions are two reforms that will continue to affect these institutions beyond the life of the
project. Finally, the use of DNA remains profiling will be a technological change that will
continue into the future.

  Procurement made from non-VAT registered supplier, in a few instances quotations were below the
required number; goods procured at a value higher than the order rate; procurement of goods split to remain
below the National Competitive Bidding thresholds to avoid complex procedural compliance.



                                                   19
The Government counterparts, the policy leadership, as well as the implementers at the sub-
project level highlighted the value of the Challenge Fund being a country-owned mechanism and
expressed desire for it to be continued in the future; either through further World Bank funding or
through the Government's own resources. The same argument can be found in the GoN's Project
Completion Report.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Relevance of objectives.
According to the World Bank's Operational Guidelines, the objectives of Bank-funded TA
projects could be all or any of the following three: assist in policy/program implementation;
develop/strengthen institutions; and, facilitate knowledge exchange (OPCS, 2006 TA objectives).
The ERTA started out as a TA project that aimed to help build capacity within the Government to
implement the PRSP, however it quickly became a TA aimed to develop and strengthen
institutions. The events that followed the 2005 royal coup and the ensuing instability hindered the
Government's functioning and created a serious setback to reform efforts. As a result, the PRSP
process was put on hold and ultimately stopped. As the political environment in which the TA
was designed changed, the ERTA, without explicit restructuring, became more heavily oriented
toward sub-projects which primarily focused on institutional strengthening.

At the sub-project level, outputs and some outcomes were satisfactory; however in aggregate
these outputs were not sufficient--and, at times inconsistent-- to achieve the overall project
objectives. The development objective of the TA was too broad and ambitious to begin with; and,
the expected outcomes were not realistic given the country circumstances, the institutional
weaknesses, and size of the project ($3 million). They were also not measurable. However, it is
important to note that the project was designed prior to the strengthening of the Bank's Results
Agenda and the Framework, which started around 2006.

Both the PRSP and the ERTA relied on the support of a few top reform-minded technocrats who
were replaced soon after the appraisal phase. Two main aspects of the project, namely accelerated
privatization and strategic communications about reforms, quickly became inconsistent with the
World Bank's assistance strategy as the country circumstances changed.

Design and Implementation.
The design of the Challenge Fund was innovative and flexible. This was the first technical
assistance project in Nepal that had a strong government ownership component. However, for the
TA to remain relevant to the overall development objective; the resources had to be channeled
strategically by the Steering Committee in line with the development priorities of the country,
which did not always happen (as some sub-projects under the Challenge Fund were not well-
linked to the overall project objectives).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The Project's Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen public sector capacity to implement
its economic reform agenda. The various sub-projects of ERTA deal primarily with improving



                                                20
governance, public management and service delivery. Progress towards achieving the PDO is
measured by success in achieving the project's four outcome indicators, which are in turn
determined by advancement in achieving the outcomes of the various sub-projects. Overall
progress in achieving the PDO has been partially satisfactory. While progress on the first two
outcome indicators (improving governance and improved service delivery) has been largely
satisfactory; sub-projects' under accelerated privatization and improved communications have not
been achieved or have only partially achieved their objectives. Although the project was initially
relevant to the Government and the Bank's Country Assistance with the regime change,
accelerated privatization (and to a lesser extent strategic communication of reforms) became
inconsistent with the GON's development priorities. It is important to note that these less
successful focus areas (and outcome indicators) of the project--privatization and strategic
communications-- together only received about 5 percent of the overall project funding;
project resources were, de facto, not channeled into these two areas.

The project also aimed to institutionalize the capacity to implement reforms by the GoN using the
country's own system - a significant contribution to this has been made through the support of the
Challenge Fund, which helped build capacity and foster innovation in some public sector
agencies. While some capacity was built under the project, its sustainability will depend on the
GoN's commitment to institutionalize this capacity in the future.

The overall ERTA project included 31 sub-projects; 20 sub projects were selected under the pre-
identified component, and 11 sub-projects under the challenge fund. When the project closed 26
of the sub projects were completed. Two sub-projects under the pre-identified component did not
sign MOUs (since they receive funding from other sources); one sub project under the pre-
identified, and, two sub-projects under the challenge fund component were stopped by their
respective implementing agency. Despite many challenges in implementation, according to the
GoN's assessment 21 of these projects were rated as satisfactory; three partially satisfactory; and,
two were unsatisfactory (as opposed to the revised target-value of 29 sub-projects being
successfully implemented).

Improved governance and public sector management.
As mentioned earlier, in the original RF, there were no baseline or quantitative target values for
this outcome indicator, instead, the PAD talks about two results indicators/original targets for this
outcome indicator namely: Passing the Governance and Civil Service Amendment Acts and
Implementing the MTEF. Both of these targets were met.

The revised baseline for this outcome indicator was weak governance and inadequate public
sector management (in accounting, auditing, civil service personnel actions, civil service
classification, local self-governance, legislative reform, government expenditure management,
school management, and public inspection/ investigation).

The revised RF measured progress towards achieving this outcome indicator by progress in
achieving the outputs/outcomes of the relevant sub-projects. In total, 13 sub-projects that aimed
to addressing governance and public sector management weaknesses were implemented (as
opposed to the planned 16 sub-projects, since one sub-project was dropped, one sub-project was
stopped, and the MoU for one sub-project was not signed). Of the 13 implemented sub-projects,
eleven were completed satisfactorily and two were partially satisfactory.




                                                 21
Specifically, sub-projects under this outcome indicator focused on and, achieved tangible results
in three key areas: civil service, fiduciary standards, and public expenditure management.4

A.       Improvements to the Civil Service. These improvements can be grouped under three
headings: inclusion, capacity building, and improvement in civil service management through
better systems.
    - Expanding Inclusion. Two sub-projects helped civil service to become more inclusive in
         terms of gender as well as traditionally underrepresented groups through supporting
         drafting and passage of several pieces of legislation on affirmative action and equitable
         governance in the civil service. In addition, one of the sub-projects helped improve
         admission to the civil service by modernizing testing techniques.
    - Strengthening Civil Service Capacity on Governance. Through building capacity to
         implement the Governance Act and providing TA to anti-corruption authority.
    - Civil Service Management Systems. The sub-project improved the management of civil
         service and increased its efficiency by setting up a computerized, network based
         personnel information system.

B.         Improvements to Fiduciary Standards and Capacity.
       -   Accounting and Auditing Standards. The project (through several sub-projects) helped
           develop and promote two separate accounting standards at par with international
           standards for public enterprises, and for the SMEs. It also promoted the adoption of
           auditing standards and auditing capacity.

C.      Improvements to Public Expenditure and Revenue Administration, and Capacity. Project
helped prioritize and allocate public expenditure (MTEF VI) and enhance the revenue
mobilization through two sub-projects.

Under this component also a very useful legislation preparation manual was prepared, adopted
and widely disseminated to help guide process of drafting legislation.

The outcomes and impacts of these sub-projects in improving Governance and Public Sector
Management are already materializing: Civil service recruitment is more inclusive and better
representative of Nepali society as a tangible result of the sub-projects which changed the rules
and processes of recruitment within the civil service. Improved capacity (and authority) to
implement Governance is a result of the sub-projects that helped translate the Governance Act
into rules, regulations and trained employees. In terms of public sector management, the PIS at
the central Government level is an important first step in making sure the civil service is better
run and more transparent. New auditing and accounting standards have resulted in better financial
and fiduciary reporting and Governance for SMEs and public enterprises.

Improved service delivery.
As mentioned earlier, in the original RF, there were no baseline or quantitative target values for
this outcome indicator, instead, the PAD talks about three results indicators/original targets for
this outcome indicator namely: Legislative Review of health sector; education sector

    Please see Annex 2 for further details of the sub-project outcomes.




                                                       22
decentralization initiative and improved community management; and creation of autonomous
HIV/AIDS unit. The Health sector Legislative review as well as the community management of
schools did materialize through two successfully completed sub-projects. The creation of the
HIV/AIDS unit took place, but was supported by an IDF-grant instead of the ERTA-funding.

The revised baseline for this outcome indicator was inadequate service delivery in the following
areas: police, health, school, forensic, statistics, civil service training, financial comptroller's
office, securities, district land records, and revenue administration.

The revised RF measured progress towards achieving this outcome indicator by progress in
achieving the outputs/outcomes of the relevant sub-projects. In total, 10 sub-projects that aimed
to improve service delivery were implemented (as opposed to the planned 12 sub-projects, since
one sub-project was dropped, and the MoU for one sub-project was not signed). Of the 10
implemented sub-projects, eight were completed satisfactorily, on was partially satisfactory and
one was unsatisfactory.

Sub-projects under this outcome indicator focused on and achieved tangible results in three key
areas.

A.       Improved Community School Management and Services. Through capacity building and
raising awareness amongst stakeholders on the systems and techniques of community school
management.
B.       Improved Government Services.
     - Improved land registration. Through computerization of information systems for the
     Land Revenue Office in Syangja.
     - Improved transparency and accuracy of civil status and court services. Through the
     development of the DNA (from human remains) profiling capacity.
     - Improving the efficiency and performance of Nepali police. By establishing a personnel
     management information system.
     - Improve civil service staffs' capacity to deliver services more effectively. Through
     strengthening the civil service training system.
     - Improved statistical services and capacity by funding and building capacity to regularly
     undertake the Distributive Trade Survey, which is a detailed representative survey that
     provides data on trading establishments in Nepal.
 C.      Improved Securities Market Services. Through enhancing data management and
 disclosure practices in the Securities market.

The outcomes and impacts of these sub-projects in improving service delivery are already
materializing: community school management and services are better in those community-run
schools that received training through the sub-project. Government services have improved in a
number of areas as result of ERTA's sub-projects: for example, land registration (in Syangja
District) is now computerized and take much less time; court/civil status services are expedited
and resolved scientifically as a result of the DNA profiling technology; Police services are more
accountable and efficient as a result of computerizing their personnel system; statistical services
were enhanced building capacity and conducting the first Distributive trade services survey in the
country. Finally, the services of the securities markets were substantially enhanced by providing
the Securities and Exchange Board of Nepal with the capacity and technology to better manage
data and be more transparent, thereby rendering better services to the public and the economy.




                                                23
Privatization. The original targets for this outcome indicator were: Privatization of a stake in at
least one of the three identified public enterprises (this was indirectly achieved) and creation of a
separate body for privatization (which was not achieved).

Lack of progress towards achieving the outcome indicator related to accelerating privatization has
been commensurate to the lack of progress for the PRSC-15 privatization related elements and
driven by the changing political circumstances. This area aimed at strengthening the
government's capacity to undertake privatization by preparing an enabling amendment to the
Privatization Act to establish a privatization entity and by preparing the three heavy loss-making
public enterprises (Nepal Airlines Corporation, Nepal Oil Corporation, and Nepal Telecom) for
divestiture through one sub-project. The baseline was insufficient planning and knowledge about
privatization requirements for major public utilities. The enabling amendment was drafted with
the support of the project but was never distributed for official discussions or for action. The
Nepal Telecoms Corporation eventually was partially privatized in 2008 via legal conversion to a
joint public-private venture, with the sale of 15 percent of its outstanding shares. This was done
with some help from ERTA (ERTA financed a study on the privatization of Nepal Telecoms).
The planned work related to the other two companies has not been initiated. The SOE review
planned as a basis for designing a privatization strategy was dropped.

Each implementation support mission Aide Memoire mentioned the lack of commitment to
privatization and the need to revisit the issue. The second Aide Memoire of 2006 recommended
that following the Midterm Review (that was then approaching) the outcome indicators should be
changed as appropriate if no progress on privatization had taken place. At the prodding of the
supervision teams, and following the MTR mission and the external MTR, the privatization sub-
project was stopped and then closed, and no additional funding was allocated or spent under this
sub-project. However, the outcome indicator was not changed or dropped.

Improved communications. This area of focus attempted to broaden the support for reform
initiatives within Nepal, through improved and strategic communication about the importance and
need for these reforms. This was to be done through two sub-projects, one of which was
completed satisfactorily. This outcome indicator's original targets were: completion of the
communications audit (which was only partially addressed through the sub-project on expediting
Governance Reforms through Strategic Communication) and commencement of strategic
communications program (which never took off).

The sub-project on expediting Governance Reforms through Strategic Communications resulted
in a communications strategy report, however, it did not follow through on its recommendations.
The National Vigilance Center Strengthening sub-project, on the other hand, assisted the Center
in communicating its messages through innovative communication tools. These messages aimed
primarily at improving the Nepali public's understanding of the importance of anti-corruption and

  The PRSC series aimed to do two things. First, it sought to improve the transparency and efficiency of the
SOE sector by completing annual audits and progressively privatizing the SOEs. Second, it intended to
reduce and eventually eliminate losses by the National Oil Corporation (estimated at 1 percent of GDP in
FY02­03 due to subsidized fuel prices). Its approach to NOC losses was both short-term--raising fuel
prices to cover cost of purchase, transport, and distribution--and medium-term--establishing an automatic
price mechanism for petroleum products, setting a professional regulatory body, and liberalizing petroleum
product distribution.



                                                    24
the opportunities that exist for grievance redressal aimed to facilitate the work of the office and
prepared some marketing materials with the ERTA funds.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The classic tools to measure efficiency such as economic rate of return or financial rate of return
are not readily applicable to institutional capacity building and to such TA projects. However, the
ERTA project used government systems and local consultants for implementing sub projects and
overall running and monitoring of the project - which resulted in significant cost savings.
According to the staff interviewed and the GoN Project Completion Report, lower staff costs (the
sub-projects were implemented by the staff of the respective government unit as opposed to
hiring of international consultants) and the use of the GoN's systems were key contributors to the
project's cost efficiency.

While not all the 26 sub-projects seem to be directly relevant to the project's overall PDO, and
while at times they lacked an overarching strategic direction, still having achieved tangible results
in more than 20 sub-projects in key reform areas with only about US$2 million may be
considered as efficient.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
The overall project PDO was relevant at time of project appraisal; however, it was very ambitious,
too broad and not measurable. The outcome indicators/objectives did not have a baseline or
targets, which needed to be corrected during implementation. By the end of implementation, two
(privatization and strategic communications) of the four main outcomes/objectives of the project
as defined during appraisal had become inconsistent with government priorities due to the
changing political environment. However, these only received 5 percent of the project funding.

Most of the funding was channeled to the two other main outcome indicators/objectives of the
project, whose results were somewhat relevant, did achieve their targets, and did so efficiently.
Still, the overall outcome rating is: moderately unsatisfactory. This is because: first, while the
four objectives were relevant, the chosen and implemented sub-projects and their outcomes were
not necessarily the most important reforms to address the key bottlenecks in these four areas.
Second, the aggregate impact of all these sub-project outcomes' does not yield itself easily to
claiming the achievement of the desired improvements in governance and service delivery set-out
in the very ambitious PDO.

The project, de facto, became a pool of funds open to any government office that needed
support--where there was some link to good governance and improved service delivery, and
where the GoN budget was insufficient to undertake the needed investment or activity. It seems
that the flexible design at times allowed the Bank and the Borrower to avoid taking corrective
actions to deal with the changing priorities and uncertain political environment. This also meant
that there was not an explicit decision on the adequate scope for this TA. Both of these things
impacted the overall outcome of the project unfavorably.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The amendment to the Civil Service Act improved access to the civil service for women, and
traditionally underrepresented groups.

 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
The GoN's Project Completion Report states that: "the ERTA project, in reality was more about
institutional change and organizational strengthening." This is true in two ways. First, the ERTA
funding helped strengthen institutions and systems in the Government units where sub-projects
were implemented. Second, the challenge fund component fostered a congenial competitive
environment within the Government by providing a pool of additional funds, which can be tapped
by interested Government departments that are willing to submit proposals and compete for these
funds. These departments tend to have teams that are motivated to implement these reforms, thus
instilling a culture of competition, pro-activeness and drive for results. In addition, for this type of
TA, the Government agencies need to build their capacity to submit good quality proposals,
prepare and implement projects, and to monitor implementation and results. This represented an
organizational cultural change within the GoN. This is relevant to the PDO as it links closely
with building public sector capacity for undertaking reforms.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
The ICR mission conducted a workshop in Kathmandu on 27 January 2010 with the GoN
counterparts (the implementing agency, sub-project managers) and with the participation of the
World Bank staff involved in the project. The participation at the workshop was high with
managers representing experiences from 17 sub-projects; and the discussion was very lively.
Given that the GoN considers the government units implementing the sub-projects as main
stakeholders; their views were most relevant to capture in this context.

  Relevance: extent to which objectives and project design are consistent with country needs and
institutional priorities. ("did we do the right thing?"); Efficacy: extent to which the project objectives have
been achieved or are expected to be achieved, taking into account relative importance. ("did we do what we
said we would do?"); Efficiency: extent to which the project objectives have been achieved without using
more resources than necessary. ("did we do it efficiently?")



                                                     26
The participants were enthusiastic about the project, and viewed the outcomes as highly positive.
Across the board, the managers of the sub-project who were present at the workshop felt that their
projects were closely linked with the broader objective of the ERTA. Among the strengths of the
projects they listed: project fostered innovation; government ownership; empowerment of the
Project Manager through the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU); inter-agency
cooperation in addressing implementation problems through the Steering Committee; cost
effective implementation through the use of government systems; the Challenge Fund's unique
design allowing for bottom up initiative while also allowing for the support of the higher level
leadership (the Steering Committee).

The participants also were asked to discuss the weaknesses of the project as they perceived it and
the challenges they faced during implementation. They highlighted that the project was not
designed adequately to adjust to the possible political changes despite the fact that it had been
designed during a very uncertain political environment. Sustainability of the projects and the
follow up activities were not thought through carefully. And, the participants strongly emphasized
the tediousness of the procurement procedures. In some cases, sub-project managers felt that they
were held accountable through the MoUs they signed without having the adequate authority to
achieve results intended. Excessive paperwork and frequent staff transfers were emphasized as
key challenges during the implementation phase.

According to the workshop participants lessons learned were the need for strong and clear
linkages between the objectives of the overall project and of the sub projects. They recommended
that in the pre-design phase, a high quality assessment of possible stakeholders' needs would help
design better projects. They also recommended: cutting down on excessive paperwork
requirements, allocation of adequate resources to cover sub-project overhead costs, harmonizing
project's procurement requirements with the Government's, strengthening the M&E processes in
a way to allow authorities to take corrective action, strengthening staff incentives, simplifying
the authorization budget procedure in coordination with the concerned Government agencies, and
better defined roles and responsibilities for the sub-project managers.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome7
Rating: Significant

The project's delivery mechanism was not designed to be sustainable in the long-run; with the
expectation that it would support discrete economic reforms in support of building capacity to
implement the PRSP. Still, at the sub-project level, many of the sub-projects' outputs and
outcomes (especially those involving legislative changes, accounting/auditing standard setting,
computerization and automation, and improved services) will remain sustainable in the future.
The reforms to the civil service legislation and regulation will have long-term effects in the form
of improved access to the civil service for women, and traditionally underrepresented groups. The
new standards for auditing and accounting will improve transparency and bring reporting up to
international standards. The computerization of the civil service and police personnel records and
HR actions are two reforms that will continue to affect these institutions beyond the life of the



7
  According to the 2006 harmonized guidelines, sustainability has been replaced with a "risk to
development outcome," defined as the risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). The risk to development outcome can be rated at
the project level as high, significant, moderate, negligible to low, non-evaluable.



                                                  27
project. Finally, the use of DNA remains profiling will be a technological change that will
continue into the future.

The risks to the project's development outcome have already materialized for two of the outcome
indicators--accelerated privatization, and improved communications. The reform priorities of the
authorities quickly changed following several significant political transitions in the country. As
early as the second Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR), the project team mentioned
that the privatization was no longer a priority nor a feasible goal as it was envisaged and the DO
had to be changed accordingly. Still, there was no formal restructuring or cancellation. However,
as mentioned earlier, these two outcome indicators together received only 5 percent of project
funding.

Overall, the risk to overall development outcomes is significant: the project was prepared and
appraised under the Government appointed by the King, and implemented during transition from
Monarchy to Republic, and under three other Governments. Political instability remained a
significant challenge throughout the project implementation, compromising the Government's
ability to pursue economic reforms. One of the key envisaged features of this project, which was
to pool donor funds for TA to build government's capacity to implement economic reforms,
never took place.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
This project was not assessed by the Quality Assurance Group for quality at entry. The project
was designed and approved in a short period of time, and many details were not ironed out. The
project design was at once flexible (the Borrower could chose its own reform priorities and
implement them) and too process-intensive (the Bank had to give a no-objection for every MoU
and procurement contract, the high-level Steering Committee had to approve every MoU and
many funding decisions, GoN procurement, budget approvals and other processes were observed
and involved many processes).

The project design also lacked a measurable and focused PDO, indicator values and monitoring
framework, which in turn, resulted in implementation to be driven by processes and sub-project
outputs more so than overall project outcomes.

While a number of risks to the project's success were assessed during appraisal and the project
preparation team looked at other TA projects in Nepal and in the region for lessons, the
mitigation actions for the identified risks were not adequately formulated. Since such risk
mitigation measures were not incorporated in the TA's implementation strategy there was no
available strategy for project restructuring or amendments for the project to adjust to the new
dynamics and the supervision team had to come-up with amendments (such as restructuring the
RF and extending the project) during implementation.

In theory, the continued political uncertainty could have been managed because there is
maximum built-in flexibility in the project design or because the project is "well-placed to deliver
a range of results or alternatively remain dormant until a more promising window of opportunity
presents itself". However, this flexibility allowed the Borrower not to focus on the key reform



                                                28
priorities, resulting in the approval of a number of sub-projects that were either mostly studies
and reports with no great impact, or were disparate sub-projects with no clear linkages.

 (b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The supervision of fiduciary and safeguard aspects was rigorously implemented; supervision
inputs and processes were more than adequate; and the performance reporting was high quality
and candid. Six implementation support missions were fielded, and the project had a well-staffed
technical and sectoral team from the World Bank working closely with the implementing agency
the EASU.

This TA project was quite unique in the sense that it comprised 31 different sub-projects in
various reform areas, which made monitoring of outputs and results a very time-and-process-
intensive exercise. Despite the limited supervision resources for such broad project scope, the
team has been effective in supervising the project through regular communication with the
EASU; day-to-day support to the EASU and the sub-projects (as one of the co-TTL's was based
in the field and spent considerable time on this project); periodic missions, detailed analysis of the
implementation issues, and the detailed external review which was commissioned by the Bank.

The project team ensured that three major implementation changes were undertaken, which they
perceived as necessary to improve the project's outcomes and results: design and implementation
of an extensive monitoring framework for the sub-projects (which was not initially included);
introducing more measurable and monitorable output/indicator values for the overall project; and,
agreeing on a detailed Results Action Plan during the extension period. The project team also
insisted on addressing the privatization sub-project/outcome indicator in each mission. The result
was that, at the urging of the Bank team, the sub-project was stopped and eventually closed, after
receiving only 2 percent of the overall project funds (when it became clear there was no political
will to implement it).

The fiduciary policies were implemented at all times with rigor and the related risks were
managed very well. The project team aimed at minimizing delays, however, due to the
requirement for no objection for all procurement transactions, at times, the Bank's response to the
no-objection requests was delayed since some requests required specific technical expertise (such
as specific-purpose hardware procurement that had to be referred experts in the World Bank Head
Quarters). This project did not trigger any environmental or social safeguard policies.

However, the team did not restructure the project (in order to sharpen its results focus) at the
same time as they revised the PDO and the results indicators to be realistic and measurable.
According to the team, further restructuring was not undertaken due to the following reasons: The
Borrower was satisfied with the project's design (especially the flexibility of choosing sub-
projects and the Challenge Fund) and with the implementation progress. The Borrower and the
Bank team did not deem it feasible to restructure the overall design since by the Midterm Review,
most of the 29 sub-projects had been approved and the funds for those sub-projects had been
committed. It was also not clear what it could be restructured into. Given the changes at the NPC
and the political turmoil, it was not clear what set of priorities would the project be restructured
into. Closing the project, rather than restructuring it, at any time after MTR would have
jeopardized the outputs and outcomes of the sub-projects under implementation. The supervision
team and the EASU at that stage focused their energies on issues primarily related to
implementation of the sub-projects (many of which suffered from delays), rather than the design
of the project. The privatization outcome indicator was the only one that was not performing, and
was stopped, but was not changed or dropped.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

The quality of supervision was rated as moderately satisfactory since supervision of fiduciary and
safeguard aspects was rigorously implemented; supervision inputs and processes were more than
adequate; and the performance reporting was high quality and candid. The team worked closely
with government counterparts during implementation. The Bank was able to urge the authorities
to make improvements in implementation, staffing, management, and results monitoring. On the
other hand, the project's original design was not adequate/realistic for the country circumstances
and the supervision team did not restructure drop the non-performing outcome indicators, which
resulted in a "quality at entry" rating of moderately unsatisfactory.

In the case of split ratings, the guidance is that "the rating for overall Bank Performance normally
depends on the Outcome rating except when Bank performance did not significantly affect the
particular outcome." However, the overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory
because although the outcomes rating is moderately unsatisfactory, it is so because of the over-
ambitious PDO and not as strictly measured by the Results Framework indicators. This is a
unique case where the Bank performed moderately satisfactorily and diligently (especially during
supervision) while project outcomes could have been rated as MS as well, had it not been for the
very broad and un-monitorable PDO and indicators and lack of baselines. In many ways, the
project would have been deemed a partial success, especially given the small amount of funding
involved.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The Steering Committee, (SC) which guided project implementation, was composed of the
Secretaries of key government ministries, and represented the Government in this project. The SC
showed commitment and interest to the project. From a fiduciary stand-point GoN performed
well and fulfilled its fiduciary obligations, mostly on time.

The Steering Committee was envisaged to provide the overall development vision and direction
to this project; it was composed of top government officials. The Steering Committee (SC) met
periodically, and showed interest and ownership in the Project. Despite the commitment of the SC
to the project's development objectives; the project's small monetary size, broad scope, and
complex design may have complicated the Steering Committee's functioning as the synthesizing
authority, and diverted their focus away from the overall development objectives to sub-project
implementation. This resulted in the SC choosing sub-projects that were not necessarily the key
reforms to addressing the bottlenecks in the four focus areas of the project. It also resulted in
spreading the funding over 27-odd sub-projects, instead of consolidating it on a few key, high-
impact reform areas. The flexibility in the project design meant that the Government did not
always focus on the key reform priorities, resulting in the approval of a number of sub-projects
that were either mostly studies and reports with no great impact, or were disparate sub-projects
with no clear linkages.

The SC had the power, the ability, and the broad representation to choose and approve key reform
areas for funding under ERTA. However, due to various reasons (including changes of


                                                30
Government Secretaries and changes at the National Planning Commission, among others), the
SC did not exercise this authority to the fullest. The project was not marketed sufficiently within
the Government. Its role was reactive rather than pro-active, as it did not take the initiative to
focus the project on key reform areas, or introduce/choose more effective sub-projects in those
areas.

The project's implementation has been slow and suffered from extended delays, some of which
were related to the Government's performance. First, in some cases, some sub-project approvals
by the SC took up to or longer than 3 months. Second, delays in budgetary allocation and
spending authorizations prevented sub-projects from acquiring resources needed to implement the
sub-projects. Third, the frequent transfer of staff both at the EASU and at the sub-project manager
level has had an impact on the performance of the project and sub-projects, though it is essential
to highlight that this problem is pervasive across projects in Nepal. These implementation delays,
in turn, resulted in time pressures to complete sub-projects quickly, which risked at times
compromising the quality of some outputs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The EASU, the implementing agency, was committed to achieving development objectives of the
project. Over time, EASU became adequately staffed as implementation proceeded, and technical
experts were brought on board as needed such as in procurement and monitoring and evaluation.
The EASU worked closely with the sub-projects--which were the beneficiaries of this overall
project-- and endavoured to resolve implementation issues. However the frequent transfer of
coordinators and some staff affected performance. The EASU team fulfilled its fiduciary, project
management, and monitoring tasks adequately.

The EASU; was able to carry out several corrective actions when needed, such as ensuring that
the amount of study tours were limited; and, organizing training for the sub-project staff on
procurement and bidding. At times, however, corrective action was not taken or was delayed. For
example delay in dropping some unsuccessful sub-projects and reallocation of resources. And the
EASU's own monitoring was solely focused on the sub-project outputs, and not the overall
project results (until the year of the project's extension).

In terms of sub-project implementation, some of the sub-projects agencies were very enthusiastic
and capable of implementing and the result was good outcomes for these sub-projects. However,
there were quite a few sub-projects with poorly performing implementing agencies, which were
not pro-active (and at times not interested) in implementing the sub-projects, which resulted in
many implementation delays and under-spending (compromising the sub-project outputs).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance rating is moderately satisfactory based on the government and
the EASU's commitment to implement the project, the commitment and ability of many of the
sub-project implementing agencies to implement their sub-projects, as well as adequate overall
fiduciary compliance. While implementing agency(ies) performance has been rated as moderately
satisfactory (because of their implementation efforts), Government performance has been rated as
moderately unsatisfactory because of the lack of strategic direction regarding the broader
development objectives of the project and lack of focus in approving sub-projects, which meant
that the results of the project were largely limited to sub-project outcomes, some of which were



                                                31
not the most relevant to the overall project outcome indicators. Delays in implementation and
slow disbursements also hampered the project's performance.

Despite this split ratings, the overall Borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory
because although the outcomes rating is moderately unsatisfactory, it is so because of the over-
ambitious PDO and not as strictly measured by the Results Framework indicators. This is a
unique case where Borrower had been diligent and performed moderately satisfactorily, and the
project outcomes could have been rated as MS as well, had it not been for the very broad and un-
monitorable PDO and indicators and lack of baselines.

6. Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

        The Project's DO and the key outcome indicators were too broad and not measurable.
        This created severe challenges during implementation and monitoring outcomes.
        The project design put too much emphasis on the commitment and support of an
        executive authority with limited legitimacy and a few top reformers (who were replaced
        during the course of project implementation).
        Inconsistencies between Nepal's National Procurement Act (NPA) and the IDA
        procurement guidelines were a key factor in explaining slow disbursement as sub-project
        managers were compelled to follow extra steps/procedures in line with the NPA (even if
        not required by the IDA guidelines). This seems to be a common obstacle in many
        projects in Nepal, which needs to be resolved.
        The requirement for the World Bank to provide no-objection for each procurement
        transaction under this project was very cumbersome and process-intensive. It not only
        slowed down the project implementation, but also was costly in terms of staff time from
        both the authorities and the Bank side.
        The Challenge Fund is an innovative and flexible implementation tool, and could be
        replicated. However, it is important that there should be an overall strategic direction and
        result orientation to guide its allocation decisions and implementation. These types of
        funds need to have a thematic focus and the sub-projects chosen should address key-
        bottlenecks in this area of focus.

Executive Summary of the Borrower's Project Completion Report
Project Overview
Under the Economic Reform Program, the Government of Nepal had initiated Economic Reform
Technical Assistance (ERTA) project with technical support from the World Bank under IDA
Grant H173-Nep. This ERTA project was designed to streamline, coordinate, and improve the
effectiveness of foreign Technical Assistance (TA) to bring efficiency and effectiveness of the
public organizations of Nepal. The overall objective of the project was to strengthen public sector
capacity by improving service delivery, public sector management, and support for economic
growth with efficient governance. Under the ERTA project, several sub-projects, each spanning a
willing government agency, were implemented with the goal to facilitate economic reform
programs by improving the internal management system in their respective organizations.
The key dates of the project were as follows:
        Grant approval date: 06/28/2005
        Grant effective date: 11/28/2005
        Grant closing date: 12/31/2008
        Extended closing date: 12/31/2009
The Cost of the project was USD 3 million in total: Pre-identified 2 million and Challenge Fund 1
million. Total disbursement was USD 2.1 million.
The status of the sub-project was as follows: Total number of sub projects selected 31, Pre-
identified 20; Challenge Fund 11; Total number of sub project started 27; Pre-identified 17;
Challenge Fund: 10. MoU of 2 projects were not signed; and 3 sub-projects were dropped. In total
26 sub-projects were completed. Among them the success rate of 21 was satisfactory, 3 sub-
projects were partially satisfactory, and 2 were unsatisfactory. The objectives of the government
with this project were:

        Strengthen public sector capacity to implement national economic reform agenda
        Improve service delivery
        Accelerate privatization
        Increase strategic communication across the country via central and district public offices.

The main beneficiaries of this project were civil servants of various sectors at central as well as
district level and stakeholders of the private sector who can work in public private partnership
models. Ultimately the general public would be benefited through efficient governance.

Project Components
The ERTA project originated with four major components based on baseline value and end-of-
project target value:
    a) Improved Governance and Public Sector Management
    b) Improved Service Delivery
    c) Accelerated Privatization
    d) Strategic Communication

Project Design and Implementation



                                                6
The project was designed in line with the 10th National Plan of Nepal to reduce poverty and
strengthen the capacity of public sector by means of reformations. The implementation of the
objectives remained consistent and relevant throughout the life of the project. However, due to
the volatility of the national political scene that affected the Steering Committee, and changes in
development ideologies and approaches, some sub-projects were halted by implementing
authority. Rests of the sub-projects, carried out and completed, were most relevant to the
economic situation of Nepal and objectives and project design were found most relevant.
All sub-projects under each component were focused on measuring the effect of the innovative
activities and project outcomes. Priorities were determined from among the accounting, auditing,
civil service personnel actions, civil service classifications, legislative reform, government
expenditure management, community school management.
The total project expenses were 47.44% for public investigation under good governance and
35.81% for improved service delivery. Likewise expenses on accelerated privatization was 1.8% ,
4.05% for strategic communication and 10.90% was for office management.

Project Outcome and Impact
The overarching goal of the project was to strengthen public sector capacity to implement its
economic reform agenda. With this in mind, the four component objectives were determined to
measure project outcome.

A. Governance and Public Sector Management
Overall Outcome Rating:
Relevance: High
Efficacy: High
Efficiency Outcome: Satisfactory
The 12 sub-projects under this objective were completed with a satisfactory outcome. One of the
key impacts of this objective is corruption control and awareness. The implementation of
Governance Act reformation sub-project will make public officials more accountable for the
optimal use of public resources. The Audit Quality Improvement (OAG) sub-project will improve
the audit efficiency and capacity of OAG to produce more credible audit reports that will
maintain public confidence. The qualitative and timely issuance of audit reports will also satisfy
donors such that it will expedite the flow of foreign aid more effectively. Similarly, the
Development and Promotion of Accounting Standards for Public Entities sub-project will
enhance reliability through a more transparent and accountable Government Accounting System.
This will ensure a sufficient flow of foreign aid, and thus foster economic development. The
development and promotion of accounting standards for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
will contribute to revenue generation and foster economic growth through uniformity in the
financial statements of SMEs and thus the enlargement of tax base. Among other key outcomes,
the strengthening of Civil Services PIS through e-Governance will result in instant record updates
that can be used for resource planning and decision making process. This will ensure effective
and efficient management of civil servants. Moreover, the study and implementation of unified
civil service project will result in efficient, effective, and productive civil servants. A continuation
of Unified Civil Service Project Phase II planned, but it was stopped by the implementing agency.

B. Improved Service Delivery
Overall Outcome Rating:
Relevance: High
Efficacy: High
Efficiency Outcome: Satisfactory




                                                   7
Eleven sub-projects where completed successfully under the improved service delivery objective,
with the primary goal of improving inadequate service in police, health, schools, forensic,
statistics, civil service training, financial controller, securities, district land records, and revenue
administration services. Upgrading of public financial management of the government will ensure
efficient maintenance of Government account. Data of government expenditure and revenue will
be available timely, which will aid in swift decision making.
The Computerized Personnel Management Information Establishment Project will increase the
economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the police, and change citizen's image of the police
force for the better. Likewise, the Capacity Building Program on Community School
Management sub-project will inspire non-CMS to transfer to CMS. On the healthcare front, the
Private Sector Health Assessment Project could enhance effectiveness and efficiency in the
delivery of health services but all the planned activities in the project were not completed.

C. Accelerated Privatization
Overall Outcome Rating:
Relevance: Moderate
Efficacy: Moderate
Efficiency Outcome: Moderate
Insufficient planning and knowledge was assessed about privatization for major public utilities.
At the end of the project, the expectation was successful implementation and completion of one
project that lead to forming of privatization cell and at least one SOE privatized. The only project
in this objective was Nepal Public Enterprises Privatization Program. This could increase the role
of private sector public entities but it could not achieve its outcomes because of changes in
policies and priorities.

D. Strategic Communication
Overall Outcome Rating:
Relevance: High
Efficacy: High
Efficiency Outcome: Satisfactory
The lack of strategic communication was a hurdle on reform initiatives. Hence this objective was
implemented via two sub-projects. The National Vigilance Center Strengthening sub-project will
have positive impact on society through technical audit and public awareness on service delivery
cost, and positive culture enhanced to prevent corruption activities. The accumulation of capital
earned through corruption will be discouraged and productive investment will be increased.
The Expediting Governance Reforms through Strategic Communication sub-project could not
achieve all the envisaged outputs.

Future Implications and Recommendations
The assessment of risk to development outcome is satisfactory. This rating is done in view of
longer term sustainability of the outcomes. This is obvious that optimal outcomes resulted in
quite large sectors of governance, service delivery and communication with minimal input. It has
also brought quick changes and results in civil servants' day to day performance with project
input. The present political situation is less risky to practice the outcomes in their respective field.
Many of the success stories like Land Revenue record system of Syangja, SEBON and DNA are
easily replicable outcomes in other similar areas. There is also less financial risk to continue
project outcomes since government can continue many project activities with its regular budget.
Some backstopping support may be required in future in developing technical or Hi-tech system
in governance supra-system, system and sub-system as continuous process, expansion of projects
or designing new projects. Virtually in all cases government can continue achieved outcomes.



                                                   8
The assessment of bank and borrower performance is just satisfactory. Since ERTA was a new
project model for Nepal it will require a lot of preparation at the entry such as environmental
scanning including political situation, marketing of project ideas among stakeholders,
requirements of technical expertise in preparation, procurement of experts and equipment,
exploration of baseline data, and clarification and delimitations of PDOs and indicators. In spite
of these facts, Bank's decision to support GoN is an inspiring and encouraging decision for the
development of Nepal.
The lengthy process of procurement resulted delay in procurement, which led delay in project
completion. It is recommended that both the Bank and the Borrower's side be simplified. The
high rate of transfers and turnovers of project managers in a project affected smooth
implementation. It is recommended that the same project managers remain in place during the
project duration.
To motivate the project team, an incentive program should be devised that periodically rewards
and recognizes effective workers. Team managers have their own regular duties to perform in
addition to the projects. For smooth implementation of such projects they should be freed from
other tasks or more staff is to be assigned for additional duties and tasks.
TA support can be more relevant and effective if invested in demand based projects in future.
However, ERTA is a good project model for Nepal. It can be even more relevant if done under
Challenge Fund with wider dissemination of information or marketing, and selection from a
wider competition including private sector. Most of the project can be sustained even with local
resources if considered sensitively. Some backstopping may be required to update the technology
and governance system.
