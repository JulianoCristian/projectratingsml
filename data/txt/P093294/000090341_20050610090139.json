Assistance\n            Project for Nepal aims to support the implementation of key\n            short term measures of the reform agenda as embodied in the\n            Royal Proclamation, the 21-point program, and the PRS. The\n            Nepal Economic Reform Technical Assistance Project (NERTA)\n            should be structured to provide flexibility in sourcing and\n            building capacity. During the preparation and appraisal\n            meetings, Bank support was requested in the following areas;\n            (i) improving governance and public sector management; (ii)\n            accelerating privatization; (iii) improving service\n            delivery; and (iv) implementing a strategic communications\n            program. A brief overview of support in each of these areas\n            is presented below. It is proposed that these areas form the\n            areas of pre-identified technical assistance while the\n            remainder of the resources is placed in a challenge fund."}, "docdt": "2005-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
