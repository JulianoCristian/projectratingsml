The\n            objective of the project was to enable the Government of\n            Tanzania to provide the farming community with adequate\n            extension messages to enhance agricultural production,\n            productivity and rural incomes.  Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) in a long-term\n            program, specific objectives, with indicators, for each of\n            the phases in the program should be clearly identified at\n            the start of each phase; (ii) the pilot scheme provided\n            insufficient input to project design since inadequate time\n            was allowed for experience to be generated and an evaluation\n            to be made; (iii) simple technical messages are often\n            initially relevant to farmers on initial contacts with an\n            extension service; (iv) the project did not carry out\n            initial base-line surveys to later measure project impacts;\n            (v) the involvement of farmers in designing and operating\n            extension programs is a critical element in ensuring the\n            continued technical relevance and usefulness of the service;\n            (vi) the change to group-based extension was positive as\n            ownership of the program was then transferred to the\n            community; (vii) government commitment is essential for\n            training and visit projects to have a successful outcome,\n            both in terms of staffing numbers and funding from\n            Government budgetary resources; and (viii) ICRs need to be\n            altered to require the ICR to be completed and available at\n            appraisal of succeeding operations."}, "docdt": "1998-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
