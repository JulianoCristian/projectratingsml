Dear Sir:
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the above-
mentioned Project dated May 8, 1989, between the United Republic of
Tanzania (the Borrower) and the International Development
Association (the Association) and to Mr. Mugasha's letter dated May
2, 1990, requesting an amendment to the definition of Project Area
to include the Mara Region instead of the Rukwa Region.
     Accordingly Section 1.02 (m) of the Development Credit
Agreement is amended to read as follows:
     "Project Area" means the area covered by the following
     regions, Tabora, Singida, Dodoma, Kagera, Mara, Sinyaga,
     Kilimanjaro, Mtwara, Lindi, Mwanza, Morogoro and Arusha.
     All provisions of the Development Credit Agreement as amended
herein shall remain in full force and effect.
                         Sincerely yours,
                         INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  ASSOCIATION
