They are described as follows: Protect soil\n            surfaces during construction, control and clean construction\n            sites daily, and provide adequate waste disposal services to\n            prevent soil contamination from waste materials. Dispose of\n            oil and other hazardous materials properly, rehabilitate\n            adequate sanitary facilities, and include appropriate\n            disposal of wastewater and sewerage in order to avoid\n            clogged drains and water quality decline. Use water to\n            control dust and restrict construction to certain hours to\n            reduce noise. To maintain aesthetics and protect the\n            landscape and prevent debris from being dumped into water\n            bodies, clean the building site and dispose of all debris\n            and waste materials in accordance with clauses specified in\n            the bills of quantities. Except for paint, all of the\n            materials are non-hazardous. Sites used for construction\n            waste disposal will be government-approved. Sites will be\n            rehabilitated and trees planted. A community involvement\n            measure calls for commitments from families and local\n            businesses to look after trees. Finally, to prevent any\n            health implications to populations, there will be specially\n            designed systems for handling and disposing of hazardous\n            wastes like asbestos."}, "docdt": "2003-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
