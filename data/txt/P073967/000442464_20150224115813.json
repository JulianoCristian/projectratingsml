Surrounded\n            by potted plants and faded posters, the kids are dwarfed by\n            the heavy wooden furniture. A first set of projects helped\n            revise the national curriculum, reorganize universities, and\n            rehabilitate school buildings. The latest endeavor, the\n            rural education project, was launched in 2003. Financed with\n            a 60 million dollars World Bank loan, the project seeks to\n            correct disparities between rural and urban schools, a\n            particularly important issue as Romania moves ahead with\n            decentralization. The ministry of education has earmarked 34\n            million dollars under the rural education project to bring\n            Romania\u0092s 1,500 rural schools up to civilized standards. The\n            World Bank and the Romanian ministry of education also\n            launched a competition in which schools, working with the\n            municipality and local citizens, are invited to submit\n            project ideas. Winning programs have invited adult villagers\n            to discover the school library, for example, or offered\n            farmers a chance to learn with their children about the Internet."}, "docdt": "2005-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
