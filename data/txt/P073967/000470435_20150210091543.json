Surrounded by\n            potted plants and faded posters, the kids are dwarfed by the\n            heavy wooden furniture. Carmen, a precocious 10 year-old,\n            has to stand on her feet to reach her notebook and write.\n            Upstairs, where lightweight desks and chairs have recently\n            arrived, teachers like Vasile Priciu, 51, have discovered\n            the art of semicircles and small study groups.

In an effort to\n            break with this passive model inherited from the country\u0092s\n            authoritarian past, the Romanian government is working with\n            the World Bank to modernize its schools. A first set of\n            projects helped revise the national curriculum, reorganize\n            universities and rehabilitate school buildings. The latest\n            endeavor, the Rural Education Project, was launched in 2003.\n            Financed with a $60 million World Bank loan, the project\n            seeks to correct disparities between rural and urban\n            schools, a particularly important issue as Romania moves\n            ahead with decentralization."}, "docdt": "2006-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
