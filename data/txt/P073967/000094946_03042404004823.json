education,\n            as evidenced by higher achievement scores and completion and\n            transition rates. This wil be achieved through four project\n            components. Component 1 improves teaching and learning by\n            financing school-based professional development for\n            teachers, providing career development opportunities;\n            upgrading basic education conditions in schools, and\n            ensuring access of rural students to basic teaching-learning\n            materials. Component 2 improves school-community\n            partnerships by setting up a school-community grants\n            program. Component 3 strengthens the analytic capacity of\n            the Ministry of Education and Research (MER) at national and\n            local levels for policy analysis and formulation, as well as\n            for planning and evaluation. Specifically, it establishes\n            the National Education Indicators Set (NEI); improves the\n            National Education Database (NED); and prepares a National\n            Assessment of Basic Education. Component 4 strengthens\n            project management capacity; its activities include forming\n            an information, education, and communication strategy for\n            increasing awareness of policy and decisionmakers and\n            generating stakeholders' support. The project will\n            support a broader community involvement in education\n            management, working not only with education authorities, but\n            also with the local councils, parents, and representatives\n            of communities."}, "docdt": "2003-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
