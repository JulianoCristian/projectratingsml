PROJECT,TF028965-GEF - PDF B PROTECTED AREAS\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Protected Areas\n            Management Project (PGAP) for Morocco were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to global\n            environment outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory.  The main lesson to be\n            learned from the PGAP experience concerns the critical\n            importance of formulating early on a fully functional\n            financial system to ensure the efficient implementation of\n            all the project activities. The failure of the Autonomous\n            Administrative Unit for Forestry Products Development\n            (SEGMA) account to deliver an effective and decentralized\n            mechanism has hampered the entire PGAP operation. It may\n            have appeared on paper to be the most suitable financial\n            vehicle, but when changes occurred to the terms of its use\n            and the host ministry was reorganized (into a high\n            commission) there should have been a more concerted effort\n            on both sides of the project to seek a more suitable\n            alternative. This issue will be critical to the success of\n            any future operation - and fortunately the new protected\n            areas law should now provide the means to develop fully\n            decentralized budgeting and management functions. The second\n            important lesson learned is the necessity to formulate a\n            realistic project design, grounded in practical and\n            achievable activities with solid and measurable outputs.\n            Otherwise, there is a risk that operations will become too\n            dispersed and disconnected to achieve any lasting impact or\n            sustainability. Finally, decentralized multi-purpose\n            projects, such as the PGAP, require close, constant and\n            efficient supervision (both internal and external), so\n            adequate staffing and budgets must be allocated to achieve\n            this level of oversight and support."}, "docdt": "2008-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
