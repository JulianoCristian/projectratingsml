sustainable conservation\n            management. There are four principal project components: 1)\n            National capacity building will strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of the Ministry of Water and Forestry and other\n            main actors, in particular research and training\n            institutions, in sustainable management and conservation of\n            protected areas in Morocco. 2) The national parks component\n            will support activities to enhance natural resources through\n            ecotourism development; rehabilitate the most threatened and\n            biologically most interesting habitat and species; and\n            develop and implement rural development plans compatible\n            with conservation objectives with user communities. 3) The\n            Sites of Ecological and Biological Interest-reserves\n            component will support activities to strengthen ecosystem\n            management, ecotourism, participatory rural development, and\n            basic equipment. 4) Public awareness and education will\n            support activities to inform the Moroccan public on\n            biodiversity, sustainable development, and protection of\n            wildlife and flora."}, "docdt": "2000-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
