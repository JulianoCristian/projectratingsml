Both the World Bank and the Borrower have\n            performances rated satisfactory overall. A key lesson of\n            this project was the manner in which the World Bank and the\n            Government responded to the post-war challenges facing the\n            entire Rwandan portfolio, and this project in particular.\n            The timely restructuring of the project in 1995 and 1997,\n            together with other projects in the portfolio, and the\n            Bank's flexibility in exercising its policies, helped\n            restore project performance to satisfactory levels after two\n            years of unsatisfactory ratings. Of great importance was the\n            immediate shift in the Bank's overall assistance\n            strategy to Rwanda. A related lesson was the readiness with\n            which the new Government accepted existing national policies\n            governing projects like this one. This factor helped\n            consolidate donor confidence and support. Other lessons\n            concerned the need to improve rural access both in terms of\n            infrastructure and affordable motorized and non-motorized\n            transport in order to promote higher productivity and\n            increase incomes. Taking advantage of the very high\n            population densities in rural areas and the very high\n            occupancy of roadside land, road maintenance activities can\n            easily be integrated into agricultural activities. Future\n            projects in the sector should seek to establish partnerships\n            with village communities and draw from this favorable\n            environment for sustaining rural road maintenance."}, "docdt": "2002-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
