                         Offices (DRRMOs) vis a vis the original target of 14. The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) rolled out training sessions and is in the process of issuing sectoral guidance notes for
                         conducting the post-disaster assessments. The Ministry of Health audited 199 hospitals for their disaster vulnerability, vis a vis the original target of 100. The Department of Social
                         Welfare and Development (DSWD) conducted DRR training to over 1,000 villages, exceeding the target. The first draft of the catastrophe risk strategy has been developed and will
                         be further consulted with all relevant sectors which are part of the Technical Working Group. Overall, the progress made is satisfactory, in terms of the key outputs and outcome
                         indicators for the Government's enhanced capacity to manage the impacts of natural disasters.
