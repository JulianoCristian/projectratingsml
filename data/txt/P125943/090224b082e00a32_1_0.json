   (CAT-DDO) for the Philippines received a satisfactory\n            outcome rating with moderate risk to development outcome.\n            Both the Bank and the Borrower received satisfactory ratings\n            for their performances respectively. No major restructurings\n            took place throughout the lifespan of this project. The\n            CAT-DDO was designed to enhance the capacity of the\n            Government of the Philippines to manage the impacts of\n            natural disasters. The operation addressed three key\n            disaster risk management policy areas prioritized in the\n            2010 Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management\n            (DRRM) Act: (1) strengthen the institutional capacity for\n            disaster risk management efforts; (2) mainstream disaster\n            risk reduction into development planning; and (3) better\n            manage the Government\u2019s fiscal exposure to natural hazard\n            impacts. Several lessons were learned from this project\n            including the following: (1) for disaster risk management\n            (DRM) policy frameworks with multiple action areas across\n            different sectors, a dialogue should be initiated with\n            various line agencies during project preparation and\n            implementation, (2) development policy operations with\n            CAT-DDOs can provide an entry point for introducing broader\n            concepts for disaster risk financing and insurance, (3) the\n            \u2018soft trigger\u2019 for disbursement, which is a standard feature\n            of the CAT-DDO instrument, needs to be supported by strong\n            analytics in order to optimize the timing of drawdowns, (4)\n            Department/Ministry of Finance\u2019s role as implementing agency\n            for CAT-DDOs can provide the impetus for their deeper\n            involvement in the coordination of DRM-related policy\n            actions, (5) the implementation of a programmatic technical\n            assistance engagement to support the policy areas of the\n            CAT-DDO can facilitate substantive policy dialogue and\n            effective implementation even after full disbursement of the\n            loan, and (6) complementarity between ongoing World Bank\n            investment projects and the CAT-DDO can generate mutual\n            leverage for achieving development objectives."}, "docdt": "2015-04-19T11:18:01Z"}
