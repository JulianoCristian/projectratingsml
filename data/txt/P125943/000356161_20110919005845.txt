       The Executive Directors approved a Disaster Risk Management Development Policy
Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO) to the Republic of the
Philippines in the amount of US$500 million on the payment terms and conditions set out in the
President’s Memorandum (R2011-0196).

        Executive Directors expressed support for this innovative project, which they noted is
consistent with the priority areas identified in the CAS. They also noted that the loan would
strengthen the Government’s capacity to manage the impact of natural disasters and mobilize
resources for disaster risk management and prevention. Directors highlighted the need to
improve the public financial management system, especially internal audit, accounting,
integrated financial management, and information functions. The need to strengthen regional
and trans-boundary cooperation in disaster risk management was stressed. Directors also
encouraged the Bank to continue its cooperation in the area of disaster risk management working
together with other donors.
