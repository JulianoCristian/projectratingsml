                         The project is on track towards achieving its objectives. As the project became effective in the latter half of the reporting period, so it is too early to report progress on outcomes, but
                         the team did review progress in terms of the output indicators given in the policy matrix. The Bank has maintained an open dialog on disaster risk reduction and management issues

                         capacity building, mainstreaming disaster risk management into development planning, and disaster risk financing. The mission confirmed the program remains in place and is
                         showing a positive progression through increased integration of disaster risk reduction measures across sectors and in agencies’ development and investment programs. In addition
                         traction appears to be building in the education and agriculture sectors to increase resilience to future disasters.
