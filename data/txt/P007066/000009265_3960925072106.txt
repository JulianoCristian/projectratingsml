PROJECT COMPLETION MEMORANDUM
INECEL POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
LOAN 2045-EC
Preface
1.       This is the Project Completion Memorandum for the INECEL Power
Transmission Project, which the Bank supported with Loan 2045-EC (US$100
million). The borrower was Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrificacion
(INECEL); the guarantor was the Government.
2.       The loan agreement terminated on July 21, 1983, twenty months
after loan signing (December 4, 1981) at the requElt of the borrower and
the guarantor. The loan agreement had never become effective due to non-
compliance on the part of INECEL and the guarantor with respect to major
financial covenants.
In accordance withi the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Memorandum was read by the Opera-
tions Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED
staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
project completion memorandum to the Government and the Borrower for
comments. However, no comments were received.

INECEL POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT (2045-EC)
Prolect Completion Memorandum
Introduction
This memorandum was prepared in lieu of a project completion
report (PCR), as Loan 2045-EC (US$ 100 million) terminated on
July 21, 1983, twenty months after loan signing (December 4, 1981) sinice it
failed to become effective. The termination of the Loan Agreement took
place at the request of the borrower (Instituto Ecuatoriano de
Electrificacion - INECEL) and the guarantor (Government) due to non-
compliance on the part of INECEL and the Government with respect to major
financial covenants. No portion of the loan was ever disbursed.
Project Description
The project was part of a larger program to be executed by INECEL
to meet energy and power capacity requirements for the period 1980-1985.
The project consisted of: (i) constructing transmission lines (338 circuit
km at 230 kV and 427 circuit km at 138 kV) and substations (with about 280
MVA of transformation capacity); and (ii) engaging consultants in
connection with a training program, an institutional development program,
and various engineering services. Each transmission line and its
corresponding substation was the least-cost transmission alternative when
compared with an equivalent thermo-electric power plant. The project was
expected to cost US$144 millions with a foreign cost of US$86 millions.
The proposed loan would cover the foreign cost of the project (US$86
millions) plus interest during construction.
Loan Processing, Negotiations, and SiRning
Bank preparation and appraisal missions visited Ecuador between
October 1979 and November 1980 in connection with the above project. Bank
staff paid particular attention to the problems of loan amount, co-
financing and audit arrangments, power sector tariffs, distribution losses,
asset revaluation, control over the investment program of INECEL
subsidiaries, and retroactive financing.
In order to provide for an appropriate level of resource
generation on the part of INECEL, Bank staff agreed at the Decision Meeting
(December 1, 1980) that the Bank, inter alia, would seek revrenue covenants
specifying the following rates of return: 1981, 2%; 1982, 42, 1983, 8%; and
1984 and thereafter, 8.5?. Subsequently, it was decided that the loan
agreement should include a covenant requiring INECEL and its subsidiaries



- 2-
to increase their power tariffs by 3% per month until they had achieved the
specified rates of return.
No major problems delayed loan negotiations (June 15-19, 1981) or
Board approval (July 21, 1981). Because of post- negotiation objections on
the part of the Controlaria General to the auditing covenant of the loan
agreement, the Bank, the Government, and INECEL had to delay tigning the
loaln and guarantee agreements until December 4, 1981.
Loan Effectiveness
By the original deadline for effectiveness (March 4, 1982), INECEL
had not fulfill d a special condiiion for eifectiveness (the selection of
auditors) and was in non-compliance with res-ect to the covenant requiring
monthly tariff increases of 3%. At that time, even though the actual level
of monthly tariff increases was only 1.7%, there was substantial
political pressure to discontinue the policy of monthly tariff increases.
The Bank agreed to ercend the date of effectiveness by three months (to
June 4, 1982); anet 'ispatched a supervision mission (March 17-24,1982) to
monitor progress.
In the subsequent months, notwithstanding continuing non-
compliance with respect to the revenue covenants on the part of INECEL and
the Government, the Bank twice more agreed to change the deadline for
effectiveness: from June 4, 1982 to August 4, 1982 and t!"en to July 21,
1983. The later date was two years after loan approval. While INECEL
eventually fulfilled all of the special and general conditions for
effectiveness, it remained in non-compliance with respect to the revenue
covenants of the loan agreement.
Although there had been some small upward movement in tariffs in
1981 and early 1982, these were not sufficient to comply with the financial
covenants of the loan agreement. INECEL did attempt to raise tariffs in the
autumn of 1982 but this action was partially responsible for the dismissal
of the general manager of INECEL and the impeachment by Congress of the
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, who had authorized these
increases. As a result of inaction on tariffs, INECEL earned a negative
rate of return in 1982 and during the first half of 1983 and was unable to
cover even half of its debt service. Throughout this period, the Bank had,
of course, urged the Government to implement tariff increases in accordance
with the covenants of the loan documents.
A supervision mission (February 1983) reported that there was
substantial political resistance to further increases for power tariffs;
and recommended that the Bank cancel the loan if the GovernzLent would not
commit itself to carry out a program of tariff increases. Later (May 1983),
a Bank mission composed of higher level staff confidentially offered the
Government a compromise plan for tariff increases which would permit INECEL
to earn a rate of return of 2% in 1984 and 8.5% in 1986. Under the
financial covenants of the loan agreement, INECEL was obligated to earn a
return of 8.5% in 1984 and each year thereafter. Under the compromise



- 3 -
plan, the Bank offered the Government and INECEL a three-year period in
which to raise tariffs sufficiently to comply with the original targets of
the revenue covenants.
Because of political considerations, the Government declined to
accept this program. Preceding the dispatch of the mission, Bank staff had
examined a Government offer to increase tariffs (an increase of 101
followed by monthly increases of 2X) and concluded that the Government
offer would not have provided INECEL with a positive rate of return before
1986. Given that the financial rehabilitation of INECEL was a major Bank
objective, this offer, in the opinion of the Bank, fell too far short of
what was needed to be acceptable. In contrast, the Government believed
th.t political resistance to the tariff Increases proposed by the Bank
would be so strong that the political stability of the country would be at
stake.
In these circumstances, compromise was not possible. The Bank
felt it could not accept the Government's offer which would not have
provided INECEL with a positive rate of return until 1986 and the
Governwbnt felt it could not aecept the Sank proposal which would have
provide    ECEL with rates of return rising from 21 to 8.52 in two years
(betweer. ..84 and 1986). Because of these radically different views on
tariff increases, the Government requested that the Bank terminate the Loan
Agreement as of July 21, 1983; and the Bank agreed to this request.
As a postscript, it should be noted that in May 1985 the
Government introduced monthly tariff increases of 3%; and that these
increases have not compromised the political stability of the country.
