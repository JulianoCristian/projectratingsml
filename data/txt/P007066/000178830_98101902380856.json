"The proposed project would consist of:\n            (a) the construction of approximately 338 circuit km of 230\n            kV and approximately 427 circuit km of 138 kV transmission\n            lines; (b) the construction of terminal substations,\n            installation of corresponding step-down transformers, and\n            expansion of the existing substation at Ibara; (c) training\n            and institutional development programs for INECEL; (d)\n            engineering services for the design and supervision of\n            installation of a National Load Dispatch Center; and (e)\n            consultant services for supervision of the civil works. The\n            project faces no special technical risks. It is, however,\n            part of an ambitious power sector program which requires a\n            major funding effort. To minimize the risk of program delays\n            because of funding shortfalls, the Government has agreed\n            under the proposed project to provide sufficient financing\n            for the overall program."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
