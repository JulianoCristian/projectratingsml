PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

FINANCIERA DE PREINVERSION (FINAPRI)
PREINVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
(CREDIT 1081-NI)
PREFACE
1.       This is the Project Completion  Report (PCR) for the Preinvestment
Fund Project, which the International Development Association (IDA) sup-
ported with Credit 1081-NI (SDR 3.9 million equivalent to US$5.0 million).
As the borrower, the Government reloaned the proceeds of the credit under a
SubsidiaL( Loan Agreement  to  the  beneficiary, Finw'ciera de Preinversion
(FINAPRI), a semi-autonomous Government agency link 1 to the Ministry of
Planning and skilled in the contracting, selection and supervision of con-
sultants. With the proceeds of the IDA credit and with additional equity
contributions furnished by the Government, FINAPRI made sub-loans to sub-
borrowers (public sector entities) to finance preinvestment studies on
projects which were suitable for the reshaping of the economy as determined
by the Ministry of Planning.
2.       The Association approved  the  credit  on  December  16, 1980; and
signing of the Credit and Project Agreements occurred two days later. The
Credit Agreement became effective on March 18, 1981. The last disbursement
was on November 29, 1984; and the closing date was June 30, 1985.
3.       The Latin America and Caribbean  Region prepared this report based
on the contents of IDA files and information supplied by FINAPRI.
4.       This PCR was read  by  the  Operations Evaluation Department.  The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments, and they are attached to
the Report (Annex 4.1).

PREINVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
(CREDIT 1081-NI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.       In post-revolutionary Nicaragua civil strife had resulted not only
in destruction of urban infrastructure and productive facilities, but in a
massive flight of capital  ard  trained  personnel.   The parastatal sector
found itself in the greatest difficulties, since many of the enterprises
which it had taken over had ceased to function, or if functioning, were
financially insolvent. The Preinvestment Fund Project (Credit 1081-NI) was
conceived as a means of assisting the revolutionary Government of Nicaragua
to establish a sound basis for new project identification and preparation.
2.       FINAPRI, the executing agency for  the project, utilized IDA fi.ads
to finance 23 consultants pre-feasibility and feasibility studies covering
a broad spectrum of potential investment activity in energy, transport,
agriculture, forestry, mining, commerce, industry and tourism. The project
was L :cessfully completed within  the  time  frame envisaged at appraisal,
and the Government met all of its obligations under the project, except for
a financial covenant requiring payment of  a  0.75Z service fee on the dis-
bursed balance of the credit.  In March, 1984 the Government suspended
all debt service payments on outstanding Bank and IDA debt.
3.       This project was successful in providing the Nicaraguan Government
with sound professional advice in producing studies which were expected to
identify important investments for the restructuring of the economy.
FINAPRI (and later Fondo Nicaraguense de Inversiones (FNI)) implemented and
administered the project efficiently. Unfortunately, because of the deter-
iorating economic and political situation in the country, the pre-invest-
ment studies carried out with positive results under the project did not in
all cases materialize as new investments.   Of the thirteen projects recom-
mended for implementation, seven were undertaken, but two of these are in
abeyance because of financial  constraints.    The  other six have been de-
ferred due to the extremely difficult investment climate.
4.       Because renewed civil  strife  and  deteriorating economic perfor-
mance during the later phase of project implementation severely limited the
capacity of the Government to undertake new investments, no clear lessons
can be derived from IDA's experience.

PREINVESTMENT FUND P'tOJECT
(CREDIT 1081-NI)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1 Bank and IDA Operations in Nicaragua
1.1.1    Prior to the civil war  (1978-1979) which ended the Somoza regime,
the Bank and IDA made 25 loans and one credit to Nicaragua for a total of
US$185 million. These loans and credits supported: (a) export diversifi-
cation projects; (b) infrastructure projects in key sectors (such as water
supply and electric power); (c) projects with major social objectives (such
as education, rural sanitation, etc.); and (d) an earthquake reconstruction
project.
1.1.2    At the end of the civil war (July 19, 1979), the Bank and IDA took
in understanding attitude toward the  financial problems of Nicaraguan bor-
jers, which, for reasons beyond their control, were unable to comply with
-he financial covenants of their  respective loan agreements.  After agree-
ing to restructure many projects and after agreeing to waive or to modify
the financial covenants of existing agreements, the Bank and IDA resumed
disbursements (October 1979) and began to process new applications for
loans and credits.   In  January  1980,  the  Bank  and IDA signed Loan and
Credit Agreements amounting to US$52.0 million to support projects for
industrial  and  agriculturai   rehabilitation  and  urban  reconstruction.
Beginning in March 1960, IDA staff began processing a credit in support of
a preinvestment project, which is the subject of this report.
1.2 Economic Context
1.2.1    The civil war was costly in  terms of loss of life (about 30,000),
physical damage (about US$435 million),1 and capital flight (about US$500
million). The revolutionary Government inherited an economy which was
financially insolvent and burdened with a damaged productive apparatus.
After taking power, the revolutionary Government (a Junta of National Re-
construction backed by the Sandinista Front), confiscated the properties of
the Somoza family and many of its supporters, and nationalized major sec-
tors of the economy (finance, foreign trade, mining, and communications),
thereby making the Government the dominant economic decision maker. The
Government also reorganized public companies; encouraged a restoration of
agricultural and industrial production in both the public and private sec-
tors; and established an austerity program based on a reasonably balanced
budget, wage and price controls, and a minimal degree of foreign borrowing.
1/ FNI data reflect loss of life of 49,000 and physical damage of US$2.5
billion, which may reflect a different time period than that referred
to in para. 1.2.1.



-2-
1.2.2    In recognition of the fact  that  the economy was still largely in
private hands, the Government announced an economic recovery program based
on the concept of a mixed economy, which envisaged the full participation
of both public and private sectors.   The Government's main objectives weze              r
to restore production (particularly basic foods) to pre-revolutionary
levels, generate erployment and promote exports. First priority was given
to reviving the agricultural sector in * ime for the Spring 1930 planting
season. A second priority was to recover lost industrial output.
1.2.3    During its first year,  the Govetnment experienced economic diffi-
culties, but these difficulties were less severe than initially expected.
With commitments for loans and  credits  amounting to about US$750 million,
the Government made progress towards restocking inventories, relieving
unemployment, and restoring real levels of cons%.aption.  While these devel-
opments partly helped to restore capacity and to renew physical plant, they
did not resolve fundamental structural problems which severely constrained
further efforts to regain lost production capacity and to improve effi-
ciency.
1.2.4    The Government had become  owner  and  operator of firms which, in
many cases, had ceased to function, were financially insolvent and had lost
most of their key personnel. T'here was a need to set policy objectives and
priorities, develop viable investment targets, create coordination mech-
anisms at the ministerial level, as well as to establish proper financial
management, accounting and budgeting procedures, and staff training at the
enterprise level.  However, parastatal enterprises tended to focus on imme-
diate production goals and on maintaining unskilled work force levels
regardless of output considerations.   Many  private sector firms tended to
be constrained about taking decisions for the future due to uncertainty as
to the Government's political and economic direction, and tried to maintain
viability by cutting costs while maintaining current output levels. In
addition, both sectors not only lacked the financing to undertake new in-
vestments, but the expertise to prepare new projects as well.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 Project Origin
2.1.1    In March 1980, the  Government  requested IDA to provide financing
for a preinvestment project.   The  borrower would be the Government, which
would relend the proceeds of the proposed credit to the executing agency.
The executing agency would be FINAPRI, a semi-autonomous agency linked to
the Ministry of Planning and skilled in the contracting, selection, and
supervision of consultants. FINAPRI would maintain its records and conduct
its operations as if it were  a  revenue-earning  entity, not as if it Tcre
another department of the Government.
2.1.2    FINAPRI would use the proceeds of the proposed credit to make sub-
loans to sub-borrowers to finance sub-projects (studies). In recognition
of the needs of FINAPRI for  speed  and flexibility, IDA agreed to simplify
its approval procedures for the smaller studies which would be financed by



so-called Oiree-limit' sub)-loans.   Each 'free-limit" sub-loar. would amount
to no more than US$150,000 equivalentg and as a group, they would amount to
no more than US$2.0  million  equivalent.   Annex 1.1 sets forth add'"ional
details on the 3rganization and operations of FINAPRI as ex. .ted at
appraisal.
2.1.3    The project would consist  of  the  preparation of feasibility and
other studies by consultants.  7hese  studies would enable a planning body,
the Investment Committee (also linked to the Ministry of Planning), to
decide whether a project proposed by a public or private entity (and re-
quir!g foreign exchange) should be carried  out.  It was expected that all
approved projects would ctunform to the political, economic, and social
object ves of the Government (paras. 1.2.1 and 1.2.2).
2.2 Project Preparatiot and Appraisal
2.2.1    Project preparation and appraisal  moved  very  quickly.  In March
1980, an identification mission established informal requirenzu's for pro-
cessing a request for IDA fiisncing.    In June 1980, a preparatict, mission
was upgraded to an appraisal mission as all documentation was prepared and
outstanding issues were  settled.    In  addition  to the dtsft operational
manual of FINAPRI, the mission concentrated on the definition and cost of
the project, and a list of tentative studies (sub-projects).
2.2.2    The Government and  IDA  agreed  that  the  credit would amount to
SDR 3.9 million (equivalent to US$5.0 at appraisal) to support a project
consisting of:
Part (A) a three-year program of assistance to finance (through sub-
loans) the cost of hiring consultants to prepare and review
preinvestment studies (sub-projects) in such sectors as trans-
port,   agriculture,   energy,   education,   mining,   public
utilities, etc.
Part (B)  technical assistance for FINAPRI in the form of hiring consul-
tants  with  expertise  in   the  mechanism  of  preinvestment
(preparation of terms of reference, consultant selection pro-
cedures, etc.).
The Credit Agreement specified that the credit would be allocated as fol-
lows: SDR 3.8 million would cover 80Z of the cost of Part A and SDR 0.1
million would cover 100Z of the cost of Part B.
2.2.3    The Government aud  IDA  also  agreed  on  the  following cost and
financing plan for the project:

(equivalent to US$5.0 million) made at the then prevailing IDA terms, i.e.,
there was only a charge for administrative costs of three-fourths of one
percent (3/4 of 1Z) p.a., the term of the credit was 50 years, including 10
years of grace, and repayments would commence on February 1, 1991 ane end
on August 1, 2031.
2.4 Major Covenants of the Credit and Project Agreements
2.4.1    The Credit Agreement defined the project, obligated the Government
to carry out the project, and set forth the terms and conditions of the
credit (para. 2.3.1). The Project Agreement established the obligation of
FINAPRI to seek prior IDA approval for all sub-loans. defined the terms of
the sub-loans, and set forth various procedures for contracting con-
sultants.
2.4.2    Annex 1.2 sets forth  major  covenants  of  the credit and project
agreements. The Government and FINAPRI complied with these covenants,
except for the covenant requiring the Government to pay administrative
costs equivalent to three-quarters of one percent (3/4 of 17' of the dis-
bursed balance of the Credit.   In March 1984, the Government indicated its
inability to cover debt-service payments  on  all loans and credits owed to
the Bank and IDA (para. 3.7.1).
III.  PROJECT EXECUTION
3.1 Actual and Forecast Data on Project Execution
3.1.1    Annex 2.1 provides a brief description of the studies approved for
financing  by  IDA  and   the   implementation  of  their  recommendations.
Annex 3.2 sets forth the actual cost and disbursement of the credit (stated



5 -
in SDRs) on a study-by-study basis. Annexes 3.3 and 3.4 compare actual and
forecast data on, respectively, allocation of the credit and timing of
disbursements. The paragraphs below discuss the information set forth in
these annexes.
3.2 Project Cost and Timing
3.2.1    The original  project  cost  of  US$6.2  million (para. 2.2.3) was
equivalent to SDR 4.8 million.   This  is  very  close to the final project
cost. The cost data in Annex 2.2 must be treated with some caution, how-
ever, because of the ride difference between the official and market rates
of exchange for the cordoba.
3.2.2    FINAPRI carried out the project  between Harch 18, 1981, (the date
of effectiveness) and November 29, 1984, (the date of last disbursement).
Two studies were completed in 1985  using  local funds.   At appraisal, the
expected completion date  was  December  1984.   The deteriorating interna-
tional credit situation of ilicaragua (para. 3.7.1) did not interfere with
completion of the project.
3.3 Proiect Results
3.3.1    IDA  approved  financing  for   twenty-five  studies  proposed  by
FINAPRI, and disbursements were made for twenty-three studies. All sub-
borrowers were state agencies (Annex 2.1).
3.3.2    Annex 2.1 sets forth details on the studies, which were designated
A-1 to A-S (sub-projects requiring detailed IDA approval procedures), B-1
to B-17 (sub-projects requiring less detailed IDA approval procedures), and
C-1 to C-3 (technical assistance benefiting FINAPRI). IDA never disbursed
for B-9 (Annex 2.2).
3.3.3    The sectoral distribution of the studies was diversified, covering
(in order of cost) energy, transportation, agriculture and forestry, mining
and natural  resources,  marketing,  tourism  and  industry.    Nine of the
studies consisted of technical assistance or preparation of terms of refer-
ence and were successfully  concluded.    Of the remainder, one recommended
that a proposed castor oil production project not be undertaken. Five
resulted in implementation of projects ir grain storage, tourism and wood
products. Two other studies (in rice seed production and coconut re-
planting) have led to some investment, limited by financial constraints.
Similarly, six projects (covered by eight studies) are in abeyance due to
financial and security problems, including the Hojolka hydroelectric plant
which was the largest sub-project under the IDA credit.
3.4 Allocation of the Credit and Timing of Disbursements
3.4.1    The allocation of  the  credit  betveen sub-projects and technical
assistance vas just about as expected (Annex 2.3). Disbursement timing vas
initially siower than expected but was completed within the originally
anticipated period (Annex 2.4).



-6-
3.5 IDA-FINAPRI Relations
3.5.1    In the course of complying with  Sections  2.05a and 2.05b of the
Pro,ect Agreement (which required IDA approval for all non-free-limit sub-
projects), FINAPRI engaged IDA in a continuing dialogue which was profes-
sional and cordial. FINAPRI took serious note of IDA commentary on pro-
posed terms of reference, consultant selection procedures, and draft con-
tracts. FINAPRI also sought IDA comments on some free-limit sub-projects.
3.6 Evolution of FINAPRI
3.6.1    In December 1983, the Government merged FINAPRI and FED2 to estab-
lish FNI. IDA did not object to this change, on the understanding that it
would continue to receive separate accounting statements for the preinvest-
ment operations of FNI.   The  merger  did not affect the implementation of
the project.
3.7  International Credit Situation of Nicaragua
3.7.1    In early  1984,  the  Government,  being  about  US$10  million in
arrears, was on the verge of defaulting  on its obligations to the Bank and
IDA.  To provide the Government  with additional time for mobilizing finan-
cial resources, IDA developed a strategy involving the application of the
undisbursed resources of existing loans and credits to cover debt-service
arrearage. In accordance with this strategy, the Bank and IDA first iden-
tified those loan and credits which permitted disbursements for local cur-
rency expenditures. Credit 1081-NI qualified in this respect, and the Bank
and IDA transferred the undisbursed balances into a special account, from
which disbursements were made to IDA as disbursement applications for
eligible local-currency costs were received. The Central Bank of Nicaragua
made payments to consultants and suppliers in cordobas. Although this
arrangement provided some more time, the Government was unable to mobilize
the necessary financial resources to meet debt service obligations to the
Bank and IDA and formal disbursements were suspended in September 1984.
Disbursements under the special arrangement for Credit 1081-NI continued
through November 1984, when the credit was fully disbursed.
IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.1 Actual and Forecast Data on Financial Performance
4.1.1    Annex 3.1 compares actual and  forecast data on the financial per-
formance of FINAPRI between 1981 and 1984, the period of project execution.
Actual data is based on audited financial statements expressed in cordobas
translated into US dollars at the average rate for the year. Substantial
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the US dollar and the cordoba
2/  Fondo Especial de Desarrollo.    Th:^s  entity was created following the
earthquake  (December  1972)  which  devastated  Managua.    The merger
combined the human and financial resources of the two institutions.



-7-
and the wide margin between the official and market rates of exchange limit
the  comparability  of  actual  and  forecast  data.    The  information in
Annex 3.1 is discussed below.
4.1.2    FINAPRI's net disbursements for preinvestment loans were 23Z above
the appraisal forecast in 1981-83, but fell below it in 1984 (-23Z),
reflecting the broader problems of the Nicaraguan economy. This higher
level of activity was funded in the earlier years by budgetary funds, as
drawdown of external grant and loan funds fell below expectations. In 1984
there was a sharp contraction in budgetary support and grants (64Z below
the forecast) and FINAPRI's largest sources of fzmds were special Govern-
ment lines of credit for state enterprises, small enterprises and rehabili-
tation of coffee plantations.
4.1.3    Revenues were substantially above  appraisal forecasts as a result
of the quicker rate of disbursement and the introduction of cost recovery
for technical assistance, which was decided after the IDA credit was
approved. Although FINAPRI's cash requirements for administration were
also higher than anticipated, the cumulative deficit in 1981-84 was
slightly below the appraisal forecast.
V. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER, FINAPRI AND IDA
5.1 The Borrower
5.1.1    The performance of the  Government  was satisfactory in connection
with implementation of this project, except with respect to the observance
of the financial covenant requiring payment of the service fee (3/4 of 1Z)
on the disbursed balance of the credit.
5.2 FINAPRI
5.2.1.   The performance  of  FINAPRI  was  satisfactory  (paras. 3.4.1 and
3.5.2) IDA staff were favorably impressed with the skill and efficiency
of the beneficiary. There was concern that turnover of middle management
staff might affect  project  implementation.    FINAPRI propcsed a training
program for its staff to address this problem. To} management continuity
was maintained throughout the gestation and implementation of the project;
this undoubtedly contributed to smooth project execution. The merger of
FINAPRI and FED was wise, since the two institutions were involved with
similar problems at different stages of the project cycle and there was a
possibility of achieving economies by sharing staff and facilities.
5.3 IDA
5.3.1    IDA designed a  credit  arrangement  which provided flexibility to
FINAPRI. As with other preinvestment fund projects, a multisectoral effort
was involved in the review  of  subprojects.   This meant that occasionally
specialists were not available to ensure prompt response to FINAPRI com-
munications.



VI. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
6.1 Proiect Results
6.1.1    The project benefits are clear in the area of technical assistance
and preparation of terms of reference (nine of the twenty-five studies
approved). Of the other sixteen studies, seven are known to have resulted
in implementation. The economic and political problems and civil strife
that have been confronting Nicaragua since IDA credit approval explain much
about the lack of results in terms of investment.
6.2 Lessons
6.2.1    Because renewed civil  strife  and  deteriorating sconomic perfor-
mance during the later phase of project implementation severely limited the
capacity of the Government to undertake new investments, no clear lesuons
can be derived from the studies financed; howerer, the project was success-
ful in demonstrating the need  for  such  studies in the process of project
identification, and strengthening FINAPRI as an institution.

FINANCIERA DE PREINVERSION (FINAPRI)
PREINVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
(CREDIT 1081-NI)
FINAPRI Organization and Operations
Introduction
1.       Set forth below is  the  appraisal description of the organization
and operations of FINAPRI (Report No. P-2916-NI, December 1, 1980). At
appraisal (June 1980), FINAPRI was not a veteran organization but a working
group linked to the  Ministry  of  Planning.    It had modest experience in
preinvestment work, a proposed organizational chart (Attachment 1), and a
draft operations manual.
Origin
2.       Law 322, dated February 28,  1980,  established FINAPRI as a semi-
autonomous body linked to the Ministry of Planning. Its major function
would be carrying out preinvestment work--that is, supplying loan financing
and technical help to borrowers who needed to undertake preinvestment
studies. It was expected that the work of FINAPRI would help to create an
inventory of projects suitable to advance the objectives of the Government.
Board of Directors
3.       As described in the  President's  Report, the Financial Cabinet of
the Government would act as the Board of Directors of FINAPRI; would select
the Executive Director; and would exercise general supervisory functions,
including supervision of financial operations, budget and borrowing agree-
ments. It would consist of one member ot the Junta (para 1.2.1), the pres-
idents of the Corporacion Financiera and the Central Bank, the Minister of
Finance, the Minister of Planning, and the head of the Fondo Internacional
para la Reconstruccion  de  Nicaragua  (FIR).    FIR  was  charged with the
responsibility for promoting,  negotiating,  and organizing external finan-
cial assistance for reconstruction projects.
Relations with Other Government Bodies
4.       FINAPRI would carry out  its  duties  in connection with decisions
taken by the Investment Committee (IC), a Government entity which was
headed by the Ministry of Planning and which included representatives of
FIR, FINAPRI, and the  Ministry  of  Finance.   For investment projects re-
quiring foreign currency financing, the relevant public sector agency or
private sector enterprise would subm.it proposals for approval by the IC.



- 10 -                  ANNEX 1.1
Page 2 of 2
If the IC judged that preinvestment studies were necessary before it could
act on a proposal, FINAPRI would undertake to finance and to supervise the
generation of such studies. Upon completion of the study, and if the IC
were to approve the proposei project, FIR would assume the responsibility
for marshalling external financing.                                                        L
FINAPRI Operations
5.       The appraisal mission found  satisfactory the procedures described
in the draft operating manual, including procedures for lending and pro-
curement. With capital supplied by the Government, including the reloaned
proceeds of the IDA credit, FINAPRI would lend (sub-loans) to public and
private entities to finance feasibility and such other studies (sub-proj-
ects) as were required for an investment decision. FINAPRI would charge
its customers 8? p.a. with terms extending up to 10 years. Private cus-
tomers would pay an additional 0.5Z commitment fee and had to post
collateral.
6.       When necessary, FINAPRI would assist in project identification and
preparation of project briefs for submission to the IC. Once the IC had
given its approval for a study, the borrower would proceed to the drafting
ef detailed terms of reference, a preliminary budget, prequalification,
selection and contracting of consultants.   FINAPRI would provide technical
assistance and supervision in all stages. FINAPRI would maintain its books
as if it were a revenue-earning entity. It was expected that FINAPRI would
not require budgetary support from the Government for its operations once
its portfolio of sub-loans had been built up.

Execution of the Project
A. Sub-proJects Financed by Large Sub-loans
A.1      Ocotal-Jalapa-Teotecacinte  Highway  Improvements:    Final design
study to upgrade 85 km of highways. Local consultants (CISCONCO) completed
the final design in January 1982. with a delay of 5 months and a cost over-
run of 7?.   The  Government  accepted  the  estimated construction cost of
US$23 million. Construction was postponed due to lack of funds.
A.2      La Gateada - Nueva Guinea  Road  Improvements:  Final design of 63
km highway in Zelaya  department.    Local consultants (ESPRINSA) completed
the work in January 1982, with a delay of 6 months and a cost underrun of
201. The Government accepted the consultant's work and authorized imple-
mentation, with an estimatea cost of US$7 million. Construction was post-
poned due to lack of funds.
A.3      Hololka Energy Study:  Feasibility study of a 180 MW hydroelectric
project, coWpleted in 1984. The study was carried out by Canadian consul-
tants (MONENCO) with a time saving of 7 months and a cost overrun of 1OZ.
The Mojolka project is in abeyance in view of the economic problems of the
country.
A.4      Topacio 4inera:   Pre-feasibility  and  feasibility  study of gold
mining area. The consultants (CPRM of Brazil) rediscovered two gold mines
with an estimated yield of 0.8 to 1.2 ounce troy per metric ton for the
main mine.  The project was designed in phades of 6,000 tons per year up to
18,000 to 20,000 tons when  fully  developed.   Study completed in November
1983, with a delay of five months and a cost overrun of 19X. The Govern-
ment authorized implementation and is applying to CABEI for financing.
A.5      Petroleum  Study:    This   was  an  oil-reserve  inventory  study
involving reinterpretations of geophysical data and seismic data. The work
stopped at one point for lack of financing, but was completed satisfac-
torily in 1985 by the French  firm  BEICIP.   There was a 31X cost overrun.
Because of foreign exchange constraints, detailed follow-up work is
delayed.

B. Sub-projects Financed by "Free Limit" Sub-loans
B.1      Gold Mine Rehabilitation:    This  contract  with an individual US
consultant was to prepare terms of reference for A.4 above. The Government
was satisfied with this study which was completed in 1982.
B.2      Rehabilitation of the Atlantic Coconut  Plantationst The study by
a local consultant was concluded satisfactorily in 1983. Two areas suit-
able for a US$8 million investment were identified and 282 hectares were
replanted. Work had to be suspended, however, because of the war.
B.3      Castor Oil Production:   Feasibility  study  carried out by French
consultants. Completion of the study was delayed until 1985 due to changes
in the terms of reference and disogreement between FNI and the consultants
on methodology. The consultants recommended that the project not be imple-
mented and this recommendation was accepted.
B.4      MASA:  This was  a  technical  and  feasibility study for the con-
struction of grain silos.    The  Government was satisfied with this study
which was completed in 1980 by Honduran consultants (CINSA). The grain
silos were built near Masaya at a cost of US$20 million of which CABEI
provided US$13 million in finance.
3.5      Forest Inventory:   First  phase  of  a  study that developed more
specific proposals (B.10). The work was carried out by Chilean consultants
and completed in 1983. A change of the location of the project was recom-
mended and accepted.
B.6      Pochomil Tourism  Infrastructure:    The  Government was satisfied
with  this  study which was   completed  in  1982  by  local  consultants
(CISCONCO). The completed project which provided basic infrastructure for
small hotels and recreation houses along 4 RH of beach along the Pacific
Coast was implemented by INTIRISMO--the national tourism organization.
B.7      Ha22ings  This study consisted  oi  creation of a quantitative and
qualitative  database  based  on   satellite   imagery  for  the  Instituto
Nicaraguense Territorial. The mapping was completed satisfactorily in 1983
by Italian consultants (GEOMAP).
B.8      MASA II  Grain  Storage:    This  study  of  the rehabilitation of
existing silos was completed in 1982 by the Interamerican Institute of
Agricultural Cooperation  (IICA).    The  recommendations  have been imple-
mented.
B.9      Commodity Analysis:  The same  consultants for MASA II completed a
useftil study of 32 basic commodities by regional analysis. No investment
was proposed.
3.10     Forest Product Feasibility:  This successful study of wood extrac-
tion for laminates and chip board was completed at the end of 1984 by the
same consultants as B.5.    The  study  recommended  setting up an  Empresa
Mixtaw of Hexican and Nicaraguan capital. Implementation is underway.

B.11     National Airlines:   Canadian  consultants  (DELCANDA) completed a
comprehensive diagnosis of operations of the national airline in 1984 and
the recommendations for administrative restructuring were adopted.
B.12     Highway Rehabilitationt  Under this contract a consortium of local
consultants was engaged to prepare engineering designs for the rehabilita-
tion of 265 km of roads.   The  work was completed In 1982 within the terms
of reference. The intention was to obtain financing from CABEI, but this
did not materialize and the project has not been implemented.
B.13     Food Production:   Feasibility  study  of  food  production in the
Jalapa Valley by  local  consultants.    The  study  was completed in 1984,
covering production of basic grains and potatoes on 3,250 hectares. Imple-
mentation was completed in 1986.
r
B.14-17 Rice Studiest Feasibility studies of an irrigated rice project
(2,500 hectares) and of production of certified rice seeds by local consul-
tants. The 2,500 hectare project was presented to Mexican investors who
decided to proceed with an alternative investment. The seed improvement
study was carried out for the rice production parastatal, Enarroz. Invest-
ments recommended under the study are being carried out gradually by
Enarroz.
C. Technical Assistance to FINAPRI
C.1      Livestock Production:  This was  a  study of cattle production and
utilized an approach capable of wider application. Some of the recommen-
dations were implemented with IDB financing including training of local
technicians in beef production.
C.2      Industry:  Completed  in  December  1983,  this study analyzed the
industrial sector of Nicaragua and covered three fields: general super-
vision of the economic content cf terms of reference; generation and organ-
ization of statistical information; and the use of input/output analysis to
establish the financial implications of investment opportunities.
..3      Agriculture:  This study,  completed in December 1983, recommended
a US$60 million credit for cooperative and small-scale farmers and develop-
ment of the poultry and egg production for the country.

made to consultants in cordobas was in some cases lower than the
amounts disbursed by IDA.

FONDO NICARAGUENSE DE INVERSIONES
ANNEX
RE: Comments on draft Project Completion Report (Credit 1081-NI)
1.        Para. 1.2.1
49,000 human lives have been lost, and the cost of damAge directly
resulting from the war exceeds US$2.5 billion.
2.        Component C of the Credit consisted of technical assistance for
FINAPRI.  This was fundamental in strengthening the staff's professional
expertise and substantially reducing turnover.  Some of the effects of this
strengthening are still being felt, because we now have qualified and
motivated personnel with experience in the effective management of
preinvestment.
3.        Para. 6.2.1
We believe that the following lessons can be learned from this
project:
(a) The strengthening of preinvestment is an effective process, and
provides lasting capability.
(b) Even in these difficult economic and political circumstances, the
process of preinvestment project identification is very important
for stabilization and recovery, since this phase will require
intensive preinvestment.
(c)  The approval procedures for FINAPRI subloans provide for flexibility
and the necessary degree of operational control.
