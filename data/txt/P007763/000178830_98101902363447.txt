PREINVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                    Republic of Nicaragua
-Beneficiary:                 Financiera de Preinversion (FINAPRI)
Amount:                      3.9 million SDRs (equivalent to US$5.0 million).
Terms:                       Standard
Relending Terms:             The proceeds of the credit would be channeled
through the Ministry of Finance to FINAPRI on
standard IDA terms. FINAPRI would relend the
funds at 8% per annum for terms of up to 10 years
including 1 to 2 years of grace. The proceeds
from the spread between these terms would be
retained by FINAPRI to build up its capital.
Project Description:         The project's main objective is to assist the
newly established Government institution, FINAPRI,
to help generate both public and private sector
investment projects. It provides for the funding
of (a) consultant's services to prepare high
priority investment projects in key productive and
social sectors; and (b) technical assistance to
FINAPRI and its borrowers. The project does not
involve any special risk other than the risks of
possible delays in implementation which may arise
due to FINAPRI's lack of experience.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA FOR A PREINVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
1.       I1 submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Nicaragua for 3.9 million SDRs,equiva-
lent to US$5.0 million,on standard IDA terms to help finance a proposed pre-
investment fund project. The credit will be channeled through the Ministry
of Finance to the Financiera de Preinversion (FINAPRI). FINAPRI, a newly
established public agency responsible for assisting the public and private
sectors in identifying and carrying out preinvestment work, would receive
the funds on standard IDA terms from the Government. It would onlend the
funds on terms up to ten years, including one to two years of grace, at
an interest rate of 8 percent. The spread between the IDA terms and the
on-lending terms would be retained by FINAPRI to build up its capital. About
US$100,000 of the credit has been earmarked to finance technical assistance
to FINAPRI and its sub-borrowers.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last Bank economic report, "Memorandum on Recent Economic Develop-
ments and Prospects of Nicaragua" (2061-NI), was circulated to the Board on
June 30, 1978. Two emergency loans and credits presented to the Board in
December 1979, contained the analysis of a mission which visited Nicaragua
in September 1979 to review the emergency conditions the post-revolutionary
Government faced. This section of the President's Report reflects informa-
tion obtained during a brief visit by the country economist in July 1980.
An economic mission is presently in Nicaragua and its report will be distributed
to the Board in the first half of 1981.
3.        Nicaragua is a country rich in land resources.  Agriculture repre-
sents about one-quarter of GDP, employs nearly half of the labor force and
generates about 70 percent of commodity export earnings. The country is
divided into three distinct agricultural areas. The Pacific Zone, where about
60 percent of the nation's 2.6 million people live, is characterized by two
types of farming - a great number of small farms grow basic grains with
conventional technology, while a few large plantations use modern technology
and specialize in cotton and sugarcane; the mountainous Central District is
devoted primarily to the production of coffee and livestock; and the extensive
underpopulated Atlantic Plain holds a largely unutilized potential for addi-
tional agricultural production, including forestry, tree crops and livestock.
4.        Nicaragua is a relatively small economy, very open to the outside
world. It has had a record of high economic growth (nearly 6 percent per
year in the last three decades) and very low rates of inflation prior to 1972.
Population has been increasing at an annual rate of over 3%. Income growth
has basically been the result of the expansion and the adoption of modern
methods of production for commodity exports, primarily coffee, cotton, beef,
sugar, and shrimp. Industry has been growing in importance; prior to the
revolutionary war this sector represented about 28 percent of GDP. Exports
of manufactured goods, mainly to the Central American Common Market, were
close to 30 percent of total exports.



2-
5         This substantial longa-term growth was not accompanied by parallel
social developmient.  The limited availability of key public services, such
as educationi ar,d health9 reflected, in part, budgetary stringency dictated by
insuff icient rev:e,ndu-
6.        T).e armed struggli that preceded the establishment of the Government
of National Reconstruction in July 1.979, was extremely costly for Nicaragua.
More than 30,00CO people lost their lives, and many more fled the country.
While many ba-E ret-Irned, so me very capable and skilled people have remained
abroad.  In addition, the revolutionary war seriously damaged the nation's
industrial urod'luctiv  capac:ity and had disastrous effects on the financial
system.  It is estimated that the direct damage to physical structures, equip-
ment and in-.7entormes was approximately US$250 million.  The flight of capital
prior to and dtring the conflict exceeded half a billion dollars, and many
banks and industrial and commercial enterprises became insolvent.
7.        A very difficult recovery period has ensued.  The new Government
embarked rièulca:musly on the tasks; oil economic recovery and social transfor-
mation.  An atmosphere of law and order and fiscal probity has been achieved
amidst profound social and economic changes and sweeping institutional reforms.
The reorganized Government bureaucracy, although largely inexperienced, is
committed to improving the living conditions of the population and to increas-
ing production.  The new regime has indicated that it will maintain a mixed
economy, in which the public sector will be directly involved in the regulation
of the economic process, and will exert a sizeable degree of control over the
allocation- of investment   In addition to confiscating the Somoza family's
land holdings and industria:L and comimercial enterprises, the Government has
nationalized the banking system, the insurance companies, foreign trade, the
mining sector and much of the mass communication system.  The public sector's
participation in agricultural production is about 20 percent, in manufacturing
25 percent, and in the service sectors more than 50 percent. The total share
of the publi.c sector in the country's GDP has risen from 15 to 40 percent.
8.        The machinery of Government has been extensively reorganized:  a num-
ber of new ministries have been created, new institutions have been developed;
and practically all Government and autonomous public agencies have undergone
reorganization. In particu:Lar, the financial system has been totally restruc-
tured and ministries have been established to handle the nationalized sectors
of agriculture, irndustry and trade.  The Government is now headed by a
five member Junta of National Reconstruction that is backed by the Directorate
of the Sandinista Front of National Liberation.  There is also a Council of
State, where business and professional groups have some representation.
Efforts have-been mlade to strengthen the planning process, and the planning
council has beeni raised to the ministerial level. An emergency program was
adopted as soon as the war ended; a formal program of economic reactivation
was drafted for 1980, and the degree of target achievement during the first
half was recently evaluated; an economic plan for the year 1981 is currently
being drafted.
The Nicarag a  Economy During the First Year of the New Regime
9.        Tne revolutionary struggle which culminated in the toppling of the
Somoza regime left: Nicaragua financially insolvent and with a highly damaged
productive apparatus. Manufacturing production declined by nearly one-third



- 3 -
in 1979 as a result of the destruction of factories and inventories and the
loss of managerial personnel; during the first half of the year, private
investment shrank to a minimum, and construction nearly stopped. Agricultural
production was seriously affected. The slaughter of immatt> beef cattle
and the smuggling of herds outside the country severely compromised beef
production for the coming years. Urban unemployment and underemployment
reached alarming levels (the combined rate was more than 30%). Real GDP
dropped by 27% in 1979 - in addition to the decline of 9% it had suffered in
1978. The income forgone during the period 1978 through 1980 will surpass one
billion dollars.
10.       A very significant loss for the country was the drop in export
proceeds. Exports constitute the chief driving force of the Nicaraguan
economy, as they represent one-third of GDP, and are a major source of employ-
ment. Although export proceeds derived from the 1978-1979 crop remained high
during the first half year, the foreign exchange earned was largely syphoned
out of the country. The 1979-1980 agricultural season was disrupted by the
war; both production and exports were affected. Farmers failed to plant
cotton, and production of coffee, sugar and beef dropped substantially.
Although high international prices of sugar and cotton offset some of the
possible losses of foreign exchange, total export receipts from goods and
services will probably decrease by US$230 million between 1978 and 1980 - in
real terms, a drop of 37%.
11.       Faced with an enormous curtailment of domestic supply and conditions
of financial insolvency, both on the national and international fronts, the
new Government braced itself for a very difficult first year. Efforts were
made to increase domestic supply, but in practice, the recession in the indus-
trial sector and the losses in agricultural production were essentially offset
only through increased imports. Inflation was kept down by the increased
imports, made possible by a large inflow of external financing, and by price
controls implemented through the Empresa Nacional de Abastecimientos (ENABAS).
12.       During the first year following the revolutionary war, international
organizations and a number of countries provided Nicaragua with substantial
amounts of external loans and credits and balance-of-payment financing--commit-
ments totaled approximately three-quarters of a billion dollars. Donations in
cash and goods amounted to more than US$130 million (plus considerable direct
technical assistance).  The other cotntries of Central America granted US$125
million in lines of short-term credit for trade financing. Bilateral grants
and loans from the developed and OPEC countries and reoriented loans from AID
added another US$158 million.  Undisbursed loans obtained before July, 1979
from the World Bank Group, IDB and CABEI, totaled US$118 million and new loans
obtained since that date, US$181 million; of this last sum only US$33 million
had been disbursed through June 1980. Disbursement levels rose considerably
during the second half of the year, but the scarcity of prepared projects
continued to be an important constraint on disbursements.
13.       The first months of 1980 were a period of relative fiscal equilibrium.
Surprisingly high fiscal revenues, derived from new taxes and more efficient
collection, together with low capital expenditures resulted in a balanced
budget. But this occurred only in the first quarter; during the remainder of



-4-
the year, fiscal policy has been more expansionary than planned. Although
capital expenditures in 1980 will be lower than budgeted, current expenditures
are likely to be about 2.7 times higher than those of 1978, surpassing the
relatively buoyant current revenues. The overall deficit of the Central
Government could rise to US$ 320 million, about 80 percent of total revenues
and 18 percent of GDP. Only about half this deficit is covered by external
financing. Bank credit expansion to the private sector in 1980 has been
substantial, much of it oriented towards short-term loans for commercial and
agricultural activities.
14.       Following the typical pattern of small, open economies, this large
increase in both Government expenditures and credit has quickly leaked out
into imports, particularly from Central America. Consumer prices are expected
to rise by about 35 percent in 1980; a high rate, but only about half of that
of 1979. Import growth has been mostly stimulated by the partial recovery of
consumption; the value of capital goods imports is expected to be just below
two-thirds of that of 1978, while imports of fuel and food may be twice as
high.
15.       In sum, the policy followed in practice has been one of satisfying
the basic needs of the population, restocking inventories, trying to restore
real consumption levels which had dropped sharply in 1979, and providing
employment, or at Least marginal work, for the urban unemployed through the
rapid expansion of commercial activities and the doubling of the government
sector. Since reaL consumption in 1980 is still likely below 1978 levels, it
would probably have been difficult to follow a more austere course. The one
chosen has given the Government, and the country itself, a breathing spell
following a very trying war-time period.  Had imports been restrained, domestic
scarcities would have been more apparent and inflation would probably have
accelerated. There has, however, been some cost to permitting a less painful
transition, i.e., the fostering of a large trade deficit.
Prospects for 1981
16.       In agriculture, basic grain production appears to be on the rise and
there is a good possibility that domestic consumption needs will be satisfied
to a large degree. The prospects for agricultural commodity exports are
good. Total exports in 1981 are projected to be more than 40 percent higher
than in 1980, and may reach the record exports of 1978. The 1980/81 coffee
crop may equal the record 1978/79 crep. Sugar exports are favored by high
world prices, and the shrimp and lobster catch is currently high. Beef pro-
duction, however, will remain depressed. The cotton area planted, a crucial
variable in the country's economic recovery process, will be approximately
140,000 "manzanas," including 21,000, now owned by the Government. Although
this represents nearly a tripling of the area planted in 1979, it is consider-
ably short of the 250,000 "manzanas" average of 1972-1978. The private
sector is hesitant to expand cotton production, particularly in the lower
yield lands, as hunian resources and some needed inputs have been in short
supply. Further the Government plans to limit the area under cotton to
170,000 "manzanas" so that the balance can be allocated to the production of
food.



- 5 -
17.       The prospects for the industrial sector in 1981 are not favorable.
Although it is expected that production in most of the plants under government
control will reach 1978 levels, the recovery of private industry continues
to be slov   The investment climate remains uncertain.  Confidence appears
insufficient to encourage large private entrepreneurs, such as those that
produce the bulk of the exports to Central America, to invest in the recon-
struction of firms and in working capital. Prospects for the mining sector--
now nationalized--are, however, very promising. Gold has become a major export
commodity for Nicaragua. High prices will mean that the value of gold exports
in 1981 could exceed US$30 million.
V
18.       Even if the potential for export recovery is fully realized, the
balance of payments picture will continue to be bleak for some time. As
production recovers, imports of capital goods should rise sharply; total
imports of goods and services in 1981 could reach US$1 billion, putting
additional pressure on the balance of payments. External assistance has so
far been substantial; the required external capital flows during the next
few years will also be high - over a quarter of a billion dollars per year.
However, debt service obligations could absorb a substantial part of that
inflow. An important determinant of the net flow of capital will be the
arangements that are reached by the Government with respect to the re-
scheduling of external debt. A satisfactory agreement has recently been
concluded with the foreign private banks. An October 1980 meeting of the
Paris Club began consideration of rescheduling of bilateral debts with
foreign governments; further meetings of the Club as well as some bilateral
agreements are likely.
Longer-Term Prospects
19.       Nicaragua is favored by a number of conditions  conducive to a
high rate of economic growth: the country has a low population/land ratio;
the available land resources are of good quality and plentiful - in fact there
exists much undeveloped frontier land; the core of the transport infrastruc-
ture network is well established and commodity exports are more diversified
than those of most of the other Central American countries. In addition, the
Government is giving high priority to productive sectors and to projects that
will generate foreign exchange. It also strongly favors rural development,
and the nationwide literacy program, which appears to be successful, will
broaden the long-term development potential of the country.
20.       At the same time there are a number of obstacles to the attainment
of a high growth path. First and foremost, the havoc caused by the war:
in addition to the loss of life, there were sizable income losses and property
damage. The consequences of these events will linger for a number of years.
The foreign debt inherited from the last administration is large. Loans
needed for the recovery program make current public external debt (including
undisbursed) approach the level of GDP. An estimate of future debt service
payments is not currently available because Nicaragua's past debts are still
being renegotiated.
21.       The country will depend for a number of years on costly, imported
fossil fuel as a principal source of electrical energy. Petroleum imports now
represent about one-quarter of total goods' imports. Hydroelectric power
development has lagged in Nicaragua, and geothermal exploitation is just
beginning.



- 6 -
22.       Perhaps the greatest challenge will be the ability of the Government
to lead the country through the difficult recovery period. The present policy
of restoring past levels of real consumption through monetary and fiscal expan-
sion and deficits in the current accournt must be tempered with one of growing
public and private investment, increased revenues from public enterprises,
high productivity, and all this within the framework of social transformation
to which the Government is committed. The economic consequences of the revolu-
tionary struggle will persist for a number of years. Under these circumstances,
concessionary external credit and official assistance in excess of the foreign
exchange component: of individual projects will be required to ease the transi-
tion period until the economy has completely recovered and the country's
traditional creditworthiness has been fully reestablished. In the longer
term, with good economic management, Nicaragua could attain the rapid growth
rates it had reached in the past and at the same time succeed in achieving its
more pressing social goals.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
23.       Nicaragua to date has received 26 Bank loans and three IDA credits
for a total of US$237 million. A loan of US$20 million and a credit for
US$10 million for agricultural and industrial rehabilitation and a second
credit for US$22 million for urban reconstruction, were signed on January 4,
1980. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of October 31, 1980 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
24.       Because of major fiscal difficulties during 1978 and the disruptive
effects of the revolutionary war in the latter part of 1978 and in most of 1979,
the Bank did not lend to Nicaragua between early 1978 and the end of 1979. In
mid 1979 it was concluded that meaningful project activities and adequate
supervision of ongoing projects were no longer possible. Therefore, the Board
was informed on July 16 (A 79-192) that no further disbursements on existing
loans and credits would be made. The Government of Nicaragua was subsequently
replaced by a Junt:a of National Reconstruction. The Junta requested emergency
assistance from the international community to facilitate recovery from the
economic disaster caused by the war as well as by large ouLtflows of capital.
The Bank responded to this Government request by restructuring projects on
which substantial balances remained undisbursed and by making them more
responsive to emergency needs. Also an emergency loan/credit package was
extended for agricultural and industrial rehabilitation and for urban recon-
struction. The restructuring of projects was completed in October, 1979, at
which time the suspension of disbursements was rescinded. The emergency
operations were signed in January 1980. As described in Annex II, implementa-
tion of the restructured and emergency projects is progressing well.
25.       In the past, the objectives of the Bank/IDA program in Nicaragua
have been (a) to support the Government's export diversification efforts
(b) to help build viable institutions in key seccors, such as water supply



-7-
and electric power and (c) to help spread the benefit of growth to more people
through lending for projects such as education, rural sanitation, agriculture
and water supply. The Bank Group also assisted in the reconstruction effort
following the devastating earthquake of 1972.
26.       Because of the Government's preoccupation with emergency reconstruc-
tion requirements, it has not yet been possible to develop a long-term lending
program for the Bank Group. A new investment program for the expanded public
sector is now being formulated.  An agreed draft is expected to be completed
shortly. However, an agreement has already been reached within the new
Government on investment priorities and on a list of projects requiring
financial assistance immediately.  The Bank was, therefore, invited for
programming discussions in August of this year. The objective of these
discussions was to develop a tentative program of assistance for the next
three years. This program is summarized in para. 27 below. Bilateral assis-
tance programs are still largely responsive to emergency needs. The Government
has also had programming discussions with the IDB, from which it has requested
substantial financial assistance. The Bank Group lending activities to
Nicaragua are being closely coordinated with donors such as IDB, CABEI, USAID
and other bilateral agencies.
27.       In view of the disruptions created by the revolutionary war, one of
the most urgent requirements of the Nicaraguan economy at present is the
establishment of a mechanism to generate well designed, high priority projects.
- The FThAPRI project will assist in meeting this requirement. The rural
development office for Central America, for which the Bank is serving as
executing agency, is expected to provide assistance in the identification and
preparation of rural development projects. The Government has also requested
assistance for the following projects: (a) rural primary education including
adult literacy, a component that would reinforce and institutionalize the
results of the recently completed literacy campaign, (b) a continuation of the
agricultural/industrial rehabilitation program, which was part of the emergency
package approved in December 1979--since commitment of funds under the first
project has been nearly completed, a follow-up project is urgently needed (c)
infrastructure, development projects for water supply and electric power
(geothermal), where the Bank has worked in the past, as well as for road
upgrading and road maintenance (d) urban projects to upgrade low-income
neighborhoods, finance municipal improvements and implement a low-cost
housing program and (e) in addition to an immediate repeater project for
agricultural and industrial rehabilitation, assistance in agriculture, partic-
ularly for the development of tree crops (oil and coco palm).
28.       IFC's first operation in Nicaragua involved a FY1968 loan and equity
investment of US$1 million and US$1.07 million, respectively, in a textile
plant, Textiles Fabricato de Nicaragua, S.A. IFC's equity participation was
sold in FY1974 to local shareholders. In FY1976 IFC agreed to provide US$6.5
million in long-term debt to Nicaragua Sugar Estates Ltd., a sugar mill, to
help expand its production capacity and develop new cane fields. Due to
subsequent cancellation of part of the project by Nicaragua Sugar Estates Ltd.,
that commitment was subsequently reduced to US$4 million. Also in FY1976 IFC
made a loan and equity investment of US$700,000 and US$200,000, respectively,
to help finance the construction of the Camino Real Hotel. The projects



@8 
financed by IFC's three investments suffered some damage, but were not
destroyed during the civil war. Four IFC missions have visited Nicaragua
during 1980 to discuss with the Government the rescheduling of part of
IFC's existing loans and its future role in the reconstruction of the country.
Arrangements for rescheduling IFC's loans are expected to be completed by
December 31, 1980.
PART III -- INVESTMENT NEEDS AND PROJECT PREPARATION ACTIVITIES
29.       Nicaragua will have to invest large sums in the coming years if
the effects of the recent war are to be overcome and the level of economic
activity is to return to normal. The National Investment Program prepared in
the first half of 1980 calls for investments of the order of US$380 million in
calendar year 1981 rising to close to US$600 million by 1983. The total level
of investments in the past three years was US$555 million in 1977, US$264
million in 1978 and (-) US$63 million in 1979. 1/ Not only did the war
interrupt investments and reduce economic activity, it also hindered invest-
ment planning for the future and prevented the preparation of feasible invest-
ment projects. Furthermore, many of the investment plans prepared before the
civil war have become obsolete. The public sector which accounted for only
about 15% of GDP before the war has been expanded to account for about 40% of
GDP because industrial enterprises and agricultural land formerly owned by
the Somoza famrily have been expropriated and brought into the public sector.
In addition, there is a dearth of management expertise because top level
managers of expropriated enterprises in industry and agriculture have left
the country and their place has been taken by new managers who, although
highly motivated, lack experience. This has made it necessary to strengthen
the administration of the public sector to ensure that the level of invest-
ment called for by the National Investment Program can be attained. Top
management of public sector agencies has been replaced and public sector
administration has been restructured by the creation of new ministries. It
is hoped that with these steps the implementing capacity of the public
agencies will be gradually built up so that when suitable high priority
project are prepared they can be implemented rapidly. The private sector
however continues to remain hesitant about making new investments.
30.       The Government, recognizing the importance of creating a reliable
mechanism to generate well thought out and prepared projects for both the public
and the private sectors, has established two key institutions for this purpose.
One is the Fondo I'nternacional para la Reconstruccion de Nicaragua (FIR),
established in September 1979, and the other is FINAPRI, the beneficiary of
the proposed credit, established in September 1980. FIR, which is headed by
a Minister, is in charge of the promotion, negotiations and organization of
financial assistance for reconstruction projects from bilateral and multilateral
sources. FINAPRI, which is headed by an Executive Director selected by the
1!   The negative investment stemmed from the fact that the large stock draw-
downs exceeded the value of the very limited fixed capital formation.



09 
Financial Cabinet of the Government, is charged with the task of financing and
helping undertake preinvestment studies with the object of building up a
pipeline of projects, necessary to restart economic activity in the country and
reshape Nicaragua's economy as determined by the Minister of Planning. The
Financial abinet also serves as FINAPRI's Board of Directors and consists of
one member of the National Junta, the Presidents of the Corporacion Financiera
(CORFIN), and the Central Bank, and the Ministers of Finance, Planning and the
head of FIR. It has general supervisory functions, including supervision of
FINAPRI's financial operation and budget and the approval of contracts under
which FINAPRI acquires its resources. FINAPRI's organization chart is attached
as Annex V.
31.       Both FINAPRI and FIR along with the Ministry of Finance are repre-
sented on an Investment Committee which is chaired by a representative of the
Ministry of Planning. For investment projects requiring foreign financing,
proposals are submitted for approval to this Committee by the relevant public
sector agency or private sector enterprise. If the Committee feels that
preinvestment studies are necessary before it can act on a proposal, the
financing and supervision of such studies is entrusted to FINAPRI. Upon
completion of the study and if the Committee s approval is obtained, any
additional external financing needed to implement the project becomes the
responsibility of FIR.
32.       It is the Governments intention to involve FINAPRI in all public
sector preinvestment studies not already budgeted by the implementing agencies.
While the extent of FINAPRI's involvement will depend on the needs of the
various implementing agencies, it is expected that, given the clear need for
preinvestment studies in Nicaragua,the major constraint to FINAPRI's activities
for the next few years will be its human and financial resources.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The project was prepared by FINAPRI between March and June 1980 and
appraised by the Association in June 1980. Supplementary data are provided in
Annex III. Annex IV contains a tentative list of studies which may be considered
for financing under the proposed project and financial projections of FINAPRI and
Annex V contains a description of FINAPRI's organization. Negotiations were
held in Washington from November 17 to 18.  The Nicaraguan Delegation was headed
by Mr. Bernardo Chamorro, Vice Minister of FIR.
Project Objectives and General description
34.       The main objective of the proposed project will be to provide
assistance to further strengthen the recently established FINAPRI, which
is expected to help generate both public and private sector investment projects.
The proceeds of the credit would be used to finance consultant's services for
preparing high priority investment projects in key productive and social
sectors and technical assistance to FINAPRI and its borrowers.



- 10 
35.       FINAPRI started operations in March 1980 and, under its super-
vision, studies in the following areas have already been successfully
completed:
(a)  feasibility of railway rehabilitation;
(b)  feasibility of rehabilitation and construction of
production roads;
(c) feasibility of improving the transport system on
Lake Nicaragua;
(d) development of drinking water project for secondary
cities and possibilities for improving drinking water
for 28 communities;
(e) evaluation of possibilities of extending the coastal
waterway; and
(f)  35 investment profiles for the industrial sector.
Of the studies listed above, Association staff have reviewed the feasibility
study of the rehabilitationL and construction of productior roads and found
it to be of adequate quality.
36.       FINAPRI will provide technical assistance to its borrowers at every
stage from project identification to study supervision; it will identify early
in the project cycle possible impediments to implementation, from lack of
investment funds to internal weaknesses in the borrower's organization, and
help devise ways and means to correct them; it will act as a promoter in those
sectors where there is a particular shortage of projects, so that the Government's
sectoral distribution goals for investment can be met.
37.       Ever since its inception FINAPRI has been gradually building up its
staff which presently number 65. Its management and staff are highly motivated.
Although lacking in experience, they are considered qualified to achieve the
institution's objectives, provided they receive technical assistance from
consultants in fields where FINAPRI lacks the expertise to support the sub-
borrower (para. 51).
FINAPRI Procedures
38.       FINAPRI's procedures are described in its operating manual which
was developed in early 1980. While it is considered satisfactory, it has not
as yet been tested in practice. FINAPRI's management intends to monitor its
effectiveness and make appropriate changes in general operating procedures in
consultation with the Association (Section 2.10(a) of the draft Project
Agreement).
39.       FINAPRI, wvhen necessary, alssists in project identification and
preparation of project briefs for submission to the Investment Committee
whose function is described in paragraph 31. Once the Committee has given
its preliminary approval for a study, the borrower proceeds to the drafting



- 11 -
of detailed terms of reference, budgeting, prequalification, selection and
contracting   of consultants.  FINAPRI has a technical assistance as well as a
supervisory function in all these stages.
40.       Since FINAPRI is a public sector institution, gua-3ntees to ensure
repayment of its subloans to public sector agencies are not required. For
loans to the private sector collateral will be obtained to cover the risk of
possible non-repayment. This is provided for in FINAPRI's manual.
FINAPRI's Financial Position and Projected Operations
41.       FINAPRI's financial projections show that Government budgetary
support will be required to cover operating expenses through 1985, when the
outstanding and disbursed loans would amount to approximately US$26 million.
The Government would provide the necessary funds for this purpose. These
are estimated at US$3.4 million, in addition to US$355,000 for start-up
expenses. The Government would also provide counterpart funds for the preinvest-
ment studies to be financed by the proposed credit, estimated to be about
US$1.2 million equivalent (Section 3.01(a) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). After 1986, FINAPRI should be able to cover approximately 35% of
disbursements through net income and repayments on its loans.
42.       FINAPRI plans to maintain separate accounts for its technical assistance
activities and it intends to charge a fee for them. No estimate, however, of
income from this source can be made at present because the extent of FINAPRI's
involvement in technical assistance is not yet known nor has the fee level been
determined. Charges for technical assistance have, therefore, not been
fncluded in the cash flow forecast. Even if FINAPRI is not able to recover
technical assistance costs from its sub-borrowers, it should be able to
cover its operating costs by 1986, the year following expected full disbursement
of the IDA credit. Any recovery of technical assistance costs would result in
FINAPRI being able to break even earlier.
43.       FINAPRI is currently estimating that it will be called upon to
finance studies that could result in producing projects representing about half
of the value of the national investment program. The cost of these studies is
estimated at about 3% of the cost of such projects. This is consistent with
experience in other countries for work up to and including feasibility studies.
The investment forecasts, and resulting cash requirements for FINAPRI, are
given in the following table.

44.       The cost data do not include the private sector or requirements for
detailed engineering. At least initially it is not expected that the private
sector will make much use of this facility. As explained in paragraph 29
the private sector is still reluctant to make new investments. However,
when it does starl: to invest it generally prefers to use its own funds for
preinvestment studies. Nevertheless the Government feels that it is important
to leave the door open for the private sector to use FINAPRI's resources.
45.       A list of studies for which a preliminary budget could be prepared,
is provided in Annex IV. The cost of these studies amounts to US$19.8 million.
Not included is a large water supply, engineering study because sufficient
information on it is not presently available. A separate engineering loan
is being prepared for it which will be proposed for financing by the Bank.
This loan may alsco be channelled through FINAPRI.
46.       The sources of funds for these studies, in addition to the proposed
credit, are expected to be the IDB and various bilateral agencies. The German
Ministry of Economic Cooperation and the IDB have already provided $450,000
(see Annex IV). The Government has requested a loan of US$5 million from the
IDB which is expected to be made in about a. year.
Adequacy of the Credit
47.       It is not considered necessary to agree on a specific list of studies
to be prepared as a precondition for the proposed credit, because priorities
for preinvestment studies tend to change as new possibilities are identified
and as conclusions; of ongoing studies become available. The estimated size of
the identified priority investment requirements and the large number of studies
identified in Annex IV suggest that the proposed credit would be committed and
disbursed promptly.
l
48.       The proceeds of the credit will cover 80% of the cost of approved sub-
loans estimated at US$6.1 million. This represents about 20% of the total
amount of subloans that FINAPRI intends to make during the disbursement period
of the proposed credit. Of the 80% contribution from the Association approxi-
mately 70% would cover foreign cost and 10% local currency cost of studies.
Local cost financing is justified for reasons given in paragraph 22 above.
On-Lending Terms
49.       FINAPRI will finance up to 100% of the cost of preinvestment studies
in the public sector and up to 90% in the private sector. It would receive
the proceeds of the proposed credit on standard IDA terms from the Government.
FINAPRI's onlending terms fcr studies in the public sector are 8% per annum
interest for a maximum of 10 years including a grace period of not more than
2 years. There is a provision for accelerated repayment in case of project
implementation. The private sector would have to pay an additional 0.5%
commitment fee, (Section 2.02 of the draft Project Agreement). All borrowers
would pay the penalty charge on overdue service payments provided for in
Nicaragua's Banking System. (At present this is equivalent to the regular
interest rate plus a penalty charge of about 6% per annum). (Section 2.02(a)(iv)
of the draft Project Agreement). The Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk (Section 3.01(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).



- 13 -
50.       Nicaragua's 1980 annual inflation rate is expected to be about
35 percent; and it may continue at that rate in 1981 before declining to
lower levels in the succeeding years. Interest rates charged for agricultural
and industrial loans are now 12-14%. The Government has just completed a
major reoi mnization of the banking system, and bank portfolios are still
filled with an unknown quantity of loans to defunct enterprises. Private
investment remains low. Until the situation is normalized and inflation is
brought under control, the authorities are reluctant to raise nominal interest
rates, preferring to depend on Government-owned banks to allocate credit on
the basis of central guidelines. Regarding preinvestment studies for the
private sector, the Government is eager to encourage the sector to invest
and has, therefore, set FINAPRI's lending rate for the private sector also
at 8% (plus a 0.5% committment fee). To ensure the financial viability of
of FINAPRI, the Government has decided to meet all of FINAPRI's operating
expenses not recovered through loan or technical assistance charges. In
effect, the Government has decided that public sector preinvestment studies
will be a normal administrative responsibility of the Government, and that the
private sector requires some subsidy, at least to evaluate its investments
in the present uncertain environment. Given the lag in private investment
so far, the latter decision seems justified.
Technical Assistance
51.       Provision is made for approximately $122,000 (equivalent to
100,000 SDRs) in technical assistance, to cover possible requirements for
short-term experts in specific disciplines which FINAPRI lacks. The objective
would not be to finance studies by the direct employment of such experts, but
to make their expertise available to sub-borrowers or FINAPRI for helping
prepare terms of reference and assisting in consultant selection and super-
vision. These funds could also be used for assistance in the operations of
FINAPRI itself.
Procurement of Consultants and Disbursements
52.       In regard to studies to be financed under the credit (other than
free limit studies), the Association will approve the general outline and the
initial budget (Section 2.05(b) of the draft Project Agreement). For free
limit studies, costing not more than US$150,000 each and totalling not more
than US$2 million, the Association will approve the subject matter only
(Section 2.05(c) of the draft Project Agreement).
53.       Acceptable procedures for the selection of consultants are specified
in FINAPRI's operating manual except for the hiring of individual consultants.
The Association's approval would be sought regarding any changes in the pro-
curement procedures set out therein (Section 2.10(b) of the draft Project
Agreement), and it is a condition of effectiveness that the manual be amended
to include the provision for the hiring of individual consultants (Section 5.01(c)
of the Draft Development Credit Agreement.
54.       For selection of consulting services under sub-loans other than free
limit subloans, the Association will approve: (a) the short list of consultants
to be invited to make proposals, (b) the assessment of the responsiveness of
the winning proposal, and (c) the negotiated-draft contract (Section 2.04(i)
of the draft Project Agreement).



14 -
55.       With this involvement the Association seeks to insure that the
firms on the short list have the technical capacity to undertake the work,
that the terms of the invitation (not otherwise subject to approval) make
allowance for the recruitment of qualified personnel; that the standard form
of contract is followed to an appropriate degree; that comments have been
taken into account, and that the costs are within acceptable limits.
56.       Consultant's contracts would follow a standard form which will be
submitted to the Association for approval prior to disbursement under
category 1 of Schedule 1 of the Credit (Schedule 1, para. 3(b) of the Draft
Development Credit Agreement).
57.       The Association would disburse 80% of the cost of preinvestment
studies and 100% of technical assistance cost. It is expected that the amounts
allocated in the credit for subloans will be fully committed by June 30, 1984.
The closing date is, therefore, set at June 30, 1985 (Section 2.04 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement).
Monitoring
58.       The Government would furnish to, and exchange views with, the Asso-
ciation on the yearly work programs of FINAPRI, including its cost and
financing arrangements, as well as the results of actual execution of the
program. To the extent possible, the Association and FINAPRI will develop
cost effectiveness targets out of these reviews.
Benefits
59.       The project provides financial resources and technical assistance to
strengthen the capability of FINAPRI to identify and prepare suitable projects.
By helping to promote careful project analysis and design for sub-borrowers,
as well as by developing the budgeting, contracting and general supervision
skills of FINAPRI itself, it should lead to better conceived and more economical
investment projects. A further benefit is the stimulus which the project will
give to local consultants.
Risk
60.       There are no special risks involved in the proposed project.  The
size of the investment needs of Nicaragua, the determination of the Govern-
ment to carry out a substantial development program and the project identifi-
cation efforts of multilateral development banks are likely to ensure that new
projects can be readily identified to replace any that may be dropped from the
initial list.
61.       Delays :Ln commitment and dLisbursement could arise because of FINAPRI's
lack of experience and expertise. As stated in para. 37 above, the quality
of FINAPRI's staff is considered good.  The supervision planned by the Associa-
tion should assist in overcoming problems of implementation due to any lack of
experience that may become evident.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan/Credit No.
Ln.  1244   Second Education Project:  US$ 11.0 Million of June 15, 1976:
Effective Date: August 17, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
Project implementation has improved greatly in the last few months.
Eighteen basic secondary schools and around 110 out of 222 rural
primary schools are under construction.  Tenders have been called
which would bring the number of schools under construction by the
end of 1980 to around 75% of the total.  Around 55% of the estimated
total value of civil works is in execution.  Repair of the 22
schools built under the First Education Project which were
destroyed during the 1979 civil war was also substantially completed.
Procurement of school furniture and equipment is proceeding
satisfactorily and the teacher training program will resume in
December 1980.  The technical assistance program contracted with
UNESCO was initiated on October 1, 1980. 40% of the loan proceeds
have been disbursed to date. Total project costs have risen by
around 10% due to labor and materials cost increases. The project
is expected to be completed by December 31, 1981.

Ln. 1402  Ninth Power Project:  US$22.0 Million of April 22, 1977; Effective
Date:  October 27, 1977- Closing Date:  June  30, 1982.
The project was significantly delayed because of delays in hiring
consultants, difficulties in engaging contractors and because of
ENALUF's (now INE) increasingly tight financial situation. These
earlier difficulties are in large measure a consequence of the
political disturbances wlhich ended with a change of Government in
July 1979. The cost of the project, originally appraised at US$32.3
million is now estimated to be US$40.2 million. After the civil
war,modifications in the project were agreed with the new Government
and INE. They consisted of a reduction in the Bank share of some
parts of the project (financing for which was assumed by CABEI) to
allow the Bank to finance a portion of the local costs of
reconstruction of installations damaged during the war, and
finance replenishment of INE's inventory of distribution equipment.
Since the end of the war, procurement activities under the project
have been satisfactory, except that the tariff and sector organization
studies which were to be financed have not been restarted. Because
of reduced sales and increased operational expenses, largely due
to increased fuel cost, INE continues to face serious financial
problems.  Collection performance which was very poor during and
immediately after the war has improved substantially; however,
proposed tariff increases have not yet been approved.  We are cone
cerned about managerial efficiency but expect a productlve dialogue
on required institutionalL improvements in the context of preparing
the next power project.
Ln. 1495  Rural Sanitation Project:  US$3.0 Million of February 9, 1978;
Effective Date:  July 10, 1978; Closing Date:  June 30, 1982.
Follow:ing the civil war and in view of the changed responsibilities of
the Ministry of Health and the water company (INAA), the Government
presented to the Bank a detailed proposal for the modification of the
project scope and the institutional arrangements required for the
Project. Meanwhile, the subprojects already started are being com-
pleted.
Ln. 1496 Managua Water Supply III Project: US$10.1 Million of January 30,
1978; Effective Date: May 26, 1978; Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
The project was restructured in October 1979, eliminating some
components which were not of high priority under current circumstances
and using the resulting savings to finance replacement of equipment
destroyed during the war and to increase the financing of local
costs and interest during construction. Although the executing agency
(INAA) has endured a very critical financial position, the company
is now in the process of recovery. All Bank recommendations have been,
or are, in the process of being implemented, and the project is
expected to be completed only six months after the original closing
date of June 30, 1981.

Ln. 1785   Agricultural and Industrial Rehabilitation Pro4-<t:  Loan US$20.0
Cr. 966    Million, Credit US$10.0 Million of January 4, ijdO; Effective
Date: January 25, 1980; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
One half of the Loan/Credit was allocated to replanting of ex-
propriated farmland and war damaged private farms and to a coffee
renovation project. Disbursements on this part of the project
have been faster than expected and as of November 7, 1980, US$6.9
million had been disbursed by Bank/IDA. As of September 30, 1980,
the total committed by the project management from the Loan/Credit
to agriculture was about US$17.5 million. Since the utilization
of the industrial component has been slower than that of the
agricultural component and, due to the more immediate needs of
the agricultural sector, US$7 million of the US$15 million industrial
allocation has been reallocated to the agricultural component.
Although 135 private and 6 state farms have benefitted from the
project, the amount has not been sufficient to finance more than
half of the subprojects requiring financial assistance.
The other half of the Loan/Credit had been allocated for the reha-
bilitation of industrial enterprises to enable them to regain pre-
war levels of employment, output and exports through restoring
current production and the repair or replacement of fixed installa-
tions. Of the remaining US$8 million, US$6.5 million has been
committed and the balance is expected to be committed shortly
(subproject approvals for the industrial sector by the Government
now total the full US$8 million).
Cr. 965   Urban Reconstruction Project:  US$22.0 Million of January 4, 1980;
Effective Date: January 25, 1980; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The Municipal Reconstruction Component (US$6.8 million) is proceeding
on schedule; most repair works on the street and public spaces
have been completed except for the installation of water supply
equipment. Major reconstruction of markets and other municipal build-
ingsare under construction or in the final design stage due in large
part to the quality of the technical teams of the Ministry and
Municipalities. The Small Scale Enterprise Component (US$3.2 million)
handled by the FED has made about 1,800 loans totalling over US$3.0
million which include numerous micro-enterprise loans handled by the
Banco Popular and BND. Progress on the Urban Transport Component
OTS$12.0 million) is also satisfactory; the bus route paving
improvement program is ahead of schedule. Tendering for procurement
of buses and maintenance equipment was approved by the Bank in July
and contracts were signed in mid September. Total disbursements
are at present near appraisal estimate.

B. CASH FLOW
1.        The basic assumptions of the cash flow forecast are that operating
costs, originally forecast in constant dollars, are increased by the total
forecast local inflation; 1/ that costs of studies are increased by 10% p.a.                 t
to compensate for international inflation; that the Government will make
contributions in support of operations until these are covered by interest
and commission; that the Government will make the necessary counterpart funds
available to support the requirements of the portfolio.
2.        The operational information for the forecast was supplied by FINAPRI.
It is very tentative as it is most difficult to project the level of activities
of a newly established Preinvestment Fund. It shows an exceptionally high
early rate of disbursement. This is considered achievable, however, because
the Government has decided to route all preinvestment studies not already
budgeted by the Ministry or Authority concerned through the new institution.
3.        In line with this Government decision and policy, counterpart funds
have been budgeted by the Ministry of Finance to meet such a high rate of
disbursement. If disbursements should be slower than expected, FINAPRI's
income would be afiEected and the point at which FINAPRI will become self
financing would be delayed.
4.        Cash balances have been projected at a constant US$20,000
equivalent.
5.        Funds from other external sources are shown as grants on capital
account and cover the authorized capital of US$6.5 million by end 1983.
Increases, however, do not require special legal authority as the Enabling
Law gives the necessary authority to the Finance Committee of the Government.
6.        The forecast is based on the commitment levels indicated in para. 43.
The IDA credit is expected to be totally disbursed by the end of FY85. The
Credit is to be passed on to FINAPRI on IDA terms and onlent at 8% interest
with a repayment period of up to 10 years.
1/   The impact of inflation (see para. 50) on FINAPRI's operating cost: is
estimated to be 30% in 1980, 20% in 1981 and 1982, 15% in 1983 and 1984
and 10% in 1935 and 1986,



- 35 -
ANNEX IV
Page 7 of 8
7.        Operating costs average 22% of disbursements over the six-year
period including start-up costs. This is high, but is the rerult of the
considerable technical assistance and promotional work required (para. 36)
The possible income from charging for this work is not shown. The effect
would be roughly to halve the burden on lending operations, which would then
be about 10% of disbursements and less than 3% of portfolio.
8.        Disbursements are calculated at about 18 months from sub-loan
approval. There are no provisions for early repayments, as could occur on
implementation of study recommendations.
