                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project objective is to improve teaching and learning practices in the classroom in order to assist the Government in improving education quality while maintaining
                         its focus on reaching universal primary completion by 2015. The project would do this by: (a) improving both access and retention by expanding the number of middle
                         school places in the system, improving conditions in existing elementary schools, and by supporting additional literacy courses; (b) improving education quality, with a
                         focus on elementary education; and (c) strengthening management at central, deconcentrated and decentralized levels to ensure attainment of PDEF objectives.

                         Primary completion rate has made historical progress moving from 59 percent for the past few years to 66.5 percent for the 2010-11 school year. Grade one intake rate is at 113
                         percent against a target of 103 percent for the end of the project. The primary gross enrollment rate for 2011 reached 93.9 percent and the project is likely to meet the end of project

                         target of 96 percent. All gender targets in primary, junior secondary and secondary schools have been exceeded. Currently more girls than boys are enrolled at primary level. The
                         project has already met or exceeded most of its targets. Despite excellent progress in increasing instructional time and success rates for middle school exams, especially when
                         compared to other countries in the region, these targets might not be completely met by end of project.

                         Regarding the improvement in the quality of education, the repetition rate indicator is at 3 percent, exceeding the target of 6.3 percent. The success rate for middle school
                         examinations has shown strong progress moving from 35 percent in 2009 to 47.5 percent in 2010 and 53.9 percent in 2011. Due to teachers’ strikes, the number of hours of
                         instructional time has also progressed only from 700 to 733 hours against the end of project target at 900 hours. The Government has consistently allocated adequate recurrent
                         budget to sustain the development of the education system overall and basic education in particular.

                         The disbursement ratio is 99 percent against 51 percent in August 2010 primarily a result of project restructuring and close supervision and implementation support from the task
                         team.
