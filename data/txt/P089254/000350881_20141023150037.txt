F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project was Phase 2 of an APL. In line with APL original document, the project objective as
reflected in the Credit Agreement (CA) was to enhance the quality of the Recipient’s education
system through the improvement of teaching and learning practices.. . The project would do this
by: (a) improving both access and retention by expanding the number of middle school places in
the system, improving conditions in existing elementary schools, and by supporting additional
literacy courses; (b) improving education quality, with a focus on elementary education by
providing school grants, learning materials, training and improving testing and evaluations; and
(c) strengthening management at central, deconcentrated and decentralized levels to ensure
attainment of PDEF objectives.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The PDOs were not revised during the life of the Project. The key performance indicators were
modified to better measure the achievement of PDO. Some indicators were eliminated because
they lacked baselines and were not being monitored.

                          14
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal


1.      The Quality Education for All 2 Project was the second phase of an adaptable program
loan (APL) approved to support the implementation of the Government’s Ten-Year Education
and Training Program (Programme Décennal de l’Education et la Formation – PDEF). The prior
project (Phase I) was the Quality Education for All Project (P047319) which was completed in
December 2005. Most of the first project’s objectives were met as were the required triggers for
transitioning from the first project (Phase I) to the Quality Education for All 2 Project (Phase II).
The most important gains made during the first project included: an increase in access to
education with significant improvements in girls’ access to education; and building capacity at
the regional and district levels in terms of piloting the support of block grants to regions, districts
and schools. Other achievements included the development of monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
mechanisms and a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which was developed by the
Government’s education team with support of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).

2.      Challenges, however, remained related to: (i) improving the quality of education, the
effective use of data collected, and policy analysis to influence policy making; (ii) further
decentralizing the Government budget to local governments; and (iii) rationalizing budget
resources and reallocations among the different education levels in order to achieve the goals of
the PDEF.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

3.      The project objective as reflected in the Credit Agreement (CA) was to enhance the
quality of the Recipient’s education system through the improvement of teaching and learning
practices. The project appraisal document (PAD) indicated the Project would support the
achievement of the project development objective (PDO) by: (a) improving both access and
retention by expanding the number of middle school places in the system, improving conditions
in existing elementary schools, and by supporting additional literacy courses; (b) improving
education quality, with a focus on elementary education; and (c) strengthening management at
central, deconcentrated and decentralized levels to ensure attainment of PDEF objectives.

The PDO was to be measured by the following indicators:

Access
   • Gross primary enrollment rate for girls and boys would reach 96 percent by 2009;
   • First grade entry would reach 103 percent by 2009;
   • Girls as percentage of all students would reach 49 percent by 2009 in elementary schools
       and 46 percent in middle schools by 2009; and
   • Primary completion rate (PCR) would reach 78 percent by 2009.




                                                  15
Quality
   • Repetition rates in primary would decline to 6 percent by 2009;
   • At least 75 percent of primary students would receive at least the minimum acceptable
       score in reading, languages, mathematics and science by 2009;
   • Transition rate from primary to middle schools would reach 57 percent in 2009; and
   • Success rate on middle school exit examinations (Brevet de Fin d’études moyennes –
       BFEM) would reach 60 percent by 2009.

Management
  • Education recurrent spending would be 40 percent of all Government recurrent spending
     every year until 2009 (calculated as recurrent budget net of debt services and of common
     expenditures or dépenses communes);
  • Education recurrent budget allocated to primary education would reach 50 percent in
     2009;
  • Education recurrent budget allocated to higher education would reach 20 percent in 2009;
  • Middle school teachers would teach on average 20 hours per week by 2009; and
  • Instructional per year time in education would reach 900 hours by 2009.

4.    The PAD and the CA included a set of progress indicators, included in the Results
Framework of the data sheet, to track implementation progress (see section F of the Data Sheet).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

5.     The PDOs were not modified during the life of the Project. The results framework was
modified in the August 2010 restructuring as follows:

   (i) The target for the PCR was revised from 78 percent to 65 percent;
   (ii) The indicator related to the share of Government budget allocated to education was
   revised in order to align it with the internationally agreed Education for All (EFA)
   benchmarking; and
   (iii) Several outcome indicators were dropped – specifically those that had no baseline or
   target and those which were not monitored, or were not as relevant in measuring Project
   outcomes.

The Results Framework in section F of the Data Sheet contains the revised outcome and
intermediate indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

6.      The Project beneficiaries were: school-aged children in primary and secondary levels,
young illiterate adolescents and women between 15 and 49 years of age, teachers and school
directors. The Project would focus on underserved rural students and on students with
disabilities. The Project was supposed to benefit staff and managers of the Ministry of Education
(Ministère de l’éducation nationale – MEN) at central, regional and local levels to schools and
local governments.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project had three components:

7.      Component I: Expanding access and improving retention in elementary and middle
schools. This component would finance the following: (i) the construction of middle schools in
underserved areas; (ii) the construction of latrines and water points in elementary schools lacking
these facilities; and (iii) the provision of literacy courses to 50,000 people (with 70 percent of
these being women).

8.     Component II: Improving education quality in the elementary classroom. This
component would finance the following activities: (i) provision of block grants for quality
improvement plans at regional, district and school levels; (ii) provision of pedagogic inputs to
schools, such as textbooks and other instructional, library and reading materials; (iii) training of
teachers, inspectors, school directors and mentor teachers, with specific attention to the
development of training modules, and training of trainers to improve quality in the classroom;
(iv) improving the system of examinations and evaluation of learning outcomes; and (v)
supporting sector studies in key sub-sectors, including vocational training and higher education.

9.     Component III. Strengthening management, monitoring and communication
throughout the system. This component would: (i) provide support for results-based
management with the MEN at central and decentralized levels; (ii) strengthen M&E, building a
strong data collection mechanism and capacity for using results for policy development; and (iii)
improve communication across all actors in the system, and poll communities on their views of
education using the community score card method.

1.6 Revised Components

10.    The main components of the Project remained unchanged.

1.7 Other significant changes

11.     The project was first restructured in August 2010. The CA was modified to reallocate
funds among disbursement categories and Project components. The restructuring sought to: (i)
refocus activities that aimed to tackle the main internal inefficiencies and quality issues; (ii)
revise the Results Framework as explained in section 1.3; to (iii) involve Regional Local
Development Agencies (RDAs or Agences Régionales de Développement Local) to speed up the
implementation of subcomponent 1.a, the construction of 170 water points and 300 six toilet
blocks in existing elementary schools; (iv) introduce an activity in subcomponent 2.c “block
grants to schools and local education structures”, which would provide additional support to
students experiencing learning difficulties in math and reading during the summer vacation with
the involvement of civil society organizations (CSOs). Reallocations among project components
were minimal (see table below). Additionally, the restructuring was undertaken in order to (v)
extend the closing date by 14 months from October 30, 2010 to December 31, 2011.

12.    A second restructuring took place on December 27, 2011 so that: (i) the project closing
date could be extended for a second time from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2012 ; and (ii) a
minor reallocation of funds among disbursement categories could be made. At that point, there
were only a few activities left to be completed (construction of 7 junior secondary schools (for
which the project target was 28), construction of 170 water points and 300 latrines in primary
schools, and a learning assessment for Grades 2, 4 and 6 in May 2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.     Government ownership was strong. The PDEF, approved in 2000, was being successfully
implemented, with support from the International Development Association (IDA) and other
donors. Public expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) increased annually
between 2000 and 2005, during the first Quality Education for All project (Phase I -- supporting
the PDEF). The Government had committed significantly more resources than planned to each of
the activities during Phase I. The country had made progress in implementing a framework for
quality education and in increasing access to education, recruiting teachers and transferring
responsibilities to the decentralized departments.

14.     Project preparation was based on solid knowledge background. The first Quality
Education for All Project had financed a substantial number of studies (such as the evaluation of
school construction and the QEFA1 evaluation, a study on bilingual teaching practices,
evaluations of learning assessments, annual statistical digests) and had contributed to
strengthening M&E capacities. The Government and the IDA team had been working closely
together during the implementation of Phase I and the good dialogue between the Government
and the IDA team contributed to a solid and fluid preparation. The experience of QEFA1 and the
strengthened capacity at the MEN resulted in a strong participation of key department of the
MEN (including the Planning and Education Reform Department (Direction de la Planification
et de la Réforme de l’ Education, DPRE) the Administration and Management Department
(Direction de l’ Administration Générale et de l’équipement, DAGE) and the Elementary
Education Department (Direction de l’Enseignement Elementaire DEE) during the preparation of
the Project. The IDA team worked closely with the Government and other donors in harmonizing
the support to the sector efforts, led by the Government.


                                               18
15.    The PDOs and design were in line with the goals set in the PDEF and in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) (FY07-10), which aimed at building human capacity at the national
level while improving access to and the quality of the social services. The PDOs and components
supported the millennium development goals (MDGs) related to education and gender parity.
The choice of project components and activities were appropriate and adequate for achieving the
PDOs and targets as set out in the PAD.

16.     Lessons from QEFA1 were incorporated into the project design. A number of pilots were
fielded and its results and lessons taken into account. Block grants to schools were financed
during QEFA1, showing increased transparency and greater accountability. Other activities
supported during Phase I were initiatives to reduce repetition and dropout rates, an adult basic
education program, and assessments of students’ learning undertaken at the decentralized level.
Specifically, lessons on implementation arrangements, donor coordination, hierarchy, and project
leadership were streamlined into the project design.

17.     Quality Enhancement Review (QER) suggestions were taken into account. The QER rated
project preparation as satisfactory. The PDOs and components were positively rated at that time.
The main suggestions concentrated, on: (i) reducing the scope and the number of sub-
components and activities; (ii) prioritizing the activities under the quality component and giving
them a strategic framework; and (iii) clearly explaining how some strategies were going to be
implemented.

Nevertheless, there were also some shortcomings at this stage:

18.     The Results Framework included too many indicators for measuring outcomes. The
Results Framework included a large number of indicators to measure project outcomes and some
indicators measured outcomes which were not explicit project objectives (such as budget
management indicators). Moreover, several of these indicators were not defined with enough
specificity, which created difficulties in monitoring them (in some cases it was unfeasible to
monitor them at all) and/or their targets were not well-defined. Further, the outcome indicators
in the PAD and in the CA were not entirely the same.

19.     The implementation capacity of local governments was not adequately assessed. The
Project failed to properly assess the capacity of local governments to implement one of twenty
one sub-components/activities that aimed at upgrading elementary schools and bringing them up
to standards through the construction of point water and latrines. This shortcoming was
overcome after the mid-term review (MTR) by switching the implementation responsibilities to
the RDA 1s.

1
  ARDs are government institutions created in 1996 as public local agencies with an administrative and financial
autonomy to provide technical assistance, capacity building, and implementation support to municipalities. In 2008,
the World Bank financed project, the National Local Development Program, provided support to strengthen them.
They are currently fully operational as local development institutions.




                                                        19
20.     These shortcomings were successfully addressed during the 2010 restructuring of the
project as outlined below.

2.2 Implementation

21.      Strong Government commitment to long-term sector goals and policies. The solid
commitment to the sector policies for universal completion of elementary education,
improvement of quality at all levels, elimination of inequity in terms of gender and income,
deepening the decentralization efforts and expanding the role of local communities in education
contained in the PDEF contributed to the satisfactory implementation of the Project. The
Government maintained its commitment to improving public expenditure management by
working with IDA on sector studies on this issue. The Government used the annual report of the
status of education carried out by the DPRE and the evaluation carried out by an external
institution (the Consortium for the Social and Economic Research – CRES) as an opportunity to
monitor performance and review policies and practices if needed. Implementation was not
significantly affected by the presidential elections and change in Government that took place
shortly after Project approval.

22.    Solid involvement of senior staff in the Ministry of Education (MEN). The Minister of
Education and the Directors of the different departments were deeply involved in the
implementation of the Project’s activities. Implementation benefited from the involvement of the
technical units, which were responsible for implementing the project. The Project was
implemented by the MEN and its technical directorates, and not by a separate project
coordination unit. The DAGE handled all of the fiduciary matters and had trained staff on board
when implementation started.

23.    Strong coordination among the departments involved in project implementation. The
DPRE was responsible for the coordination of the activities included in the PDEF, including
those of the Project. The project team understood the importance of creating a Steering
Committee led by the office of the Minister of Education which included representatives of those
departments who were responsible for implementing project activities and this was described in
the PAD. This arrangement contributed to overcome the impasse experienced at times during
Phase I, given the hierarchical issues among the directorates.

24.     Activities to accompany implementation were key to the successful implementation of the
project. The deconcentrated levels of the MEN (education structures at the regional level –
Inspection d’Académie (IA) and education structures at the district level – Inspection
départementale de l’éducation nationale (IDEN)) carried out regular visits to the schools to
accompany the teachers and principals in the implementation of the new curriculum, the use of
manuals and other pedagogical materials, the preparation and implementation of the school
projects. The visits provided first-hand knowledge of the problems and provided relevant
information to prepare the activities for the Regional Training Plans (Plans Académiques de
Formation – PAFs) and the Quality Action Plans (Plans d’ actions de Qualité – PAQs).

25.   Successful implementation of school projects, while overcoming some initial difficulties.
Implementation of school projects was, in general, satisfactory. Elementary and secondary
                                              20
schools successfully executed their projects and took advantage of the training and planning
exercises to engage their communities. One of the difficulties in the Project’s early stages was
that due to competing needs, some schools had difficulties using the funding for the intended
objectives. In some instances, resources were spent on infrastructure upgrades instead of on
pedagogical items, out of need and lack of other sources of funding. In order to help the schools,
the MEN prepared new guidelines to re-focus the content of Project on activities to improve
quality, solve pedagogical problems, and increase learning achievements. School projects were
affected by the delays in receiving resources, which in some instances, were more than a year. In
the Project’s early stages, there were delays in opening accounts by the school management
committees (Comités de gestion scolaire – CGEs) and the planning of activities at some schools.
These were in large part due to insufficient communication between IAs, IDENs and CGEs
which was subsequently rectified.

26.     Weak implementation capacity of local governments. Local governments were supposed
to implement the sub-component supporting the construction of water points and toilet blocks in
existing elementary schools. By MTR, implementation of this activity had not begun due to the
local governments’ limited capacity. Therefore, the ARDs in Diourbel, Kaolack, Kaffrine,
Louga, Thies and Saint Louis worked in a timely and efficient manner to implement these
activities.

27.     Higher than expected cost for the water points. The cost of constructing water points was
underestimated at the time of project preparation, due to the uncertainty of where the water
points would be built. The technical study revealed greater physical and geographical challenges
than had been anticipated. Specifically, that it was necessary to dig deeper in some areas than in
others, due to the depth of the aquifers. This resulted in a lower than envisaged number of water
points that could be built with project funding.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design
28.     The PAD included an M&E framework agreed with the Government, including a set of
outcome and implementation progress indicators, with baseline values and targets for most of
them, though the targets were vague or not defined for some outcome indicators. Together with
the project indicators, the Government and the donors agreed on a matrix of Education for All-
Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) indicators to be reviewed annually pertaining to the education
sector. These indicators were closely connected to the project indicators. The Project included
M&E activities for each of the components, and the costs of these were explicitly reflected in the
PAD.

Implementation
29.     As described in the PAD, the DPRE was responsible for leading and coordinating the
M&E activities, with inputs from the directorates at central level and the regional and local
levels. The DEE and the Directorate for Middle and General Secondary Schools (Direction de
l’Enseignement Moyen et Secondaire General, DEMSG) gathered key implementation
information coming from the IDENs, related to the implementation of activities at the school


                                               21
level. School principals, teachers and inspectors of the IDEN and IAs monitored the progress of
activities.

30.     The Project supported the preparation of key monitoring reports: (i) the Annual
Economic and Financial Report of the PDEF, which included a review of the expenditures and
carried out an analysis of the education system’s performance in terms of access, quality and
other aspects such as supply and demand, internal efficiency, and equity in the provision of
education services; (ii) the Annual Education Status Report of, which analyzes the performance
of the different education levels; and (iii) other evaluations carried out by the evaluation
department (INEADE) on the implementation of the school projects and the learning assessments
carried out in 2010 and 2012 (Système National d’Evaluation des Rendements Scolaires –
SNERS).

31.    The decentralized levels (IDENs) developed standardized learning outcomes tests to
capture the situation at the schools in their geographic areas at the beginning and at the end of the
school year. The results were shared with the school teachers and the regional inspectors and
were used as guidance tools to define priority areas of intervention. By project completion there
were some regions working together to harmonize the content, the implementation modalities
and timing of the tests.

Utilization
32.     The DPRE has carried out an assessment of the progress in the implementation of the
PDEF at the end of each of its three phases. This exercise allowed for reflection on the
achievements, problems and lessons learned during each phase. This analysis and information
has been used to adjust the activities in support of the program for the following phase. The
DPRE used the monitoring tools to refocus and adjust the project activities. This was the case
with the school projects in elementary and lower secondary schools, which were refocused after
the evaluation of the first phase of the PDEF. The IAs and the IDENs have been using the
standardized tests developed at de-concentrated level as diagnostic tools, to assess the priority
areas to tackle.

33.     Nevertheless, there were shortcomings in the use of the information gathered under the
evaluations at central and deconcentrated level. Both in the case of the INEADE and the IDENs,
there was little sharing of information with the schools, once the standardized tests were carried
out. Before project completion, there had been no systematic efforts to disseminate the results of
the analysis.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.     Financial management: Financial management (FM) throughout the life of the Project is
rated as satisfactory. The Borrower’s team had experience in managing other IDA projects. In
general, the experience of staff in MEN (DAGE) facilitated a satisfactory financial performance.
External annual audit reports were carried out on time, and were unqualified. The Government
implemented the recommendations in the auditor’s report by project completion.

35.   Procurement: In general, procurement was deemed satisfactory during project
implementation. The Project benefited from the capacity built around the procurement team

                                                 22
during Phase I. Thus a well-trained team was in charge of the procurement of the project. The
supervision missions found the quality of the annual procurement plans and the documentation
and organization of the procurement activities adequate. As mentioned in section 2, the main
difficulty revolved around the lack of capacity of the local governments (municipalities) to carry
out the implementation of the infrastructure upgrades at the schools which was resolved by
transferring that responsibility to the regional development agencies.

36.    Environmental and social aspects. An Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) was prepared during appraisal to mitigate the potential negative impacts of
school construction, since the exact location of the schools had not been identified. During
implementation, specific environmental clauses were not required during the bidding process.
There were specific requirements introduced and addressed during the bidding and in facilities
construction related to social concerns (ramps for the handicapped, separation of latrines by
gender) were adequately addressed.

37.    No adverse environmental effects occurred as a result of the construction of secondary
schools. Nevertheless, there were certain aspects during construction that required attention to
ensure standards were followed in managing school construction, such as cleaning the sites after
completing the building of the school as well as landscaping and grading of the terrains around
the schools. The School Construction Department followed up on these shortcomings. In order
to emphasize the importance of the environmental aspects, a collaboration agreement between
the DPRE and regional level of the Directorate for the environment was signed before project
completion.

38.     A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared at the time of appraisal as well.
There were no resettlement issues with regards to the construction of the secondary schools,
latrines, and water points. The land where schools would be built was given by the communities
and the process of selecting the location of the new schools to be built was highly participatory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.     An extensive evaluation of the PDEF was carried out by the CRES, before implementing
a new long-term sector program covering the period from 2012 to 2022. The Government is
incorporating the main findings of the evaluations of the different activities supported by this
project (such as the use of teaching and learning manuals) in the design of the next project.

40.     The Government has taken steps to improve human resources management, seeking a
more efficient use of financial resources in order to free fiscal space to better finance quality
inputs and pedagogical support. In 2009 and 2010 the MEN carried out an audit of personnel.
Another one is being carried out in 2012 with the process being led by the Human Resources
Department with biometric identification.

41.    The Project contributed to further the decentralization and de-concentration process. It is
expected that achievements in this area will continue, with the signature of performance
agreements, based on results improving the management and efficiency of the provision of
education services.


                                               23
42.    The Project financed several studies on higher education which contributed to the
preparation of a project in this sector and on technical and vocational education.

43.     The completion of the Project on June 30, 2012 meant that the national budget was
responsible for providing the resources for the activities included in the Project. At the time of
the implementation and completions results report (ICR) preparation, the Government continued
to provide additional recurrent budget to IAs, IDENs, and schools. However, more resources are
needed to continue to finance all activities that the Project had financed notably: (i) more
pedagogic support at the school level and financing school projects for the new school year; and
(ii) funding some information technology (IT) experts’ positions in the MEN, hired with project
support. The MEN was actively working to provide continuity through the reallocation and
training of human resources, to handle these key tasks.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

44.    The PDO was highly relevant at the time of appraisal and it remains highly relevant
today. The PDO – improving the quality of education, in support of achieving universal quality
primary education for all students (an MDG) – remains the most important objective of the
Government for the sector. The Project supported the current Government’s goal of
implementing a ten-year mandatory basic education program, which merges primary and junior
secondary levels.

45.     The PDO was in line with the CAS (March 2003) and with the subsequent CAS (FY07-
10). It was also aligned with the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (2006-2010).

46.   The Project design was relevant, with an adequate choice of components and sub-
components to achieve the PDOs. The IDA team took into consideration advice provided during
the QER to reduce the number of activities and focus the Project’s interventions in areas of
comparative advantage, in a context where IDA was not the largest donor in the country.

47.    The Project design was based on Phase I (QEFA1). A lot of activities of Phase I were
discontinued and Phase II was more focused on a smaller number of activities in which IDA had
an advantage and other donors were not working. These areas included: improving access to
junior secondary level, supporting activities targeting the schools, training a broad group of
education actors and continuing to strengthen the MEN at all levels.

48.    The implementation arrangements built on the experience of QEFA1. Project activities
were implemented by the technical units of the MEN at the central and decentralized levels. The
PAD and the operations manual (OM) of the Project successfully defined the implementation
responsibilities, which contributed to the timely implementation. The PAD introduced a steering
committee, led by the Minister of Education, which included the DPRE and other directorates,
providing a mechanism and forum to resolve any differences.



                                               24
49.      Weaknesses in design: the capacity of the local governments to implement construction
activities was overestimated and the Results Framework was complicated.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

50.    Since the Project was restructured in 2010 and key performance indicators were changed
or dropped, the achievement of the PDO is measured against the key performance indicators
before and after the restructuring.

Achievement of PDOs before restructuring
51.     Before project restructuring, the achievement of the PDO is rated as moderately
satisfactory. Some of the indicators measuring the progress towards the achievement of the PDO
showed significant progress or had been met: (i) in terms of access, the gross intake rate had
surpassed the end-of-project target (103%); (ii) girls represented more than 50% of enrollments
in 1rst grade (versus a target of 49.3%); (iii) the transition rate between primary and secondary
had surpassed the end-of-project target as well (59.6% versus a target of 57%); and (iv) the
government continued its commitment to the education sector allocating budgetary resources in a
context of financial crisis which allowed the enrollment of students in primary and hiring
teachers. The primary completion rate had increased to 59.6% (versus a target of 78% by project
completion), mainly explained by high dropout rates in 1rst and 5th grades.

52.     The Project activities contributed to these achievements. During this phase of the Project,
some activities were implemented successfully: (i) in terms of quality, the school projects as well
as the regional training and quality improvement plans (PAFs and PAQs); (ii) activities related to
the improvement of the assessment system; (iii) the alphabetization program for young and
adults; (iv) in terms of management, there were steps towards the elaboration of a single
personnel database and the redefinition of functions of the decentralized levels; (v) The data unit
of the MEN (CIME) developed a management tool based on results (SYSGAR), which
represented the initial efforts to measure the performance of each unit based on results.

53.      Nevertheless, there were challenges to implement some activities, key to the achievement
of the PDO. In terms of quality, there were significant delays in the acquisition of manuals with
financing from the Project. In terms of access, there were significant delays in the construction of
secondary schools and the activities to upgrade the schools. The communication between the
central and decentralized level was not as fluid as expected and the coordination among all of the
activities under implementation to improve the quality of learning was weak. Regarding the
strengthening of the management of the education sector, the Performance Frameworks were not
implemented at this stage of the project.

54.     The Government, IDA and other donors agreed that the PCR target established in the
PAD was not going to be achieved by the original closing date of December 31, 2010. The teams
decided to restructure the Project to better achieve the PDO, by extending the closing date,
revising the results framework and refocusing the project activities that aimed at improving
quality.

Achievement of PDO after restructuring


                                                25
55.     After the Project’s restructuring, the achievement of the PDO is rated as satisfactory. The
Project achieved its PDO of improving teaching and learning practices in the classroom in order
to assist the Government in improving education quality while maintaining its focus on reaching
universal primary completion by 2015. The achievement of the PDO was measured by the
following indicators:

Improving access and retention

56.     The improvement of access is rated as satisfactory. The outcome indicators included in
the PAD were mostly achieved and their targets surpassed. The gross enrollment rate (GER) in
primary increased from 79 percent in 2005 to 94.7 percent in 2012. This result is slightly lower
than the 96 percent target indicated in the PAD. The main reason for improvements but not
enough to reach the target GER has been the improvements in the internal efficiency in the
education system. The gross intake rate in the first year of primary increased to 106 percent in
2011-2012 (target of 103 percent). The gender parity index was 1.1 in 2012 in favor of girls,
versus 0.97 in 2005. Finally, the PCR improved significantly (from 48.7 percent in 2004)
reaching 66.9 percent in 2011-2012, surpassing the 65 percent target. Improving retention was
moderately satisfactory as dropout rates in primary improved but fell short of the target set at
restructuring.

57.      Though the improvement in the above-mentioned indicators cannot be solely attributed to
its interventions 2, the Project contributed to the achievement of these outcomes in several ways.
It supported improvements in critical basic infrastructure in elementary schools, through the
construction of 125 water points and 248 six-toilet blocks in existing elementary schools. These
improvements significantly upgraded the schools, transforming them into friendlier spaces. It is
reasonable to infer that these improvements contributed to the enrollment of more girls in
primary.

58.     The Project supported the construction of 28 lower secondary schools, which added a
total of 2,800 new school spaces in the regions of Louga, Matam, Diourbel and Kaolak. Each
school is composed of 4 classrooms, a laboratory and a library, administrative offices, two
blocks of toilets, surrounding walls and a guard booth. The number of enrolled students in these
schools largely surpassed the target goal of 2,800: close to 15,000 students (50 percent of whom
were girls). This activity directly contributed to the improvement of the transition rate between
primary and lower secondary, reaching 88 percent between 2010/2011 and 2011/12 (versus
48.30 percent in 2005). This activity contributed to improving the PCR and the repetition rates in
Cours d’enseignement moyen 1 (CM1) and Cours d’enseignement moyen 2 (CM2) (equivalent to
Grades 4 and 5). It contributed to improving the GER in lower secondary from 33 percent in
2006 to 53 percent in 2011.

59.    The Project supported literacy courses (300 hours) to 53,250 adults (90 percent of whom
were women living primarily in rural areas). This achievement contributed to an increase in
enrollment at all levels and to families’ giving girls more time to do homework at home.

2
 The Government built an average of 1,081 classrooms per year during the life of the project, partially fulfilling the
commitment with IDA (versus a target of 1,500 classrooms per year).


                                                         26
60.    The improvement in the PCR was supported by two other project activities: (i) the
development and implementation of strategies to improve the quality of education; and (ii) the
implementation of remedial summer courses for students in primary and the implementation of
the PAQs prepared and implemented by the IDENs.

Improving education quality, with a focus on elementary education

61.     Improving the quality of education is rated as satisfactory. The achievement of this
objective was to be measured by: (i) a reduction in the repetition rate in primary; (ii) a reduction
in the dropout rate; and (iii) an increase in the transition rate between primary and secondary.
The Project achieved the agreed upon targets. Repetition rates in primary were significantly
reduced from 13.9 percent at the beginning of the Project to 3.2 percent by project completion
(versus a target of 6.3 percent). The dropout rate in primary declined from 13 percent to 9
percent, short of the 5 percent target. The transition rate increased by 40 percentage points as
mentioned above.

62.     Though there were certainly other influencing factors, the Project contributed to these
achievements, financing activities which concentrated on providing and improving learning and
teaching inputs, strengthening its pedagogical use and providing training. The Project succeeded
in improving the quality of education in particular at the primary level and contributed to
strengthening the quality of the skills and services offered by education personnel (IAs, IDENs
and teachers in schools). The project contributed to these outcomes through several
interventions:

At the national level

63.     Acquisition of pedagogical inputs: The project provided support to buy and distribute
pedagogical materials (1,812,000 pedagogical manuals and reading books) to improve classroom
practices for primary level. For the secondary level, it supported the acquisition of 200,000
pedagogical manuals and 202,000 mathematics manuals (or textbooks). IDA support was part of
the combined donors’ efforts to acquire more than 13,000,000 pedagogical materials. The Project
provided resources to 779 schools to establish 3,116 reading corners in 4 classes Cours
élémentaire première année (CE1), Cours élémentaire deuxième année (CE2), CM1, CM2
equivalent to Grades 2 through 5) equipped with 30 books each.

64.     Financing of the preparation of regional training and quality programs (PAQs and PAFs):
The Project financed the development of training activities by the MEN, which were provided in
the context of the regional training and quality programs. The modules concentrated on
improving the use of the pedagogical materials provided to the schools and on accompanying
teachers in the implementation of the new curriculum. The training courses concentrated on:
improvement of reading instruction, provision of pedagogic support to teachers at the classroom
level, focusing on learning assessment, remediation techniques, materials development by school
principals and head teachers. Training modules included leadership and management courses for
school principals and inspectors at the district and regional levels. There were activities to
develop research and action tools at the level of IAs and IDENs to address problems they

                                                27
identified at the district and regional levels, respectively. The ensemble of courses provided was
more oriented to school heads and supervisors than to classroom teachers. There was little
training on specific techniques to improve reading and comprehension, even though this
shortcoming was one of the most critical to overcome to improve learning. A total of 28,200
education professionals received training (an estimated 75 percent were teachers at the primary
level, since the IAs and IDENs did not provide detailed enough information on training
participants).

65.     Training, follow-up and support activities were carried out at the District Education
Authorities (Inspections Departementales de l’ Education Nationale, IDENs) level. The
INEADE evaluated twice the use of these materials in primary school classrooms. These
evaluations showed that the pedagogical manuals were not sufficiently used due an insufficient
training of teachers, an insufficient number of manuals reaching all primary schools and the fact
that the manuals did not integrate the current pedagogical practices.

66.     Improvement of the learning assessment system: The Project contributed to the
improvement of assessments of learning and examination systems, in an effort to provide key
information for the policy makers. The INEADE carried out with project support, two rounds of
national learning assessment evaluations (SNERS) in 2010 and 2012 for Grades cours
préparatoire (CP)), CE2 and CM2. While the evaluations are not comparable due to changes in
the curricula that were made during the life of the Project, the results were and will be used to aid
policy makers adjust activities and interventions.


At the regional level

67.    The Project provided technical and financial support to implement the content of two key
management tools: the PAQs and PAFs. IDA provided financial support for the preparation of
the PAFs, and its implementation at the regional level. It financed in-service training and
classroom observations (carried out by the IDEN’s inspectors) in order to determine how the
learning materials were actually being used in the classrooms.

68.     The Regions, represented by the IAs, prepared regional training plans. These included
activities geared towards improving the quality of instruction and learning. The PAFs included
training on the use of learning materials by teachers; training of school heads, teachers in
elementary and primary schools, staff in the IAs and the IDENs (inspectors, pedagogic advisors
and teacher trainers in regional teacher training centers and in the training of teacher trainers..
The training modules were developed at the national level by the MEN and the actual training for
teachers in the use of the learning materials was carried out in the regional centers.

69.     The Project provided financing to implement the content of the PAQs to improve quality
of education at de-concentrated and school level. These plans were developed as a response to
locally-identified problems related to the low quality of education and to problems identified by
IDENs and IAs. To address these problems, strategies were designed and implemented at the
local level. The PAQs were prepared at the local level and submitted to the central level for
approval. The PAQs received about FCFA 1,055 million (US$2.1 million).

                                                 28
70.     The implementation of the PAQs contributed to the following achievements: trained
school principals in the supervision of teachers; provision of direct didactic support to teachers in
math and language; elaboration of instruments to monitor the learning progress of students and
remedial interventions; development and implementation of standardized tests at IDEN level for
math and reading; provision of technical support to schools with weak learning achievements;
involvement of the communities in activities to reduce dropout and school failure; studies on the
use of mentoring programs by older students; provision of materials to students for pedagogical
reinforcement; elaboration of materials and development of strategies to monitor student
progress that have been generalized. The PAQs had a direct impact on the reduction of dropouts
and school failures, a national priority.

71.    The Project supported the improvement of the assessment system (examinations and
learning assessments) which included the development of standardized tests that students now
take twice a year to monitor progress and to adjust activities at the school level. IDENs created
groups by regions and compared test results. In the case of Pikine in Dakar, the IDEN was
accompanied by evaluation experts supporting the quality of the process.

At the local level

72.     The Project financed the development and implementation of school projects (Projets
d’ecole and Projets d’etablissement for elementary and lower secondary schools respectively).
The school projects supported proposed activities to address quality issues and problems as
perceived in each of the schools. These school projects achieved their objective of helping the
school community to agree and work on a strategy, as identified by the school, to improve
learning and strengthen the leadership of the pedagogical teams. The projects concentrated on
different activities: until 2007, the projects financed improvements in infrastructure and
acquisition of goods in a broader understanding of elements to improve quality. In 2007, after an
evaluation of the school projects during the first phase of the PDEF, the school projects were re-
focused to concentrate on improving pedagogical challenges and improving teaching and
learning, as quality improvement activities. New operational guidelines for the school projects
were produced to achieve the following three outcomes: a reduction in repetition and drop out
rates; an improvement in the results for math, French and sciences; and an increase in the
effective teaching time in schools.

73.      Evaluations of the impact of the school projects on the quality of learning (which was
undertaken 2009 and 2011) on a representative sample of schools showed a positive impact on
students’ achievements. These evaluations showed that the school projects strengthened
achievements in math and French notably in the early grades. The results have shown that Grade
3 students in intervention schools (schools which received the school project grants) performed
substantially better in these subjects than Grade 3 students in control schools. In the south, this
observed difference in performance was large amounting to over 30 percent of a standard
deviation for mathematics and over 40 percent for French. Clearly the program had a large and
statistically significant effect for this group. The report concluded that that a well-targeted
program improving resources for schools (as a permanent increase in school spending) would
likely have an important effect on student performance.

                                                 29
74.     The school principal, teachers and CGEs were trained in the preparation of these projects
by the IDENs. The school projects had an impact in improving quality. These projects supported
the acquisition of pedagogical and non-pedagogical inputs, contributed to make the relationship
with the communities more dynamic, involved the teachers and the CGEs in the quality aspects
of the school, and contributed to introducing and strengthening a culture of accountability and
management of resources at local level, with the main objective of improving the quality of
learning.

Strengthening management at central and decentralized levels

75.    Strengthening the MEN’s management capacity is considered satisfactory. The
achievement of this outcome was to be measured by the following indicators, as modified at
MTR:

   •   An increase in the education recurrent budget as a share of the Government’s recurrent
       budget, excluding the debt service: this indicator was surpassed, reaching 34 percent
       (versus a 33 percent target for 2011).
   •   An increase in the hours of instructional time: this indicator was almost achieved
       reaching 806 hours per school year which was below the 900 hours targeted. This was a
       significant increase from 700 hours in 2005. This was achieved by extending the school
       year and by regularly monitoring the performance of each district in achieving this target.

76.     The Project supported the strengthening of the education management system at the
central, de-concentrated and decentralized levels. It provided support to carry out an analysis and
an audit of the MEN contributing to better define roles and function at each level. The Project
supported the creation of a working group who carried out an organizational diagnostic and
analyzed function and roles of the IAs and IDENs. As a result of this exercise, several
recommendations were compiled in a document identifying the recruitment, training and human
resource needs for the IAs and IDENs. Implementation of these recommendations will deepen
the de-centralization and de-concentration process and improve the quality of human resources at
regional level. The Project reinforced the FM capacity at the IAs by financing an FM officer,
strengthening the capacity in this area. This person was responsible for managing the
contributions by different sources to be used by the IAs and IDENs.

77.     Development and implementation of Performance Management Contracts (PMCs-
Cadres de Performances): The project supported the development of PMCs, supporting the
Government efforts to move to results based performance. By Project completion all Directorates
and Inspectorates (IA and IDEN) had signed performance contracts. The contracts were signed
between the Minister and each of the Directors, including the IAs and IDENs. Contracts started
to be signed in 2010 and finally the DAGE and the DHR signed theirs before Project completion.
Its implementation is contributing to a change in culture towards greater accountability and
capacity to implement results-based management at all levels. The Project supported the
development of an information system to monitor the implementation of the performance
contracts.


                                                30
78.     The Project provided improvements in infrastructure and equipment for information
technology at the central level of the MEN as well as at the IDEN and IA levels. The Project
financed equipment upgrades for the different units. This activity has supported capacity
strengthening at all levels in management and leadership. It provided training for over 800 staff
at central and decentralized level, contributing to the adoption of a culture of IT within Ministry
of education IT Unit (the Cellule Informatique du Ministère de l’ Education, CIME). The CIME
developed different software applications for education management.

79.    The Project supported the MEN in continuing carrying out statistical campaigns and
analyzing the data, surpassing all targets set for this activity. The MEN has made a statistical
digest available and disseminated widely each year. In addition, data were analyzed in the
Annual Education Status Report and the Economic and Financial Report of the PDEF.

80.     The project supported some incipient efforts to improve the management of human
resources. A personnel audit was carried out in 2009 and in 2010 another audit of contractual
staff was carried out, allowing implementing some very limited measures to improve the
efficient use of human resources. Nevertheless, interventions in this area fell short of needs and
expectations.

81.     The Project supported the Government efforts regarding the budget reform in the
education sector, within the country’s overall budget reform program. The project supported
MEN’s efforts in developing and implementing a budget tool Medium term expenditure
framework (MTEF) or Cadre de Depenses Sectorielles à Moyen Termes (CDSMT) based on
programs and results. The main achievements in this area were: (i) the use of a medium term
budget tool, which clearly established a connection between the programs in the budget and their
allocations; (ii) the use of a sector approach; (iii) the introduction of a performance and
accountability culture and greater participation in the budget preparation process; (iv) an
improvement in the visualization of the expenditures in the short and medium term. The CMSDT
contributed to a better link between allocated budget resources to sector priorities as reflected in
the CDSMT.

3.3 Efficiency

82.     A cost effectiveness analysis of the operations within the sectoral context was done at
appraisal in addition to a fiscal impact and sustainability analysis. In the absence of available
data on households’ expenditure, a project economic analysis with a Net Present Value or an
Internal Rate of Return was not conducted.. The current analysis at ICR is focusing on the
project contribution to the government efficiency program in the education sector, the
effectiveness in the implementation of the project, and the externalities and results to which the
project contributed.

83.     The project supported Government’s efforts to improve the efficiency of its education
system notably the primary education and junior secondary education sectors. The reduction of
the repetition rate in primary education, the sharp increase of the transition rate between primary
and secondary education, the reduction of the dropout rate in primary, and reduction of the
average salary unit costs notably in junior secondary has improved the overall efficiency of the
education system by reducing repetition and dropout rates.
                                                31
84.     Cost effectiveness Project implementation has been efficient in delivering the expected
outputs. While 1000 schools were targeted to receive grants, the project provided grants to 1473
schools, junior secondary schools were organized to host more than the 2,800 students targeted
during preparation; 53,000 adults were trained in literacy classes while 50,000 were targeted.
All other expected outputs planned in the project were delivered, and most of the time above the
targets at the exception of the number of additional water points and sanitary blocs due to a lack
of good knowledge of the hydrological situation at the points where the water points were
supposed to be set up. Regarding the unit costs of the construction, the architectural design are
only comparable with the design used under the government budget and USAID. The final costs
show that a junior secondary school costs FCFA105 3 million for USAID project, FCFA98
million for the Government investment budget and for the EFA FTI project, incurring savings of
FCFA 7 million or approximately $14,000.

85.     Social rates of return. The Project contributed to the government agenda of improving
quality and participation in schooling that generated important externalities. An analysis of the
rate of return was done using the 2011 Household Survey. The social return of primary
education is 4.9 percent while the private return is even higher with a rate of 15.9 percent. The
private return of junior secondary is higher at 13 percent. Similarly, social returns in junior
secondary schools are 11 percent, higher than primary education. Analysis of the 2011
household survey shows a positive impact of primary and secondary education on health
outcomes. The infant mortality in 2011 was 97/1,000 for children with a mother without primary
school, 63/1,000 when the mother has primary school, and 36/1000 when the mother has some
secondary school. Similar outcomes are evident for malnutrition or knowledge of HIV-AIDS.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86.    The overall outcome of the project is rated as moderately satisfactory due to the
following:

     •   Relevance was substantial: The PDOs were relevant and remained relevant until Project
         completion. The design took lessons from the implementation of Phase I to improve the
         proposed components and implementation arrangements. Nevertheless there were some
         shortcomings: the design did not adequately assess the challenges to be faced at the time
         of upgrading the schools and the weak capacity of local government (rural
         municipalities) to handle the implementation of the activities; and the results framework
         included too many indicators and some of them lacked a baseline or defined targets;

     •   Efficacy was substantial: (i) The Project contributed to the achievement of the main
         outcomes in terms of increasing access to primary and lower secondary for all students
         and in particular for girls, contributing to close the gender gap; (ii) It contributed to
         successfully implement activities to improve the quality of education and further

  The USAID-financed construction program is managed by the same government entity as for the IDA project. The
difference is the inclusion by USAID of community mobilization funds in the school construction program.


                                                     32
        decentralized the management of education services; (iii) It contributed to build capacity
        by training key actors in the education sector (teachers, inspectors, principals and MEN
        personnel at central, regional and local levels); finally (iv) The Project contributed to
        create a culture of monitoring and evaluation at all levels of the MEN. It supported the
        continuous use of the monitoring and evaluation system to assess the progress on the
        improvement of teaching and learning at classroom level, identify problems and adjust
        activities and policies. It kept teachers, principals, district and regional inspectors as well
        as personnel at central level, focused on quality issues and on achieving results
    •   Nevertheless, the progress towards the achievement of the PDO was moderately
        satisfactory in the early period or implementation, which required a restructuring of the
        Project to better focus some activities and the monitoring and evaluation indicators.
        Annex 10 contains the weighting of the outcomes in the different implementation
        periods.
    •   Efficiency was high: the Project supported the Government’s efforts to improve the
        efficiency of its education system, contributing to the adaptation of key steps to improve
        the use of resources in the education sector and improve planning and performance.
        Project implementation was efficient in delivering the expected outputs.



3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

87.     The Project provided support to improve the literacy of vulnerable populations. The
program financed by the Project benefited around 53,250 adults, 90 percent of them were
women, versus a target of 70 percent, surpassing the target. The alphabetization program had
positive impact on poor rural women. Most of these belonged to small business associations or
economic interest groups, the framework in which they carried out their work. Participants in this
program expressed a high degree of satisfaction mainly due to the benefits the training brought to
the management of their economic activities. In addition, the training had an additional positive
effect on children, whose mothers received more education. The program further built capacity
by training 665 staff as facilitators and 1,110 community members, relying on the local
governments (les collectivités locales) for implementation. The learning outcomes were
measured twice for three of the four cohorts, showing impressive achievements of the
competencies they were supposed to achieve.

88.     The project has supported the Senegalese Government to close the gender gap in primary
and junior secondary schools. Currently, more girls are enrolled and their completion is even
higher than for boys.

89.    The construction of middle schools under the Project took place in poorer regions of the
country, which had a positive impact on gender.




                                                 33
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

90.     The implementation of Literacy activities under the Project contributed to strengthening
and building capacity. The local government institutions worked together with the IDENs to
choose the site to deliver the courses; there was a revision and better definition of the role and
responsibilities and of the goal to be achieved by the program. This allowed the local institutions
to preside over the management committees managing the alphabetization centers, to analyze the
requests and follow up closely the implementation of the courses, and provide proof and
testimony of the adequate and true delivery of the courses. Besides, in the context of this
program, the National Center for Educational Resources (CNRE), created by the Government,
houses since 2009 the coordination and follow up unit (cellule de coordination et de suivi - CCS)
which was a separate unit.

91.     The school projects in primary and lower secondary schools contributed to dramatically
transforming the nature of the relationship between schools and communities. All of the primary
schools and their CGEs were trained in the preparation of school improvement projects. The
schools became closer to their communities, new pedagogical and non-pedagogical tools were
provided to the school, the life of the schools that had receive support from these projects was
revived. The interviews with school principals, presidents of CGEs and IDEN inspectors during
the ICR mission indicated that the school projects have introduced a mentality of results and
accountability.

92.    The financing of the PAFs and PAQs contributed to strengthen the decentralization and
de-concentration process in Senegal. The execution of these instruments facilitated the transfer
of financial resources to the regional and district levels, from the central level to the de-
concentrated levels. This enabled IAs and IDENs and eventually the schools, to conceive,
develop and implement a set of activities (based on their own and first-hand knowledge of
challenges and needs) to improve the quality of teaching and learning. Allocations between PAFs
and PAQs are included in Annex 2. Activities to train teachers and supervisors absorbed 70
percent of the budget and classroom observations received 30 percent, putting strong emphasis
on the use of the learning materials as a vehicle to improve learning. The PAQS and PAFs were
prepared by all of the IDENS and IAs. The process of elaboration and implementation greatly
contributed to build capacity at regional and local level. The themes and areas to strengthen the
capacity of the teaching force were relevant and in line with the needs identified by the
inspectors.

93.     The training provided to the MEN staff at the central and decentralized levels on IT
contributed to create a culture of information and technology, led by the MEN’s data unit.
Around 800 staff received training on IT and internet, as well as specific training on management
tools. All directors, heads of departments (around 100 leaders) at the MEN received training on
the use of laptops and professional email, which contributed to improving team work and
communications. Staff at the IDENs, DAGE and DHR working on personnel issues received
training on the software used to generate salary reports.

94.    Finally, the Project supported the strengthening of the education management system
through the support to the upgrade in hardware and software of the MEN. In particular, it
contributed to better management of the resources of the education sector through the
                                                34
development of software and tools to generate reliable and updated information on personnel,
schools, and the implementation of programs, such as the PDEF.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There were no other unintended outcomes or impacts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
n.a.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

95.        The risk to the development outcomes is considered low due to the following reasons:

       •   Strong Government commitment, as shown in the new letter of development policy and
           the preparation and approval of a new long term education sector plan 2012-2022;
       •   The Project supported the Government PDEF and it was implemented by the technical
           units of the MEN that strengthened their capacities;
       •   The annual budget has increased since 2002 and is being sustained;
       •   Strong donor support of Government sector priorities; and
       •   Strengthening of the institutional capacity at all levels – central, regional and local.

96.     Nevertheless, at the time of the ICR the lack of enough budgetary resources available to
finance teachers’ support all activities by IAs and IDENs, quality enhancing activities at school
level and IT personnel at the MEN posed a challenge to sustain achievements made under the
Project. The Government has committed to train MEN personnel to take up these positions and it
was gradually fulfilling this commitment at the time of project completion.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

A detailed rating following OPCS guidelines is in annex 10.

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

97.     The IDA team worked closely with the Borrower during the preparation phase. The team
built on the experience of preparing and QEFA1. The team worked in coordination with other
donors active in education (USAID, Agence Francaise de Développement (AFD), Japan, CIDA,
etc) to harmonize the activities in support of the PDEF. During preparation, emphasis was placed
on the participation of stakeholders and the decentralized levels, overcoming a weakness of the
preparation of Phase I. The IDA team took into account the recommendation of the QER panel



                                                  35
which contributed to focus the Project activities. In general, the IDA team overestimated the
implementing capacity of the local government.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

98.     The performance of the IDA team is rated as satisfactory throughout the life of the
Project. The IDA team was led by two task team leaders TTLs and the transition was smooth as
the new TTL had been part of the preparation team. IDA carried out regular missions and these
were well staffed.

99.     The supervision team was country-based and collaborated closely with the Borrower to
adjust and re-focus the project activities when necessary, showing flexibility in order to support a
successful implementation. After the MTR, the IDA team worked with the Borrower to
restructure the Project, paying attention to the quality of the monitoring indicators and the
feasibility of following up on these regularly, within the context of the M&E context. It focused
on addressing the construction issues by involving the ARDs to carry out works supported by the
Project.

100. Furthermore, the team worked with the Borrower to extend the closing date of the
Project, in light of the time needed to implement activities and use the credit resources.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

101.   The overall rating is satisfactory due to the Bank’s:
   •   Good dialogue with the Borrower;
   •   Quality of preparation and coordination with other donors;
   •   Frequent supervision missions and good documentation to illustrate progress and
       monitoring;
   •   Flexibility to work with the Borrower to achieve the PDOs; and
   •   Leadership role in guiding donors’ support in terms of developing strategies and M&E as
       well as in involving other donors at all stages.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

102. The Government showed strong commitment to the policies and objectives in the PDEF
which were supported by the Project. During the period 2007-2012, it annually increased the
budgetary resources, supporting the increase of the expenditures on education as a percentage of
GDP. The Government carried out in a timely manner all of the necessary actions to enable the
project to start implementation and to be extended. Finally, the Government complied with all of
the activities agreed upon in the framework of the Project, falling short only in the construction
of new classrooms in primary and largely exceeding in junior secondary.
                                                36
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

103. The MEN was responsible for project implementation. The DPRE was in charge of the
technical aspects of the Project and the DAGE was responsible for the fiduciary aspects. The
DPRE coordinated with other key directorates (Directorate of Primary Education, Directorate of
Secondary Education, Directorate for School Construction, INEADE, CIME) to ensure that the
execution of activities was in accordance with the OM for the Project and on time.

104. The regional levels of the MEN were responsible for implementing a significant part of
the quality improving activities. The IAs and the IDENs participated actively in the development
and execution of activities to improve quality. Despite some delays in gathering and presenting
documentation and in having a better communication among themselves and with the central and
local levels, they performed adequately, taking advantage of the instruments provided by the
Project to develop plans, activities and evaluation tools.

105. The performance of local governments was weak in terms of procurement. Nevertheless,
implementation was transferred to the RDAs which had experience and had worked with an
IDA-financed project, the National Program for Local Development, who then handled the
procurement and implementation responsibilities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Borrower’s performance is rated satisfactory due to the its:

   •   Strong commitment to the PDOs;
   •   Adequate budgetary support to implement the PDEF and the Project;
   •   Good dialogue with the IDA team;
   •   Continuous involvement of the Minister and Directors in the MEN; and
   •   Strong participation of the IAs and IDENs.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

106. PAFs and PAQs were useful and effective instruments in supporting innovative strategies
and approaches developed at the local level to improve the quality of education. They were
perceived as effective instruments to achieve this objective. An example is the support provided
to undertaking standardized tests developed by the regions. It might be useful to provide further
technical support by evaluation experts to exploit the potential of these assessments.

107. School projects strengthened the involvement of teachers in aspects of school
management. These projects introduced a culture of planning and accountability. The
improvements which included providing clear guidelines related to quality education, including


                                                37
its features, indicators that should be used to measures quality aspects, and identifying processes
for identifying problems and implementing strategies were critical for the Project’s successes.

108. It is crucial to continue to provide support for classroom observations as a way to
improve teaching. This tool was an important innovation in identifying the training needs of
teachers. It served to ensure that the training received was then was utilized at the classroom
level. Following up by providing additional teacher support and pedagogical inputs was an
effective way of addressing any problems that had been identified. This observation tool can
now be improved and used as a way to monitor and improve teaching techniques at the regional
and national levels and possibly shared with other countries in the region. Follow up activities
should focus training on ways that identified constraints can be addressed to improve student
learning in the classroom, particular among poor students.

109. More training for teachers should focus on preparing teachers to carry out activities to
improve reading and language skills. More activities within the PAFs and PAQs to support the
acquisition of reading and language skills should be considered in the future as reading and
mastery of language are key tools for understanding the content of other subjects (Math and
Science). More activities should have concentrated on improving classroom practices and
teaching and learning of key core subjects, which would have translated into better learning
outcomes.

110. Strong Government commitment is crucial for the achievement of the PDOs. A strong
commitment from the Government is a major force behind the success of a program or a project.
In the case of Senegal, the Government sustained this commitment by annually providing
resources to enable the implementation of policies and activities and worked closely with the
donors to harmonize their financial support behind the country’s defined priorities. Despite
changes in Minister of Education, there was clear leadership and increased capacity in the key
directorates in charge of implementing the project activities (DPRE, DAGE, DEE, etc.)

111. Regular monitoring and evaluation of a program or a project contributes to the
achievement of sought outcomes. The MEN, through the DPRE and the INEADE, regularly
carried out monitoring activities to follow closely the progress of activities, to gather feedback
from actors and beneficiaries and to adjust an activity when necessary. It commissioned
independent reviewers as well, such as CERSS, to evaluate the MEN and its activities. The
PDEF was assessed at the end of each phase, before starting a new one, in an effort to extract and
apply lessons in the future. At the local level, follow up activities had a similar role and were
considered essential by inspectors, teachers and principals in making changes at the school level
and in the classrooms.

Component III – Strengthening management of the Education System.

This component succeeded in supporting the strengthening management of the education system.
The Project financed activities to: (i) support institutional reforms in the education sector; (ii)
support the implementation of budget reforms in the context of the medium term budget
framework; (iii) improve the collection and analysis of data; and (iv) efforts to improve the
management of human resources. The main achievements and outputs of this component were:

   1. The creation of a working group to carry out a diagnostic of the MEN, the IAs and
      IDENs, in order to reorganize the decentralized levels of the MEN, strengthening their
      capacity and aligning them with their functions and responsibilities;
   2. The elaboration and signature of Performance Frameworks by all of the Directorates at
      central level, the eleven IAs (regions) and forty three IDENs (districts) in the MEN. An
      information management tool – SYSGAR - was developed to support the efforts to
      implement a results-based management system;
   3. Hiring financial officers for the regional structures, contributing to strengthening the
      management capacity of the increasing amount of resources transferred to the regional
      and district levels;
   4. Elaboration of an audit of human resources in 2009 and an audit of contractual personnel
      in 2010;
   5. Support for the implementation of the medium term budgetary framework (CDSMT);


                                                  45
6. Development of software in the areas of budget, personnel management, school
   management among others. CIME developed several IT education management tools, in
   collaboration with others (UNESCO, DPRE, DEMSG): (i) CODECO, a tool to provide a
   code to the schools; (ii) FINPRONET, a tool for financial management which allows
   management of the budget in real time, manage the procurement process and the
   expenses among; (iii) SYSGAR, a web-based tool based on results-based management
   for planning, monitoring and evaluation, which was key to monitor the implementation of
   the PDEF; (iv) PLANETE: a tool to improve the administrative and pedagogic
   management of schools at all levels; (v) GESTYLCO, a tool that allows to capture
   information on secondary schools at the beginning of the school year on the building,
   personnel, students, examinations, etc; (vi) PETTAO, an intranet portal which allows the
   administrative staff of the central and decentralized levels (about 3,500 people) to share
   information; (vi) FUP, the single personnel file, which has allowed improvements in
   personnel management;
7. Provision of hardware and software for the central, regional and district levels of the
   MEN: around 1,200 computers (desktops, laptops and servers) were acquired for the
   directorates at central level. Each of the 11 IAs received ten desktops, two laptops, three
   printers, one server, one router and one switch. Each of the 43 IDENs received five
   desktops, one laptop, three printers, one server and one switch. The central buildings of
   the MEN and of the Ministry of Technical Education were upgraded to connect the
   computers provided to intranet and internet and among themselves through WIFI. The
   Ministry of Education data unit was equipped with 13 servers and one fiber optic
   connection to the Government’s intranet;
8. Training on IT to around 800 staff working at the central level and at the regions and
   districts. Specific training was given to staff working on different areas such as statistics
   management, salary reports; financial management of the PDEF; etc.

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A cost effectiveness analysis of the operations within the sectoral context was done at appraisal
in addition to a fiscal impact and sustainability analysis. In the absence of data on households
‘expenditure, the project economic analysis with a Net Present Value or an Internal Rate of
Return was not carried out. The current analysis at ICR is focusing on the project contribution to
the government efficiency program in the education sector, the effectiveness in the
implementation of the project, and the externalities and results to which the project contributed.

The project supported Government’s efforts to improve the efficiency of its education system
notably the primary education and junior secondary education sectors. The reduction of the
repetition rate in primary education, the sharp increase of the transition rate between primary and
secondary education, the reduction of the dropout rate in primary, and reduction of the average
salary unit costs notably in junior secondary has improved the overall efficiency of the education
system by reducing repetition and dropout rates.

Cost effectiveness Project implementation has been efficient in delivering the expected outputs.
While 1000 schools were targeted to receive grants, the project provided grants to 1473 schools,
junior secondary schools were organized to host more than the 2,800 students targeted during
preparation; 53,000 adults were trained in literacy classes while 50,000 were targeted. All other
expected outputs planned in the project were delivered, and most of the time above the targets at
the exception of the number of additional water points and sanitary blocs due to a lack of good
knowledge of the hydrological situation at the points where the water points were supposed to be
set up. Regarding the unit costs of the construction, the architectural design are only comparable
with the design used under the government budget and USAID. The final costs show that a
junior secondary school costs FCFA105 4 million for USAID project, FCFA98 million for the
Government investment budget and for the EFA FTI project, incurring savings of FCFA 7
million or approximately $14,000.

Social rates of return and externalities. The Project contributed to the government agenda of
improving quality and participation in schooling that generated important externalities. An
analysis of the rate of return was done using the 2011 Household Survey. The social return of
primary education is 4.9 percent while the private return is even higher with a rate of 15.9
percent. The private return of junior secondary is higher at 13 percent. Similarly, social returns
in junior secondary schools are 11 percent, higher than primary education. Analysis of the 2011
household survey shows a positive impact of primary and secondary education on health
outcomes. The infant mortality in 2011 was 97/1,000 for children with a mother without primary
school, 63/1,000 when the mother has primary school, and 36/1000 when the mother has some
secondary school. Similar outcomes are evident for malnutrition or knowledge of HIV-AIDS.

  The USAID-financed construction program is managed by the same government entity as for the IDA project. The
difference is the inclusion by USAID of community mobilization funds in the school construction program.

The QEFA2 is the second phase of a sector operation that provided technical and financial
support to the ten-year education sector program of Senegal (Programme décennal de
l’éducation et de la formation, PDEF, 1998-2009). The first phase was successfully
implemented and the triggers to pass to the second phase were all met. The QEFA2 contributed
to the achievement of several objectives. First, to achieve the Millenium Development Goals
related to gender and education. Second, it supported the Government strategy to reduce poverty
by developing human resources and emphasizing education. Third, the Project was in line with
the country assistance strategy’s objective of reinforcing the national capacity and to improve
access to social services. The Project started in 2006 and it was completed in 2012. The
beginning of implementation coincided with the adoption by the MEN of a program approach
and donor harmonization to coordinate their activities. The Project supported the Government to
face the main challenges in the education sector in a sustainable manner.

MAIN PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
ACCES
The Project contributed to the achievement of the objectives of the PDEF. It contributed to the
construction of 28 secondary schools, as foreseen. This contributed to the enlargement of the
secondary schools network in the country, which increased from 853 schools in 2006 to 1542 by
Project closing. The Government partially fulfilled its commitment of building classrooms per
year, reaching 1,081 classrooms annually (versus a target of 1,500). The construction of secondary
schools contributed to improve the transition rate between primary and secondary education (from
60,1% to 88,4%, between 2006 – 2011).

Access indicators overall improved during the life of the Project: (i) The gross intake rate in first
grade of primary improved markedly; (ii) Gross enrollment rate improved significantly (from 79%
at the beginning of implementation to 94.1% in 2012) though below the project’s target. This
result should not be considered underperformance, since it is the result of the reduction of the
repetition rates in primary; (iii) the gender parity has improved both in primary and secondary
levels.

The synergies generated by the implementation of several strategies contributed to the
achievement of these results. Namely: (i) the implementation of a policy to support transition
between primary and secondary education; (ii) the development and the implementation of
performance contracts between the IAs, IDENs and the DEE; (iii) the implementation of
strategies to improve quality and internal efficacy, through the summer remedial courses during
the vacation break and the action plans prepared by the IDENs. All of these strategies were
supported by the Project.

There were significant achievements in the non-formal education sector with the support of the
alphabetization programs which allowed 53,250 beneficiaries to receive alphabetization courses.
90% of them were women (versus a target of 70%) and most of them belonged to associations or
economic activity groups. The beneficiaries were highly satisfied with the courses because they
perceived direct benefits related to the management of their income generating activities.

The activities carried out to upgrade schools through the construction of 248 sanitary blocks and
125 water points contributed to improve the school environment and to improve the enrollment
of girls.

QUALITY

The Project supported the acquisition and distribution of 1,812,008 teaching manuals and the
acquisition and distribution of 202,000 Mathematics manuals for secondary level. Around 779
schools received resources to create reading corners in 4 classes (CE1, CE2, CM1 and CM2) in
each school (a total of 3116 reading corners).

The project financed 1,473 school projects in primary schools (versus a target of 1,000) and 86 in
secondary schools. These projects contributed to the improvement of the quality of teaching and
learning in the schools benefitted. The schools projects contributed to make the schools more
dynamic, to provide pedagogical and non-pedagogical inputs, to bring the communities closer to
the schools and to improve the management of resources at local level to benefit teaching and
learning. An evaluation was carried out in 2009 provided evidence of the positive effects of the
school projects on student learning.

The implementation of quality action plans and regional training programs (PAF and PAQ) by the
IAs and the IDENs: (i) fostered the de-concentration efforts; (ii) guaranteed in-service training for
28160 teachers, principals and key personnel of the education system, improving their
competencies; (iii) supported local initiatives to resolve local problems; and (iv) maintained
working relations among key actors in the system. The PAFs and PAQs contributed to reinforce
transferring financial resources to the regional and district levels, allowing them to receive
resources to conceive, develop and implement activities and strategies to improve the quality of
education. Between 2008 and 2011, a total of 2.2 billion CFA were transferred to the de-
concentrated levels to finance the PAFs and PAQs activities.

In an effort to improve the quality of learning, the project supported remedial courses over the
summer for students with academic difficulties: in 2010, 11,802 students with academic
difficulties and 12,144 in 2011 in grades CI and CM1 received courses in reading and Mathematics
in the IDENs of Parcelles Assainies, Pikine, Tivaouane, Mbour, Kébémer, Louga, Fatick, Kaolack,
Bambey et Diourbel. Learning assessments were done at the beginning and end of the program. In
2010, the success rate in CI went from 40% to 66% and from 51% to 75% respectively in French
and Mathematics. In 2011, similar positive results were observed.

All of these Project’s activities have given positive results, such as the reduction in the repetition
rate in primary which went from 13.9% at the beginning of the Project to 3,5% in 2012, surpassing
the target of 6,8%.

MANAGEMENT
The Project provided support for: (i) institutional reforms at the MEN; (ii) improving human
resource management; (iii) implementing budgetary reforms in the framework of the medium term
budget framework; (iv) improving the collection and analysis of data and communication. As

results of the Project’s support: all of the Directorates at central level, IAs and IDENs had signed
performance contract and the successful statistical annual campaigns were carried out.

Reorganization of the Ministry of Education

The project provided support to establish a working group with international support to reorganize
the IAs and the IDENs. As a result, new legal texts were produced reorganizing these structures in
order to make them more modern and aligned with their missions and to prepare a program to
reinforce their structures.

Financial Management

The QEFA2 contributed to the strengthening of financial management through the de-
concentration of financial resources to the IAs. The resources from different donors were directly
allocated to the IAs and they were managed by Financial Officers hired and trained under the
Project. The Project financed several financial software applications for accounting and budget
management, personnel management, school management and team work, among others. The
QEFA2 financed the hardware IT equipment of the Ministry of Education at central and de-
concentrated levels (IAs and IDENs). More than 800 staff at the central level (including
representatives of unions that intervene in the teacher’s rotations and administrative staff of the de-
concentrated levels received training.

Difficulties faced to implement the Project
    School construction and upgrades experienced delays due to the lack of enough
       companies to carry out these activities and delays during the procurement process;
    Regarding the PAF and PAQ , it is worth pointing out that:
               Budgetary constraints limit the continuation of the training, the positive
                  implementation of some of the planned activities together with the lack of
                  implementation of other planned activities due to a shortage of time. The main
                  consequence of on implementing according to the planning meant that some
                  key aspect of the training lagged behind schedule;
               Logistical constraints, such as limited transportation and carburant, are the main
                  obstacle to a close follow up of the activities ;
               Delayed technical and financial data collection and processing after the
                  implementation of activities;
    Difficulties in the implementation of the procurement plan due to the lack of technical
       specifications on time, insufficient trained staff, amount of work and conflict of interest.


Factors with an impact on Project implementation
    Resistance to the traditional education services: the implementation of the policy of
      universal education faces resistance among certain groups in areas of the country where
      the religious schools are dominant. In some areas, the construction of traditional schools
      is very recent. Thus, the demand for education must be better dealt with, with the
      following actions: (i) reinforce the creation of French-Arab schools, and (ii)


                                                 54
       communication and sensitization campaigns to improve and foster access to education
       services.
      The location of certain schools in certain zones means a delay in construction and the
       reality that these will remain remote and distant from more populated areas.
      The de-concentration of financial management and the transfer of funds to the regional,
       local and school levels, allowed better grass root and community involvement and the
       establishment of a transparent governance and consensus building..
      The involvement of the grass root communities in those areas where the schools
       benefited from the school projects (projets d’établissement) ;
      The Government’s compliance with the commitments agreed with IDA.

Lessons learned
    The adequate performance (functioning) of the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms
      and the use of those results had a strong influence of the performance of the Project.
    Re-invigoration of grassroots and community organizations (des Organisations de
      Comité de Base) especially women organizations, through the improvement of activities
      that contributed to increase their revenues;
    Improvement of the pedagogical practices through a systematic implementation of the
      teacher training programs;
    Improvement of the learning achievements to meet a minimum standard level for the core
      disciplines of the curriculum ;
    Limit to a maximum of four the number of secondary schools (collèges) to be built by
      each company given their capacity in an effort to avoid delays in construction;
    The need to identify activities and foster ownership in a timely manner;
    The need to elaborate on time a procurement plan;
    The need to continuously reinforce the capacity of key actors, through continuous
      training and knowledge update (mise à jour des connaissances);
    The importance of archiving documents in matters related to procurement activities;
    The follow up of payments, disbursements and delivery of goods and services.

The Project was restructured in 2010 to better achieve the PDOs. At the time of restructuring, the
rating for development outcomes was moderately satisfactory. The restructuring left the PDO
unchanged and modified key performance indicators. In particular, it lowered the target for the
Primary Completion Rate indicator (from 78% at the end of 2009 to 65% at the end of 2011).
Though there had been progress in increasing the primary completion rate since the beginning of
implementation, it was perceived by the Government, IDA and other donors that the target
established in the PAD was not attainable. The main reasons were the high dropout rates in
grades 1st and 5th.

Several indicators were dropped because they lacked baselines or specific targets, were not being
monitored or were not as relevant in measuring project outcomes.
