The project will do this by: (a)\n            improving both access and retention by expanding the number\n            of middle school places in the system, improving conditions\n            in existing elementary schools, and by supporting additional\n            literacy courses; (b) improving education quality, with a\n            focus on elementary education; and (c) strengthening\n            management at central, deconcentrated and decentralized\n            levels to ensure attainment of PDEF (Programme Decennal de\n            l'Education et de la Formation) objectives. The\n            modifications requested at this time are related to: (i) the\n            extension of the closing date for the International\n            Development Association (IDA) credit and the PHRD grant;\n            (ii) the reallocation of project funds among categories and\n            components; (iii) a refocus on activities that aim at\n            tackling the main internal inefficiencies and quality\n            issues; and (iv) the revision of the results framework by\n            reducing the number of indicators by dropping those that are\n            not monitored and by fine-tuning others."}, "docdt": "2010-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
