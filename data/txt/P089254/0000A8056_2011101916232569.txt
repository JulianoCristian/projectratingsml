                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project objective is to improve teaching and learning practices in the classroom in order to assist the Government in improving education quality while
                         maintaining its focus on reaching universal primary completion by 2015. The project would do this by: (a) improving both access and retention by expanding
                         the number of middle school places in the system, improving conditions in existing elementary schools, and by supporting additional literacy courses; (b)
                         improving education quality, with a focus on elementary education; and (c) strengthening management at central, deconcentrated and decentralized levels to
                         ensure attainment of PDEF objectives.
