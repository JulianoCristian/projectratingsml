The project will do this by: (a)\n            improving both access and retention by expanding the number\n            of middle school places in the system, improving conditions\n            in existing elementary schools, and by supporting additional\n            literacy courses; (b) improving education quality, with a\n            focus on elementary education; and (c) strengthening\n            management at central, deconcentrated and decentralized\n            levels to ensure attainment of PDEF (Programme Decennal de\n            l'Education et de la Formation) objectives.
