                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project objective is to improve teaching and learning practices in the classroom in order to assist the Government in improving education quality while
                         maintaining its focus on reaching universal primary completion by 2015. The project would do this by: (a) improving both access and retention by expanding
                         the number of middle school places in the system, improving conditions in existing elementary schools, and by supporting additional literacy courses; (b)
                         improving education quality, with a focus on elementary education; and (c) strengthening management at central, deconcentrated and decentralized levels to
                         ensure attainment of PDEF objectives.

                         Regarding the improvement in the quality of education, the repetition rate indicator has met the target of 6 percent against 13.9 percent baseline. The success rate for middle school
                         examinations has shown strong progress moving from 35 percent in 2009 to 47.5 percent in 2010. The number of hours of instructional time has progressed from 700 to 822 hours
                         with the end of project target at 900 hours. The Government has consistently allocated adequate recurrent budget to sustain the development of the education system overall and
                         basic education in particular. Regarding internal efficiency, while the repetition rate decreased sharply during the last year, but the dropout rate remains high at 10 percent inducing a
                         stagnating primary completion rate.

                         In 2010-2011, the Government has implemented policy measures to improve quality and efficiency: (i) with the delivery of two-month summer courses to underperforming students,
                         (ii) the implementation of performance management frameworks with local education authorities (IA and IDEN) that subcontract with school directors to improve learning and
                         internal efficiency; (iii) full implementation of a new curriculum for grade 1 to 6 ; and (v) an effective implementation of a ten-year compulsory basic education strategy achieving a
                         transition rate from primary to junior secondary of 95 percent in 2010. The outcomes of these interventions will be available by December 2011 when all school data for 2010 will be
                         made available. As a result of the project restructuration and a close supervision and implementation support from the task team, the disbursement ratio increased between August
                         2010 and February 2011 from 51 percent to 79 percent.
