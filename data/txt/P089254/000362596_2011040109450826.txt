against Vulnerability of Children and Youth Project dated January 19, 2011.  Please note 
that the capitalized terms used in this letter (Amendment Letter) and not defined herein

It has come to our attention that the Closing Date of the Agreement coincides with

“3.03. 
Withdrawal Period.
 
The Closing Date referred to in Section 3.06 (c) of 
the Standard Conditions is June 30, 2012.” 
 
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and 
dating this Amendment Letter in the spaces provided below.  Henceforward, all other 
provisions of the Agreement, except as amended through this Amendment Letter shall 
remain in full force and effect.  This Amendment Letter shall be executed in two 
counterparts each of which shall be an original.
