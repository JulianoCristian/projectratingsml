                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project objective is to improve teaching and learning practices in the classroom in order to assist the Government in improving education quality while maintaining
                         its focus on reaching universal primary completion by 2015. The project would do this by: (a) improving both access and retention by expanding the number of middle
                         school places in the system, improving conditions in existing elementary schools, and by supporting additional literacy courses; (b) improving education quality, with a
                         focus on elementary education; and (c) strengthening management at central, deconcentrated and decentralized levels to ensure attainment of PDEF objectives.

                         1. Relevance of the project objective: the project objective supports the Government's goal to achieve the MDGs of universal primary education for all. Furthermore, the project's
                         relevance is enhanced with the government's new goal of putting in place t a compulsory ten-year basic education program, merging primary and junior secondary levels. The project
                         continues to be aligned with the Government's poverty reduction strategy and the World Bank country assistance strategy.

                         2. Design: The design was appropriate but some shortcomings are noticed. In many aspects, the project built on the design of the first quality education for all project. It used the
                         same implementation arrangement with the regular government structures at local and deconcentrated levels in charge of the technical and fiduciary aspects of the project. However,
                         the results framework was too complicated with numerous key performance indicators which were sometimes different from those in the legal agreement or in different section of the
                         Project Appraisal Document. The second shortcoming was related to implementation arrangement for construction of additional facilities by local government without assessing the
                         capacities of these structures to implement the project; at the MTR, these construction activities had not started any action started for that activity. The project was restructured to
                         change implementation modalities moving the responsibility to carry out activities from local governments to Regional Development Agencies that had the necessary capacity to
                         effectively implement the construction program. The results framework was also simplified.

                         3. Implementation: Overall project implementation is l satisfactory. We can assess implementation by looking at two phases of the project; he first phase is from project start to MTR
                         when implementation was slow accompanied by low disbursement. The MTR coincided with a change in the TTLship and the project was restructured and t implementation support
                         reinforced. As a result, the implementation accelerated and disbursement picked up. Overall, the Government was able to satisfactorily coordinate and implement the project both at
                         central and deconcentrated levels which was essential for the success of the quality and management components. Since the MTR, the Regional Development Agencies are
                         adequately managing the construction of water points and toilets in rural areas. The capacity of the Ministry to manage its sector program, shift management responsibilities to
                         regional inspectors, and work with multiple stakeholders and donors has been strengthened. The Directorate of Planning and Education Reform (DPRE) coordinated the entire
                         education ten-year program. Meetings are regularly organized within the Ministry and with inspectors and progress reports prepared and discussed with stakeholders. The
                         Construction Directorate (DCS) satisfactorily delivered the junior secondary schools construction program. The DAGE adequately managed the resources in terms of financial
                         management and procurement and reinforced the Education Regional Authorities (IA and IDEN) to manage all deconcentrated activities. INEADE regularly delivered the learning
                         assessment survey and the analysis of the ongoing learning assessment for 2011/12 school year will be available by end of October 2012 and will inform the next phase of the
                         Government's education sector program. Despite these positive developments, , the Primary education directorate (DEE) was not always successful in coordinating all of the various
                         initiatives in the field aiming at improving the quality of learning and most likely its organization and capacity will need to be strengthened as so many donors are working at this level
                         of education in Senegal.
                         4. Changes: The Project Development Objectives (PDO), project components and implementation arrangement remain unchanged. The project was restructured after MTR to
                         introduce the following modifications:

                         Extension of the closing date: The project closing date for the IDA credit and PHRD grant was extended from October 30, 2010 to December 31, 2011 and to June 30, 2012.
                         Results/indicators: the results framework was modified as following: (i) a revision of the end of project target for the primary completion rate indicator. The initial target was 78% and
                         the new one is 65% ; (ii) the revision of the indicator related to the share of the government budget allocated to education in order to align it with the EFA benchmarks; (iii) reduction in
                         the number of indicators by dropping those that had no baseline and targets and are not monitored or are less relevant to measure the project outcomes.

                         Components: One change was introduced into the sub-component " block grants to schools and local education structures" to include an activity aimed at providing additional support
                         to students experiencing learning difficulties in math and reading during the summer vacation with the involvement of civil society organizations.

                         Institutional arrangements: Local Governments were supposed to implement component 1.a that aims at constructing 170 water points and 300 six-toilet blocks in existing elementary
                         schools. At mid-term review, the implementation of this sub-component had not started due to low capacities of local level. So Regional Development Agencies of Diourbel, Kaolack,
                         Kaffrine, Louga, Thies and Saint-Louis were granted the responsibility for the implementation of the subcomponent.

                         II.      Efficacy

                         The project has achieved or exceeded most of the expected outcomes in terms of access to education, gender equity, quality improvement and management strengthening.
                         However, minor shortcomings are as follows:.

                         (a) improving both access and retention by; (i) expanding the number of middle school places in the system, (ii) improving conditions in existing elementary schools, and by(iii))

                         The project has met or exceeded many of the results targets, particularly with regard to primary education access. The grade one intake rate in 2012 is 106 percent, exceeding the
                         first end of project target of 103 percent but did not met the new target of 121 percent that was set at revision when the first target was exceeded. The primary completion rate has

                         improved from 48.7 percent in 2005 to 66.9 percent exceeding the end of project target of 65 percent. All gender targets in primary, junior secondary and secondary schools have
                         been exceeded. Currently more girls than boys are enrolled at primary level. The Gross enrollment rate improved significantly from 79.9 percent to 94.7 percent but is just shy of the
                         end of project target of 96 percent. This was mainly achieved due to the Government appropriate implementation of the teacher recruitment program. When the recruitment of 2500
                         teachers per year was planned, the Government recruited an average of 3572 new teachers per year. The Government has constantly allocated adequate recurrent budget to
                         develop the education sector by recruiting enough staff. At secondary level, the construction of 28 junior secondary schools with the IDA-financed project in addition to those built with
                         its own budget and USAID funding contributed to increase access to secondary education. 28 junior secondary schools were constructed for the creation of 14,947 places instated of
                         2,800 planned. Regarding the adults literacy program, 53250 people (90 percent female) were trained against a target of 50,000 participants (70 percent female). The building of 248
                         latrines and 125 water points to improve conditions in existing elementary schools are expected to be completed by project closing.

                         (b) improving education quality, with a focus on elementary education;

                         The indicators demonstrate positive performance. The repetition rate indicator decreased from 13.2 percent to 3.2 percent, exceeding the end of project target of 6.3 percent. The
                         transition rate from primary to junior secondary schools improved from 46.3 percent to 88 percent exceeding the end of project target of 57 percent. The dropout rate decreased from
                         13.9 percent to 9 percent but did not meet the end of project target of 5 percent. According to a recent survey, the main cause of dropout is the need for children in poor families to
                         support their parents in their work. The improvement in the quality outcomes indicators were supported by the appropriate implementation of the quality improvement component
                         notably regional education authorities quality improvement actions plans at the district and school level the schools grants that support quality improvement pograms at schools ,
                         the summer schools for nonperforming students, and the learning materials supply and distribution.

                         The regional education authorities quality improvement actions plans (PAFs and PAQ) are plans designed by the Inspections d'Academie (IA) and the Inspections Departementales
                         de l'Education Nationale (IDEN) to achieve the quality improvement goals at local regional and district levels. The IDA-financed project provided block grants to these structure and
                         technical assistance to implement these plans that are mainly focusing on in-service teacher training, quality management and supervision, and local innovations for quality
                         improvement. These plans were constantly financed over the lifetime of the project and 28,160 teachers and local education managers were trained and various innovations financed.

                         Blocks grants were provided to schools to support their quality improvement initiative. While 1000 schools were targeted, 1473 received grants from the project. These grants were
                         managed by school management committees including teachers, students and the local community. An impact evaluation was carried out. The preliminary results have shown
                         positive impact of the initiative on student achievement. The report will be finalized and the findings will be used in the ICR. In addition,Senegal implemented satisfactorily the dated
                         covenant that aimed at providing funding to schools to financed quality improvement inputs.

                         Learning materials were purchased and provided to schools. Overall 1.8 million primary textbooks and 202,000 junior secondary textbooks were distributed to students. PAFs and
                         PAQ were used to train teachers to improve the effectiveness in the utilization of textbooks in classrooms practices. INEADE is carrying out an assessment to see if there is any
                         improvement in teachers competencies in the use of learning materials in classes compared to the assessment done in 2008, just after the project started. In addition, the project

                         financed the provision of reading areas to 779 schools that received each 30 reading books for each of the four classes of CE1, CE2, CM1, and CM2. Overall 3116 reading areas
                         were installed.

                         An innovative summer school program was designed and implemented to provide remediation courses to non performing students at grade 1 and grade 5 where repetition and drop
                         out was very high. More than 23,000 selected students attended during the summer of 2010 and 2011. This initiative was introduced at MTR and was co-managed with civil society
                         organization. As a result, 58 percent at first grade and 61 percent at grade 6 move from nonperformers to good performers.

                         (c) strengthening management at central, deconcentrated and decentralized levels to ensure attainment of PDEF objectives.

                         Regarding the improvement in the management of the sector, Senegal continues to allocate an important proportion of its budget to the education sector. In 2011, the Government
                         spent 34 percent of its recurrent budget on education against a target of 32 percent; the proportion of the education recurrent budget allocated to the primary school cycle was 46

                         percent - below the target of 50 percent. However, the primary education level received more resources than expected because the entire education budget in nominal terms was
                         higher than initially planned and the primary school level received an amount higher than expected. These developments are explained because tax revenues in Senegal increased
                         over the time period of the project (from 18 to 21% ). On average, the Government spent CFAF409 billion per year when FCFAF371 billion were planned. The number of hours of
                         instructional time has also progressed from 700 hours in 2005 to 813 hours in 2011 (end of project target is 900 hours). The Government is implementing an action plan to improve

                         that indicator and the final results achieved will be known at the end of the school year.

                         The project was decisive in strengthening the education management system at central, deconcentrated and decentralized levels and is explained by the following actions

                         (a)       To improve the accountability and results-based management at all levels, the project supported the development of performance based-contracts between the Minister on
                         one hand and Directors and Inspectors on the other hand. These contracts are changing the management culture in the MOE from an input oriented to a more results oriented one.
                         All Directors and 14 IAs have signed a contract each. The IT unit (CIME), with IDA funding developed an IT application, the SYSGAR, for the management and the monitoring of the
                         contracts.

                         (b)      Modernization of the budget management: The project has supported the ministries in charge of the education sector to results-based budget and a Medium term-
                         expenditure framework. The project supported the training of staff involved in budget preparation to better align the government expenditure with the strategic objectives, equipped
                         budget managers with computers at all levels both at central and deconcentrated levels, and provided technical assistance. With the support of the CIME, the MOE deve loped a
                         budget management application that links the MOE, the IAs and the MOF. So, the budget management moved from a paper-based process to an IT based one which has influenced
                         the Ministry of Finance to adopt and extend the application to all ministries in Senegal for the budget management. Currently, the MOE staffs are proving technical assistance to the
                         MOE of Guinea that is planning to implement MTEF in its system.

                         ( c) The project supported the MOE to be a highly performing department in terms of data production and analysis for decision making. While the project indicator was to successfully
                         conclude the annual statistical campaign by April of following school year, the MOE is now completing the statistical campaign during the same school year. In addition, the education
                         statistics are analyzed in a yearly education Country Status Report discussed with all stakeholders during the joint annual review. In addition to the production of the statistical
                         yearbook, the project provided support to INEADE to conduct regular leaning assessment at central level (every two year) and yearly and lighter deconcentrated learning
                         assessments implemented by IAs.

                         (c)     The project support the IT Unit (CIME) fully supported by the project has contributed to the transform the management culture and the efficiency in the management of the
                         system. IT equipment and software are developed and used to improve the internal communication, the budget management, the data collection and analysis, and several other
                         areas. Currently, the MOE is one the more IT user in the country.

                         (d)       One of the major outcomes of the project is the reinforcement of the education management in IAs and IDENs. The project support IAs and IDEN to develop their regional or
                         district education development plans of which are extracted academic training plans or quality improvement plans financed by the project. The project moved the management of
                         many resources from the center to the field. By doing that, the project empowered local education authorities to be more responsible in managing the education system, be closer to
                         the client and improve the service delivery. The project recruited financial management specialists in each region to help strengthen the resources management at regional level.
                         These specialists are now responsible for the management of IDA funding, FTI project, and many other donor interventions that follow the IDA project initiative to move the

                         management of resources from the center to the field.
                         ( e) However, the project was not able to improve the efficiency of teacher management systems and procedures. Although the policy dialogue during the project implementation
                         led government to stop of the non transparent and parallel recruitment of teachers, management systems are still inefficient with a large proportion of teachers in unnecessary
                         administrative positions and a large proportion of teachers recruited centrally

                         III.      Efficiency

                         The project has delivered all expected outputs and has sometimes exceeded the quantity planned.
                         -         28 junior secondary schools are delivered as planned for more than 14,000 students when the project expected them to host 2,800 students. The quality of the
                         infrastructures is good according to the assessment done by an independent architect.
                         -         53,250 learners attended adults literacy when the project planned 50,000.

                         -        More textbooks than planned were supplied and distributed.
                         -        The training of teachers has is decentralized with responsibility to local authorities using lower unit costs compared to when the training programs were managed centrally.
                         -        The project financed summer classes for 23,000 nonperforming primary students while this activity was not included in the budget at appraisal.
                         The project did not deliver the number additional water facilities with initial budget. Given that the unit cost of each well depends on several factors, the most important being the
Public Disclosure Copy




                         depth the water table, it is difficult to predict total costs. In some dry areas, often a planned depth of 12 meters became +100 meters and the unit cost would increase by 5 or 6 times
                         the forecast cost. .When the total budget is fixed, the number of wells will be less than envisaged.

                         The project demonstrated efficiencies in a number areas which will be analyzed in more depth in the ICR and include:

                         -        Lower Repetition rates and increased transition rates has lead to a decline in the cost to educated 1 primary school graduate

                         -        The development of management software has improved the efficiency of decision-making and interministerial coordination as well as the time and quality of sector statistics

                         IV.      Risk to development outcomes:

                         The project supported a government policy and strategy that are reconfirmed with the new letter of development policy. It used the government's own structure to implement the pr
                         oject, and there is a strong ownership. The main risk that should be addressed is to make sure that the Financial management specialist at IA level and the contractual IT specialists
                         in the CIME financed by the project will be maintained with government or other donors resources. Otherwise, all activities depending on them will be in jeopardy. The MOE has
                         developed an action plan to fill these positions with qualified civil servants.
