           Transport Project for Chile were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was uncertain, Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            availability of sufficient financial resources for\n            satisfactory implementation of a project can be ensured\n            through favorable macroeconomic conditions, sound\n            macroeconomic policies and adequate sectoral allocation of\n            budget resources. Satisfactory project implementation is\n            fundamentally determined by adequate project design, which\n            should be kept as simple as possible within the complexities\n            of the sector and of the project objectives. Inherent\n            institutional weaknesses identified during project\n            preparation should be dealt with not only by requiring\n            fulfillment of action plans and key indicators, but also by\n            establishing w ell-designed and clearly formulated loan\n            covenants. In addition to the performance of tasks related\n            to general project administration and problem solving,\n            planning, and budgeting of supervision missions should\n            provide sufficient time in the field to allow adequate\n            supervision and quality control of works execution."}, "docdt": "1997-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
