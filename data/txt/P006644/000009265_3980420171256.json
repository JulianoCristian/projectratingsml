of a 5\n            year rehabilitation and maintenance program to bring streets\n            back into a condition of maintainability; (ii) construction\n            and evaluation of a pilot segregated bus/tramway in Santiago\n            to demonstrate less costly alternatives to future expansion\n            of the metro system; (iii) construction and evaluation of a\n            pilot bikeway to demonstrate the feasibility of this mode of\n            transport in Santiago; (iv) implementation of traffic\n            management measures including bus priority lanes in Geater\n            Santiago, Greater Concepcion, and Greater Valaparaiso to\n            reduce congestion and pollution; and (v) studies, technical\n            assistance and training to improve the planning,
