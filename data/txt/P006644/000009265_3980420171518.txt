MEMORANDUM AND RECOHIIENDATION OF THE PRESIDEtlT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR AN URBAN STREETS AND TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for US$75.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years with five years
of grace and interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
2.        Background.  Chile is a highly urbanized country with over 802 of
its 12 million people concentrated in cities where approximately 75Z of the
country's GDP is produced. Because of the urban areas' economic dominance
and population concentration, an objective of the Government of Chile is
improvement in the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the delivery of
essential urban public services, including urban transport. Urban
transport modes in Chile include private vehicles, privately-operated bus
systems, a privately operated trolley >uis system in Valparaiso, a
government-owned metro system in Greater Santiago, and some bicycle use
(wliich the government is encouraging), with public transport accounting for
over 701 of trips nationwide and 85Z in Greater Santiago. Pricing and cost
recovery are adequate. Approximately 552 of the gasoline used is imported
and gasoline prices are set at or above international rates; buses and
taxis are privately operated and fares are ostensibly market driven. The
only publicly operated transport mode (metro) presently covers all
operating costs and will become an operationally and financially
independent entity in 1989. Analysis of total public revenues attributable
to the national transport sector (licenses, fuel tax, etc.) indicates a
surplus over public costs associated with providing transport services.
The majority of these revenues is derived from the urban sector.
3.        Major issues affecting the provision of cost-effective urban
transport services in Chile are primarily institutional in nature.
*          Inadequate planning and maintenance, poor intermodal integration within the
urban transport system, and insufficient traffic management, have led to:
(a) widespread congestion; (b) increased vehicle operating costs:
(c) higher accident rates; (d) loss of productivity; and (e) high levels of
pollution. Chile has no stated urban transport policy within wlhich to
evaluate the appropriateness of operations or investments and. despite
efforts in the past, there is little integration of programs among the
numerous public and private agencies involved in the sector.  To improve
investment analysis and coordination. the President of tho Republic created
the Urban Transport Commission (CTU) in 1982 to evaluate and *coordinate
policy and investment. This commission, however, has been largely bypassed
in sector operations as Government agencies have continued to view urban
transport not as an integrated system but as a collection of discrete modes
of travel and have often ignored the need fir coordinated planning and
implementation of programs. Also, with ss a exceptions such as the
Executive Secretariat of the Urban Transport Commission (SECTU), agencies



and personnel responsible for plarning, evaluation, operation. and
maittenance of the system have not kept abreast of modern management and
analysis techniques. Part of the Government's current strategy in the
sector is the development of an acknowledged urban transport policy and
facilitation of SECTU's involvement in evaluation and integration of
investments and programs essential to implementation of this policy.
4.        While Chile's urban transport sector suffers from an array of
problems. urban street maintenance and rehabilitation is an especially
critical issue affecting all aspects of the system including traffic flow,
vehicle operating costs, and fuel efficiency, as well as representing a
stibstantial investment of public funds. Urban streets (only about 501 of
which are paved) are deteriorating rapidly due to ineffective pavement/
maintenance management and years of deferred maintenance. The Ministry of
Public Works has developed a strong interurban road maintenance program
with assistance from Bank loans. Urban streets, however, are the
responsibility of the Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (MINVU) through its
regional agencies, and have been largely ignored as MINVU concentrated on
housing issues. (The Municipality of Santiago, the small central area of
Greater Santiago, is an exception. It is the only urban area in the
country responsible for maintenance of its own infrastructure). Air
pollution is a serious problem in Santiago and preliminary results from
studies currently being carried out by the Government (funded by IDB)
indicate a major cause is particulates from diesel engine emissions and
poorly maintained and unpaved streets.
5.        Project Rationale.  The proposed urban transport project is an
integral part of the Bank's assistance strategy to Chile which seeks to
resl)ond rapidly to wide swings in economic circumstances that affect the
country's external equilibrium. This strategy is built upon a blend of
adjustment operations, time-slice financing of public investments, and
conventional projects addressing the objectives of export diversification,
infrastructure maintenance, poverty alleviation, and capital market
development. An adequate and efficient infrastructure system is necessary
to facilitate production and provide access to low-income segments of the
population to services and employment. Efforts to reduce external debt and
promote economic growth, however, have required austerity in public
spending. Acknowledging this, the Government asked the Bank to (a) assist
in the development of an institutional capability to manage effectively
urban street maintenance and rehabilitation in the future; and (b) to fund
a program to bring the system back to a condition of maintainability, thus
enabling an efficient use of scarce maintenance funds. In response to
demands for expansion of the metro system, this project would demonstrate
the technical, economic, and financial viability of less costly exclusive
bus/tramways to accommodate demand and reduce government public transport
costs. This is a key element in the Bank's policy of cost recovery in the
urban transport sector and would serve as an example throughout the region
of implementation of the most cost-effective solution. Implementation of
the project will result in reduced fuel usage and air pollution thus
supporting the Bank's strategy in Chile for amelioration of the impact of
declining petroleum reserves, as well as help to reduce environmental
pollution. Based on the Bank's urban transport strategy for the region, it
is a first step toward a more systemic, integrated urban transport
approach.

6.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are
to: (a) strengthen institutional capabilities to plan. manage. and maintain
the urban transport svstems in the country in a cost-effertive manner:
(b) preserve the national investment in urban street infraqtrur-ture:
(c) facilitate the integration of urban transport elementc. redure
congestion. and contribute to a reduction in air pollution: and
(d) demonstrate the efficiency of alternative public transport modes.
7.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project would consist of:
(a) development of cost-effective urban street pavementlmaintenance
management systems in each of the country's 13 regions and implementation
of 5-year rehabilitation and maintenance programs to bring streets back
*          into a condition of maintainability (82% of project costs):
(b) construction and evaluation of a pilot segregated bus/tramway in
Santiago to demonstrate less-costly alternatives to future expdnsion of the
metro system (7%); (c) construction and evaluation of a pilot bikeway to
demonstrate the feasibility of this mode of travel in Santiago (12);
(d) implementation of traffic management measures including bus priority
lanes in Greater Santiago, Greater Concepcion, and Greater Valparaiso to
reduce congestion and pollution O8X): and (e) technical assistance,
studies, and training to improve the planning, operation. and maintenance
of the urban transport system (2Z). The project, to be carried out over 5
years, provides funds for civil works. equipment. technical assistance,
training, and studies. The urban street maintenance components, as well as
overall project administration, will be the responsibility of MINVU. The
public transport and traffic maaagement components will be implemented by
the regional governments assisted by SECTU. SECTU will also provide
technical evaluation and coordination for all elements of the project.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$150 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$75 million (50%). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Chile are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7627-CH dated February 9, 1989, is also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions:  (i) implementation of organizational changes in MINVU and
transfer of necessary personnel to develop and implement an adequate
maintenance program; (ii) MINVU will prepare and submit to the Bank for
review its annual street maintenance and urban street improvement programs
(including rehabilitation) at least 60 days prior to the applicable fiscal
year: (iii) separate street maintenance accounts will be created, pavement/
maintenance management systems will be implemented in each region. and
sufficient funds will be allocated annually to carry out an adequatp
maintenance program; (iv) the Bank will be advised of anv urbLan transport
investment exceeding US$10 million in the project area during the prnject
implementation period, provided information on the impact of such
investments on the Bank project, and given adequate opportunity to comment
on such investment prior to its commencement. Execution of any major
investment that would adversely affect the Bank project or undermine its
strategy would constitute grounds for suspension of disbursements; (v) as
part of the Santiago Urban Transport Study, the Government will prepare
recommendations for sector policy, strategy, organization, operation, and



- 4 .
i-vordination/regulation. Theise rec'nmendations will lie developed during
the first 18 months of the priject, reviewed with the Bank, and an action
plan developed. This study. as well as all studies in the projzct, will be
carried uut and reviewed with the lank in accordance with an agreed upon
schedule: (vi) to maintain a policy of full cost-recovery in the transport
putblic sector: and (vii) any land acquisition will be done in accordance
with Bank guidelines.
9.        Benefits.  Deterioration of the urban street infrastructure would
be reduced, the cost-effectiveneos of providing maintenance would be
improved, and vehicle operating costs lowered by implementation of
pavement/maintenance management jystems throughout the country as well as
the implementation of five-year rehabilitation and maintenance programs.
Regular maintenance and street paving will also improve access to public
transport in low-income areas, and provide permanent employment
opportunities for unskilled labor. Cost-effective alternatives to
expansion of the metro system would be demonstrated.  Pollution from
particulates would be reduced by the improved maintenance programs and
paving of unpaved streets. Traffic management would improve vehicular
flow, reduce fuel consumption, lower vehicle operating costs, and reduce
vehiele emissions. Training and institutional strengthening will ensure
continuity in the delivery and cost-effectiveness of urban transport
services and serve as a catalyst in the development of a "systems" approach
to the planning and management of urban transport. The internal economic
rate of return is 262.
10.       Risks.  The primary risk to successful implementation of the
project and achievement of objectives is in institutional development.
This project represents the first step toward a truly integrated approach
to urban transport management; consequently, lack of institutional
cooperation couid cause delays. During project preparation, guidelines for
cooperation and interaction were developed and all agencies have now worked
well together. An interministerial committee was established within the
Urban Transport Comission to review and resolve issues regarding project
selection and development and other matters that might affect project
implementation. Past institutional weaknesses within HINVU (i.e. the low
priority given to the subsector) have been addressed through reorganization
and transfer of qualified personnel into appropriate positions. Technical
assistance will be provided to assist the director of the new roads
subdepartment to organize and initiate the program of road planning,
construction, and maintenance. Training would be provided to strengthen
ministry personnel--all of which should minimize the institutional risk.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
