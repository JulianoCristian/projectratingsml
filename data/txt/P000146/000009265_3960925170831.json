In general, the Bank performance was\n            good. Of particular importance and benefit was the\n            Bank's cooperation in accelerating the administrative\n            processes at project commencement, and its willingness to\n            provide retroactive financing relations between the Borrower\n            and Beneficiary, the Consultants and the Bank were at all\n            times excellent. The Borrower and Beneficiary the Water\n            Utilities Corporation (WUC) is a small, highly efficient,\n            compact organization with a dedicated staff determined to\n            maintain the highest possible standards. In summary, the\n            Project has met its physical goals, some progress has been\n            made in management development, but the objectives were not\n            clearly specified In numerical terms in the appraisal\n            report. The Government of Botswana and WUC have fulfilled\n            all the covenants under the Guarantee and Loan agreements."}, "docdt": "1988-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
