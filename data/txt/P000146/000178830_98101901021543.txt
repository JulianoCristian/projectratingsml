BOTSWANA
THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND WASTE DISPOSAL SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      Botswana, which has an area of about 582,000 km2 (225,000 sq.
mi.), is landlocked and is bordered by Zimbabwe, the Republic of South
Africa (RSA), Namibia, and Zambia. Botswana occupies the central portion
of the great plateau of southern Africa and the ground surface, which is
relatively flat, averages about 1,000 meters (3,000 ft.) in elevation.
1.02      The climate is continental and semi-arid with an average annual
rainfall of 475 mm which is highly erratic and unevenly distributed. 1/
Precipitation is seasonal, mostly occuring during the period of November
through April. Temperatures generally range between 5CC and 38°C with wide
diurnal variation particularly evident during the "southern" winter months
(May through October).
1.03      The population of Botswana, mainly situated in eastern Botswana,
was 935,000 according to a 1981 census and is increasing at about 3.5%
annually. Although the urban population comprises only about 16% (resident
in five towns, Gaborone, Lobatse, Francistown, Selebi-Phikwe and Orapa),
the country has one of the world's highest urbanization rates, currently
close to 12% per year.
1.04      The rangeland of Botswana basically consists of a number of bush
and tree savannah types. In only about 5% of the surface area of Botswana
do adequate rainfall and suitable soils occur together to provide potential
for arable agriculture.
1.05      Intensive, large-scale prospecting for minerals has begun only in
recent years. Commercially exploitable deposits of diamonds, copper-nickel
and coal have been brought into production at Orapa, Selebi-Phikwe and
Morupule, respectively. A third diamond mine has just been put in
operation at Jwaneng.
Water Resources
1.06      Although Botswana's total water resources are fairly substantial
2/, due to their unfavorable location and/or variability in occurence, the
country is effectively water deficient. Surface water, representing over
85% of the total resources and of good quality, occurs mainly in the
Okavango River located in the north and, to a lesser extent, in border
rivers. Except for the Limpopo and its tributaries located in eastern
/ Average annual rainfall ranges from 250 mm in the southwest to more
than 650 mm in the northeast.
2/ The total annual resource, though not well documented, has been
estimated at about 21 billion m3 of which approximately 18 billion m
is surface water and about 3 billion m3 is ground water.



- 2 -
Botswana, they are little utilized. Surface water located elsewhere,
although more accessible, is ephemeral and small in volume (representing
less than 5% of all surface water).
1.07      Although ground water is believed to underlie much of Botswana,
these resources have not been fully investigated. The majority of existing
boreholes are located in the eastern part of the country where 90% of the
population is located. The country has over 5,000 registered boreholes,
and the number of unregistered boreholes is estimated at 50% of this
figure. Shallow wells are much smaller in number. Yields of individual
boreholes are small 3/ and natural water quality in some areas is
unacceptable for human consumption due to high salinity. Many of the wells
are unuseable during extended drought periods due to lowered water levels
and the small storage capacity of individual aquifers. Further, due to the
nature of the aquifers and to inadequate control of the
disposal of waste from livestock and/or humans, high nitrate concentrations
and serious fecal bacterial contamination exists in ground water underlying
many villages and certain of the towns.
1.08      In recognition of increasing water demands in the eastern portion
of the country, the Government of Botswana (GOB) recently investigated the
feasibility of developing supplies from several potentially attractive
sources. The first of these studies, which was financed by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), concerned transfer of water from the
Okavango Delta to potential areas of demand. The studies concluded that
such a transfer is unlikely to be economic in the foreseeable future. The
practical limitations are that the demand must be either close at hand or
very large and concentrated. A second study, financed by the African
Development Fund (AfDF), concerned the feasibility of water development in
northeast Botswana. Several attractive schemes were identified in this
study including that of the just completed Second Water Supply
(Francistown) Project financed by the World Bank. A third study by the
Department of Water Affairs (DWA) of the Ministry of Mineral Resources and
Water Affairs (MRWA) investigated the feasibility of developing supplies
from principal sand rivers of eastern Botswana. Findings of this study
indicate that sand rivers have potential mainly as supplies to villages and
other minor demand centers.
1.09      Water resources studies relevant to the proposed Third Water
Supply Project (Gaborone) have been:
(i) "Water Resources Reconnaissance of lower Metsemotlhaba and
lower Ngotwane River" prepared by B.G.A. Lund and Partners,
RSA, 1977.
(ii) "A Reconnaissance Study for Major Surface Water Schemes in
Eastern Botswana", prepared by Sir Alexander Gibb and
Partners, 1977.
(iii) "Gaborone Water Resources, Review of Alternative Development
Options" prepared by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, 1981.
3/ Only 17% of all wells are yielding more than 2.5 litres per second, and
typical depths range from 30 to 100 m.

A complete list of all documents relevant to the project is available on
the project file.
Sector Legislation
1.10      Various Parliamentary Acts dealing purely with water sector
issues, legislated between 1956 and 1970, together with the Tribal Land Act
of 1968 and the Town and Country Planning Act of 1977, provide adequate
legislative instruments.   However to further improve the situation
Government have invited SIDA to study all existing water legislation and
obligations covering domestic and international water regulation. The
studies are in progress and will also include recommendations for
necessary amendment of legislation to deal with the evolving water
needs and establish controls for the management of Botswana's own national
water resources and common international water resources. During
negotiation, Government agreed to make the studies available for Bank
review and comment prior to introducing legislative changes. (Guarantee
Agreement Section 3.02).
Sector Organization
1.11      Four different ministries are active in the sector.  Two of
these, the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Water Affairs (MRWJA) and the
Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL), have principal roles while
the Ministry of Works and Communications (MWC) and the Ministry of Health
(MOH) have minor roles. Given the size of the population and existing high
level of service coverage, the present organizational and institutional
arrangements are satisfactory.
1.12      MRWA, through the Department of Water Affairs (DWA), is concerned
with Botswana's total water resources and their development. It collects
and maintains hydrological and hydrogeological records, plans and
implements water supply projects in rural areas, designs, constructs,
equips and, in certain instances 4/, operates and maintains village water
supplies. It also registers new boreholes, monitors ground water
production and, ground water pollution, administers special water resource
investigations and provides technical training to its own staff and to
village water supply operator candidates recruited by the District Councils
(DCs). Another department of MRWA, the Geological Survey Department (GSD),
through its Hydrogeological Division, is responsible for locating and
evaluating the country's aquifers and assisting in the development of
ground water resources. The Water Utility Corporation (WUC), a parastatal
4/ The DWA is responsible for operation and maintenance of water supply
systems in large villages (with populations larger than 7,000
persons). Water supplies for smaller villages are turned over to the
DCs for operation and maintenance upon completion.



- 4-
body under MRWA, is responsible for water supply in urban areas 5/.The
performance of WUC, which will be responsible for project implementation,
has been fully satisfactory (see Chapter IV).
1.13      MLGL has responsibilities both in rural and urban areas.  In all
urban areas except Orap 6/, MLGL is responsible for the preparation of
town development plans including provision for water supply. However, WUC
provides MLGL with planning input relative to water supply and is also
responsible for the implementation of water supply schemes.
1.14      In urban areas, large water supply projects are prepared and
designed by consultants, and financed mainly by bilateral and multilateral
agencies. Construction is by contract. Smaller urban projects generally
are prepared and designed by staff of the responsible government agency.
In such instances, funding is frequently provided by Government and
construction is by force account. In rural areas, planning and
implementation of village water supply projects normally are accomplished
by DWA staff although, due to staff constraints, consultants are sometimes
used for preparation and design.of larger projects. Financing has been
provided mainly by bilateral assistance agencies, and construction is
normally by force account.
1.15      MLGL is also responsible for sewerage, drainage and sanitation,
both in rural and urban areas. Large urban projects are usually designed
by consultants, constructed by contractors and financed by Government loans
to the Town Council. Once constructed, the sewerage and sanitation systems
together with the refuse collection and disposal are operated by the Town
Councils.
1.16      MOH currently has no primary role in the sector but is
responsible for: (a) health education, (b) maintenance of health
statistics, and (c) monitoring of environmental sanitation. MOH has
developed a substantial network of health facilities including clinics and
health posts which are well distributed in both rural and urban areas. The
health posts are staffed by family welfare educators. A National Health
Institute in Gaborone trains junior health personnel while a Health
Education Unit, also in Gaborone, promotes health education in general.
5/ In Botswana, only towns characterized by significant trade and/or
industry are considered as urban. Currently, five towns meet this
classification, viz., Gaborone, Francistown, Lobatse, Orapa and
Selebi-Phikwe. Although some villages have larger populations than the
towns, they are officially classified as rural since they are oriented
toward subsistence agriculture. The only exception to WUC's operation
of urban supplies is Orapa, where the mining company runs the supply.
6/ In Orapa, these responsibilities are met by a diamond mining
concessionaire.



-5-
Cost Recovery
1.17      Government policy requires that urban water supplies be
financially self-supporting whereas rural water supplies are subsidized.
In urban areas, other than Orapa, WUC charges for all water supplied based
upon metered consumption. Customers with private connections are charged
directly while the town councils are billed for standpost deliveries for
which they, in turn, levy a flat rate charge on individual plots dependent
upon standpost supplies. Water users taking delivery through public
standposts receive a partial subsidy in the form of a cross subsidy from
other water consumers.
1.18      In rural areas, the DCs charge only those consumers   having
private water connections with the charges based upon metered consumption.
Water tariffs are determined by the operating agency, with the approval of
the concerned ministry.
1.19      Charges for sewer service are based on full cost recovery.  Fees
are collected through the property tax levied by the town councils on those
plots receiving such service. In site and service areas where the town
councils provide for sanitation such as the substructures of the pit
latrines and are responsible for emptying of pit latrines, costs are
recovered through a monthly service levy.
Manpower and Training
1.20      The appraisal report for the second water project drew attention
to the severe countrywide shortage of technical manpower in all sectors
which necessitated substantial recruitment of expatriates, mainly
professional but also higher levels of sub-professionals. Government was
aware of the situation but appreciated that increased localization was
dependent on the pace of general education improvement and the availability
of suitably qualified Batswana. The Banks' second education project,
appraised in 1979, was directed to improving the country's supply of
skilled manpower. Understandably this is a long term project and benefits
will take some time to become apparent. Consequently the water supply
sector continues to experience the problem associated with the shortage of
adequately educated Batswana candidates available for training beyond the
level of craftsmen and operators. For the time being Government has to
rely on expatriate assistance, mainly financed from bilateral sources, to
staff and manage the Department of Water Affairs, which assists the
District Councils to manage and operate rural water schemes.
1.21      The Geological Survey Department, which is responsible for
monitoring the country's water resources, provides in service training for
cartographers and technical assistants. The training continues to be
provided by bilateral funded expatriates and equipment.
1.22      Staffing and training for WUC is better managed than the Sector
as a whole. However WUC is also still heavily dependent on expatriate
management and operating staff notwithstanding the existence of a sound
training policy and program. A full description of the existing training
program and the status of implementation is given in paras. 4.08 to 4.11.



-6-
Present Service Levels
1.23      Over 90% of the urban population has access to piped water
supplies. Until recently, the water supply coverage in rural areas was
relatively low, about 30%. The situation is now much improved through an
active program which is mainly financed by SIDA and in 1982 the coverage
has reached 68% of the rural population (mainly from ground water
sources) which is high by African standards 7/.
1.24      Water service in urban areas is generally good.  Approximately
60% of Gaborone and Lobatse water consumers have private connections while
in other urban areas the percentage is substantially less than that (e.g.
Francistown 13%). Remaining water consumers are served from public
standposts. Service levels in the major villages where water systems are
operated by DWJA, generally are higher than those in the minor and small
villages, where water systems are operated by the DCs. Design criteria for
the major villages (Population 3000) currently require supply capacity
averaging 40 lcd and water points located no further than 400 m from any
consumer. Design criteria for smaller villages are similar although, in
some instances, supply capacity requirements are based on 20 lcd. These
criteria are reasonable.
1.25      In urban areas, piped wastewater systems are limited to high
and medium cost housing plots, and institutional, commercial, and
industrial properties which have piped water supply . Treatment is by
waste stabilization ponds. For other urban water consumers with private
connections but outside the sewer system septic tanks are generally used.
For water consumers using standposts, sanitation facilities are limited to
pit latrines. More sophisticated 8/ on-site sanitation units have been
tested in two-year pilot study on low-cost sanitation recently concluded by
IDRC. However, difficulties have been encountered with these units due to
relatively high construction costs and/or poor performance. At present
only single and twin pitlatrines are constructed.
1.26      Sanitation facilities in rural areas if existing, are generally
pit latrines.  Due to poor sanitation practices in some rural areas and in
Francistown, ground water quality has been badly degraded. This situation
is often compounded by poor practices in siting and constructing boreholes.
Service Level Policy
1.27      Government analysis of the District Development Plans (1977)
showed thlat water supply was rated the highest priority. Accordingly the
Government has adopted the following policy in the National Development
Plan 1979-1985:
(i) reduce drudgery and improve health levels by keeping existing
water supplies operating, installing new water supplies as to
reach all villages by 1985 and by action against pollution;
7/ In northern Zambia only 40% of the rural population have access to
wells and boreholes.
8/ Aqua privy and Reed Odorless Earth Closet.



(ii) provide adequate domestic water to urban areas without subsidy
and assist the growth of productive employment for Botswana by
providing the water required for industry and mines.
1.28      Health care has also been given high priority in the Fifth
National Development Plan. Elements listed as essential for attaining an
acceptable level of health are adequate food and housing, safe water, basic
sanitation, health education and immunization against communicable diseases
as well as appropriate treatment of diseases.
1.29      Through its integrated water supply program the Government
intends to cover the presently unserved rural village population by 1988.
Although all major villages already have existing water supply systems
covering almost 100% of their population, many of the system capacities are
now inadequate due to low original design criteria and high population
growth. In addition, some small scale industries have established their
plants in villages and the Government's policy is to support this
development in order to reduce the very rapid growth in the urban areas.
Rehabilitation and extension of these works are planned but these are
dependent on the development of additional water sources which are being
studied under the South East and Central Eastern Botswana Study. It is
probable that it will not be possible to serve nomadic rural population,
about 8% of the total rural population, under the decade plan.
Sector Development
1.30      Sector Development accelerated after independence in recognition
of the need for water supply to support urban and mining development, and
with the initiation of large-scale efforts to improve village water supply
systems. The majority of these expenditures were met through external
assistance with the main donors being SIDA (mainly for the
implementation of rural water supply schemes), the United Kingdom (UK), the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the World
Bank Group. Urban water supply projects were completed in the towns of
Gaborone, Lobatse, Selebi-Phikwe and Francistown. In rural areas, water
supply schemes were completed in 145 major and medium-size villages, thus
increasing the percentage of rural population served from less than 5 (at
independence) to about 68.
1.31      About P 100 million (US$90 million) of expenditures are planned
for urban water supply schemes up to year 1988. Projects underway or
proposed include water supply extensions for the towns Francistown,
Selebi-Phikwe, Jwaneng and Lobatse and major water supply plants for
Gaborone (raising of the Gaborone Dam under this project and future
construction of two smaller dams at Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba). In rural
areas the planned expenditures of P 57 million (US$51 million) are for the
completion of water supply schemes in 209 minor villages and the
rehabilitation and extensions of water supply schemes in 17 major
villages. For details of the sector investment programme see Annex 1.
1.32      The NDP includes a relatively small sanitation component which is
not separately identified but included as parts of other programs, most of
which are to be implemented through MLGL. These include sanitation and/or
sewerage studies for Francistown, Gaborone, Lobatse and Selebi-Phikwe.



-8-
Possible Constraints
1.33      Training of skilled manpower, particularly that associated with
maintenance and operation, are critical to the success of the rural water
supply program. In urban water supply the Government is largely dependant
on expatriate managers and engineers and localization in this area is
making only slow process. The provision of funds to finance the ambitious
rural and urban water supply programme poses an increasing problem for the
GOB. Water resources in the estern part of Botswana are scarce and it will
be more and more difficult to provide the rapidly increasing population
with water at affordable prices.
Previous Bank Group Projects
1.34      Five Bank Group projects have assisted sector development in
urban areas. A US$3 million credit was made in 1971 for the
Gaborone-Lobatse Water Supply Project (Credit 233-BT) which was completed
in mid-1974. All project objectives were achieved and one of the more
important accomplishments of this and the following Shashe Infrastructure
Project was the establishment of WUC to operate on a commercial basis
without subsidy.
1.35      Bank loans for the Shashe Infrastructure Project (Loan 776-BT of
June 30, 1971 and Loan 776-2-BT, dated June 7, 1974) included finance for a
major water supply component to serve the BCL Limited mining complex and
the township of Selebi-Phikwe. The water supply facilities were
commissioned in June 1974 after minor delays due to cost overruns and
subsequent financing difficulties.
1.36      The Francistown Urban Development Project (Credit 471-BT dated
May 9, 1974) included water supply and minor sanitation components.
Several problems were noted on this project that have been useful in
designing subsequent projects, and resulted in Government decisions that
future urban projects should stress: (a) a greater degree of community
participation, and (b) the elimination of subsidies to low-income
beneficiaries.
1.37      The Second Urban Project (Loan 1584-BT dated September 11, 1978)
also includes water supply and sanitation components to support urban
development in Francistown and Selebi-Phikwe. The water supply component
provided for expansion of the primary water supply system in Francistown
including equipment improvements for existing boreholes, and the expansion
of the distribution system and provision of water standpipes in both
Francistown and Selibi-Phikwe to serve the urban poor. The Sanitation
component in both towns mainly provided double pit vented latrine type
units for 6,500 low income housing plots. The projects' physical works
have been completed successfully within budget. However there will be
about one year delay in overall project completion (closing December 1983)
caused by early institutional and staffing problems.
1.38      The Second Water Supply project (Loan 1763-BOT) September 26,
1979 for US$4.4 million provided for (a) the extension of the Francistown
supply, treatment and distribution system and (b) and preparation of the



- 9 -
third water project comprising raising of the Gaborone Dam with associated
expansion of the existing treatment plant, storage and pumping capacity.
The Francistown component was completed satisfactorily in May 1982,
approximately half year behind schedule with modest cost overruns.
Preparation of the third project was also completed with minimal delay and
minor cost overruns due to higher than anticipated local inflation. The
water supply facilities were officially put into operation in September
1982. As soon as final accounts with contractors are settled the Project
Completion Report will be prepared by Government.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location - Special Features
2.01      The project is located in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana
although it will also provide partial supply to the town of Lobatse located
about 70 km south of Gaborone. Gaborone, the only major town in South East
Botswana became the capital in 1966 when Botswana achieved independence.
Since that time, the town experienced a very rapid but controlled growth,
its population increasing from a village level of 6000 to the present
62,000.
2.02      Gaborone is the administrative center of Botswana and the seat of
Government. It is also the major commercial and educational center of the
country. At present an international airport is under construction near
Gaborone. The better employment opportunities have been and are still the
main reasons for the unexpected growth of Gaborone. In 1978 the Cabinet
decided that Gaborone should be developed towards the west. In a
subsequent study Gaborone West (see IBRD Map 16923) was divided into ten
residential "super blocks", three industrial areas and a number of
recreational zones. At present Phase I of this development is under
construction.
Existing Water Supply and Waste Disposal Systems
2.03      Gaborone's sole source of water supply, the Gaborone Dam was
constructed in 1964 on the Notwane River some 4 km south of the town. The
reservoir also serves as a supplemental source of water to the town of
Lobatse. The catchment area of the reservoir is about 3,800 km2 and lies
partly in Botswana and partly in neighboring south Africa (see IBRD Map
16922). Based on 20 years of flow records the safe yield of the full
existing reservoir at a risk of failure in 1 in 20 years is about
6.Mm3/annum 9/. The reservoir is currently operated above this rate to
satisfy demand. With abstraction rates equal to the safe yield above,
projections indicate that the dam would spill in one year in five at an
average rate of 14.5 Mm3/annum. There is thus scope for capturing spillage
9/ Recorded mean annual inflows have varied from maximum 194 Mm3/a (1966)
to minimum 0.2 Mm3/a (1979).

by increasing the reservoir storage capacity by raising the height of the
dam.
2.04      The existing primary water supply system of Gaborone consists of
the following (See IBRD Map 16921).
(i) The raw water system consists of the Gaborone Dam, intake tower,
raw water pumping station, and raw water main to the Gaborone
treatment plant. The system has a capacity of 25 to 35,000 m3/d
depending on the water level in the reservoir.
(ii)  The water treatment works consists of clarifiers and rapid
gravity sand filters. The works have been constructed in 1965
and have been extended in 1974 and 1981. The present nominal
capacity is 28,500 m3/d, the present maximum daily demand 29,400
m3/d.
(iii) The treated water transmission system consists of three pumping
stations at the treatment plant site, one at the town storage
site and one at the Broadhurst storate site and associated
transmission pipelines. Another pumping station at the treatment
plant site pumps water to Lobatse.
(iv)  Treated water storage consists of 2 elevated reservoirs one in
the town and one at the Broadhurst storage site and of seven
ground level reservoirs, one at the treatment plant, four at the
town storage site and two at the Broadhurst storage site. The
total storage capacity is 38,000 m3 representing two days storage
at average daily demand.
2.05      Gaborone has an extensive sewer system covering almost the entire
town area and is designed to cope with the ultimate flow when all town
areas will be sewered.  The sewage is treated in oxidation ponds
at the South, North and Broadhurst treatment plants, along the Notwane
River downstream of the Gaborone Dam.  Non sewered areas rely on pit
latrines (5,600 units). Most common are the ventilated single or twin pit
latrines with seat.  In a pilot area in Broadhurst the aqua privy type has
been tested but has not been fully successful so far because the users did
not maintain the necessary water seal. Septic tanks are not common in
Gaborone (only 100 units).
Population Served and Standards of Service
2.06      Gaborone's 1982 population is approximately 62,000.  The whole
population has access to public water supplies; about 62% through private
connections and 38% from public standpipes. Lobatse has a population of
19,000 and the supply conditions are almost the same as in Gaborone.
2.07      The Gaborone water supply system is completly metered, including
the public standposts. Sales amount to approximately 85% ofthe treatment
plant output which is an acceptable performance by any standard. In 1982
the average specific domestic consumption at private connections amounted
to 138 I/cd and at public standposts 42 1/cd. The water quality is good.
Details of water analyses are available on the project file.



- 11 -
2.08      Gaborone has regular refuse collection.  In residential areas
refuse is collected once to twice a week, in commercial areas daily. The
refuse is disposed of by sanitary land fill on two sites.
2.09      Due to the present satisfactory water and sanitation conditions,
water borne diseases do not pose a problem in Gaborone. Nevertheless,
diarrhea is still a frequent disease, but this is probably due to improper
sanitation habits. Bilharzia has not been found in the dam. There are
occasional outbreaks of Malaria, especially in wet years.
Population Projections and Demand for Service
2.10      The Department of Town and Regional Planning of the Government
conducted population growth studies and projected the population as
follows.  For comparison actual previous growth rates are also stated.
Year            inhabitants             annual % increase
1964               3,900                        24 (actual)
1971              17,700                        18
1975              34,500                         9
1982              62,000                         8
1985              79,000                         8 (forecast)
1990             115,000
After 1990 the Government intends to halt further immigration to
Gaborone by developing other urban centers and allow only for natural
growth. The 8% growth rate upto 1990 appears to be on the high side but is
possible.
2.11      Gaborone's and Lobatse's future water demands have been projected
by Gibb up to 1991 (see Annex 2). For comparison previous demands for the
years 1979 to 1982 are also given. The demand projections are based upon
unit water demands for house connection and public standpipe users,
projected population and demands by industrial, commercial and
institutional water consumers. The projected average unit water demands of
Gaborone of 160 1/cd for house connections and 45 I/cd at public standpipes
are assumed to remnain constant through the period 1983 through 1991. These
consumption levels are considered realistic based on other comparable
African countries. Due to the projected substantial increases in water
charges, an increase in average water consumption levels is not expected.
Although the specific water consumption at standpipes of 45 1/cd in
Gaborone appears to be high, past records confirm this. The good coverage
of standpipes with relatively short walking distances (100-150 m) appear to
be the main contributing factors.
2.12      The town of Lobatse is partially supplied with water from
Gaborone via a 250 mm pipeline from Gaborone to Nnywane treatment plant at
Lobatse (see para. 1.34). This contribution is necessary for the
foreseeable future due to the limited alternative sources at Lobatse.
2.13      A summary of the previous and future total raw water demand of
the Gaborone Dam is given below (for details see Annex 2).

Losses between treatment plant output and raw water sources are estimated
at 5%. Sales amount to 85% of the treatment plant output. Maximum-day
system demands are estimated at 1.6 times average-day demands.
a/ The proposed raising of the Gaborone dam by 8 m will be unable to meet
this demand of 1:20 years risk of failure of the yield.
b/ The Lobatse demand is mainly for the Lobatse Abattoir (Botswana Meat
Corporation BMC).
III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01      The Government of Botswana urgently requested the Bank to assist
in financing the project to which they give highest priority. The
ongoing development of Gaborone West, (see para 3.09) would have to be
stopped if additional water supplies are not assured. The Bank agreed to
accelerated project processing and to advance contracting for the Gaborone
dam raising works in order to complete the project one year earlier than
originally envisaged to impound the 1984/85 rains.
3.02      The need to augment Gaborone's water supply was forseen during
the appraisal of the Bank financed Second Water Supply Project in 1979
(para. 1.38) and as a result funding was included for engineering
investigations and preliminary design to increase the capacity of the
existing Gaborone dam reservoir.
3.03      Following the 1981/82 drought in the Gaborone area, an "Urban
Drought Committee" was appointed by the Cabinet which consisted of
technical and administrative experts of all ministries. The Committee
commissioned the "Gaborone Life Extension Study" which was prepared by the
Consultant,Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (Gibb).



- 13 -
3.04      Gibb's final report was submitted in January 1982 which
recommended the immediate raising of the Gaborone dam by 8 meters but
without confirmation that it was the least cost solution or the optimum
height of the dam. At the Bank's request, WUC instructed Gibb to review
both these points in a supplementary report. Gibb's supplementary report
confirmed that of the seven possible sources of raw water for Gaborone
(Gaborone dam, Kolobeng dam, Metsemotlhaba dam, Ramotswa Wellfield, Bokaa
dam, Marico dam and Limpopo dam) raising the Gaborone dam by 8.0 meters was
the least cost solution. The Bank has reviewed these reports and agreed
with the conclusions.
3.05      Due to the forecasted shortages of water which can be expected to
occur anytime from 1983 onwards, the Government and WUC understandably
attached great importance to the earliest start of construction.
Consequently in consultation with the Bank and CDC the timetable of project
implementation was accelerated, detailed design and tender documents were
completed, reviewed and approved by the Bank, and bids for the construction
of the dam were received December 1982.
Dam Safety
3.06      In view of the size, complexity, and required speed of
construction the Bank requested WUC to appoint a Panel of Experts to review
the design and safety aspects of the dam. A panel of three experts was
appointed and submitted their report in early January 1983 which WIJC, its
consultants Gibb, and the Bank have reviewed and accepted. The Panel's
recommendations are being incorporated into the contract for the dam
raising. During negotiations, WUC agreed to retain the services of the
Panel of Experts to review the construction of the dam (Loan Agreement
Section 3.02(c), and to make satisfactory arrangments for periodic safety
inspections of the dam and other works after completion of the project
(Loan Agreement Section 4.02(b)).
International Water Rights Issues
3.07      Approximately one-third of the catchment area of the dam is
situated in the Republic of South Africa.  Furthermore, when the dam is
completely filled, an area of approximately 10 hectares will be inundated
beyond the border of Botswana (IBRD maps 16921/22).  In accordance with the
Bank's request the Government of Botswana has contacted all up stream and
down stream riparians of the Notwane and Limpopo rivers and informed them
of the proposed project. The riparians have either expressed no objection
to the project or given explicit agreement to its execution. The Bank
reviewed the respective documents and was satisfied with the actions taken
by GOB.
Objectives
3.08      The principal objectives of the proposed project are to augment
and secure the water supply to Gaborone, Botswana's rapidly developing
capital, through the raising of the existing dam by 8 meters which will
meet the city's water demands up to about 1988, and to expand Gaborone's
existing water treatment and supply system to cater for the increased water
availability. The project also provides for the site investigations and



- 14 -
preliminary designs of two new dams (Koloberig and Metsemotlhaba dams) to
further augment the water supply to Gaborone beyond 1988.
3.09      An urban expansion plan has been prepared for Gaborone and the
Gaborone West Phase 1 (of a total of 10 phases; see IBRD MAP 16923), is
under construction and will provide 3,000 hoising plots, civic community
and commercial land. Total cost for the infrastructure for the ongoing
Phase 1 is estimated at P 25.0 million (US$22.5 million) and is being
developed with assistance from USAID. Work on Phase II will have to be
delayed by some two years until additional water supplies from the raised
Gaborone dam are assured.
Technical Alternatives
3.10      Comparisons between alternative sources of water supply have been
made on the basis of present value of the investment and operation costs of
each program (see para. 3.04). Raising the Gaborone dam by 8 m proved to
be the least cost solution, followed by Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba dams in
priority of development.
3.11      Water supply facilities for Gaborone West must be designed in a
way that up to 1988 the water demand can be met from the Gaborone dam and
treatment plant East. After 1988 additional water from the proposed
Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba dams will require a new treatment plant West.
The consultant investigated three alternatives for the primary water supply
system and two for the secondary water supply system and has determined the
least cost solution. The solution is described in Annex 3 and is
acceptable to the Bank.
Water Saving Techniques
3.12      Proposals have been put forward by the Public Health Engineer of
MLGL to introduce water saving flush toilets as a standard in all high,
medium and low cost houses.  In a pilot project, toilets with 3 and 6 liter
flushing capacity will be tested. This research work is actively being
supported by the TAG group of the Bank. If the project is successful, the
Botswana Housing Corporation proposes to introduce these systems on a large
scale. At present, however, magnitude of water savings cannot be
estimated.
3.13      Due to the scarcity of water resources and the high cost for
developing of existing sources the question of returning of sewage effluent
to the Gaborone dam has been investigated (see document on project file).
It was agreed that presently the economic and operational requirements are
not favorable, but this possibility should be borne in mind for the future
when alternative sources of water may become unacceptably expensive.
Service Standards
3.14      The majority of future consumers (Gaborone West) will be
residents of Site and Service areas 65%, 20% will be low cost, 10% medium
cost, and 5% high cost housing. All Site and Service areas will have non
waterborne on-site sanitation units. Low, medium, and high cost housing
areas will be supplied through individually metered connections and will be



- 15 -
connected to the puiblic sewers system. Water supply to Site and Service
areas will be through public standpipes, with one standpipe for 20 plots.
The service levels for Gaborone are proposed to be developed as shown
below.

Description of Project Components
3.15      The project, which is more fully described in Annexes 3 and 4
consists of three parts; (a) the raising of the Gaborone dam; (b) the
extension of basic water supply facilities in Gaborone; and (c) consulting
services and investigations for preparation of future extensions and
training. The main project components are:
(a) Raising of the existing Gaborone dam by 8 m. This is mainly a
civil works contract and consists of: (i) site clearance,
drilling and grouting works; (ii) earthworks for the dam
construction; (iii) concrete works for the spillway and
outlet; (iv) instrumentation, pipeworks and fencing; (v) road,
rail, power and water pipeline diversions; (vi) land
acquisition; and (vii) engineering including panel of experts.
(b) Expansion of treatment and transmission facilities for
Gaborone. This will comprise civil works and supply contracts
covering: (i) extension of the Gaborone East treatment works;
(ii) extension of the raw and treated water pumping capacity;
(iii) construction of additional raw and treated water mains
to treatment plant and storage sites; (iv) construction of
additional ground level reservoirs; and (v) engineering.
(c) Consultant and technical services for: (i) site investigations
for the future Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba dams; (ii)
engineering for the preliminary design of two new dams,
Gaborone West treatment plant and transmission pipelines;
and (iii) a manpower development study and training
support.
Location of the various sites are shown on IBRD Maps 16921 and
16923.
Cost Estimates
3.16      Total project cost exclusive of interest during construction, is
estimated at P 49.9 million (US$44.9 million). Duties, are only payable on
goods imported into the Southern Africa Customs Union, of which Botswana is
a member. Goods and services purchased within the Customs Union would not



- 16 -
be subject to duties and taxes.  Since this project has only small
components for supply of material, the share of duties and taxes are not
significant and will probably be below 2% of the total cost. Foreign
exchange costs would amount to P 32.8 million (US$29.5 million,
equivalent), or 66% of total project costs. A summary of the project cost
estimates and interest during construction is shown below and a more
detailed breakdown of these estimates is included in Annex 5).

Not included above are the costs of the associated expansion of the
secondary and tertiary distribution system as these costs are always
pre-paid by the appropriate development authorities who then recover from
sale of developed plot proceeds. However, the cost of the expansion
program which is directly related to the project has been included in the
Economic rate of return calculation (para. 6.04). Based on the development



- 17 -
program up to 1988, expansion of the distribution system will cost
(including physical and price contingencies) about Pula 16.0 million
(US$14.4 million). During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from
Government that adequate funds will be made available in a timely manner to
expand the secondary and tertiary distribution systems (Guarantee Agreement
Section 2.02(b)).
3.17      Project costs are based on the awarded contract price for the
dam, and on estimates by the consultant Gibb for the other components at
June 1983 price levels. An allowance of 10% was added to baseline costs
for physical contingencies. For price contingencies distinction was made
between expected local and foreign inflation rates. For local costs, price
contingency factor of 9.0% has been applied for FY1984 (for 9 months), and
12.0% and 10.0% for FY1985 and 1986 respectively. For foreign costs, the
respective factors applied are 6.0%, 7.5% and 7.0%. The costs of
engineering design and construction supervision have been calculated on the
South African Model Form Payment Agreements for consulting engineer work
which forms the basis of the contract between WUC and Sir Alexander Gibb &
Partners. Engineering and supervision of construction costs are estimated
at US$1.8 million for Gaborone dam raising (5% of cost), and US$0.R million
for the associated treatment plant and supply system expansion (10% of
cost).
Project Financing
3.18      The proposed Bank loan of US$22.0 million would finance 68% of
the total foreign exchange cost of US$32.5 million and would cover about
44% of total project cost of US$50.0 million, including interest during
construction and front end fee. Remaining financing requirement totaling
US$28.0 million would be provided by a loan of about US$10.8 million
equivalent from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), about
US$5.5 million from WUC from self generated funds; and the balance of
US$11.7 million from GOB as a loan from the Public Service Debt Fund
(PSDF).
The roject Financing Plan is as follows:
US$ million        %
IBRD loan                                     22.0           44

Total                                         50.0           100 %
Details are provided in Annex 11
3.19      The Bank loan would be for 17 years including a grace period of 4
years; interest wouild be variable in accordance with Bank's current
procedures; and a front end fee of 1/4 of 1% would be payable on the total
Bank loan of US$22.0 million on loan signature by deduction from loan
proceeds.



- 18 -
3.20      CDC's loan of about US$10.8 million is expected to be on same
terms as those of the Bank i.e. for 17 years including 4 years grace period
but with a fixed interest rate of 10.5% and no front end fee.
3.21      Government's contribution of US$11.7 million (Pula 13.0
million) will be provided as a PSDF loan, interest would be at 10% per
annum for a term of about 25 years with the grace period restricted to the
period of construction (i.e. a maximum of 3 years). Of the US$11.7 million,
Government has already advanced about US$5.0 million to cover mobilization
and initial progress payments of the dam raising contract.
3.22      The completion of all necessary loan formalities including
effectiveness of the CDC loan and the PSDF loan will be a condition of
effectiveness for the Bank's loan.
3.23      WUC is expected to contribute about US$5.5 million to finance all
interest during construction amounting to US$5.0 million, Bank front end
fee of US$0.1 million, and about US$0.4 million of project costs.
Implementation
3.24      WUC would be responsible for project implementation and has
retained Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners ("Gibb"), an UK engineering
consultant firm to carry out all engineering work including supervision of
construction, in respect of raising the Gaborone dam. WUC, with Bank
approval will also retain Gibb for preparation of detailed engineering, and
tender documents for the treatment and pumping plants, service reservoirs
and trunk water mains, together with supervision of construction.
3.25      Based on the award of contract in January 1983, work on the
raising of the Gaborone dam commenced in February 1983 with completion
estimated in October/November 1984. Construction of treatment plant and
service reservoirs is scheduled to begin in September 1983 and completion
is expected May 1985. An implementation schedule is included as Annex 6.
3.26      The project also provides finance for the ongoing geological
investigations of the proposed two future dam sites, Sites 61 and 62 at
Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba. WUC has engaged a contractor at a cost of
US$0.9 million to carry out these investigations; whilst Gibb has been
retained for site supervision and for the preliminary design of the two
dams, the new water treatment plant WEST, transmission pipeline and pumping
stations.
Land Acquisition
3.27      Enlargement of the Gaborone dam reservoir area including
realignment of the road and railway lines, and land for new reservoirs and
pipelines will involve acquisition of about 1600 ha, mainly undeveloped,
from some 15 different owners. As the project is in the public interest,
the existing "Acquisition of Property Act" provides Government with
compulsory powers to acquire the necessary land on payment of appropriate



- 19 -
compensation. Government does not forsee any problems of entry and
acquisition, the costs of which have been estimated not to exceed Pula
200,000, (i.e. about Dula 125/ha. US$110/ha.). Government is responsible
for determining the amount of compensation, and WUC is responsible for
payment. At negotiations, an assurance was received from Government that
it will indemnify WUC against all land compensation claims in excess of
Pula 200,000 (Guarantee Agreement Section 3.03).
Procurement
3.28      Three major contracts are planned:
(i)  Civil works covering the raising of the Gaborone dam costing
about US$32.7 million. Tendering for the raising of the Gaborone
dam followed the Bank's ICB guidelines. Tender documents and
prequalification of bidders were reviewed by the Bank prior to
project appraisal. Subsequent to project appraisal, tenders have
been received and the tender evaluation report has been reviewed
by the Bank. The contract was awarded in January 1983, on a no
objection basis by the Bank.
(ii)  Civil works covering construction of pumping stations, treatment
plant, reservoirs, and trunk mains costing about US$5.1 million;
and
(iii)  Supply and erection of equipment and instrumentation of pumping
stations, treatment plant, reservoirs and trunk mains costing
about US$2.1 million.
3.29      Tender documents for both contracts (ii) and (iii) are being
prepared in accordance with Bank ICB Guidelines, which will also be
followed for the tendering evaluation and award of contracts. Equipment
and instrumentation is not manufactured locally and would have to be
procured outside the country. The size of the civil works contract is
expected to attract both local and overseas contractors.
Disbursement
3.30      The Bank's loan will be disbursed as follows:
(i) 60% of the balance of the cost of the dam raising
contract to be incurred after Board presentation (about
US$28.0 million) amounting to US$17.3 million;
(ii) 100% of total expenditure for all consultants services,
including the services of the Panel of Experts, amounting to
US$4.7 millions.
Disbursement schedule is given in Annex 7.
3.31       CDC are expected to match the Bank's disbursement arrangements
and finance jointly about 23% of the expenditure of the dam raising
contract to be incurred after Bank Board presentation, amounting to US$6.3
million, and about 60% of the expenditure of the treatment plant and



- 20 -
transmission system expansion amounting to US$4.5 million. The bulk of
Bank funds are expected to be disbursed within the first two years. All
disbursements will be fully documented and any loan funds remaining
undisbursed at the end of the project would be cancelled. The project is
expected to be completed by December 31, 1985, about three years after
award of the Gaborone dam raising contract. The proposed closing date
would be six months later at June 30, 1986 to allow adequate time (a) to
settle and pay all outstanding claims and retention monies, and, (b) to
complete payment for all preparatory works on dam Sites No. 61 and 62 up to
and including preparation of bid documents.
3.32      During appraisal, Government requested retroactive financing of
about US$1.7 million equivalent to about 3% of total project cost, and 8%
of Bank's proposed loan of US$22.0 million.  The retroactive finance would
cover the cost of (i) engineering consultants fees for a) the preparation
of preliminary engineering, bid documents, evaluation and award of
contracts for both the raising of the Gaborone dam and the associated
expansion of the treatment plant and the main supply system; initial
supervision of construction of the Gaborone dam raising prior to Board
presentation, and cost of the expert panel totalling about US$0.7 million;
and b) preliminary engineering of dam sites Nos. 61 and 62 of about US$0.3
million; and (ii) the ongoing site and soil investigations contract for dam
sites Nos. 61 and 62 of about US$0.7 million. This request is justified
and should be supported on the grounds that Government has already made a
substantial advance payment (para. 3.21); WUC has or will prepay these
expenditures from funds earmarked for other investments; and the urgency of
both the raising of the dam and need to firm up additional water sources.
Water Resource Aspects
3.33      Gaborone dam is the only existing developed source of water for
Gaborone. The next three least cost sources have been identified as:
(i) Kolobeng dam (Site 61),
(ii) Mletsemotlhaba dam (Site 62), and
(iii) Ramotswa Wellfield.
3.34      Based upon a risk of source failure of once in 20 years (5%), the
raised Gaborone dam and the proposed Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba dams will
have the following safe yields:
Average
Yield        Cumulative    Demand        FY
mil ms/a -----------
Gaborone dam                11.5           11.5           11.7     1988
Kolobeng dam                 4.0           15.5          16.0      1994
Metsemotlhaba dam            3.0           18.5
These figures indicate that the Kolobeng dam should be completed by the end
of 1988, and Metsemotlhaba dam by 1994. To achieve an end 1988 completion
date, decision to proceed with the project will be required by end 1985.
In addition to the two new dams, the potential of the existing Ramotswa



- 21 -
wellfield has yet to be fully evaluated with regard to long term safe
yield. Preliminary estimates range from 1500 to 5000 m3/d which would
represent a relatively minor contribution to Gaborone's water supply.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.35      The project would contribute to maintain the present high
standard of water supply and health conditions. The project does not
include sanitation or public health education components as these are being
satisfactorily addressed by the Town Council, MH and UNDP Global Sanitation
projects. The raising of the dam would have minor adverse impact as the
land to be flooded is marginal grazing land with virtually no permanent
human settlement.
IV. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
The Borrower
4.01      At the request of the Government, the borrower and the
implementing agency for this project would be the Water Utilities
Corporation. In the previous second water supply project Government choose
to be the borrower in order to on lend to the WUC (the implementing agency)
on more generous terms. However WUC is now adequately managed and
financially viable to undertake the project.
Organization, Management and Staff
4.02      WUC was established in 1970 as a parastatal entity to operate on
sound commercial public utility lines under the Water Utilities Corporation
Act. This Act was drafted with Bank Group assistance provided under a
previous Bank Group project (para. 1.34). WUC's initial responsibilities
were (a) to operate and maintain the bulk water supply facilities for the
Shashe Infrastructure Project covering the townships of Francistown and
Selebi Phikwe, and (b) to replace the existing government agency, the
Gaborone Water and Electricity Unit, as the sole supplier and distributor
of water in the Gaborone-Lobatse region. The Second Water Supply project
helped expand WUC's areas of responsibility to the distribution system of
Francistown township. It is Government's general intention to expand WUCs
mandate to cover bulk supply and distribution of water to Jwaneng (a
diamond mining town east of Gaborone) in 1983, and the distribution of
water in Selebi Phikwe at some later date. Precise timing depends on the
availability of staff and finance. Jwaneng will be supplied eventually
from the Gaborone dam when adequate water is available.
4.03      WUC's Board consists of nine members, all of whom are appointed
by the Minister of MRWA. The Chairman is the Permanent Secretary of MRWA,
the remaining eight members comprise four drawn from the public sector, and
four from the private sector. The Board meets at least quarterly, approves
budgets and establishes policy. As the need arises, the Board delegates
certain authorities to sub-committees to deal with such specific matters as



- 22 -
procurement and contract award, loan negotiations, the recruitment of
senior staff, etc.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) known as
Engineer/Manager is appointed by the Board to manage the day-to-day
business of the Corporation. The Act empowers the Minister of MRWA to give
directions^to WUC that are consistent with the Act and are related to broad
policy matters but not for day-to-day operations.
4.04      WUC is presently organized into two operating divisions:  the
Gaborone-Lobatse Division based on Gaborone, and the Shashe Division based
on Selebi-Phikwe. The Shashe division currently supplies water in bulk to
the township, power plant and mine at Selebi-Phikwe, and provides a full
commercial service in Francistown. Each division is headed by a Divisional
Engineer, who reports to the CEO and is primarily responsible for the
operation, maintenance and routine expansion of the water supply systems in
his area. The divisional engineer is also responsible for meter reading,
revenue collection, new service connections and disconnections in his
area. In addition to the two Divisional Engineers, the CEO is assisted by
a Principal Administrative Officer in charge of administration, a third
Divisional Engineer responsible for planning and supervision of new water
works, a Chief Accountant, and a recently appointed Project Engineer for
the raising of the Gaborone dam. The routine accounting work of the Shashe
division is carried out in Selebi Phikwe under the direction of a Principal
Accountant, reporting to the Chief Accountant in Gaborone. The accounting
of the Gaborone division is carried out under the direction of the other
Principal Accountant operating within WUC's headquarters, and he is also
responsible for the consolidation of the accounts of the Corporation. An
organization chart of WUC is shown in Annex 9.
4.05      The present organization structure of WUC is well suited to its
needs and provides a sound framework into which WUC can eventually absorb
the water supply and commercial operations in the remaining towns of
Jwaneng and Selebi-Phikwe.
4.06      The present expatriate CEO has been in charge of WUCs affairs
since mid 1982. He is an able and highly experienced water engineer and a
competent manager.  His services are covered by a two year renewable
contract. In previous loans it was agreed that WUC would consult with the
Bank before making any appointment to the position of CEO. WUC has
honoured this assurance and it is continued in the proposed loan. (Loan
Agreement Section 4.04).
4.07      The First Water Loan (776-BT) included an assurance that any
appointment to the position of Chief Accountant should have appropriate
qualifications and experience but this assurance was dropped from the
Second Water Supply Project (Loan 1763-BT). Notwithstanding the recent
change of Chief Accountant, WUC will not be asked to reinstate this
assurance  as the Corporation may be relied on to appoint competent
management.
4.08      WUC has developed into an effective and well-managed
organization. It has a total establishment of 394 including proposed
staffing of Jwaneng. Of the 31 senior posts, 20 are filled by
expatriates. In addition to the recent appointment of a project engineer
(para. 4.04), the size and complexity of the proposed project requires the
appointment of a project accountant who could eventually assume the



- 23 -
responsibilities of internal auditor. Following construction of the
project, responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the facilities
would be assumed by the Gaborone/Lobatse divisional engineer, with some
increase in skilled and unskilled personnel.
Personnel Development and Localization
4.09      The steady progress of WUC as an organization over the past nine
years is good evidence not only of the competence of its management but
also of the efforts that WUC has made in the development of its personnel.
Faced with an acute countrywide shortage of trained personnel (para. 1.20),
WUC's practice has been to provide its recruits with the necessary
training, either on-the-job and/or through formal courses, and to promote
them through the ranks depending on the experience and levels of skill
which they acquire over the years. In recognition of WUC's staffing needs
a sound training policy and program was established some six years ago
which is periodically reviewed and up dated. When the program was
formulated, the lack of good promising Batswana candidates with minimum
education standards was recognized as a major constraint to rapid progress
in localisation, and in fact this has been the experience over the past six
years. Notwithstanding management's consistent attention to training,
progress has been both slow and limited. In common with the experience in
other African countries, the most promising trainees leave as soon as they
attain modest levels of qualification and competency for better
opportunities in the private sector or outside the country.
4.10      The second Water Supply project appraisal report noted that WUC
made good use of training facilities available within the country and
externally; this use has been continued. WUC also encourages staff
generally to continue their general education by financing night classes
and the more usual externial correspondence courses. Many of WUC's artisan
cadre continue to benefit from technical training offered by DWA and the
National Center for Vocational Training (mechanics, plumbers, etc.). The
majority of WUC's accounting staff are following some form of upgrading
courses mainly covering book-keeping. Three of the accounting staff were
enrolled in either the three year afternoon course run by the Botswana
Training College or the four year evening course given by the Institute of
Development Management at the University of Botswana both leading towards a
professional qualification. Unfortunately the most promising trainee has
recently left WUC for improved prospects outside Botswana. With regard to
the water technicians, WUC continues to send promising staff to the one
year course for water works operators provided by the Swaziland College of
Technology (SCOT). The best of the SCOT graduates are expected to progress
to water superintendent after five years work experience. One of the
earliest trainees was appointed the first local water superintendent during
1982; whilst initial indications are not promising, it is much too early to
make an overall judgement on the success of the program. It has always
been recognised that WUC would be unlikely to localize completely the water
superintendent staff level before 1990. Given the relatively small WUC
establishment, the training programs described above are well conceived and
implemented, and should meet WUC's future staffing needs below the
professional and sub-professional level. At this time, local staff
turnover and wasteage is not excessive given the country's growing manpower
demands.



- 24 -
4.11      The major personnel problem which continues to face WUC is it's
excessive reliance on expatriate staff. The professional and
sub-professional cadres comprising engineers, accountants, and water works
superintendents (with the one recent exception) are staffed by
expatriates. For the engineer cadre, there continues to be no significant
improvement in the very limited number of Batswana civil engireering
graduates available in the country. WUC will have to compete for this
limited number of graduates against the attractions of the diamond mines
and the private sector. With the training program mentioned in para 4.09
WUC expects to localize all water works superintendent posts by 1990. The
same target date was set for the accountant posts. An additional concern
is that WUC is experiencing increasing expatriate staff turnover. One of
the past strengths of WUC has been staff continuity both local and
expatriate. This resulted in the establishment of sound technical and
commercial practices which have been consistently applied during the fairly
rapid growth and evolution of WUC. However, within a space of twelve
months, five senior staff members comprising the CEO, chief accountant, two
divisional engineers, and the divisional engineer for new capital projects
will have left, others are expected to follow.  Two major factors are
responsible - firstly Botswana's fairly high and accelerating rate of
inflation coupled to the recent devaluation of the pula for which no
compensation has been granted by WUC on Government's instruction; secondly
WUC's expatriate staff conditions, which are based on the UK supported
overseas civil service scheme, have been eroded following reduction in UK's
level of support. As a result there has been a marked drop both in the
number and level of qualified candidates willing to accept more than one to
two-year contract. This problem is common to other parastatals. Whilst
Government is sympathetic, the issue of precedence for the substantial
expatriate civil service and the weakened economy puts them in very
difficult position.
Manpower Development Study and Implementation Program
4.12      WUC's training program for lower level staff is sound and future
staffing and training requirements should be met without great difficulty.
However, the need to accelerate the supply of suitably qualified Batswana
at all management and senior technical levels, is acute. WUC is anxious to
mitigate its current heavy dependence on expatriates and the special
problems posed by their increasing cost and turnover at a time of
operational expansion and rising water demand. To this end WUC intends to
undertake a special study of this manpower constraint. The object of the
study would be to design a short and long-termstrategy, and implementation
program, for the recruitment, education, training and succession of
Batswana professional and sub-professional cadres which would, over time,
alleviate and eventually remove WUC's dependence upon expatriates. An
intensive study of short duration is envisaged. This will require support
from a short-term consultant, or expert, in water sector management
development to assist WUC with the design and implementation of the study.
The Bank's role in the study would be to provide, as a minimum, information
and advice on the availability of current and planned relevant technical
education opportunities within the region, or elsewhere. Finance has been
included in the proposed Bank loan both for the study and to assist with
the first phase of a senior staff development program. During negotiations
an assurance was obtained from WUC that, if required, a consultant to



- 25 -
assist with the study would be appointed by Marci 31, 1984 with
qualifications, experience, terms of reference and contract terms
acceptable to the Bank. (Loan Agreement Section 3.02(b)).
Accounting and Audit
4.13      The accounting system of WUC is commercially oriented.  It was
developed and implemented during the early years of WUC with assistance
from Cooper Brothers, an accounting firm from the UK. Cooper Brothers also
advised WUC on the initial choice of accounting machines, used mainly for
billing and consumer accounts records. However, with the recent growth of
consumers consideration is now being given to replacing the present billing
accounting machines by a simple computer (para. 4.17). Accounting
practices and procedures are adequate; separate accounts are maintained for
the various water supply operations. WUC's accounts are well kept and its
annual financial statements have been published promptly.
4.14      Whilst WUC does not currently have an internal auditor's position
in its establishment, certain internal audits have been conducted on an
informal basis. WUC accepts the need to formalize its internal audit
function and proposes that if a project accountant is appointed he will
take over the internal auditor function on completion of the project.
Additionally the appointment of this project accountant should permit the
existing principal accountant Gaborone/Lobatse division to undertake
informal internal audit duties during this interim period.
4.15      External audit of WUC's accounts has been carried out to a high
standard, by Coopers and Lybrand, an international accounting firm
(formerly Cooper Brothers of UK). WUC's audited annual accounts include
separate accounts for the Gaborone/Lobatse division, the Francistown water
undertaking, and the Shashe division in order to determine the individual
rate of return of the various divisions as required by previous loans. The
audited annual accounts have been submitted consistently to the Bank Group
within five months after the close of each year, as provided for in
previous Loans. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that WUC
would continue to maintain separate accounts for the Gaborone/Lobatse
division, the Shashe division, and the Francistown Undertaking and that
annual accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
would be submitted to the Bank within five months of the end of the
financial year (Loan Agreement Section 5.01 and 5.02(a) & (b)).
Billing and Collection
4.16      Prior to the transfer of the Francistown water undertaking to
WUC, the processing of billings for the two divisions of Gaborone/Lobatse
and Shashe was centralized in Gaborone from monthly meter readings sent to
Gaborone. Following the assumption of responsibility for Francistown by
the Shashe division, the divisional number of consumer accounts jumped from
1700 to 4,000. This prompted the decision to decentralize and transfer the
Shashe divisions' accounting and billing to Francistown. The transition
was well planned and is working satisfactorily. Meters continue to be read
monthly. Due to the relatively modest numbers of consumers in each of the
two existing divisions (Gaborone/Lobatse 7,000 and Shashe 4,000), meter
readers normally only read meters on certain days in the month and are



- 26 -
employed elsewhere within the corporation for the remainder of the month.
The flexibility inherent in this arrangement is essential for a small
organization such as WUC to control operating costs.
4.17      WUC's billing performance has in the past been completely
satisfactory with total accounts receivable averaging about 35 days. In
September 1982, total accounts receivable for the Gaborone/Lobatse division
averaged about 56 days but this was a temporary situation due to senior
accounting staff changes, and machine breakdowns. As the capacity of the
present mechanical accounting system for billing is now fully utilized and
the machines are reaching the end of their useful life, WUC with its
auditors assistance, is investigating computer billing systems as a
possible option to help maintain a satisfactory billing performance and
cope with future increases in number of consumers.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
5.01      As mentioned in para. 4.15, WUC maintains separate accounts for
the Gaborone/Lobatse and Shashe divisions, and as agreed under the second
water supply project also maintains accounts for the former Francistown
water undertaking separate from those of the Shashe division. Summarized
past and future financial Statements for the three operations, as well as
the estimated future financing plan for the Gaborone/Lobatse division, are
analysed in the following paragraphs.

WUC's debt/equity ratio of 77/23 as of March 31, 1982, was marginally worse
than the forecasted position of 73/27. However, this represented
considerable improvement over the position at the time of WUC's creation,
when it had virtually no equity. Such a capital structure is the direct
result of Government's policy of making financial contributions to WUC's
development program mainly in the form of commercially oriented loans
which are recovered from water consumers through tariffs, rather than as
equity, WUC's capital structure is projected to continue to improve.

Financial Performance of Gaborone/Lobatse Division Water Supply Operations
5.04      Gaborone/Lobatse financial performance over the past three FY's
1980 through 1982 has been overall very much as forcasted in the second
water supply project in September 1979. Demand, average tariff rates and
water revenues have grown as predicted. Operating expenditures (including
depreciation) has been controlled, whilst the operating ratio has been in
the satisfactory range of 69 to 71. The rate of return target of 8% on net
revalued assets has been consistently met or bettered thereby enabling the
Gaborone/Lobatse division to generate a favorable cash position (aided by
good billing and collection performance and tight financial control).
Operations and maintenance levels have been fully satisfactory.
Financing Plan Gaborone/Lobatse Division 10/
5.05      As the project is expected to be physically completed within
three years by about mid 1985, the financing plan for the Gaborone/Lobatse
division covers the four FY's 1983 through 1986 and is summarized as
follows:
10/ Since the preparation of the financing plan for Gaborone/Lobatse
division, the 1982/83 rains in the Gaborone area have completely failed.
Emergency drought measures have been introduced effective April 1, 1983 to
conserve the remaining limited water supplies. As a result, the expected
level of water sales for FY1984 is unlikely to be achieved. At this early
stage, it is difficult to quantify the expected loss of revenue but it has
been prudently estimated at about Pula 3.0 million. Government readily
appreciates that loss of revenue of this magnitude would jeopardise WUC's
proposed contribution to project financing at a critical time and has
therefore agreed to provide bridging finance in the form of a special Pula
3.0 million PSDF loan on concessional terms. With this Government
assistance offsetting the expected FY1984 loss of revenue, the financial
projections and assessments in Chapter V and Annex 10 remain valid.

5.06      The financing plan is considered reasonable and within WUC's
financial capacity. In previous water sectors' loans, Government as the
borrower has borne the foreign exchange risk and only passed on to WUC 3%or
less of the actual foreign exchange fluctuation. Previous exchange
differences have been relatively modest due to stable exchange rates.
However, WUC as the direct borrower will now assume the full foreign
exchange risks which is in accord with Bank policies.  Should the recent
volatility in exchange rates continue, this could pose substantial risks
and costs for WUC in face of its rapidly increasing external debt burden.
Government is now reassessing its policy on foreign exchange risks on
external borrowings by parastatals. In line with past practice Government
would be expected to share the risk should the cost prove excessive.



- 31 -
5.07      The financing plan assumes the following tariff increases
effective at the start of each financial year: 50% for FY1984, 50% for
FY1985, and 30% for FY1986, which would produce rates of return on net
revalued assets in operation of 17.6% FY1984, 12.2% FY1985 and 9.5%
FY1986. These high rates of return in the first two years results from the
benefit of the substantial tariff increases on a basically unchanged assets
in operation base. In the third year, the net assets in operation include
the cost of the project and the rate or return starts to fall back into to
the 8% range. WUC considered limiting tariff increases for the FY's 1984
and 1985 to those required to maintain an 8% rate of return but decided
this would have resulted in an uneven tariff increase pattern and
inadequate cash flows. A steady 8% rate of return achievement would have
required tariff increases of about 4% in FY 1984, 74% in FY1985, and 47% in
FY1986; and cash flow would have been reduced by about Pula 4.8 million
(US$4.3 million) over the three year period. WUC's past financial
performance has been excellent, partly in response to the Bank's 8% rate of
return target. In recognition of the need for further substantial
investments over and above the proposed project within the next five years,
during negotiations WUC agreed to maintain the 8% rate of return target on
revalued assets in operation for the Gaborone/Lobatse division (Loan
Agreement Section 5.04(a)).
Future Operations and Financial Position of Gaborone/Lobatse Division
5.08      Forecast income statements, balance sheets, and funds flow
statements for the Gaborone/Lobatse division for FYs 1983 through 1986 are
given in Annex 10.
5.09      Based on existing figures for the Gaborone/Lobatse division,
revenues from water sales are expected to grow by about 11% in FY1984 to
about 7.2 million M3 and thereafter to taper down to a steady annual growth
rate of about 5% p.a. by FY1987. The volume of water sold in FY 1988 is
expected to reach around 10.3 million M3, 66% increase over the FY1982
level of 6.2 million M3. Revenues over the same period are expected to
grow to about Pula 16.8 million compared to the actual revenue for FY 1982
of Pula 2.6 million, an increase of 550%, derived primarily from tariff
increases. Direct operating expenses (including depreciation) percentage
is forecast to remain steady at around 42% from FY1984 onwards;
notwithstanding a jump in the annual depreciation charge from Pula 0.6
million in FY1984 to Pula 2.7 million by FY1986. Interest chargeable to
operations will rise dramatically from Pula 0.4 million in FY1983 to a
maximum of Pula 4.8 million in FY1986 (following project completion);
annual interest payable then commences to decrease progressively with
repayment of principal. From FY 1986 onwards rates of return are expected
to average around 8.0%, based on tariff increases which reflect local
inflation rates i.e. zero tariff increases in real terms.
5.10      Given the substantial increases in depreciation and the 8% rate
of return, cash flows are expected to remain healthy and be more than
adquate to cover the debt servicing of the proposed financing plan,
together with nonral renewals and expansion of the distribution system.
Should further substantial capital expenditure be incurred around FY1988
onwards, additional external financing will be required which could strain
WUC's financial resources. During negotiations WUC gave an assurances not



- 32 -
to incur any loan without Banks prior approval, unless there is sufficient
internal cash generation to cover 1.5 times maximum future debt service
(Loan Agreement Section 5.06).
Tariffs
5.11      The tariff level and structure of WUC's Gaborone/Lobatse and
Shashe divisions and of Francistown water operations as of November 1, 1982
are summarized in the following table.

a/  Excluding contributions from raw water consumers -
5.12      The first category is a social lifeline tariff for small consu-
mers and for standpost delivery. Although the average tariffs for the
Gaborone/Lobatse division will require substantial annual increases over
the next several years, it is envisaged that the social lifeline tariff
increases would correspond to the general level of urban inflation.
Consequently the bulk of the tariffs increase are expected to be borne by
the larger consumers. In particular, during appraisal both WUC and
Government agreed that consumers using more than 70 m3/month should pay the
highest rates. This will be reflected in the tariff adjustment for
Gaborone/Lobatse division to be introduced effective April 1, 1983.
5.i3      The varying tariffs scales and levels between the respective
divisions reflect their individual operating and capital structure
characteristics and debt servicing obligations. The tariff levels for
Francistown were determined as part of the financial obligations agreed
under the Second Water Supply Project (September 1979). These provided for
a modest rate of return growth from 0% in FY1982 rising to 3% in FY1987 and
there after in recognition of financial impact of the long run marginal
cost of water for Francistown beyond 1987. Had these modest rates of
return not been adopted unacceptably high tariffs would have resulted. WUC
also agreed to progressively increase Francistown tariffs up to FY1987 to
reach the targeted rate of return of 3% on net revalued assets in
operation.
5.14      Government is still firmly commited to its long standing policy
of not subsidising the urban water sector. During appraisal the general
level of required tariff increases in para. 5.16 were discussed and agreed
in principle with Government and WUC. Since then WUC Board has approved,
with Government's endorsement, the tariff increases which became effective
April 1, 1983. WUC's proposal will increase average tariffs by about 50%
to Thebe 72/M3 (US$2.52/1,000 US gallons) and at the same time will
introduce a progressive tariff structure which will place the bulk of the



- 33 -
tariff increase burden on the industrial, commercial and large residential
consumers. Tariff increases to the smaller consumers will be limited to
about 20% thereby raising the cost of water to about Thebe 28/M3 (US cents
98/1,000 US gallons) for the first 10 M3 per month. Future tariff
increases beyond FY84 will be introduced at the commencement of each FY
(April 1), and will be calculated to achieve rate of return targets, debt
service coverage, and self-generated investment needs.
Rate of Return - Gaborone/Lobatse Division
5.15      As part of past Bank support, WUC was required to achieve a rate
of return of at least 8% on revalued net assets of the Gaborone/Lobatse
division. This requirement was reduced for FY's 1975, 1976 and 1977 but
reinstated in FY1978 and continued through FY1983. Except for FY's 1976
and 1977, of which the Bank had prior knowledge, WUC has consistently met
its rate of return targets by appropriate tariff adjustments and tight
financial control.
5.16      To continue to meet or better the existing 8% rate of return
target, WUC proposes to increase tariffs as follows:
FY ending March 31   Average tariff   Annual % Increase   Average tariff
Pula/M3           Current    Real          Real Terms
Terms      Terms         Pula/M3

1988                        1.63            8         0               1.14
Overall Growth Rate FY's 1983-1988  240%         138%
Revaluation of Assets
5.17      The current method of revaluation of assets is based on the
Government's Urban Cost of Living Index for "All Income Groups" issued by
the Central Statistics Office of MFDP. This index served as a reasonable
approximation when Botswana was experiencing modest inflation roughly equal
to the price increases of imported goods. However with the increasing
disparity between the accelerating rate of local inflation and the slow
down in the price increases of imported capital goods, the present method
of revaluation could lead to the need for excessive tariff increases.
Consequently WUC has requested that the basis of revaluation be amended.
During negotiations, it was agreed that WUC will revalue its assets
annually using methods of valuation satisfactory to the Bank (Loan
Agreement Section 5.05).



- 34 -
Affordability for Low Income Groups
5.18      In 1975 the NRWA launched a sociological and housing attitudes
survey in low cost housing areas in order to determine guidelines for
future planning. As far as the physical aspects of water supply and
sanitation was concerned, the survey revealed that water borne toilets
were favored, whilst communal toilets were not acceptable, dissatisfaction
existed with the standard of standpipe water supply, and preference was for
individual garbage bins. The affordability aspect was however another
matter. Since reliable statistical sources on Gaborone urban income are
not available only estimates are possible. In the low income group, the
average household size is 6.2 persons, of whom an average 1.3 persons are
in employment. The CY1982 average household income in this group is
estimated to range between Pula 100 and Pula 150 and the urban poverty line
per household is estimated at P 100/month. Based on standpipe water
consumption of 45 1/cd, per person, a poverty line household's water bill
would absorb about Pula 2.00 or about 2.0 % of total income, at existing
standpipe rate of Thebe 23/M3. This is considered affordable even if
standpipes tariffs were to increase by about 10% in FY1983. The Town
Council reimburses WUC for actual metered consumption of individual
standpipes and recovers the cost through a monthly flat charge incorporated
in plot fees. (para. 1.17).
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Benefits
6.01      The project would satisfy the water demand in Gaborone up to
about 1988 and would thus enable the Government to continue with the
large-scale development of Gaborone West. Demand in Gaborone at present has
already outstripped the safe yield of the existing dam, and provisional
measures (raising the existing spillway by 1 meter) are envisaged by WUC in
order to avoid possible water shortages until the new dam is completed.
The people in low-income areas of Gaborone, who pay for water as part of a
fixed monthly fee per plot, would also benefit from the (cross) subsidized
tariff for water supplied through standposts. The project would also
finance foundation investigations and preliminary engineering studies for
the construction of the Kolobeng and Metsomotlhaba dams, treatment plant,
and transmission water mains, which would be necessary to meet the water
demand forecast for Gaborone beyond 1988.
6.02      The two previous Bank financed projects helped to strengthen
WUC's organizational and financial capability, as demonstrated by the
orderly transfer of the Francistown water undertaking in the second
project. The proposed project would continue to strengthen WUC by
expanding the Gaborone/Lobatse Division's capacity to meet the
growingdemands of industrial and residential consumers. WUC is required as
part of its mandate to recover from existing water consumers all operating
and debt servicing costs, and under the Government's long range planning
will progressively assume full responsibility for the supply and



- 35 -
distribution of potable water to the five major urban areas of Botswana:
Gaborone, Lobatse, and Francistown (in effect); Jwaneng and Selebi-Phikwe
(future developments).
Least Cost Solution
6.03      Previous engineering studies have identified the raising of the
Gaborone dam by 8 m to be the most economic alternative (paragraph 3.04 and
3.10).   Comparisons among alternative programs have been made on the basis
of the present value of investment and operating costs of each program.
The proposed project has the lowest present value.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Pricing Consideration
6.04      The Economic Rate of Return of the project is the discount rate
at which the present value of the capital, and operating and maintenance
costs is equal to the present value of benefits attributable to the
investment over the economic life of the project. In the cost calculaion,
taxes and duties have been excluded, whilst shadow pricing of foreign
exchange and labor was not applicable. Capital costs include the annual
investments in the expansion of the secondary and tertiary distribution
system up to 1988 when the additional water supply is fully committed
(para. 3.16). Capital costs are based on mid 1983 prices plus appropriate
physical contingencies; incremental operating and maintenance costs are
based on 1983 actual expenditure levels, split 40% variable/60% fixed. The
incremental water revenues were taken as the best proxy of the benefits
attributable to the investment and have been calculated on proposed average
tariff changes in real terms (based on 1983 price levels). On this basis,
the ERR is 8.3%, and would have been higher if unquantifiable health,
environmental, social benefits and consumer surplus could have been
included. The rate of return is sensitive to a 10% increase in costs or a
10% reduction in benefits by about 1%. A combined 10% increase in costs
and 10% reduction in benefits would result in an ERR of 5.9% (details of
the calculations are given in Annex 12).
6.05      The average incremental cost of supply for the project area is
estimated at Pula 1.30/m3 at an opportunity cost of capital of 10%. The
average incremental cost is marginally higher than the expected average
selling price of Pula 1.16/m3 (in real terms) in 1985 when the benefits
become available. The highest block of the tariff is expected to be priced
around Pula 1.40 which is above the incremental cost. (Details of the
calculations are given in Annex 12).
Project Risks
6.06      Project construction would be relatively straightforward and
would not pose any significant risks particularly as the Expert Panel will
continue to monitor safety aspects during the construction of the dam.
WUG's record of good management gives assurances that the Project will be
satisfactorily operated and maintained after commissioning. The only
appreciable risk may be W(C's ability to increase Gaborone water tariffs to
the necesssary levels, which are estimated to more than double in real
terms over the next three years. However, this risk is acceptable in view
of: (i) the Government's firm policy of not subsidizing urban services;



- 36 -
(ii) WUC's plan to increase Gaborone tariffs in gradual steps each vear;
and (iii) WUC's intention to maintain a socially acceptable tariff
structure, cross subsidy for standpost users, as well as to those with
minimum house connections and consumption by cross-subsidisation from the
largest industrial and commercial consumers.
Project Monitoring System
6.07      The most important monitoring aspects concern implementation of
the proposed Project and actions on tariffs. Suitable indicators for
monitoring project implementation and for measuring performance against
project goals are set out in the project monitoring systems given in Annex
13. During negotiations, it was agreed that, after completion of the
proposed Project, WUC will prepare a *Droject Completion Report" on the
basis of an outline to be agreed with the Bank (Loan Agreement Section
3.04(e)).
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements to be Reached.
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were received from Government
that:
(a) a copy of the reports on review of existing water legislation
covering domestic and international water regulation will be
made available to the Bank for review and comment prior to
the introduction of legislative changes, (para. 1.10, G.A.
Section 3.02);
(b) Government will ensure adequate funding for the secondary and
tertiary distribution systems in a timely manner; (para.
3.16, G.A. Section 2.02(b));
(c) Government will reimburse WUC for any land acquisition costs
connected with the raising of the Gaborone dam, inexcess of
Pula 200,000 (para. 3.27, G.A. Section 3.03).
7.02      During negotiations, assurance were received from WUC that:
(a) WUC will continue to retain the services of the Panel of
Experts to review construction of the dam, and after
completion of the dam will make satisfactory arrangements for
the periodic safety inspections (para. 3.06, L.A. Sections
3.02(c) and 4.02(b));
G.A. = Guarantee Agreement; L.A. = Loan Agreement.



- 37 -
(b)  WUC would continue to retain engineering consuLltants for
project implementation, whose qualifications, experience, and
terrms and conditions of employment would be satisfactory to
the Bank (para 3.24 and 3.25, L.A. Section 3.02(a));
(c)  WUC would consult with the Bank prior to making any
appointments to the position of Chief Executive officer.
Appointee would have the necessary qualifications and
experience, (para. 4.06, L.A. Section 4.04);
(d)  If required, WUC would appoint consultants to assist with the
manpower development study by March 31, 1984 with
qualification experience terms of reference and contract
terms acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.12, L.A. Section
3.02(b));
(e)  IWUC would submit its audited accounts, including separate
accounts of its Gaborone/Lobatse and Shashe divisions and
Francistown Undertaking together with the auditors' reports,
not later than five months after the close of each financial
year and will continue to employ independent auditors,
acceptable to the Bank, (para. 4.15, L.A. Sections 5.01 and
5.02(a) and (b));
(f)  WUC, in respect of Gaborone-Lobatse Division will adjust
tariffs so as to enable the Division to earn a rate of return
of not less than 8% on revalued net fixed assets in operation
(para. 5.07, L.A. Section 5.04(a); method of revaluation to
be acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.17, L.A. Section 5.05);
(g)  WUC will obtain Bank's prior agreement before incurring any
loan if the cash generation for the previous year is less
than 1.5 times maximum future debt servicing requirement
(para. 5.10, L.A. Section 5.06);
(h)  WUC would prepare, after completion of the proposed Project,
a "Project Completion Report" on the basis of an outline
to be agreed with the Bank (para. 6.08, L.A. Section
3.04(e)).
Recommendations
7.03      Retroactive finance of up to US$1.7 million is recommended to
cover technical and consultant services incurred after July 1, 1982 and
prior to loan signature, (para. 3.32, L.A. Schedule 1, para. 3).
7.04      The completion of all conditions of effectiveness for the CDC
loan together with the completion of all necessary formalities for the
Government PSDF loan would be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed
Bank Loan, (para. 3.22, L.A. Section 8.01).
7.05      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for a
Bank loan of US$22.0 million equivalent to WUC for 17 years including a 4
year grace period.

BOTSWANA
THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Description of the Proposed Water Supply Facilities
1.       According to the land use plan, Gaborone will only extend towards
the west. The Gaborone West development plan is therefore the basis for
the design of the required extension for the water supply facilities.
Various alternatives have been investigated by the consultant. The least
cost solution is described below and shown on IBRD Map 16923.
2.       Gaborone West is considered as a single supply zone with storage
provided by ground level reservoirs sited on Forest Hill. In the period
prior to 1988/89 water for Gaborone West would be pumped from the Gaborone
East Treatment Works to the Gaborone West distribution system with
balancing flows into or out of the ground level reservoirs on Forest Hill.
From 1988/89 onwards, raw water from Kolobeng and later on also from
Metsemotlhaba Dam would be piped to the Gaborone West Treatment works and
then pumped to the Forest Hill reservoirs. Water for the rest of the
Gaborone and the satellites would be pumped directly from the Gaborone East
Treatment Works to the Town storage site as at present. The primary system
for Broadhurst would remain as it presently exists.
It is also believed that this solution has an additional advantage
in terms of greater flexibility of operation in regard to the whole of the
Gaborone Water Supply System. It allows for the laying of a large diameter
trunk main through the Gaborone West Development and it will be possible to
make connections off this at selected points to link into the existing town
distribution network for use in emergency situations.
3.       Two separate water treatment works will be required in Gaborone.
These are:
(i) the existing Gaborone East Treatment Works near the Gaborone
dam that treats raw water from the Gaborone dam, and
(ii) the Gaborone West Treatment Works that will treat raw water
from the Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba dams.
These treatment works are required to treat water at a rate equal
to the peak day demand (1.6 times of average day demand) in the areas which
they serve. In addition the Gaborone East Treatment Works supplies a
quantity of treated water to Lobatse via the Gaborone-Lobatse pipeline.
Capacity of Gaborone East Treatment Works
The safe yield of the Gaborone Dam after raising is estimated to
be 30,000 m3/d. Therefore, the Gaborone East Treatment Plan should have a
ultimate nominal capacity of 48,000 m3/d. Since the present capacity
amounts to only 28,500 m /d, an additional treatment works capacity
of approximately 20,000 m3/d will be required.

Page 2 of 3
Capacit-y of Gaborone West Trfeatment Works
The combined safe yield of the Kolobeng and Metsemotlhaba dams has
been estimated as 205,000 m3 day. Therefore the ultimate capacity of the
Gaborone West Treatment Works will, on applying the same peak day factor,
be 32,000 m3/d. The works will be implemented in 2 construction stages.
4.       The present ground level storage capacity at the Gaborone East
Treatment Works, the Town Storage and the Broadhurst Storage Site amounts
to 36,000 m3. At a storage capacity equal to two times the average day
demand (WUC design criteria) the future ground level storage requirements
are:

/ Space for future reservoirs at the Town storage site is limited.  It is
suggested that the existing 910 m3 reservoir be demolished in order that
a new reservoir can be constructed. The space then available will be
adequate for a reservoir of 16,500 m3.
5.       Water supply facilties to be financed and constructed under this
project are listed below:
(a)  Raw water main from Gaborone Dam to raw water pumping station,
dia 500 mm, 1,200 m.
(b)  Raw water pumping station -- installation of 4 duty and 2
standby pumpsets in the extended raw water pumping station,
(c)  Extension of Gaborone East Treatment Works to raise the
capacity by 20,000 m3/de
(d)  Extension of the treated water pumping station at the
treatment plant by installing 2 duty and 1 standby pumpset.
(e)  Extension of the existing pumping station at the Town Storages
Site by installing 2 duty and 1 standby pumpset.

6.       The secondary and tertiary distribution system is not part of the
IBRD Third Water Supply Project. This part of the project is financed
through the sale of the plots to be serviced and will be constructed in
stages as required for the town development.

Third Water Supply Project
Economic Rate of Return for Gaborone Water Supply
Assumptions
1.        Capital expenditure has been based on June 1983 base line costs
plus physical contingencies and include:
(a)  Cost of dam raising;
(b) Expansion of the treatment plant, pumping station reservoirs and
transmission mains, and replacement of equipment in years 2001
and 2016, i.e. approximately every 15 years;
(c) Expansion of the tertiary and secondary system, mainly in
Gaborone West, in FY1985 through 1987 to utilize additional water
from the dam. Expansion will have to cease after 1988 unless
additional water sources are available.
Dam will be completed by November 1984 rains which will benefit
FY1985 revenues. Treatment plant expansion will be completed by June 1985.
Value of Incremental Water
2.        Incremental water has been valued at the proposed average tariff
calculated in real terms (FY1983 as base year).
Operating Costs
3.        Incremental operating costs have been based on previous actual
costs (vairable to 40% and fixed 60%) and calculated on incremental water
sales attributed to the project.

Proposed Monitoring Guidelines
General
1.        The following guidelines are prepared to facilitate planning and
to evaluate achievement of technical, financial, management and training
goals. Certain of these will be included in periodic reports to be
submitted to the Bank whereas the remaining data may be included in WUC's
annual reports.
Monitoring Guidelines
2.        WUC would develop and maintain Gaborone Undertaking records for
the following:
a. Water System Operation Data
(1) Water production: metered production by month at the Gaborone
treatment plant;
(2) Water consumption: metered monthly consumption for all
categories of water demand and consumption steps including,
but not restricted to, the following uses: (1)
residential; (ii) commercial/industrial and (iii)
governmental/institutional;
(3) Unaccounted-for water by month;
(4) Numbers of connections at year-end listed by consumption step
and category (see para. a(2) above) including residential
connections of the following types: (i) private connections;
(ii) public standposts, and (iii) other;
(5) Interruptions in service: the extent to which water service
was interrupted on an annual basis with specific
consideration of: (a) frequency, (b) duration, and (c) cause
of interruption.
b. Treated Water Quality: Summary of physical, chemical and
bacteriological quality.



- 65 -                       ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 2
c. Project implementation: Quarterly forecasts of expenditures are to
be prepared for each contract within three months of signature of
contract. Quarterly reports are to indicate percentage completion
of original forecasts and revised forecast of expenditure for
remainder of contract.
d. Financial Indicators (required annually)
(1)  Contributions to capital expenditures from internal cash
generation during the Project construction period as measured
by historic performance and WUC's five-year forecast;
(2) Annual rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets in
operation;
(3) Operating ratio;
(4) Debt service coverage.
(5) Audited Accounts.
e. Staffing, Training and Localization (WUC, consolidated)
(1) Staffing (end of financial year)
(a) Number of permanent employees;
i. Professional;
ii. Subprofessional.
(2) Training: Number of staff trained during financial year by
category, duration, and type of training (viz., on-the-job,
off-the-job);
(3) Localization: Water works superintendent and accounting posts
filled versus total numbers of posts authorized.
Consultation with World Bank
3.        The Borrower would consult with the Bank, at least on an annual
basis, relative to the revaluations of average net fixed assets in
operation, and the calculations of annual rates of return relative thereto.
