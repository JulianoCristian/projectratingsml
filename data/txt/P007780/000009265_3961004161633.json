By reactivating land markets, encouraging\n            investment, creating employment opportunities and improving\n            agricultural productivity and the incomes of small and\n            medium farmers through better access to basic agricultural\n            services, the project will help to ameliorate the\n            country's extreme poverty.  The project has two main\n            components.  The agricultural technology component will\n            decentralize agricultural public sector services and support\n            the development of a demand-driven mechanism for private and\n            public research and extension. It will consolidate public\n            research and technology transfer services into a new\n            decentralized Nicaraguan Institute of Agricultural\n            Technology (INTA), incorporating soil conservation and\n            pesticide management as integral parts of the system.\n            Specifically, the project will, through INTA, support\n            programs for:  (a) technology transfer and validation to\n            emphasize crop management research and extension focussed on\n            small and medium farmers, including an artisanal seed\n            program; (b) integrated pest management; (c) soil and water\n            conservation; (d) research grants; and (e) academic studies.\n            In addition, the agricultural technology component will\n            support:  (a) a pesticide management program, as part of\n            establishing a national environmentally sound strategy for\n            pesticide use and management; and (b) a private technical\n            assistance program to help farmer groups contract technical\n            assistance from the private sector.  The land management\n            component will support the design and implementation of a\n            national cadastre, land titling and land registration\n            system.  Specifically, the project will:  (a) streamline\n            administration and improve inter-agency; (b) establish the\n            basis for an efficient national cadastre; (c) strengthen the\n            Public Register at the central and departmental levels; (d)\n            support the issuance of 50,000 land titles, prioritizing\n            beneficiaries by zones; (e) provide technical assistance and\n            equipment to improve field supervision and quality control;\n            and (f) finance studies aimed at establishing the legal\n            administrative and technical groundwork for the future\n            demarcation of the boundaries of indigenous lands and\n            natural reserves."}, "docdt": "1993-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
