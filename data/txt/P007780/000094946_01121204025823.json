qualifications. While not entirely clear as a\n            control issue, this report's authors believe that\n            government agencies emerging from a decade of centralized\n            government, macro-economic instabiity, and a post-conflict\n            environment had varying degrees of difficulty\n            acting/reacting with the technical and administrative\n            agility and skill required by the project. A critical issue\n            beyond Government control was the large number of claims for\n            indemnifications from US citizens , for lands lost during\n            the conflict in 1979 and its aftermath, representing a\n            fiscal and political burden and a huge obstacle for land\n            regularization. Project sustainability is rated likely\n            because of renewed support by IDA, and because follow-up\n            initiatives are building upon this project's\n            achievements. world Bank overall performance was on balance\n            satisfactory but mixed. Borrower peformance overall was\n            satisfactory.Bank requirements, seen by the Borrower as\n            onerous on occasion, nevertheless served an important\n            function of transferring knowledge/technology to borrower\n            agencies concerning the standards, actions, and practices\n            needed to execute complex programs; and its instutional\n            performance--albeit uneven within and between\n            agencies--improved significantly over time. Other lessons\n            learned pertain to monitoring outputs and impacts,\n            collaboration between disparate institutions, and the legal\n            environment for land titling, especially women's land tenure."}, "docdt": "2001-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
