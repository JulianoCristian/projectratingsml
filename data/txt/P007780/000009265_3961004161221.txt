also support a Project       Unit (US$2.4 milion) to coordiat and monitor both
omponents, aid speial studies.
The project would provide a means for Nicarau, which   in a peiod of
reconstrution, to gumpstart" the agricultural sector by intrducing a new demand-
drve approach to technology generation and transfer, and by supporting the required
technologicaland institutional bamework for defining an' enuring land property
rigt  Under the Agculturd Technelogy component, 34,500 mostly small and
medium farmers would benefit directly fiom research and extension progrms and,
under the Land M   ent component, 50,000 landholders would receive secure title
to weir property. Non-quantifiable benefits of the project include: (a) creating a
conducv envionment for private investment, competition and innotion because of
Imprved poUcy, leg, and regltory framewrks; (b) supporting human resource
development through t     (c) impig the delhvey of basic ervioes (rsea,
eemio, cadase, land titling and risby) to that part of the nra populatin wih
limited potical or economic inluence; and (e) responding to agro-ecological
imbalanc  wh a view to conserving the countr's natura resource base. Perhaps the
most important non-quantifiable beneft reutng from the project will be the impved
chanc  fr political and social peace aing firom the implementation of a credble
system of lad propet rghts.
3:bE        A major rsk relates to the Goemnmenet's commitment to the agreed sector
policy framwork and to the breadft of institutional and tenological chage proposed,
compounded by limited projet  mpmetation capacity at the pvernent leveL In
particulr, the decetalization of agriultural services may not be carried out as forcefully
and efficiently as planned. To mitgatt; this risk during proect ppa tion, ac ted
efforts wre made to desig and agree on a realist decentraia  program and major
o   Ludnal dchangy and polic acbons took place prior to Boa4 presentation In
addWion, the 1DB AGSAL Poliy Matrig, prepared in parallel to the propcsed project, and
endored by IDA, specffics an institutional framework establishing explicit policy priorities
and a clear divio of labor between sector agencies.
The politial sensitivity of land tenure issues and the fragile nature of the enomc reform
proCOSs in Nicrgua may also  opardize project imp     The effective enactment
prir to Board presentation of an agreed and dearly defined regulatory frmework should
significantly impr  the poliicl and ecomm;ic envionment. Government recogizs the
seveity of the problem and has started to take effective action twards completing the
ogoing process of land sigmets, resolving competing claims, completing the
ssifcation of unduly  propriated or assigned rural properties, and proceedingth a
frmal fincial       on plan.

1.1   When the current Government of Nicaragua (GON) took oce in April 1990, te economy
was in disarra: tota exts and GDP per capita had dedined to about 40 percent of the levels
attined in the eary 19M, and mjor fiscal and eten  balance had reuWlted in hylatio. The
extrnal debt bad grown to more than five times the level of GDP and most exenal credito,
including the Word Bank, had supened thedr operations in Nicargua on account of payments

their own sd, paricubrly beans, there is little incetive for the developmet of a commerc  sed
idustry. For such crops, the project would support a new 'wartisanal seed poducton   approach in
which farmers who are unable to buy oertified seed, would improve the quality of the seed they save
for themsves and sell to their neighbor  This would require technial assistane in seed production
and procesing metods, and modest facilities (Annex C, paras 19-20).

land tenure reg     , resolving          issues, and significanly reducing tensions and
conflicts over land propet rights, thus helping to consolidate and reacvate land markfet in
Nicaragua. Overall, this project component i aimed at creating a new reguatory and inctive
framework to suppor private sector deveopment and investment in agrtum
2.37  The component would be managed by INRA m coeratin  with INEIT   (land titing) and
the Public Registry of the Niaaga Suprme Court (land registry). Coopert  aements among

238  During the first stage of the project, and under the new egaVadminialv frmework  the
most pressig and lega  viable propert claims, laey rising farm  med   tides to the same

-19-
(Are de Ppiedad del Pueblo; APP) (parm 1.19) would be completed. Ti preimiq  stage of the
prect would mainly involve the legazation of rural property acquired by the pret or past
adinistrations that was asigned to benefidares of the Agraian Reform prior to being registered
under the State's owneship, and would be supported by a grat from the Nethedands for Dutch
"ulder 1,047,581 (US$M6600). Once properly registeredw ith INRA, these properdes would be
traered to the current legaly rcie d dweller. An unrestrt  legal tide would then be
provided to each property and registered with the Registro Pdblico. Duing negoiations, a- asurance
was obtained from Goverment that the title and the  compag poperty dscription wunild adhere
to a fomat satisfory to IDA as provded in the INRA publication of September 1992 (pt. 3.1(d)).
2.39  Ihe project woul support the active participation of producer orga-izatons (paras. 1.29-130).
It is ected that their paricpation would assist INRA in pending land propety regulaization C_

project would finance technial assistance for this purpose.
2.40  Th Nationdastre (USS14.0 mion)wd be implemented by INRA under the
coopratve agreement with INETER. This suboomponent would support a new technical and
admistrative firmework for the establishment of a muti-purpoe unifom nationa cadastre for
103,000 km2 (or 78%) of the national territory, including the improvement and updating of cadastal
iormation of 19,000 kn2 in the Pacific Region, in acccrdance with internationaly accepted noms
and stadard  The cadastre would be completed for approxmautely 2Z000 km2 of rurWal properties to
be titled under the project. Ihe new multi-purpose uniform national cadastre would be based on the
development of a national geodetic grid and now up-to-daL aerial photography that would allow the
limits of each parcel to be tied to pemanent ground control poinis withi the nationa geodetic grid,
thus abandoning the present iefficient and costly sytem of geoah  propert descriptions. Thi
few approach would generate tehnially sound and verable land information upon which to base
the process of land titing and land tenure regularization (ie, registering)
2.41  Aerial photography would be acquired at two diffrent scales, 1:40,000 for the production of
orthophoto maps at 1:10,000 scale for the Czatral and Pacific Regions, and 1:75,000 for the
production of orthophoto maps at 1:25,000 scale for the Aantic Region. he orthophoto maps
would prvide technically sound and reiable information whih would help resove and expedite the
land adjudication process These maps would be produced for selected areas (land titlg modules)
and utilhed by in-fidd cadastral svying and titling teams to adjudicate property boundaries and
produce an up-to-date cadastral data base. An implementation summary of the cadastre
subcomponent is given in Ann=  , Appendx 2.
2.42  The cadastral data base would incorporate alpha-numercal inmat  on the parcel and
owner/s supported by orthophoto maps shoing location and parcel characteristics. Thi information
woud comprise the basic cadastral file card Clcha catastral). Data obtained through the cadastre
would be regularly updated, and icorporated in the departmental and national cadastre offices
through a communica  network to be financed by the project. The cmmuniction network would
Se inter-lined with the Registro Pdblico for regtry updating.
2.43  To insre proper implementaon, ad relar montorig and updating of futme changes in

both the central and deptmenta level (17 departmental offices) imprving accuracy, reliability, and
accesibility of land tenure ioromato  A computerized Inter-connected data base, to be financed by
the project, would pwrvie not only a more efficent and cost-effective instumment for the
administration of real estate traacions, but woud make it easier for the Registro Piblico to fiuly

2.57  Under a mdized and computerized regstry, the prosing of land taction would be
signficantly impd both in quaity and timeliness. A first step would involve the microfMming of all
the existing data. In addition, the project would finance technal assistance for the development of
appropriate software for entry of relevant data into the registry and taining on information
management tecbniques (Annex I, page 12).
2.58  Pvsion have been made under the pojet for the remodeng of departmental offies of the
registry. All remodeling projects would have to be revised by an engineer specialized in antieimic
struures and requue prior review and approval by IDA. To the extent possble, the registry offices
would be consolidated within existng facilities at the departmental or municipal level, or co-located
with INEIER.
2.59 In June 1993 GON announced a system to collect fees for subsequent changes in land title
issuance and registration after a parel has been formally titled under the project (the first titde
registered under the project would be free), initially set at about US$75. These fees would be
periodically updated to cover at least operational costs in real tenns.
2.60   0taSo amsw           Technical assitance would be provided under the project to analye
the legal and administrative status of the three major indigenous areas in the Atlantic region, which
overlap with protected natura reserves. For this purpose, studies would be carnied out by INRA in
cooperation with [RENA to establish the tecnicd and  tatv groundwork for the future
demacaon of the boudaries of the ndienowus and natwal reserve located in the Atlantic Region.
The studies, which should be completed durng 1994, would identify the extent of current occupain
vithm the diputed are... In addidon to these studies of indigenous and administrative reserves,
project fiding would be available to carry additional studies related to agricultural develoment and
natural resource       t, with the pnor approval of IDA. Such studies could include work in
pecific, bigh piority areas such ii analyzn women i develoment issues arg from the
implmentaion of the proet's agriultural technolog and land _magemet components, lookig,
egB, at how both agriculural extension and research are responding to women farmers' needs, and
bakgoud studies linked to the preparation of futue projects in the agriculture and natural
resources sector. The reslts of the sti, and foMow-up actios would be discussed during project
supervnision and at the time of the projects mid-term review (para 2.79).

2.61  The project executing agencies would be INTA (techology generation and transfer); MAO, in
cooperation with IRENA (pesticide management and the PTA program); and INRA, in cooperation
with INETER and the Registro P6bLico (land ma t) and in coopeation with [RENA (studies
of natural and indgeo  reserves). As a condition of Credit effectiven  INTA and INRA would
sign Implemtatin Agrements with MAO, saisao  to IDA (par. 32(a)). During negotiation
assuranne was obtaed that INTA and INRA would each mmntain an  nzatonal strucue and
fll key positions with ponnel hang    c and qualifications satisfactory to IDA (par. 3.1(f).

2.62   A Project Cordinatg Unit (PCU) responsible for overal prject coordinaton would be
establdied as a gg    a                  bf (t  by the Minister of Aiclture as Head of
CONAGRO, in terms satsfacory to IDA (pama 3.2(b)) Its respnsIbIlit  would include: (a)
conoldating anual prject operational plans, and  p   of progress and prjet completion
reports, based on the information submitted by the exeutig agencies, including monitoring of legal
covenants (b) p on of project budgets; (c) techicd support and reviw of documents for the
procurement of works, goods, and consultant services; (d) prepaing disrmet applications; (e)
support for projet  accounting (f) identtion of possble implementin difficulties and ensuring
approprate  remedy action is taken; and (g) organzing projct workhops, including the Project
Lauch Workhop and workshops for the annual revi   and the mid-term rview (para 2.79).
2.63 lhe PCU would consist of a team of four consultants (Director, Project Specialist,
Procuremn Specalst, and Accountant/Public Administration Speaist) selected under terms of
rferee satsacty to IIDA. Give the lack of yflirity of the projects exeting agencies with
IDA reirements with respect to pr    t, a procurement agency attached to the PCU would
provide technical assistnc to prtect agencies. Duriog negotiations an supo was obtained that
the cmposio of the PCU, its members' quaficat    and eprince, and contracting terms and
conditions would be satsfactory to IDA (par 3.1(g)). The PCU's perfrmance would be monitored
and evuated by CONAGRO and Bank supervion msions, and as part of the mid-term review, and,
in consultationwith the Borrower and IDA, by indepedent auditing conultants to be recruited under
TORs and prcdure satisfactory to IDA.
2.64  A Prject Seering Commitbee (PSC) woud be established, headed by the Minister of
Agiculte aS Head of CONAGRO, as a coiion of Cedit    e          (par 3.2(b)). The PSCs
Secetary would be CONAGRO's Technical Secetary. Te PSC would meet at last four times a year
and consit of the Directors of INRA, RENA. and INETER, a senior representatie of the President
of the Nicraguan Supreme Co, the President of INTA, the Vice 1Mintr of Finace, and a senior
repesntative of the Minstry of the Presidency Th PSC would meet to resolve project
implementation difficulties and to ene inter-ituonal coordintion at the highest evels of
goventnent  he coodinating         fom  r the prject, including among CONAGRO, the PSC
and the PCU, would be reviewed through reguar project suervion as wel as during the mid-term
2.65  Eac executig agency has appoed a project coordinator to sere as a lIaison between the
agenc and the PCU. An asw was obtabied at negotiations that Annual Operating Plans
(AOPs) for the coming year would be prepared by each excuting agency and submittd to the PCU,
for further rview by IDA, by July 31 each yr (par 3.1(h). Te AOPs woud outhne component's
objectves for the coming year, the implementation shedule, and the specific resources hmuan and
financial alocation requredL Adherence to the AOPs woud be reviewed annually.
2.66 A Project Launch Workhop would be held in September 1993. Its purpose would be to
famarize the executing agencies with  A        t, s          and other adminittive
procdure and to ensure that project manages and staff develop a common u     of the
projOct, its overall objective and specific targets, as well as the role of each of the agenies. A major
fcs of the wohop would be to discus and explain in deti the AOP of each implementing
agenc, and to cley identify and plan for are  of required coordtion amog gencies. Annex Q

need to support prgams to promote womes active patipation in the agricultural sector (on the

and specifically addresed during woops, seminars and publications supported by the Bank-
xcuted RUTA II project aud the Fundaciin Arias, Gg, in the case of land tiding issues related to
women. Overall, the projec's emphasis on the       of land property rights (Nicaragua's land
titling laws are gender neul) and the ir t  of a demand-drven technology geation and
transfer system would mitigate o ats to womes access to salared work in agdcultual

boundaries between inieno  lans an natu  reseve  While prtected natural resves located
in the western and central regons (where der are few  digpnous lands) have received donor
Support, indigenous lands and nateserves in the Amatic regio have been relatively neglected, to
a large extent because access is dificult. Mover, disputes hae emerd on the interpretaion of
the Autnomy LAw, whic granted quaautonomous status to indigen   lands in the Atlntic regon,
without cleary definig the boundaries of the indigen   lands. As a  ult, indenos  comuniies
have asoed that large areas of the Atlanc regio be titled to thm, including areas now desgnated as
natural reserves.
2.90 To help reso}ve this conflict, the prqject would finance actions to assist and complement
Governmen's current efforts for deveoping a   mhensive stategy for maagemt and proteton
o£ both indigenous lands and natal reseves in the Atlantic eon inluding the future demaration
of the boundares between them. Specifical, the prject would finance stuies to be carried out by
INRA in cooperation with IRENA which oud lead to the desig of manment plan fr the tbre

292  In partdcular, the prjt  would create the capacity for plaig and implmnn a
comprehensive soil and water management program as an intrinsic part of th generation, vWdation
and teholog transfer acdvities of INTA. Aong these Ilnes, the poposed Soil Con otin Grant
Program wolld help iatroduce and disseminate soil and wae cons tion pactces by financing
seected microvatchment development piot prjectl
2.93  The poject would also directy suppor Nicagua's capacty to address pest ad petcide
problems. Speciicallythe project would:  (a) suppot the deeopment and appliato of an
lln 1 ifilly sound IPM a  ch to pest control in order to mimze adverse effDcts of pesdcde use
an beneficial insects, humans and the eonmet (b) establish a modern regulatoty fimwork and

2.94  In addition to prqjec acities, in the context of the IDA country asstane stra qy, the
Govament is prepaing an Envionmental Action Plan (EAP) that woud be intnated into the
national econoi development pla  In addition to crossectora social, w ecotmio, legal and
institution  issues, the EAP addres major sector issues such as: water management and polution;
deforesion of Trpical Humid Forests (MMFs) and non-Ts; sold waste dipos and polluion;
soil eson; pestiide use and poisning; b vity,          tal proem  reted to the fisheres
and mining secko; and amerndan and cltural heritae prtction. Bilateral doo  vould be

296  Given the extent of institutional changes, the range of actions proposed, and the number of
organiatio  ivoled, a major risk may arise in the implementaon of different actiom and progams.
Specfically, the decentraztion of agrcultural serices may not be carried out as firceWly and
efficenty as planned. To miptie this risk, during project pepartion, concerted efforts we made
to desg and agree on a realistic dee lization progrm which consolidates agricuural researh

S.  When the nw Governnt Administration  took over, the
agricutural Sector was organixed in a single institution, the
late ginistry of AgriCultUal Development and Agrarian Reform
(MZDINR&).    The  functions  of  research,  extension,
phyosanitary  monitoring, sector policie, natura resource
management, la1d policy       t and the administration  of
the Araria   form and Agricultural Sector State Enterprises
We  co tr    in this institution.
s.  The new gWOVIrInt sprt   the  =Dnmk functions and
assigned to four institutions, the Mginistry f Agriculture and
Livestock (=a), the vicaraguan Intitute of Natural R
and Environment (TURI=), the Nicaraguan In     of Agrarian
Refor=  (nM) and the National Public Sector Corporations
(OBRA?).  in our opvinion, this   paton ha  been very
positive to         ise and specialize the funtions of the
aoresaid institutions, but on the other hand it had a
negative impact, resulting in weak coordinaion of the actions
carried out at the agricultural sector level.
7.  $The  amasre  in connection with the specialization  and
improvement of cooination in the insttuonal area, and the
profoundeconomic reforms with a setor impact, have ben

climate was hararz  by runaway inflation, a huge foreign
debt and marked reduction in MP per capita, real salaries,
exportand imports.   This process Of deterioration  was
associated with an absolute State control in all economic
activitiss, whether directly through the Sta  entertrise  or
indirectly through controlling policies and regulations of the
private sector.
8.  rn March Z991 the no    v         tated a stabilization and
structural adjustmnt program.  The main elements of this
program have been: strict fiscal and monetary policies, and
a fixed nominal exchange rate. As a result of those policies
during 1992 the. official annual inflation rate was 3.85%
accompaied by a 0.5% incres  in GDP.
9.  Simultaneously with the stabili2etion effort, since 1991 a
atructural adjustmnt progrm  bra been carried out, whose
fundamental objective in to re oient the country towards a
market economy linkd to the interi tional market.   Tie
program  has been backed by ID  and the  ater-American
Developnt Bank and it includes reforms related to the
reduction of the public sector, and reforms of the tax and
tariff system. The objective of the public sector reform has
been the adjustmet of publc  ex iture in relation to
public revenu  and iproved       ny. This reform includes
personnel reduction in the plc  ctor, improvement in
publiC serVics efficincy and the privatization of State
enterprises.
10. Also a commercial program has been adopted, which includes the
elimination  of State  aonopolies  In  import and  eport
activiti", and the elimination of non tariff restrictio
giving  private  e    te    access  to  foreign  exchange.
mltaeously, iort tariffs and taxes have been gradually
re duce.  In 1991, the ciling on imports protection was
rezuced to 40%, and a reduction to 20% has been scheduled for
1994; at the san time a floor of l.0t on tariffs Mas been
established in order to reduce fr tation in the nominal
rate of protection.
11. The financial sector reform has been baed on the approval of
new banking legislation allowing the establisment of private
bning operations (already waven private banks have started
operating), establimt of the bank superintendency, the
reduction in sixe and restruturing or State baks and the
establishment of credit disciplin  and a syste  of interest
rates in accordance with free supply and demand in the lIca
market.

13. Despite the atoremtiond suctural reforas, the aggregate
agricultural product remaind  unchanged during the recent
agricultural cycle of May 3992 to April 1993.  The lUited
row nh observed since    stru   al austment bega  shoaw
the existence of additional obstacles having their origin in
the  juridical-administrative,  institutional  or  policy
framewoerk, and in deficiancis in infrastructure and public
service.
14. The Program of the present Goverent, prepared during the
electoral campaign and ratified after taking over, establishes
that farmers vould receive priority with respeat to
gnuaanteeing them lawful titl* to ths land they hold. And
lhose demobilized from Military Service, the Army ad the
Resistance have been offered arable land and economic and
technical r%Sourc4W to cultivate it, as well as the ncsary
support for their relocation and adaptation.  All this is
without prejudice to the compensation rights to the fo0rer
owners who may be affected.
15. Also durin  the  electoral campaign the  commitmnnt was
established to review the ncurances on priVate proPrtis
due to confiscations, epropriations, land encroachments or
intervetions, in order to proceed to their devolution, or to
compensation should the first solution not be possible.

private propety. Thus, in fulfillment of the principles and
objectives of ths 1989 Progr   and the laws in force, the
present Governmt has iplemented an expeditious, feasible
and articulate systm to fully solve those problem through
the  icuton of several administrative and economic measures.

18. AB Part of Project preparation, the Goverrment has adopted
measures to improve the sector's influence in the formulation
of  ecomic  policies,  by  appointing  the  xini3try  of
Agriculture and Livestock to participate pnntly in the
Economic Cabinet to represent the agricultural pUblic sector,
establising a new role ror each sector itittion, and
issuing a decre to create the National Agricultural concil
(CONAiO) as a national forum for policy coordination and
consultation  ong  the main sector institution. * The
60vement has published the executive decree establi
COW4o and has issued it  internal rules and regultion
(Presidetial Resolution 74-93).
19. in addition, Exective Decree 2293 Was issued, published in
the Offiial Gazett  No. 612 on friday, Narch 26, 1993,
aontaining the creation of the Nicaraguan institute or
Agricultural Technology (INTA), in the term  as agree  with
IDA. INTA consolidates the physical assets of the former
National Comissions on Baic Food and Non Traditional Crops,
as well as those of NAG and other State institutions devoted
to agrioultural research and extension.
20. Within  the   framework  of  institutional  reform   and
specialization, the IR eotenion program  were eliminated,

22. Also during Project preparation a new juridical-admiistrative
system was organized to handle property problms as tollowos
(a) to deal with the problem of contiscati6n: creation or a
mechanism to review confiscations (Decrees 11-90 and 23-91) ,
and rmetablishment of th National Commision for the Review
of Confiscations  (Decree No. 47-92), the  detailed  and
compuersad  organization of all property claimed by their
former owners (Decree No. 33-91), creation of the Office to
Quantify Indemifications (OCX) (Decree No. 51-92) and its
rules and regulations through MIN Resolution No. 7-93
published on March 14, 1993, to determine the compensation
amounts and modlities to which the claimants are entitled,
and the creation of the Copensation System through bonds
(Decree No. 569a2);  (b) to  deal with  the problm  of
privatization: creation of a central Agency in charge of
Public Xnterprises and state  Proprtio    ng t  and
Privatixation (Decre 7-90), and issuance of Privatization
Instructions (No. 291-92) and the Agreemnts on Social and
Economic Adjustments; (a) to review the assets asoigned during
the transition period: creation of the Property Procurator's
qffice  (Decree No. 46-92), creation of the Land Regulating
Office (OOT) to review the abuses in assigning State
properties (Decree 35-91),  xpaion of OOT' a functions to
revi  rural land assigned in the transition period from
Pebruary 25 to Aril 25, 1990 (Deree No. 48-92); and (d) to
prepare  future agrarian  legislation:    issuance of the
Presidential Resolutions of the Commission for the Study of
Agrarian  Legislation  (No.  274-92),  preparation  of  a
preliminary draft for an Agrarian Developmnt Law (now
agrarian law). The preceding shows the Government disposition
to  implement  through  the  aforesaid  new  juridical-
administrative framework all the necessary mechanisms from the
preparation of criteria and policis to define and clarify the
complex property problem, to the study of claims with a view
to return the property or to comensate for it.
23. In addition, to guaran   the property rights and the rights
of those presently tilling the land, the Goverment has issued
a Prwiential  olution (No. 275-92) giving the Nn
institute  of  Aian  Reform  instructins   about  the
legislation proces of the Agrarian Reform beneficiaries.
These provisiom eotablish the criteria on property rights and
the proedur to issue the agrarian reform title deed.  The
legal        nt   sud by the Government establishes:  the
legality of the agrarian reform titles, both "''al and

to a    aes  the property problem, have been established without
prejudice to the righte of any person to resort to tho courts,
particularly in the case of a coflict between individuals.
Fortunately,  most of the conermed parties have chosen the

practical and expeditious.
29. In  preparing  the  aforementioned  Agricultural and  Land
Management Project and with the objective of guaranteeing the
necessary juridical-administrative frameork to ffk  the
proed investnt viable, the Government has adopted the
following additional actions: an agreement was signed by the
different levels of the involved institutionB (INRA, INNR
and the Public Register); and Xnter-Institutional Commission
was established with I)M&A, rINET and the Public Register,
headed by  =fls Minister Director, which will hold bi-monthly
meetings to follow up the action planes; an IEcecutive  i

3-.. The  overnment is quite conscious of the great importance of
agriculture in the recovery of the economy in general and in
the imperative need to develop it as a aIne qua non condition
to conolidate the stabilisation efforts.
31. The Govermnt considers that a sutainable agricultural
developmnt program in Nicaragua includes three elements:
ass to the basic production factors (specifically land and
financing), an increase in the profitability of competitive
agricultural activities, and adequate regulations for the
protection of natural resources and the environment.  the
first item requires secue land tenure and the increas  in
credit availability.  In turn, the incre  in cmpetitive
agriculture's profitability requires technical and economic
incentives directed to inputs as wvll as agricultural
products; technical incentives on the suply side to improve
the acces to tachnology and public services with the
objective Of increasing productivity; and economic incentives,
as a comequence of comercial policies that eliminate

subsiies and help open           a  a basis for obtinin
competitiv prices for agricultural products and the reuired
inputs for their production.  The program needs aduat
regulations tor the   ag     nt  d use of natural resources
and the establishment of ensviron=tal criteria to insure the
sustainability of agricultural production. These elements are
the basis of the agrictral sector reforms that the
GovrnMent has begun  to  iMplemet and is comitted to
consolidate as part of the economic stabilization program.
sustainability of the now sector policy frawrk is being
guarante   through institutional refbrus to strengthen the
State's regulatory function, creating a climate favorable to
the developmnt bi the private sector as the engine of the
natioal economy.
32. Dpspite the significant progrs  chieved by the adopted
meaures regarding aga property, there is instability in
the couyide as a result of several factors; deficiency of
the   isti-  legislation on agrarian property, irregularities
in land allocation during the transition period, the absence
of a legal base for titles granted during the agrarian reform
process, diciencies in the cadestre procedures, titles and
registration, and the illegality of ame confiscations and
xprWopriations. Furthermore, the amount of available land to
atitsy  he present demnd has diminishd  and is basically
lim     to the areas of humid tropical forests which are
inappropriate for agricultural activities.
33. *To solve the difficult problem  related to land tenure, the
key concept behind all the measures under the Land Kanagent
component of the Proecst is that the present property rights
and the compensation of previous confiscations must be
separate.The principle is that the right to compensation
must not be eliminated, but that it has its own legal,
administrative and financial stem. on the other hand, the
strategy of individual revisions of agrarian property in all
its cateories (AW,, Cooperatives, Confaiscations, etc.) is
drastically limited by t   afor ntione  factors.   The
dowplexity and contradictions of this process have led certain
areas of the country to a state of insecurity with respect to
land tenure which, it not resolved, wilI make it difficult for
investments  to  flow  in.    Frthersore,  taking  into
consideration the difficulty of the agrarian conflict already
mentioned, as a general policy it has been estblished that

conticated or exproziated proporties would not be return ed,
but rather be replaced by indenitication or compensation by
the State. As part of official policy it has been recognixed
that land poperty must be guaranteed to its occupants holding
a property title, either an agrarian reform title issued by
te former or present Government, or an assignment certificate
Issued by NRA.
34. The Goverment strategy regarding agricultural research and
extension is to convert the present supply driven system,
vhich is financed with public resources, to a dmand driven
system with the private sector's gradual participation in
servicing small produc  through financing mechanisms with
publio  resources, taking into account that these producers
lack the capacity to directly and adequately finance and
manage research and extension services.

35. The sector's institutional s ture has presented serious
probles such as the sector's lack of representation in the
formulation of the national economic program, and a limited
capacity to help-formulate sector policies and contribute to
the preparation of macroeonomic policy, and to plan, execute,
supervise and evaluate sector Pr    and projects. This has
been caused by a lack of precision i defininq the functions
of the main institutions that influence the sector, which has
resulted in overlapping of functions, scattering of resources,
=d low effectiveness and efficiency.
36. The Sector Program will help to consolidate nd strengthen the
role of the sector institutions in policy formulation and
p nroaM  maaemn and would also rationalize and improve
public    ic   planning.  CONAGRO is in the process of
peparing  a  mdium  term  plan  of  prioritized  public

before September 1, 1993 will prepare the 1994 budget for each

the Research Centrs  and   peraton  cente   of the

problems. The representation of producers in the Commissions
ha been limited and veak, and hoizontal links between the
research and extension activities are needed in agricul2ural
activities as vell as between the scientist working in the
different centers. This has given rise to the absence of a

in basic scientific support for fiel research.

40. An aditional problem in the present sytem is that financing
of research and technological extension is       uatend
insufficient, and does not encourage the private *ector
participation in such activities.  The absenc  of financial
mchanism  to  hire  research  fram  the  private  sector,
universities and producer associations prevents the offlcient
use of available rsources, bot  public and private, and
affects the basis for research/validation/adtation.   A
similar problem occurs in t*he oum-m.L. .yWim, which 1i
affeCted by lack of financing for produ   grows in the
contracting of private extenion services.  Thre is also
indequate attention to the research and extesion need  of
smal producers; the research and extension service  of ths
national COMmission On  asic Woods and MAO have a limited
oaphical  coverage  and  a  clear  prioritization  of

resourc  is needed.

Occident. Regional will establish a cooperative. Once it as
been formed, by end-tber 1993, the Goverment Will issue
a decree transferrng ths aset  ad technical assistance
functions to the cooperative.  Xf by end-Sept>eur 1993 the
now cooperative has not been established or it does not accept
the National Cotton Commission (CONAL) assets, the latter will
be transferrd to INTA. If th. assets are transferred to the
dooperative, the Government may continue to provide temporary
budget support from the date of transer, phasing it out, and
ending no later than December 31, 1994.   Xf assets are
transferred to INTA, the Government would maintain budget
support to INTA and in addition rNTA will earn incom through
cost recovery for technical assistance to the cotton
producers.
44. The Genealogical Registry of the National Livestock Comuission
(CNG) will be transferred to nAG before October 31, 1993, the
Artificial Insemination Center will be sold, closed  or
liquidated before Decmober 31, 1993, and the assets and
functions related to the pasture program and the program on
Bnchmak Production units (UPR) will be transferred to INTA
before Decamber 31, 1993.  Thes transtfrs will take into
account the prioritization of public sector resources and the
priorities that have been established during project
preparation. Initially IN) will' not employ more than 10
technicians to handle both programs. The number of personnel
for these programs will be reviewed periodically in the light
of the availability of new finance sources and would be
modified in consultation with IDA.
45. All State facilities devoted to agricultural research and
extension  for  small  and  medium  production  are  being
consolidated in the new Inatitute of Technology, including the
installations of the present National Comimssions on Basic
Foods and Non Traditional Crops and NAG's research and
extension units. As part of the Technology Generation and
Transfer System, the Institute will emphasise academic
excellence and professional experience, a balanced answer to
the real needs of demand, consistency and sustainability in
the process of technology generation and transparency in the
personnel selection process, and the introduction of an
economic basis  for natural resource  and  environmental
preservation. An ample representation'of the private sector
hag been incorporated in the  aoerigsoyufrh inargans

And befor Sep r 30, 1994, all claims ot former owners and
all claims of occupied land without the corresponding titles
should be  ttle.

Eanagement &Project for whioh IDAsa support is requested, and
part of the Cadastre, Title and Registration component, the
bas  for  a  National  Multipupose  Cadastre  will  be
established, the Public Register will be modernized, and
approximately 50,000 property titles will be issued in a
period ot five years.   These actions will solve in an
effective manner the uncertainty about agrarian prorty
rights in  ural areas. Furthemore, the proposed investmet
wil establish a firm basis for the normalization of
boundaries and perimetric asurments of all rural property,
the classifiction of lands according to their productive
potential, and the delimitation of protected areas.
56.  rn addition, the Commission for the Study of Agrarian
Legislation created by Presidential Resolution No. 274-92, is
preparing a preliminary draft of an Agrarian Development LaW,
which will be submitted to the National Assembly before
December 31, 1993.

57. Since 1991 the Government has  pleted different measures
at the macro an sector levels afecting agricultural trade,
marketing and price policies. The objective of these measures
has been to supply the necessary incentives to reestabligh the
profitability of agricultural activities and increase
production and export. Despite this effort, the aggregate
supply response has       limited due to the partial and
restricted  effectiveness of incentives,  pecially  those
offered by the real exchage rate level which is a fundanl
factor to dre the profitability of agricultural exports,,
considering that the overvaluation of the exchange rate is
equivalent to an implicit tax on exorts. Ir; this context,
the aov      nt       comitted to maintain a competitive
exchange rate level to inure the profitability or -aret
agricultural products and the effectiveness of trade and price
policy.

58. An additional qution in tradn pric polic7 1  relat  to
fod a.   icAaqua has r ivd a giat volume (equivalent
to mB$42.5 million durin  1991 and tJ827.4 nillion durg te
first sonse  or 1992) in food aid.  The ain. source or
distortion associated vith food aid is the sale of these food
products at prics lower th    ket opportunity costs.  in
consequence, it is necesay  to rulat the conditions,
volume, handling and colization of food aid, to avoid
the economic costs resulting frm the distortions of national
production and prices.   To this end, the Goverment has
prepared a policy to handle food aid, which includes the
institutional f rk  to negotiate and handle the aid, and
criteria to  et        volumes, composition, handling and
couercialisation  based on private  sector  participation
through a copetitie  qsystem that takes into account the
equivalet total cost of commeial imports. This policy will
e implemented during 1993 to determine the need for donations
in 1994 and ollowig years.
59. On the otaer hand.0 some agricultural prodUcts which were
subject to restrictions on produon  (wood) and exports
(vood, beans and cattle on the hoof) face distortions in their
respective markets. in the cas of basic grains, the lack of
adequate on-tarm storage, the lack of maintenance of the
national storage       tr                ted in WAlkS, the
lack of financing to maintain grain stocks, and export
restrictions have  ta lly  affected the pricgs on beans
and corn. A siuilar sitution is applicable to exports of
cattle on the hoof and its effect on livestock development.
To stabilize domestic prices the Government has canceled the
restrictions on exports of beans and cattle on the hoof. To
eliminate the already mntioned distortions in the case of
wood, the           recently completed a study that suggests
masOuroe to eliminate such distortions in timber market and to
improve the incentive sytem for the sutainable production
and  c er alixation  of  such  products.    The  study's
recoeations rgarding wood exports will he izplemnted
during 1993.
60. On-going  trade  liberalization  could  encourage  unfair
commercial practices from Other c ries due to the reduction
in the level ot ilport protection.  n the frawork of Trade
and Finan  Adju nt Loan (TFaL) financ   by the Inter-
Amrican Development Bank, the Gove nt has executed an
action plan to design a system to address unfair trade

61. The Ge nt bs started a program to ilplmnt a special
custms sys  to emp or refund duties on imported inputs,
from any origin, used in exports*   his  yst   will have a
perm nt  nature.        WMt  respect  to   agricultural
commercialixation, the  "tAt co8my trading these Products,
the  National   asic  Foods  Enterpri8s  (ENABAS),   as
sb:statia.lly reduced its pe      L   and assets and has
restricted its commerce to basc grains (corn, bean and dry
land rice) exclusively.  The Covent hMe formlated a
medium term strategy and an action plan to'redeflae the role
of ENA8 in the ac      cialization of agricultural products.
The action plan, which is being iplemetedcon         lates
reducing th  enteris e participation in the basic foods
market, etablsing for l993 a mazimm of 10% of the basic
grains collcted  nd  the gradual privatization  of the

destruction of natural resources.
63. One of the principal environment pl    associated vith
agriculture in the deforestation of the virgin humid tropical
forest on the Atlantic and the Dry  ropIcal Forest on the
Pacific.  At the present rate the forest areas would be
destroyed in 20 years. The degradation or the dry tropical
forest is the main cause of soil erosion, of changes in
hydrological systems and the reduction in the supply of
tJ.rewood which is the raa  eneg  source in Nicaragua.
Anothor of the more iot   robl  in natural resource
management is assoiat  wit th degradatlon of coastal areas
and the marine ecoy    .  here is little control at present
of ftshing, which reslts in illegal fishing in breeding areas
and during breeing periods.
64. The Governmeot has taken actione to solve the problms related
to foretry and fishing resourcs.  To that end, a Forest
Action Plan, a Conservation Plan for Siodiversity Protection
and a Land Use Pan have been approved. These plan  include
recommenatiow to consolidate the forestry law, guide. to
ter       landse according to its potentialf financing
achanims for forestry anagement, and th  dtination of
pro    daas and zoning of coastal areas*. In the franmworic
Of the  =c I, supported by IDA,  the preparation of an
Environmet Action Plan was begun and vill be completed during
1993.
65. *The Goverment considers that the rational exploitation and
conservation of natural resources is the basis for sustainable
agricultural growth, for which appropriate economic incentives
will be required.   The Forestry Action Plan, the Land
Regulating  Plan and the Conservation Plan  include the
stablisent of criteria  to  prevent  the  uncontrolled
agricultural expanson, and the protection of areas of special
#mportance in the biologicl cyles of marine speciea. These
plan  woul carry out institutional canges in the  gnt
of natural rource  d in  and preserve               areas,
and promote the sustainable exloitation' of natural resources.
TO that end  plans  to  obtain  international technical
assistance and              public investments to promote
prope use of nal r              are being developed during
this year.

preparing preliminary drafts of an Environaent and Natural
Resoure    w contalnng the rules for timber exploitation,
and later on the  iorreso      regulatons will be igsued for
the application of such rules.  The principal elments of
these regulations will include the 4ffinItion of the technical
specifications (areas, spcis, volumes), the establishment of
a revLsed *per trunk" payment systm and a competitive system
to grant  orestry  onessions    The   oer t has also
assued the c m-Itment to financ the demarcation of protected

started the preparation of a proliminary drAft of the fishery
Law containing subsector rules, and later on the corresponding
rebulations vii be issued for the application of such rules.
The principal elements of these regulations will' include the
institutional responibilities and technical specifications,
including cap    areas and periods, tonnage limitations, and
technology to be employed. During 1993 the Government will
su-mit to the National Assmbly the preliminary drafts for a
lav to regulate the use of natural resources and envirorment
presrvation: the General Law of Environment and Natural
Resources, the Forestry Law and the Fishery Law.

AGRICUtLTAL TECHNOLOGY AND LAND MANAGEMENT PROGJCr
TECHNOLOGY GENERAnION AND TRANSE
A BACKGROUND
Production Trends in Naraupa
1.    Agrcultura productio and productivity in Nicaragua haw been hily variable duing the
past two decades. Total production and yields have increased or decW led in response to
frequentl changing government policies. Production respones to tht ' changes have not been
uniform across all commodites and regions; in general, howver, production of export crops and
animal products :;as declined since 1975, while ftat of the basic grains has increased. Te rate of
increase in production of basic grins has, hover, been less than the rate of popuation
incase, resulting in both an ncrease in the importation of basic food commodities as wel as a
decine in conmumption. Furthermore, increaes achieved im the latter half of the 198X were
chiefly in response to unsustainable levels of govenment subsidies (mputs, credit, marketng); as
these have been taken off in the early 1990s production has declined.
2.    During the peiod 1960-1990 total production of corn, beas and rice rose whUie that of
sorgum Inceased until 1985, after which it suffered a sharp decline (see F%gure 1). Increase in
corn production was chiefly a result of yield impm , while that of bean was the result of
inreases in area under production as yield deied (see Figure 2). A sustained trend of yield
incses in corn can be attributed to aw large degree to the growing avaUilability and use by farmers
of high quality seed of improved com varieties, along with the availabiity of subsdized inputs
Substantial yid ieases of beans have been achieved in limited regions where intenshre
programs of on-fam trials and artsanal v. ad production resuted in high rates of adoption of
improved varieties Such efforts have, however not been sufficiently generaized to significantly
influence national production statistics  ized inputs have had little impact on bean yields, as
this crop is less responsive than corn to fertffiation. Rice yields incsed in the late 1970s and
the eady 198( folowing the introductio of new, high-yielig varitie  These vaieties were
devebped for irrgated rice; thus yields declined in the last haf of the 1980s as a growing
proporton of rice production was in rainfed areas and the quality of rice seed deterorated.
Subsantil increases in sorghum production in spite of a major dedine in area under production
have resulted from impressive yield incrase  This can be attributed to the great increase in the
proporton that is produced in the Pacific region and decase in the amount prduced in the
interor. The former is red sorghum produced for animal feeds under intensive agriculture
(irigation, use of improved bybrids and inputs); while the latter is chiefy white sorghum for
human consumption produced by the subsistence sector.
3.    The summary of tnds in production and productivity in basic grams has been given to
demonsrate the strong inter-relationshps between technology and goement poBdes and to
undercore the fact that even when improved techmology is avaiable it cannot significantly affect
national production unless it is adopted by a large proportion of famnae  Ihe availability of
production technol  that will improe yields and profitability will become increasingl important
under new govem nt poicies that diminate production subsidies and mandate intnationly
competitie prices  Improving the insitutional base for the gneration and effectie trsfer to
farmers of such technology will be the principal focus of this AnneL

4.    Trends in yields and tota production of export crops awe summaried in Figures 3 and 4.
All show a maked deline in totl production sn  the mid-1970s, except for sesame, which
sufferd a sudy decine in yields but  crased in area of production, as cotton hectaae
declined. Production of cotton has fallen most as high productio costs and lower prices for
cotton have resdted in a precipitous drop in area under production, from a high in 1975 of
approximaely 200,000 hectares to about 2,SOO hectWaes in 199Q Ecept for sesame, yields of
export cmps inCsed markedly until 1980, after which they decned substantially.

5.    Incead agricultural producton ia needed to meet a growing demand for food and fiber.
That demand is the result of a combination of two factors: populaton growth and dietary changea
Demand is rising most rapidly in the deeping countries due to their high rates of population
growth and the urgent need to overcome seio  problems of malnutrition Since the agriturSa
sector reptesents a key component of the economy of most developing counties, inreaed
produciity in thi secto is one of the most impont factor in economic deveopment. Such
developnt, by geneting changes in consumption patterns resulting from improved income. in
tur, cause ineases in demand for agricultural products that are greater than the rates of
populaion growth. Since agricultural products represent an important portion of exports of many
conmtries, Ireased agriuua production is also important for thc generation of foreign
change; and i     ents in productivity are essential for these products to be avalable at
competiie prioes in a gib market.
6.    During the past centuty most of the gains in agricultural production in the inustrialized
contries lhave been achievd through icreased productivity, the result of a major investment in
agricultural r     The fruits of this research, done primarly in temperate regions, are not
genea  tr rbl to the troal cmates nor the socio-economic conditions of developing
countries Such reseach as was done in the tropics during the colonial era was chiefly on
commeral, export crops. Thus, yield of the basc food crp m develpg countries had until
the late 196k remained _tgant, with production incses ac hieved largely through increases in
area under producdon During the past sever decades it has been  cgnized that production
tecnl   for developing countries must be deaeloped under their edaphoclimatic and socio-
economdc conditions To meet these needs international agricutural resrch centes have been
creaed and national agriculr research programs have been s hened. As a result of these
effors dramaic increas in yields of wheat and rice have been achived in many developing
countries, and mote modest pwductivity increases achied in evral other crops. Recent studies
have shown that the increased producon attributable to new wheat and rice vaeties i sufficient
to feed at least a half bfllion additonal persos, idiating high return on iwvstment in
aIculw research.
7.    Ibe combination of new prduction tchnolgy (chiefy higher-yieding varieties) and area
eO Dsion bas made it possible for world food prducto to keep pace with rapidly increasing
demand  hi wM be more difficlt to achieve in the next several decades, as population in
developing countries continue to grow and the rate of increase in yields decelerates Just when
the need for more agricultural research to meet these chaeng  is most urgent most counties
are cutting back on such inwstments due to budgetary constantL. In order to achieve the
maximum retur on the limited research inestmet it i8 essential that research focus more dcary
on problems of highest priority and that more effective research-extension lnkages be forged.
8     There is growing tecogioa  that some of the production ireases are being achieved at

that has been validated at farm lve and has tbe potential to dgnificantly increae productivity
and reduce pduction costs is cuently avalble. Thus, the most urgent present need is to
accelerate the adoption of this technoloW by producers.
13.   The causes for the low lvel of adoption of avaflable technology include:
(a)   Lack of effective linkages between research and extension and among institutiom
involved in extension actities.
(b)   Inappropriate extesmion methodology.
(c)   Ihadequate coverage.
(d)   High costs of agricultural inputs
(e)   Non-availability or poor quality of seed.
14.   In the pad, most technology was generated only on expermentael stations. Thus fiaes
did not adopt such tecnobly because it was not appropriate to their sucio.economic and agro-
ecologicl condit    and/or they had not seen it appled under thei real condidons. More
recently there has been greater emphasis on on-farm research and on on-farm validation of
technolog, with frmer participatin m the process. Therefore much of the currently available
technology is appropriate, but such onfam trbls and transfer plots have only been conducted in
limited areas. hi type of work is highly desirable and needs to be continued and expanded, but
it is costy in terms of human resource requirments and operatimonal costs This subject will be
dealt with in more detail later in this Annex
15.   Technolg that requires purchased inputs is not being widely used because of the very
high curent costs of these materials in relation to the prices farmers receive for their products,
and due to lack of credit. With impovements in the marketig of both agro-chemicals and farm
products, and renewal of rural credit, this situation should iw2rovme Nevertheless, researh should
aim at developing technology that improves the efficienc of purchased mputs and is not overly
dependant on high evels for production i
16.   Much of the improved technobg is seedbased, ie. the potential for improved
productivy and rsitance to insects, diseases and drought stess are embodied in the seed of
improvd varietis These varieties have been developed and validated for the basic grains and
pastures; but for most of these seed of the new varieties is still available only in small quantities,
and the ability of fars to puXae them is restricted by finaial limitationL The situation
with regad to rice seed is patclarly citicaL lbog past neglect of the industy, the seed
currently being produced has degerated badly in quality, it is not geneticafly pure and is
seously  aminated with red rice (a noxious weed). Some impro t in this situation is
beginng, as seveal large rc growers haw imported clean, geneticaDy pure seed and are
devping thei sed-prduction capacity.
17.   A se-financi  uit of the National Center for Basic Grainm (CNIGB), has the tenicl
and physical failities for seed certification and the production and proceing of seed. In the past
it has produced most of the oerified seed of com, beans and sorghum sold in the country. As
part of te  responsibilities are trnferred to the new Institute for Agricultra tecnuld
(INTA), the latter would produoe only basic seed that wil be sold to private seed producers for
production of   red and ertided seed, and for distribution to frmers for arsanal seed
produco  This would be an   po t over the current situation, but the deveopment of a

local commercial sed idusty (a the main objete) is retained by the lack of effective maket
nmchanisms sad the insbit of farmers to purche quality seed.
18  Ihe National Pats  Pogram, with very imted rce, is producing an impresin
amount of commercil seed of improved pasture  es, and badc seed of a number of hih

19.   in the cas of crops for which small fares usually se their own sd (particdlarly beans
and non-hybdd corn), there is ltle nentive for the developmnt of a commneal seoo industy.
For such crops a nev    ,such as 'non-conventional seed producton   should be supported

Directorte of Agricultr  ebnolok  (DTA) of the Muty of Arltural Development and
Agrarian Reform (MIDINRA)2. The DGTA was composed of thr  diectorte: Crops
(A8icola), Animals (Pecuaria) and Agiultur Etension (Extensn Agropecuaria)
22.   In 1990 MIDINDRA was diided into three entities: The Ministry of Agricdture (MAr),
the Nicarag    Institute for Agrarian Reform (INRA), and the Nicaraguan Institute of Natural
Resource and the Enironment (IRENA). In November, 1991, through the Aucudo Ejecutivo
Mintrial 7, the DOTA was cHlim d and the fie natioal agricultural commiso  (Basic
Foods, Coffee, Cotton, listock, and Non-Trait   Products) were giv  resposibli for

Fund (FD). This fund was crated in 1988 for the purpose of providing funds for the resach
centes, and has been made up chefly of a cess on the value of all commecialzd agricultural
products As of Octber, 1990 this cess was 2 percet on all products, except beans (1%), coffee
(0.25%) and soybeam (0.5%). Ihe total of this fund in 1989 was equivalent to US. $ 1.7 mllion.
Aloctmon of the  funds (as well as modifications in the perentags of the cess) were the
reponsiity of the Comite Rguador of the FDT, chaied by the Minister of Agiulure and
made up of a representatie of the Miitry of Fmance, three representaties of MAO and the
Director of the National Agraian University (UNA). These    were based on advice

Farnms, from small to large, compla that they have had no say in how the funds were used
and perceive no benefits from them. lhe strong opposition to the commission   probably due to
the fact that thei work has not been seen as being either demand-dve or beneficiar-funded.
The demandriven principle was not efecteby implemeted i that the presidents of the

Prod~uct Syatms ad SpeMCfc Crop Problems
33.   EBlven crop production systems hm  been identified for basic grain production
throughout the differt regions of the country. Beddes the mono-culture of cor, beas, rie,
and sorghum, the systems include various combinatin of two crops grown in association; such as,
cam and beam grow  topthw, and various combinations of two crops following each other in
the same field, such as com in the eadry planting followed by bean in late planting.
34.   Each one of the basic grains are grown throughout the entire national terrto, with the
exeptin of sorghum in the Atlantic coast, Consequently, the severity of the factors lmiting
pduction are extremely dhve    This, in turn, is reflected in the diversity of requiements on
the part of producers for improved crop varieties and agronomic practices. Under these
cis_uncaenm the probkml camot be dealt with on a glbal basis - they require a specific set of
actions dependig upon where the crop is grown. Te most serous problems commonly affecting
the basic grins and the export commodities and hvestock are gie below.
35.    ox. Tbe major problem is corn stunt disease, which can cause losses of 70% to 100% in
the Pacific coastal and central interior regions. The commonly used vareies are susceptible to
his diease; however, a variety rently developed by the CNIGB is tolant. Chief among
aonom  problems are inadequate plant populations per unit area, and soil management
36.   Bea_L In beans, the lmiting factors are use of low yielding vareties susceptible to
dieases caused by seedbon pathogens, and poor quality seed. One of the most serious dieases
i rust because of its widespread disibution and its diminising effect on yild. Root rots also
present a seiu production problem
37.   Rimc Poor quality seed, coupled with lack of new genetic matr, particlarly ines
deeloped for 1-pland conditon are the main limiting fazctos. AU    avalable rice
seed i seiously cnOtaminated with red rice, which is a noxious weed. The major disease causing
damage is blast, although white laf vius, rust, and root rot also occur. Inadequate insect and
weed control, feiliaton, and plant density are other limitng factorm
38.   Soru   Complete dendce on imported hybrids for red sorghum (destined for
ial feeds and representing 85% of producion), lack of drought resitat white variet  for
human            high incidence of gay weeds, excessive plant density, and inadequate
fertiliation are the major probms assodated with sorghum.
39.    upqa 1            In cotton, the major problems are lack of adapted varieties, vadetal
puity, ligh incidene of isects, disease and weeds, inadequate use of farm macmety in soi
a       n (sevee cm on), and above all eive and p es     iffectie spoing
(up to 40 appiatons annually). With respect to cofe, the problem areas are inadequate shade
management, unadapted varieties, lack of control of rust, nematodes, and borers, and deficient
fertilatn   In all regin lvestock producton suffers from inadequate herd and pasture
t and insufficient use of mineral supplements and veterinary medicines Jack of
smmer feod and the absenoe of fo    reserves are severe constraints i the Pacific region.

inittive to partcipate in technical assistance services and makig these services avaiable to
qualfd small- and medium-scale producers, the cost of which wil be hared by the governent
on a decling scale basi To that effect a Private Technical Assistan voucee Program wil be
supported by the project with a view toward providing farmers with market choices, and ensuring
their fair share of costs and responsibility for servie selecdon and evaluation. Given the
einovative nature of the PTA program, it will be implemented on a 'ote basis for at lawst the

Expected impact af the ToT Prgm
54.   Tbe adopion by produoers of improved higer yieldng vareties of basic grains not only
reults in icreased production, but also in reduced producton costs due to thek resstance to the
most important dieases and insects, whih  onsequently lessens the need for pedes.
Inceased productivity and reduced production costs will improve rural income, as well as, reduce
consumer etures Since Nicargua is not self-sOufficient in most yes for any of the basic
grains,       produc    wil also reduce  reig echange costs. Resarch already has
generated and validated at farm-level varieies of some of the basic grains that are superior to
those commonly used now by farmers Through the proj's design, the adoption rate of new
technooy by farmers can be exected to increase sgnificantly in the short-to medium- term
55.   In the longerm the research and extension effrts of the institute will impoe income
and natonal productity through continued develoment of new technlog for basic grins and
also fr dr    on to higher value crop. In addition to the benefits dedved from the ne

evaluation of INTA's experience with its own resarh program during its first two years of
operaton, an agricultural research grant program will be establihed and financed u    the
prject to support high prioit  eserh projects that cannot be covered by the Isitute owing to
its sharply focsed mandate and non-availability in the Inbsdtute of all the specialed scientific
disciplines, sklls and qpment required. Individual sintists and ittutin wi be inited to

73.   Stategic Planing. By December 31, 1993, the nstitute would develop a strategc plan
and revise that pla at regular, Slear intervals. Eblents of a strategic plan would include:
(a)   An over   oal satement, indicating the role and purpose of the Institute.
(b)   A declaration of c   -pema pindps that will guide all its activities.
(c)   A stament of pioddes that clearly idicates to wbich poduct and in whch
gions limited resources will be focused. Such prioities should reflect national
priorites as deemnined by CONAGRO.
74.   Pdority setting in reltion to commoditie and regions by CONAGRO should be based on
measurable indicato   such as:
(a)   Value of production
(b)   Area uder pduon.
(c)   Potential for hicrease in area and value of prductio
(d)   I==ome  d empment generati

75.   Once CONAGRO establhes prorities for commodities and regions, those must be
translated    n rear  ad _mtuo    pdorities by and for the Isttute by taing into account
additional criteria, such as:
(a)   Expected cost reduction or yield incre if research and extesion efforts are
successfl
(b)   Probability of success.
(c)   Estmated adoption rate.

the rgon).
(e)   Availability scientific  l and/or fimities.
76.   Opeaioa pIus. Within the frmewrk of the strategic plan opera  l plans will need
to be deeloped annually. Ihese must be more detailed in tem of actvites, budgets and
excted rIts The procedures for deveopment and app l of such annal work plans have
been descibed in general tewms in paras 47 and 48, abov  It i importt here to note that such
work plans must be diecty related to the evaluation or results of the past years astvItie  Peer

plannng and evalua.An process
77.   Eral .edws A mechanism to provide fo pedodic eaution of tbe strategy,
actvies and results of the Institue's programs by a qualifid group of exteal consultants should
also be establshed.

basic grains, pastures, divese crops, integated pest    _   and sW and water
These activities will be subject to revion when a strategc plan establishes longer-term porities.

SOIL AND WATER MANAGEMENT
A INRODUCfION
1.      i Annex describes the Soil and Water   na et Program to be created under
INTA (Instuto Nicaraglense de Tecnoloa  g         and            under the
Agricultral Tehknoogy and Land Managmen_t Proje
2*    The proposed actiities are based on the premie that soil conservation is achieved as a
consequence of impwved lnd husbandry rather than a pre-requisite for better farming. Soil
conservation should teefore become iinsic to xtensi  and to the genral fming practices,
as to improve current agricultur  production and fanmers revenue.
R BACKGROUND
3.    A certain amount of informaion about the land resowurces of Nicaragua already exii m
the form of maps, air photos and reports Studies on the country's rource base were initiated in
the 1950's by Taylor (1). In 1966, the USA1D financed an encompassing study (2) which
included a soi map and the other economically imptat natural reurces, together with the
counrys infa         populaion, and productio base. A series of agrologal, studies by
minstradve Region was prepred under MAO in the late 1980's/early 199Ws (3). These
studies pide genera infation and maps about the geology, hydrology, climate and soils of
each region, as well as soil suiabt and soil use data, complmented by relevnt
recommendations for soil use planning. Watershed development plans covering about 20,000 km2
hae been prepared by IRENA. Other udies include cimate studies (4), natural resources (5),
soil c     n  (6), and lad we (7).
4.    Photomaps coveng about 30,000 km2 of the territory have been develped by INETER.
Cadastr! maps have been prepaed for about 23,000 km2 (18% of the tenritory) at the scae of
1:10,000 and 1:5,000. Although most of this information is vety useful for macro planning
purposes, its usefulness for local sofl conservation plnning is very limited.
Cktd Soil    iI     Pn*k    (Appni 1)
5.    Accordig to IRENA, about 4% of the country's land is hgl susceptible to erosion, 29%
is moderately susceptible and 67% has a low susceptirlity ur  - the present land use conditios
However, of the total area of land that has been surveyed so f& 'covering about 75% of the
territoy), about 14% of the area showed a high to seere degree of erosion, 23% presented a
moderate to high degree, and 63% showed a slight to moderate degee of degrda     The
problem areas are mainly concentrated in the Central and in the Pacific Regions.

20.   The exitng information on sol and water csevto in Nic_aa  indate a
wiespread awaess among technical persel of the problems aociated with lad
degrdatio - decased productivity, reduced usable water, transport and depostion of
sediments, etc. Ts concern is shared by politicis and Government strategists, and i expresd
by the agricul  sector sategy which places sustainable production among the central
objects of agrclua devqpment  he Mvaious watershed devment plans elaborated by
nRNA and the number of projekt with soil consenation component that hv been
implemented in the coumtry to date confirm the general onciousness of the issue and the
polca wM to addes the prm
21.   Hwever, recent insttutional          and the technical approa  establied by
the Government to promote soil onern  have prved inadeqate. In partia, the
plaement of soil managemt unde IRENA - whose basic mandat is to preside environment
protection at larg - and not under MAO, who had the reibility to reach  mers, indates
a mistAken peception of soil conservation as an aunomous aivity, separate from the farmer
prduction systems. As a readt, soil covation activities in Nicrgua have been dispersed and
thei impact has been vey limited.
22.   Achieving soil conservation tbrough good land husbdry meam that soi conservaton
becomes an nteg part of agriuture and exenson, and should be the unvesal framework of
all technic messages to the farmer  It should, therefor-, be intrisic to research and exton
(see Annex C) rather than constiuting a separate service as it used to be. Soil consevation
posal depd upon offeri g short-term benefits (better return per unit input of seed,
fertir, labor), because most farmers camnt wait for long-tetm benefit  They must be based on
practices that make producin  sustainable. Ti invol  the adoption of some strategie that
differ essenti  from the traditional way of handling soil conservatio.
A New Soil Coumatio Stateg
23. To introduce soil conservation as a regular practice aimed to devUlp sustaible farming
sstems in Nicaagu, under the prject INTA wil establish a nat l sol and water  _ t

D. EXE         STTIONSIRATEGY
3&    While so conservaton woud become an itegral part of the technical meages of the
extension service in all regions, more intensive activities would be  trated in prioiy are  of
the Pacific Nd Ceral Regions, where the pramas impact would be economicy  more
sgnificagt.  he Mnapplcti  of the overall tecnical strategy (se parm 24), wi ivolhe
diffrtiated technical soluionm and pracies according to the various agooga stuatons,
producton systems and specific problems (see Appendix 1). The most important aspecs of the
applid technial strategy in Nicaragu would include:
(a)     aimiznsa o I. his principle of the technical strateD is aimed to reduce
splash erosion - which is the stating point of most soi degradation problems,
through the destruction of soil partics and soil sealing Good soil cover is
ensured by the use of mu!h and, partulary, by a vigrous vegetal cover.
Acwrding to soil capabilty, some areas may require a prmanent cover emured by
tree crops or forest stands Optimum cove with annual crops is achieved through
adequate soil paration, co    fertflization, use of adequate varieties and good
quality seed, r m d plant densit, suitable planting date, efficient plant
protection, zeo and minimum tillage, irrigation, etc. The teolocal pac s
these practoes for each specific situation would be defined by the
SWM team durig implementation, with the asitance of the CrA and the
freseen short-term TA, and the interaction of reschers, adexnsi  agents and
(b)   Inproed Intims to maximize water storage in the soil prfie and ensure
good root gowtb, while reducg water lgging and rnofE It is ahievd though
deep ripping, avoidig hadpan-generating sofl pparation pracdces, contour
farming terracing,  mit  sol sealing through vigorous crop cover and
adequae cutivation practces, crop rotation, green manuring, and  nsvation
(c)   Phy     bI     These may be needed particularly on slopes, where the prevous
measures are not sufficient to avoid runoff and its destv   con  a
well as to control gully eron Phyical barie are often a neessry
of roads to avoid erosion damage to the riverie fieds They vay
accodin to dte, soi txure and depth, slope,  nfat crops and, evenally, to
the material locally available. They may be broad or narrow4xs teamces, stone,
wood r conacete baries, trenches, etc. Physical bariers cobute to reduce sl
erosion, im water storage in the water catchments and minimize downm
silting and water pollution Vegetal barers, as an isolate practce or
complementay to pysal barries, are vey useful to stabili crop soils on sopes

They are usually establised with non-expanding perennial gasses such as
sugarcane, elephant grass, lemo gr  or vetivr. Wundbre   are veget batriems
againt acolc eron. Eucalyptus and a number of other fast growig tree speces
have been used in Nicaragua for thi pupo.
39.   The above staegies would tanate, in broad fines, (a) fior the mechanized fming
systems of the Pacific Region - focusing an the intoduction of improved soil preparation
techniques (to coWect ploughpan-generated degadati) and windbreak (to reduce aeolic
erosion); and (b) for the smallolder system in the Central Region - on improig soil cover
through the use of higher planting dendties, contour farming and terracing.  ese practc
would be complemeted by the  troducton of improwvd   _         adequate ertil
formulations (adjusted acording to si analyses and crop needs), crop rotb    gre 
and IPM methods. The main featres of the appled SWM strateg by agrological region are
tentativel summ d in Appendix 1. They should be taken into account at plannig the SWM
researc_NalidationK demontrationmprogram.

a committe composed by representatives of the fas beod  to the above mi t ts,
togethewiAth the local administration and the Extension Servc  Mm basic conditions for the use
of the SCOGP in a seected MC include: (a) the exice of a MC farms  asocaton; (b) the
esece of a MC soil   m      t pa; (c) the formal agreemet of 70% of the farmers of this MC
to implemt the plan; and (d)thageement of the li  d cay out publicwks

25.   IPM is a broad ecolgical approach to pest control utilzing a variety of contrd technolog
compaily in a pest maagemet sytem. To be most effectve, alistic economic injury lels must
be used to determine the need for pest control acom. At the same dme, evezybing posble is done

pathogens. When artifcial conl procedures are needed (eg, chemical pesticide applications,
release of parsites, spraing of an insect vis) they we emplked in as slective a manner as possible
and only when their use is ecnomically and ecologically justied. l   uiltimate objective of the
integrated conol appwach is to prduce the maximum return at minimum cost, taking into
consideration the ecolbg    and soiolgia constraints in each ecosysem and the long term
presvation of the environment (Falcon & Smith 1973)
266 IPM techniques were developed in Nicauagua for the control of cotton pests and although
they were technically successf in large-scale ta  they were not adopted by the grwers Te high
cost of inputs in relation to major pest problems assoated with falling world cotton prices resulted
in a steady decine in cotton cultivation from a maximum of 217,600 ha in 1977178 to no more than
3,500 ha in 1992M3.

beam (105,000 ha), rice (46,000 ha) and sorghum (50,OOO ha) amunt in total to 430,000 ba. Tne
level of pesticide use for the control of the insect pest complce expresed as a percentage of the total
production cost for each crop is 26.9% for rice, 32.9% for com and 39.6% for beam (Table 3).
28. In an area of 430,000 ha this represents an enormous pesticide comumption but so far little
has been done to develop rational pest control strategies, although, from a survey recently conducted
by MAO in collabofation with GTZ it was established that the maoity of pesiides at prent being
used are reatively toxic  hates including chir         , met midophos and turbuphos.
29.   Major insect pests in corn include la chiharita palbus maidis which transmit a viral
infection causing corn stunt and the anmyworm Spodoptera frugiperda which can cause severe
defoliaiolL
30.   Insect pests of beas include the white fly      root eatig pests, leaf deCfliators
and snails or dugs Important pest of re iclude swkig pests and stem borers; insect pests in
orghum include high populatios of the sorghum midge Contarinia orglJ
31.   As for the main hortculu  creps, the cultivated tomato area in Nicaragua (2,000 ha) is small
but provides an important source of food for loc    s  Yields are low (12.8 tlha) compared
with the United States and Europe, due maily to severe insect pest attacks which on occaions can
cause the complete destruction of the crop. Maor insect pe  in tmatoes in Nicaragua mclude the
tomato wom Iklii& spp. and the white fly  eXia tba which trausmits the yellow mosaic vir
causing a drastic reduction in yied. A vaiety of pesticides are used with the number of seasona
applications ranging from 11 to 22 and can amount to 45% of production costs (Table 3). Repolo
or white cabbage simlarly foms another impotan ingredint to the local diet partculaly for use

shown in Tabl 3, 443% of the producion costs is for the control of insect pests The need to
pret an unblemwh  pwduct at the madrt has resulted in calendar applications of pesicide evay
3 to 8 days during the cuvain  of the crop. The main pest is the diamon back moth, Plutega

and basic foods.
41. Ihe present Governent of Nicaragua in its awareness of these problems has, thrugb the
Comisifn Nacional de Plguicida (CNP), reently drafte -and iued- comprheie     l ation
to rgulate future pesdcide use and it is anticipated that this legislation wil soon be legally eforeed.
The legislati  includes stict control for the importation, storage and use of pesticides as recognized
by international safty regulatioa including the absolute prohibition of persistent organochlorine
pesticdes, inluding toxaphene, and the disposd of materials presently stored in damaged containe
42    To ensure the eff_ectveness of these legislation on pestcdes, an efflcit ispection system
needs to be created by MAG/IRENA with authority to impose fimes and the power to dose down
poorly maintained formulation plants or pesticide poJluted air-strips. The disposal of banned or
otdated pesiides, partiuafly when stored in damaged contain  also needs to be undertken and
a desiated area created for the dsposa of empty pestiide container
43.   Support should be gie to MINSA to more effectively record intoiaons throughout the
Pacifc Coastal region of the country, both by blood samplg tchnques and epideigial suie
Equpment and training hxould also be provided to MINSA and CIRA to detmine kl      of

IPM in Caom and Other Food Crops
47. In order to propagate existing IPM technology in corn and to generate new IPM
techoogies nm other bac grains and horticultur crops the project would finance: (a) tials and
d nsaw,p= of com 1PM in peasant farmer  els, focusing on cobntosof pest damage
evaluation methods, the role of naturally occuring pest control agts, making economic decison
and the use of corect plant varietes and culural practc  with the aim of t     20,000 farmers
witbin five year (b) the deveoment of basic IPM progrm  for beans and rice and sorghum
using combin    of cultura practices, mirobia and other slective control stategie and
potenal biolSi  control agents: (c) support research for the imprved control of isect pest of
horticulrl crops such as tomato and caba  to reduce the present high applcatin levels of
conventional pesticide inluding the use of economic thresholds, combinations of microbial
pescies,kIbeation of ma-reared egg paraites and behavio modifying chmias
48.   To carr out these task sven researchers and 29 support stff would be recrited though
redeployment of exiting staf The project would finance boatoy and field aeipment, operatg
costs and 72 man-months of short-term oveseas training INTA would be responuble for

implementing this program and for coordinating work actvities subconraced to the appropriate
Univrsity or Govement agency.
49.   Folow-up actons to the new treo y firaework would include: (a) the establishent of
a pestide safet enforcement inspectorate in IRENA wth powes to clse down poorly managd
frmulation plant or air-strips heavily polluted with pestides (b) the cost of analyses relating to
human intoications and the resources roquired by MINSA to undertake epidemiological studies
thoughout the coast Pacific region of the county, (c) spport to IRNA/MSA/CRA to
determine the levels of nnmental am ton reaulting from pesticide use in soil,
vegetatdon and post4harvest fruits and vegetable; (d) the coract disposal of unwantd pesticid
at preset stored in dmaged containers and the creation of a designated area for the disposal of
empty pesticide containers; (e) the provision of vistu aids and other training equpment to IRENA
to create a greater awareness of the en m   danges in pesticide use.
50.   To carry out these tass, 4 researhers, 13 midlevel technicin and 11 support staff would
be rcruited through redeplyment of existing staff. The Agricultural tecnob and Lamd
Management project would finance the necar laboatoy and ield equipment, together with a
prviion for 6 manlmonths of short term tain  and 12 man/months of external cosultancies.
ItENA and MINSA through the Public Health Deparmt would be responsible for
implementi  the epidemiokg  and human ;irtocattc i sudes  MINSA and CIRA would
implement the pesticide tesidue anabses and IREN /MAG the pestiie disposal facility while
IRENA would coordinate the work and dissmnat the trag elemet.
51.  INTA would cordinate pect acties elatig to IPM and IRENA wold coordinte
actvities relating to envomental monioring
1PM  opnu
52.   The IPM of corn based at INTA will intiallsy cooperate with the piot program established by
CARE International with the aim of extending it over a much wider area IPM programs for other
basic grain and hotdtl crops will also be devebped at INTA and finance provided for specific
rPM components to be conducted by appropriat Niaaguan Unirity Departments and other
Goverment AgeieL
53.   Under the terms of a recently establisbd National Pesticide Commision, the Publc Healtt
Department of MINSA is responsible for the work reting to the e lgical studies and humina
intoxcatons. Ihe provision of equipmet and adional tasport facilities should enable the
expansion of the program at present confind to notwest depatments to include the whole Pacific
coastal area
54.   MNSA togther with CIRA and IRENA would be respone for the pesticide residue stuies
for whih equipment and trainig would be provided in liaison with INTA for the selection of
appro t study areas

57.   lbe outcome of the proect on the enviomnt wM be positie sinoe its essential aim is to
reduce the excesive amounts of broad-spetum pestcdes at present being applied to crops m
Nkcagua by the adoption of insect specfc cotol meures withi the fraework of rPM
packages.hle project also aims to develop monitorig systems to detmine the extent of
environmental contamination due to pesdcides and their effects on human health. A greater public
awarenes of these problem wM be created through an active promotion of relevmt information
through al avilable public infomation media.

fmm by the adption of IPM strategi. This s exp       to sustain these tchniques in. the face
of mounting costs from the oe of convendonal pesticides.
IL ISSUES
59.   During prjw preparation some issues related to pesticides and 1PM were discd,
although final doc were not made, as dicussed below. Although the fact that these issues
have mt been finaly resowed should not stand in the way of successful project implementation, it
would be derabl frm the naional point of view to come to a decision on them as soon as
practicable.
60Q   Althouh the Nkiaguan Govenmet has drated comp         e  gbation to reguate
future pesticide use  co nfrmance with rcgized intertl  safety reguladonsw sh
lelation has yet to be leg  adopted. Althougb Government has issued an Executive Decree
estblishing regulation for the me and handling of pesticides, it would be best to codify these
61.    mere is cearly a need to deternine the scale of  ental contamination foiowing
pop p iand intensi  pestcde use in Nicaragu  Eperec fiom elewhere suggests that
natonal pesde monitoing laboratore are often difficult and expensive to maintain and that an
effective alntive vould be to conac te service to perimental anayical laboratories outside
dte country. However, it can be argued that, gi  the creation of INTA and becau,e of the need

Nr   the option of upading the eqipiment in the light of operational eeiec  The
Government of Nicagua must ultbtey decide which option to follow.

62    Gi   the relative asec of 1PM for the control of basic grain and horticltural crops
elswhere it can be arge that the devlopment of what might be considered as a relative
sophistcated control strategy may not be wlant to the needs of the peasat farmer in Niagu
Hower, much of 1PM philosophy can be regarded as common sense and the experience gathered
from the IPM wok in con in Nicragu sugges that the implmentation of relthie simple
methods can be both prfitable to the farmer by reduciog pesicide use and at the same time
reduce envonm l conminatiL Te  appear to be no reao   hy  ir  program cannot
be develped for othr food cwps and therefore a start should be made.
Disoa of Unwanted Cmicak
63.    ere are at present about 155,000 liters of obolete pesticides in the country, stored to a
great extent in damaged cnaine, representing a great risk to the e nnt. The mion has
cxmined thre alternatie for the inierto of these pesticide: (a) the construction of a local
cinato, (b) th hiing of a mobile ininrato, and (c) the contractingof the remova of the
chemical out of the country. The fist option was dicaded for its high cost (around (US$1.8
miion). Opto  (b) and (c) are both effeti  although cost of opton V (arund US$350,000) is
csidabk lower than cot of ce (US$600,000). On decdig betwee tse two  oices
proposod by the mision, the Govement should klep in mind that option 'c,' although more
expe   , would be the safest solution in tetms of eninme    risk for Nicaragua.

AGRICULTURAL   INOLOY AND LAND MANAGENT PROJECr
P1vat 1Th"  A tnc -voucm ProgIm  (PTA)
1.    One of the main objectv  of the Agricultural Techology and Lnd Mana t Project
i to redefine the role of pubic and private sector intiins/orgnizations, and their relative
contribution to the provision of agiulural tecnical   T Ihe private sector export
commodity oriented entepises (fomer Nationa Commsion of Coffee, Cotton, and Livestock)
wi develop thei own technical assistance p_grams. How , traditonaly the public sewor has
domiated this acvity for the smallerscale produces of basic grains and to some exent the non-
tradiional crps with export potentiaL
2.    Publc sector pmotion and  pport of private sctor mvment i agricultal
extenion is  response to one of the major problems that was identified by Govemment as a
constraint to sustained delomnt of the agricuture sector - insufficient participatio of the
prvate sector in the naonal system of research and extenoa. The mtroduction of the priate
sector into the sytem would reslt in.
(a)   Achieving a shift fiom a 'supply driten' system to one that is 'demand driven.
(b)   Using market incentives to upport quauty imp    and enhanced coveae of
extension e
(c)   Reducing pressure to re-establsh a large public sector bureaucraq for this
purpos-
(d)   Reducing puic sect expeditures hgh cost shaing with producer
beneficares for the services prvided by the pivte secor.
3.     The naue of the technical asine that wil evolv in the PTA prgm  will be a
function of the dend frm the benecatyclient. It is envioed that the demand wM be for
asitae in the productive apecs of the fiam op on, given the fact that the beeciary wili
be sharing the cost of such banm Since the orientation of assistance wi be aimed at
overoming ratber specific constraints t cropanim  producton, the plamed number of 15 viit
per client aually is consderd approprate It is expcted that 40% of the 'voucher would be
used for group vis  and the remaing 60% for indid vitTh I vouchers" would be issued
by MAG as non-endorsa   docments to be           e Veo1  by the (cerifd and
regPIstre) prvider at the regiond branches of BANADES
4.    Targa Prduc_  Prve sector extensio would foc on viable small and  edium
produces of p e          basic foods (maize, bea, nce and sorghum) Tere would also be
prvision for thoe producers interested in diversifying to other crops (cg. tubeu vegetabls and
fri). The non-viable, marginal producrs, as well as th    whose pincpa activity is witk
commodities that come under the pdvatzed National Co m   (coffe, cotto  and litock)
woud not participate mi this        stae of the PTA vucher prgm Ire numbes of small
and medim-sizd grain producs are organized in producer    primari under the UNAG
umbria. My of the esting pducer groups are wl             with legal attrutes and

of teoh   assistance, aso prvide the vehicle for introducing the "multiper efect in spreading
among ot   producers
5.    CwesugL Prelimbnay estimates put the nmber of producr in the taget group
descibed in para 4 at 80,0. Of these, howevr, it is thought that aound 40% (32,000
producers) would represent a segment of the target group that should continue to have available
to them the services of techncal afistar fiom the public sector (INTA) on a non-cos shaing
basis However, additional at o needs to be given to chaateri  and more precisely identify
this group. Ihey may be producr in the early stages of group orgnization  o those that would
be takig geater than nomal risk because of dirfyin into other crops for whi  they lack
experince. In any event, the new Technology Istitute would be primarly responsible for
attending to this group of produocs, which may be in the order of magnude - 25,000 to 30,00.
6.    On tis bas some 50,000 producer coud possible costtute in the future, the potnal
clientele for the private sector, inlduding NGOsL To get an idea of e ion coverage it is
necessay to establish "exenion agets per producer-Clint ratios, recogaing at the same time
that coierable caution must be eaercised because the idea  int     must be "locW
determined." With this reservation in mind, a private agent workng with producer groups, and
uing vaying "mutipler effiet techniques, ould probably reach from 100 to 120 producers
(1:100-120 ratio). From this, an apprmation of diffent taet oveg scenarios can be

Agrin Reorm LAW - Deces 782 Under that law,       landholdings (over 350 and 700

the time induded authorties of the curret (Mrs. Violet Baios de Chamoro's) adminitration.
1S.   Under this legsatve framewotI6 lad wa  mainly reocated to Santinista Cooperat
(CAS) and to individual peasanta  By the end of tis phase, the propet Wucre in the

acoumting for 22%, 10% and 0.8%, rective, of area under cutivatio with agricultural crops
16.   The nid  Phase,' frm June 1985 to Januay 1990, brought major changes in a
rerm policy. Land was peerentIally allocated first to individual peasnts (223,000 hectares)
and th  to CAS (190,000 hectares)  Poliy chnges we prompted by: (a) land seizue by
peass in Masay that rested in the actment of the Law to Reform the Agrarian Refirm
w  (Law No. 14 of January 11, 198), and (b) the aled deerioin of the national
economy.
17.   The 'Fourth Ph, the transition period' of February 25 to Apri 25, 1990, was
by an acceleraed allocation of lands to inividua faimes and to CAS Much of
th  land came from the APP. Laws Nos 84,87 and 88 legally conolidated the Sandlnsta
Agratian Reform   T were Issued in March, 1990.

lnd tenure structure had been modifid usubnt . Broadly seins lnd ditrution satisd
many farmer'            It covered about S0% of the hisbto    demand for land, according to
timtes of the Niaraguan Instute for Agrrian Refom (INRA). Mlb agrarian refom gave
Nicaagua the most equiab  distribution of land im LAtin America.
19.   Despite proge on equity groun  in the distbuion of lnd, the new government
inherited a seiousy flawed rurl land ownerip syem. Major problms included:
(a) incncies and dcges in the agrireordm k_ aion; (b) badequate promdur  and
irregularii in the           of land Alocation; (c) lea insecurity of land ownesip tides;
(d) allegd Meaty of certain  Opraton and             and (e) allegatios of abuse by

LAND ANAGEMT COMPONENT
BACKGROUND
1.      m now speam's prapsl ad abjetium  Me cadastre tiding and land registry component of
this pject would establsh a strong nadonal lad ad aion with unified policies, legislation, and
procFdure to estabish the bas lfr a susaible and legall consitent land tenure system providig
security and srghIng land prpty rights in rural aa  Th Natonal Program of Cadastre,
lig  and RI&tiy (PNCIR) is a joint progam of the Instituto N caragense de Reforma Agraria
(NRA), the Instituto N        de Esudics Teials (INER), and the Registro Publco of
thle Namno Suprex CourL
2.          The PNCI is a combiation of coorda ited and interrelated technical and legal
actvities which sene to stabilize rural property nghts and ensure securiy of tenurev The three basic
components of the PNCMR are
()    the turacad;stre
(i)   the titling and land tenure        of rural properdes; and
li)  the registry of new titla and ruaiao of other rural  prperts
3.          The thr  component of the PNCMR aim to prvide the Govement of Nicara
(GON) with a crehensiv  perman    and easily maintainable land adminisation tool with
muliple legal, financial and development functons. It would faciitate equitable land divisions in the
future, *Mph    oppotunities to deveop viabl land markets, provide hrnsparen  of land
decrease frud promote  stiutnal confidence and provWide the legal basi for the ies
issued. A stong land titling ad land    e  aion program will alow the GON to extend
secure land teu  to a large number of small fnne  im    the       ts' abUity to title,
rete, and administer land resources, formlate and sector policies, dramaticaly reduce tesions and
confcts over land prpery rights, and support ecomc actvies by creatig viable and secue land
4.     -h_tLflmd.U  lbe proes of land tg  and land tenure  ltion depend on substantive
action and a bigh doeg   of wel coordinated interaction betwee the Participating institution in the
PNKTR. An  i          ional agreement would establish the working rlaonships and
of each of the p  aing instutios of the PNCIR Th inter-institutional
(i)   The ost iuito          de Reforma Agria (INRA) would be the imple t
agency fr the land magment omponent (cak.  . titliqg and re  ) and serve as
ovel program coordiat for the PNCIR
(ii)   An intetl  technical committee was established incoratng mben of

to asume a key role under this prject
11.   Given the poor and spect state of lad record both in the Cad  Ofi  (NER)
INRA and the Registro PubliHo, the most cost effective approach wM be to create a new cadase
based on a          geodet grid, acquie nw up-todte aeri photgaphy which wM allow the
Imi of each pare to be tied to the natonal geodetic grd and abandon the pret   h

1     The prest godetic grid needs to be  etablished since INEER esmates that 40% of the
fist order geodetc contl points are mising in the western region of Ncargu alone Te
establishment of a national geodetic grid would cover the whole country.    200  st
