This report concludes that the Romanian\n            system of laws, regulations and practices in the sub-sectors\n            supported by the projects is sufficiently equivalent to\n            those of the World Bank, and sufficiently acceptable in\n            practice, to support piloting under OP/BP 4.00 in four\n            safeguards-related areas. Two of these areas, environmental\n            assessment and cultural property, require very little if any\n            gap-filling. Gap-filling is needed to a greater extent for\n            piloting involuntary resettlement. Should dam safety issues\n            arise in association with the Municipal Services project,\n            the Romanian systems are believed to be also equivalent and\n            acceptable for piloting with very little if any gap-filling.\n            Second, World Bank supervision on safeguard-related matters\n            will continue throughout the projects' implementation\n            to: (1) ensure compliance with \"equivalent and\n            acceptable\" Romanian procedures, (2) assess\n            implementation of gap-filling measures, (3) ensure\n            compliance with Bank policies if/where they apply in lieu of\n            Romanian systems, and (4) looking more broadly, track\n            results in terms of environmental and social development\n            outcomes. This will include a review of monitoring reports\n            as agreed with the Borrower."}, "docdt": "2006-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
