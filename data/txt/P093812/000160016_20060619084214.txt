(Communications Officer, ECCBK). Critical support on mission logistics and outreach within 
Romania from George Moldoveanu (Team Assistant, ECCRO) and Alexandra Caracoti (External 
Affairs Officer, ECCRO) was invaluable. Technical input was also provided by Gabriel Ionita (Senior 
Agricultural Specialist, ECSSD) and Peter Dewees (Lead Environmental Specialist, ECSSD). Peer 
review and management insight from other Bank staff, including Maninder Gill, Arlene Fleming, 
Doina Visa, Stephen Lintner, Charles di Leva, Laura Tuck and Benoit Blarel, as well as Task Team 
Leaders Sudipto Sarkar and Henry Kerali, is very much appreciated. Finally, the team would like to 
thank ECSSD, QACU, ECCU5, and OPCS, who generously assisted in the financing of staff and 
travel resources over and above project budgets to carry out this work. 
The report was reviewed by a working group in the Ministry of Environment and Water Management 
of Romania, to ensure that the results of the study are accurate and reflect national priorities and 
support. The working group is lead by Mr. Silviu Stoica, Director of the Environment Department 
(MEWM), and includes the following specialists: Ms. Adriana Baz (Director, Department of Nature 
Conservation, Biodiversity, and Biosecurity, MEWM); Ms. Elena Dumitru (Director, Department of 
Solid and Hazardous Waste Management, MEWM); Ms. Angela Filipas (General Director, 
Department of Impact Assessment, Control Pollution and Risk Management, MEWM); Ms. Camelia 
Calatan (Department of Authorization and Horizontal Legislation, NEPA); and Ms. Doina Cioaca 
(Department of Nature Conservation, Biodiversity and Land). The working group also coordinated 
input from other Ministries; their input is also appreciated.

Introduction 
1. 
Background.
 Following extensive global notification and consultations, in March 2005 the 
World Bank Board approved a pilot program to test the use of borrower or 
“country” systems to meet 
the objectives of World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies. This led to the issuance of 
World Bank Operational Policy 4.00
1
(OP 4.00) which lays out specific criteria for advancing pilot 
projects. It was recognized in the background paper for Board consideration that sector-specific Bank 
operations in new member states and candidates for European Union (EU) accession hold particular 
promise as pilots.  
2. 
Project Descriptions.
 Two operations proposed for Romania for piloting OP 4.00, are the 
subject of review in this report: the Municipal Services Project (MSP) and the Transport Sector 
Support Project (TSSP). The Municipal Services Project will support the rehabilitation and 
improvement of wastewater, stormwater and drinking water systems to reduce pollution, improve 
public health, and assist Romania in meeting environmental requirements for European Union 
accession. The Transport Sector Support Project will provide funds to rehabilitate, maintain and 
improve national road and rail systems.  
3. 
Methodology.
 In cooperation with Romanian officials, and with the support of European 
Commission staff, the World Bank has compared the Romanian systems (including those which stem 
from EU directives) against the objectives and operational principles laid out in OP 4.00-Table A1 for 
safeguards that would normally apply to these two Bank-assisted projects. This assessment included a 
legal and technical review; both on paper and through field interviews and site visits.  
4. 
Scope of the Pilot. 
The equivalence and acceptability assessment addresses environmental 
and social safeguard issues which are triggered (or were once considered as possibly triggered during 
preparation) by the projects in the following areas: (a) Environmental Assessment; (b) Involuntary 
Resettlement;  (c) Cultural Property, and (d) Dam Safety. As per Bank’s policy on Environmental 
Assessment, both projects are categorized as an environmental category B.  The Bank’s policy area on 
Involuntary Resettlement will apply only to the TSSP, as it may require small scale land acquisition 
(albeit without physical relocation of households or businesses). Based on current project information, 
neither project is expected to any affect known physical cultural resources, but the MSP may be active 
in historic areas so the cultural property safeguard is triggered.   
5. 
Public Consultation and Disclosure.
 Report conclusions were discussed at a public meeting 
in Bucharest on December 12, 2005, following disclosure in Romania of a draft Executive Summary. 
A
full draft report was disclosed in English in the World Bank InfoShop and in Romanian on the 
MEWM web site January 25, 2006. The comment period in Romania closed on March 10, 2006; no 
comments were received from the public. This revised version reflects: (i) clarification of information 
and supporting analyses from the draft, and (ii) a decision to not pilot Involuntary Resettlement.  
Equivalence and Acceptability Assessment: Principal Observations   
6. 
Environmental Assessment (EA)
.
The World Bank examined the equivalence and 
acceptability of Romania’s EA system along two lines: EA approval procedures, and compliance 
monitoring during construction and operation. The Bank is pleased to note that there is a well defined 
process in place for screening, review, public consultation, disclosure, and approval of EA documents. 
Regarding screening (i.e. determination of the appropriate EA category), projects falling on

Romania
’s Annex I list
2
would typically fall within the World Bank’s EA Category A. Mandatory full 
EAs required under Romania’s system provide an equivalent level of attention to assessing risk, 
alternatives and mitigation/monitoring (i.e. scoping) as compared to World Bank requirements for 
Category A projects. Both the Municipal Services and Transport Sector Support projects are, 
however, Category B for Environmental Assessment under the World Bank system. Most sub-projects 
correspond to the comparable Romania Annex II, sub-project categories being considered under the 
Municipal Services and Transport Sector Support projects will likely, therefore, be subject under the 
Romanian system to at least an equivalent approach to EA screening, scoping and analysis as set forth 
in World Bank OP 4.00.  
7. 
While the EA documents are prepared by project proponents, an independent Technical 
Committee is established by government to review each project. The committee include 
representatives of local and regional environmental agencies, other local officials, representatives of 
the Health Services, the National Environmental Guard (inspection service), the Romanian Water 
Company (“
Apele Romane
”), research institutes, and others as deemed necessary. Public participation 
during the EA process includes at least one public consultation, and as many as three public 
announcements in local newspapers or on the local environment agency website. This approach 
should achieve comparable outcomes as envisaged by the Bank under OP 4.00. Environmental 
sections of standard bidding documents for roads and rail projects were examined and found 
comparable to the core mitigation and monitoring aspects of stand-alone Environmental Management 
Plans normally included as a requirement of World Bank safeguard policies. 
8. 
Regarding implementation, a successful project application results in the issuance of two 
documents which contain mitigation and monitoring measures comparable in aim to the 
Environmental Management Plan required for Bank projects. Following the acceptance of the EA, an 
Environmental License to Construct
 
(called the “environmental agreement”) is issued by municipal 
authorities for all projects with civil works. After construction, the project proponent is required by 
law to apply for the 
Environmental Permit to Operate 
(sometimes called “environmental 
authorization”), which is issued only after a review by local or regional environmental authorities. 
The 
Environmental License
 sets the measures/conditions to mitigate adverse impacts during 
construction and is issued by the competent environmental authority based on the information 
obtained during the environmental assessment process. The 
Environmental Permit to Operate
 (issued 
by environmental authorities) verifies that mitigation and monitoring measures are in place.  
9. 
The permitting process includes setting wastewater discharge limits (by 
Apele Romane). 
Discharge standards and wastewater management programs (e.g. receiving water quality) set by 
Romanian authorities are aligning with comparable EU directives on wastewater and watershed 
management (as transposed into Romanian law), and are quite consistent with the Bank’s narrative 
descriptions of good water quality management programs in the Pollution Prevention and Abatement 
Handbook (Part II).  
10. 
This review included meetings and site reviews in cooperation with environmental officials at 
the local and regional levels. In Romania all key environmental responsibilities fall under the Ministry 
of Environment and Water Management (MEWM). Preparation for EU accession has led, and will 
likely continue to lead, to considerable increases in staff at both the policy and field levels. A core 
group of environmental specialists are also on staff in key regional offices responsible for rails and 
roads; a very important element in practical implementation of environmental requirements.  
11. Regarding 
compliance 
monitoring
,
an independent agency under the MEWM – the National 
Environment Guard (NEG) – is tasked to carry out this responsibility. The NEG is being staffed up 
and responsibilities strengthened through passing bylaws and establishing good working procedures. 
An ambitious training program is also being implemented. If violations in licenses or permits are 
found, the NEG has a range of administrative orders and penalties to issue at its disposal. There seems 
2
Annex I to GD 918/2002; projects subject to mandatory EA; based on EU Directive 85/337/EEC as amended 
Page  8
viii
 
to be serious commitment at the senior management level to improve the overall compliance level. 
The trend is positive, with reportedly increased fines for violations, more transparency, and reduced 
ambiguity in setting the fines (thereby helping reduce corruption). It should be noted, however, that a 
fully staffed NEG will not be in place for about a year, so effectiveness cannot yet be fully 
documented. 
12. 
In the area of Environmental Assessment, the safeguard diagnostic review concludes that 
there are no gaps regarding the equivalence of Romanian systems that would inhibit piloting.  
13. 
With respect to EA implementation practices (the core of the 
“acceptability analyses”), the 
Bank finds the current approach and direction of Romanian institutions in carrying out sub-sector 
laws and policies (including compliance and enforcement) to conform to OP 4.00. While several areas 
would benefit from strengthening (as part of the country’s overall improvement in environmental 
management and implementation of sectoral policies), these are not significant enough to hinder the 
Municipal Services or Transport Sector Support projects from being approved as pilots. Capacity-
building under European Union programs, as well as the proposed World Bank Environmental 
Management Loan, while not required for piloting under OP4.00, will be very supportive to further 
enhance Romania’s system in this area. 
14. 
Cultural Property
.
Regarding cultural property, the Bank believes that Romanian systems 
are equivalent and acceptable for application to both operations. If either operation would require 
construction or rehabilitation near to historic buildings or other physical cultural resources, or if 
“chance finds” are encountered, Romanian systems are at least as effective as those outlined in OP/BP 
4.00 on such points. Inventories of buildings and sites of cultural significance are available, and are 
consulted to assess whether proposed investment projects might cause impact. Local experts on 
archeology, architecture and other relevant fields are brought in for assessments before construction 
decisions are made and after, if “chance finds” are encountered during construction. While there have 
been reported instances where construction has taken place in areas of cultural importance without the 
full engagement and approval of experts, this does not appear to be a systemic issue which would 
hamper the acceptability of piloting in this area. The Bank will work with Romanian implementing 
authorities to closely monitor this aspect.  
15. 
Involuntary Resettlement.
 No Involuntary Resettlement is envisaged under the MSP.  The 
Transport Sector Support Project may involve small-scale land acquisition, but is not expected to 
cause actual physical relocation of households or businesses
3
.
Accordingly, the assessment focuses on 
the principles of OP 4.00 that are applicable to expropriation and land acquisition. The Bank 
commissioned a thorough legal analysis of expropriation and related legislation, met with officials in 
national and local governments who deal with expropriation, property assessors, and people whose 
land had been expropriated.  As will be noted below, gap-filling measures would have been needed if 
the decision were taken to pilot this safeguard area.  The extent and timing of gap-filling was 
considered by the Romanian partners, but it was finally decided to not include Involuntary 
Resettlement in the pilot for use of country systems. Consequently, Bank guidelines on Involuntary 
Resettlement as embodied in OP/BP 4.12 will apply to the TSSP.  Nevertheless, major conclusions 
from the review are noted below. 
16. 
Unlike the case of Environmental Assessment, the EU does not have community-wide 
policies or directives regarding the expropriation of land by government, or the subsequent 
resettlement of people or loss of income. Each member state has its own laws and procedures on these 
matters.  
17. 
Expropriation in Romania is governed by Law 33/1994 which establishes principles and the 
framework for expropriating private land for public use. This law is supplemented by Government 
3
During preparation it was also expected that the Municipal Services Project might trigger this safeguard, but 
following further analysis in Bucharest and Arad, this policy area is not expected to apply. 
Page  9
ix
 
Resolution 583/1994, which specifies procedures for investigations required to establish 
“Public Use”. 
The law and procedures apply to expropriation carried out by all levels of government—national 
county and local.
4
Little expropriation was carried out for many years following the fall of the 
Ceausescu regime, as there was little infrastructure development or rehabilitation activity. More 
recently, however, significant investments in highway construction on the national level, and 
rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure on the local level, have increased the incidence of 
expropriation in the country. 
18. 
The review found equivalence between Romania’s system on land acquisition, and several of 
the operational principles on involuntary resettlement of Table A1 of OP/BP 4.00, including: 
emphasizing alternatives that do not require expropriation; applying similar standards and procedures 
at all governmental levels and for all aspects of an investment; establishing baseline ownership 
conditions; including consultations, public participation and systematic disclosure of decisions and 
designs; using market value as the compensation standard, with the possibility of additional 
compensation for damages and lost benefits; requiring prompt payment; providing compensation for 
the loss of assets by third parties and persons without formal rights.  
19. 
The safeguard diagnostic review also found several areas in which Romanian expropriation 
laws and procedures are not equivalent to principles in OP/BP 4.00. Neither Romanian laws nor 
practices explicitly: (i) require a baseline socio-economic survey for expropriation; (ii) call for follow-
up monitoring and assessment; (iii) notify affected persons of their rights; (iv) grant special 
consideration to the poor, vulnerable or other special groups; or (v) give preference to a land-based 
strategy. Three of these differences would not significantly affect achieving the objectives of OP/BP 
4.00 in the pilot projects. The lack of a socio-economic survey would not materially affect outcomes, 
as the combination of compensation for loss of assets and “prejudice,” (damages and lost benefits) 
should be adequate to enable affected persons to maintain their socio-economic status. Similarly, the 
law is applied uniformly regardless of the physical or economic status of affected persons, although 
the provision of prejudice may be invoked to compensate for damages. Finally, affected persons have 
access to an open land market which enables them to purchase alternative lands, if they wish, without 
requiring an administered land replacement system.  
20. 
Two differences are significant however, and pertinent to the projects. First, as compensation 
is assumed to be adequate, there is no monitoring or assessment of the impacts of expropriation. 
Second, Romanian authorities do not systematically inform affected people of their rights, as required 
in OP/BP 4.00. The safeguard diagnostic review concludes that these differences could be mitigated 
through gap-filling measures if piloting was to be carried out.  
21. 
The acceptability assessment concluded that the expropriation process in Romania is 
implemented according to the law and is markedly consistent with OP/BP 4.00. Some key strengths in 
the expropriation process are: legislation and procedures apply uniformly to all administrative levels; 
the systematic involvement of a wide range of institutional stakeholders in the preparation and review 
of expropriation decisions; the use of market value as the compensation standard with the provision of 
additional compensation for damages; judicial review of all purchase agreements and resolution of 
disputes; clear payment requirements; and the requirement that all expropriation must be completed 
before a Construction License is issued.  
22. 
The acceptability assessment also found some areas of weakness that were largely related to 
lack of transparency in the valuation and negotiation process, and little track record with regards to 
dealing with more complicated issues such as impacts on livelihoods and illegal occupation. Gap-
filling measures to address these areas were discussed with Romania, although a conventional 
4
For highway construction, Law 198/2004 was adopted, which applies only to highways and national roads. It was 
supplemented by Methodological Rules of June 10, 2004. In addition to existing provisions of Law 33/1994, Law 198/2004 
prescribes the use of escrow accounts to enable the expropriator to pay compensation in cases where ownership is unclear or 
contested, thereby speeding up the expropriation process. The 2004 law does not apply to the pilot projects.

approach through the application of OP 4.12 was selected for the TSSP. Following the final stages of 
preparation the MSP was deemed not to require expropriation and the policy is not triggered.

Bucharest and Arad for the bulk of investments), it was possible that candidate sub-projects might 
have included rehabilitation or extension of drinking water systems where supply is obtained from 
dams or other control structures. New dams would not have been financed by the project, nor would 
dams have been rehabilitated under the project, but the capability of Romanian authorities to ensure 
dam safety was considered important should water supplies under the project be associated with 
control structures. Good alignment was found between Romanian requirements and those of the Bank 
for dam safety. Experience by the World Bank in ongoing projects in Romania also suggests that the 
country
’s system for ensuring the safety of existing dams that are utilized for water supply is adequate 
for piloting. The project as appraised, however, does not include investments reasonably associated 
with any control structures so the dam safety safeguard is not triggered. The information gathered 
during this assessment is left in this report, however, for general information and possible relevance to 
future projects.
 
Principal Observations 
–
Other Issues 
24. The 
Bank’s Policy on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50) may be triggered by some sub-
projects in the Municipal Services project, and procedures under OP/BP 7.50 do apply. As per OP 
4.00, this policy cannot be piloted for the use of borrower systems.  
25. 
There is no information to indicate that other safeguard policy areas are applicable to the 
proposed projects.  
Conclusions 
26. 
The results of this diagnostic review indicate that the operational principles of EA as stated in 
Table A1 of OP4.00 and the Romanian system of laws, regulations and procedures in the sub-sectors 
to be supported by the proposed Municipal Services and Transport Sector Support projects have many 
common features and that there are no gaps that are relevant to these projects. With respect to the 
acceptability, it was also found that Romania’s current approach to EIA conforms to OP 4.00. 
Regarding Cultural Property, Romanian systems are considered equivalent and acceptable. While 
there have been reported instances where construction has taken place in areas of cultural importance 
without full engagement or approval of experts, this does not seem to be a systemic issue and the 
Bank will work with the Romanian implementing agencies to closely monitor this aspect. Gap-filling 
would be needed for piloting Involuntary Resettlement, but it was finally decided to adopt a 
conventional approach and to not include this policy area in the pilot. Consequently, Bank guidelines 
on Involuntary Resettlement as embodied in OP/BP 4.12 will apply to the TSSP 
 
27. 
Regarding monitoring and reporting
.
Romanian entities will prepare bi-annual monitoring 
reports to monitor the implementation status of the EAAR, and identify issues or problems which 
need to be resolved. 
28. 
Safeguard-related matters will be supervised regularly by the World Bank throughout the 
implementation of the two proposed projects.

1. 
Starting in 2005, and extending over a two year period, the Bank will be supporting a limited 
number of pilot projects in which lending operations will be prepared using the borrowing country
’s 
systems
5
for environmental assessment and other environmental and social safeguards, rather than the 
Bank’s operational policies and procedures on safeguards. The rationale for using country systems is 
to scale up development impact, increase country ownership, build institutional capacity, facilitate 
harmonization and increase cost effectiveness. These pilot operations are governed by a new 
operational policy
6
(OP 4.00) on “Piloting the Use of Borrower Systems to Address Environmental 
and Social Safeguard Issues in Bank-Supported Projects.” This policy sets forth the methodology, 
enumerates the criteria for assessing country systems, and specifies documentation and disclosure 
requirements and respective roles of the client country and the Bank. 
2. 
The Bank considers a borrower’s environmental and social safeguard system to be equivalent 
to the Bank’s if the borrower’s system is designed to achieve the objectives and adhere to the 
applicable operational principles set out in Table A1 of OP 4.00. Since equivalence is determined on a 
policy-by-policy basis in accordance with Table A1, the Bank may conclude that the borrower’s 
system is equivalent to the Bank’s in specific environmental or social safeguard areas in particular 
pilot projects, and not in other areas.
7
Before deciding on the use of borrower systems, the Bank also 
assesses the acceptability of the Borrower’s implementation practices, track record, and institutional 
capacity. The above approach and criteria for assessment were developed with inputs from external 
stakeholders such as representatives of governments, bilateral and multilateral development 
institutions, civil society organizations, and the private sector and are consistent with commitments 
made by the development community in the March 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. 
3. 
Romania is one of the few countries that are being considered for piloting the use of country 
systems, specifically in the proposed Bank-assisted Municipal Services Project (MSP) and Transport 
Sector Support Project (TSSP). The following sections describe the scope methodology and findings 
of the equivalence and acceptability assessments carried out by Bank staff in co-operation with 
Romanian officials, European Commission officials, and consultants and local specialists. The 
proposed pilot is expected to bring the added benefit of moving towards harmonization of 
environmental and social safeguards requirements among the Government, the World Bank and other 
development partners such as the European Union, European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, European Investment Bank, and other financial institutions and donors who support 
similar projects in Romania.  
5
Country systems is defined as the country
’s legal and institutional framework, consisting of its national, sub-national, or 
sectoral implementing institutions and relevant laws, regulations, rules, and procedures that are applicable to the proposed 
pilot project.

The Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies will apply to the areas which the Bank has determined not to be 
equivalent to its applicable policy framework and will continue to apply to all projects that are not part of the pilot program.

ESCRIPTIONS
 
2.1 
Romania Municipal Services Project (MSP) 
4. 
The proposed Romania MSP will be implemented by three implementing entities, namely: the 
Municipality of Bucharest, the Municipality of Arad, and the Ministry of Environment and Water 
Management (MEWM). The project is rated as Category B for Environmental Assessment
8
,
and has 
the following three components: (i) urban services in Arad Municipality; (ii) urban services in 
Bucharest Municipality, and (iii) a technical assistance component.  
5. 
Components (i) and (ii) entail 
investment
,
for improving urban services in Bucharest and 
Arad through: 
ƒ
Rehabilitation of existing drinking water networks; 
ƒ
Rehabilitation of existing sewerage lines; 
ƒ
Rehabilitation of existing storm water drainage lines; 
ƒ
Rehabilitation and upgrading of existing drinking water treatment plants;
9
ƒ
Rehabilitation and upgrading of existing waste water treatment plants; 
ƒ
Construction of new drinking water networks; 
ƒ
Construction of new sewerage lines;  
ƒ
Construction of new storm water drainage lines; 
ƒ
Paving of roads where the above works have been carried out. 
6. 
The technical assistance component (component iii) consists primarily of: 
ƒ
Consulting services to prepare water and wastewater feasibility studies for projects in 11 
counties 
2.2 
Romania Transport Sector Support Project (TSSP) 
7. 
The proposed Romania Transport Sector Support project is categorized as a Category B 
project for Environmental Assessment and will be structured as a specific investment loan. The 
project will be implemented by the Romania National Company for Motorways and National Roads 
(NCMNR) and Romania National Railway Company (SNCFR) for the national roads and railways, 
respectively; for the county roads (see below) a new management entity will be established. The 
project will consist of the following components: 
ƒ
A
roads component comprising: 
o
Periodic maintenance of selected key sections of the national road network, in line with 
the Governments on-going program; 
8
Earlier versions of the Bank
’s Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS) noted a proposed FI category with possible A and 
B
sub-projects in several cities. The project as now envisaged does not include landfills or wastewater treatment plants, nor 
is it currently slated to provide co-funding for cities beyond Bucharest and Arad. With a focus on rehabilitation and minor 
systems expansion, the latest ISDS notes the more appropriate Category B rating. 
9
As of April 2006, rehabilitation and upgrading of drinking water and wastewater treatment plants may not be financed, but 
since the analyses have been carried out, the results are included in this document. 
Page  13

o
Technical assistance to improve the capacity within NCMNR to effectively manage road 
maintenance and rehabilitation. This comprises studies and consulting services aimed at: 
(a) preparing and implementing a pilot output-based area-wide multi-year maintenance 
contracts, with the objective of gradually expanding the coverage to the entire country 
within four years; (b) hiring a Technical Adviser to improve management and technical 
capacity within the RNCMNR; and (c) the design of maintenance and rehabilitation 
works.  
o
Technical assistance for county road management to develop the operating procedures 
and competitive selection procedures for Rural Roads Maintenance Consultancies 
ƒ
A
railway component
 consisting of: 
 
o
Periodic maintenance, repair and overhaul of main lines; this sub-component is designed 
to fund three types of maintenance works: (a) overhaul of public infrastructure - tracks, 
bridges, tunnels, embankments, interlocking and signaling electrification systems; (b) 
repair and maintenance of tracks, bridges, tunnels, and embankments; and (c) repair and 
maintenance of interlocking, signaling, and electrification systems at border stations;  
o
Technical assistance to SNCFR for the implementation of railway infrastructure 
maintenance management systems. 
2.3 
Rationale for choosing the MSP and TSSP for Piloting  
8. 
Joining the European Union is one of the central development objectives of Romania with the 
recently signed Accession Treaty committing the government to EU membership in 2007. EU 
accession will require wide ranging reforms of the Romanian economy in order to prepare for 
competition, and to improve the physical infrastructure. The rationale for choosing the MSP and 
TSSP lending operations as pilots for the OP/BP 4.00 is in accordance with the country
’s reform 
efforts linked to the EU accession process. The proposed pilots will support priority investments in 
transport and municipal services infrastructure sectors determined by Romania, and thereby assist the 
country to fulfill its pledges with regard to EU accession and with the absorption of EU grant funds. 
Specifically, the Transport Sector Support Project will provide financial support to ensure full 
implementation of the GOR’s program for rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing road and rail 
networks. The MSP project will provide new urban services for water supply, sewerage, drainage and 
road surfacing in priority neighborhoods of Bucharest and Arad municipalities. This equivalence and 
acceptability assessment helps to identify opportunities for strengthening existing capacity that is 
needed for the country to meet accession requirements for the EU environmental directives (Chapter 
22, “Environmental Protection”), and to establish or strengthen existing institutions and their 
environmental and social systems to absorb post-accession EU funds and contribute to a smooth 
integration process. Consequently, the MSP and TSSP pilots offer an opportunity to strengthen the 
Government of Romania’s (GOR) institutional capacity to promote harmonization of environmental 
safeguard requirements among the GOR, the World Bank and other development partners.  
2.4 
Summary of Public Consultation and Disclosure 
9. 
A public consultation workshop was organized to discuss the Executive Summary of this 
report in Bucharest on December 13, 2005. In preparation for this workshop, the document and 
invitations were placed on MEWM’s website, and invitations were sent to potentially interested 
stakeholders. Participants expressed overall support for the pilot. No major issues were raised or 
objections were made. Annex IV provides a summary of the meeting and the list of participants. 
10. 
A full draft report was disclosed in English in the World Bank InfoShop and in Romanian on 
the MEWM web site January 25, 2006. The comment period in Romania closed on March 10, 2006; 
Page  14

no comments were received from the public. This revised version reflects clarification of information 
and supporting analyses but no change in overall conclusions with regard to equivalence and 
acceptability.

Project 
11. 
Environmental Assessment.
 The proposed MSP will assist Romania in its efforts to meet the 
cost of water, wastewater, and storm sewerage investments, to comply with wastewater discharge, and 
water quality standards set by EU directives.
10
 Though these are environment friendly investments 
aimed to reduce the current pollution load, they could result in adverse environmental impacts if 
inappropriate design, construction and operational practices are followed. In order to address these 
potential adverse impacts, the Bank policy area on EA is applicable to the proposed MSP.
11
 The 
project has been categorized as an environmental category B since the investments will be related to 
small civil works without significant impact to the environment.   
12. 
Involuntary Resettlement.
 During project preparation, the possibility that the 
Bank’s policy 
area on Involuntary Resettlement might apply was raised since the project might require small scale 
land acquisition, for example to extend sewerage networks (although physical relocation of 
households or businesses was not expected.) Most of the pipes will be buried under streets, for which 
the local government will issue concessions for the right-of-way.  During the final stages of project 
preparation, where more specific information on investments in Arad and Bucharest were obtained, 
the possibility of land acquisition was excluded from the project
12
.
13. 
Cultural Property.
 Based on current project information, the project is not expected to affect 
any known physical cultural resources. However the policy area on Cultural Property is also 
considered in this assessment, to address any chance finds during construction and unexpected 
impacts that may occur during realignment or expansion of services when investments may take place 
in historic districts, potentially affect historic structures, or influence other physical-cultural resources.  
14. 
Other Safeguards.
 The Bank policy on International Waterways (OP 7.50) is triggered by 
the MSP, but given that that safeguard policy area does not fall within the scope of OP 4.00 it is not 
included in this equivalence and acceptability assessment. Instead, procedures under OP 7.50 
(notification of riparians) was carried out.  
15. 
There is no information to indicate that other safeguard policy areas are applicable to the 
proposed MSP. During the preparation of the Municipal Services Project (i.e. before the selection of 
10
 A list of relevant EU directives can be found in Annex I 
11
 Under the Bank
’s OP/BP 4.01 the MSP would be classified as environmental “B.” Earlier versions of the Bank’s 
Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet noted a proposed FI category with possible A and B sub-projects. The project as now 
envisaged does not include new landfills or wastewater treatment plants, nor is it currently slated to provide co-funding for 
other cities. With a focus on rehabilitation and minor systems expansion in Arad and Bucharest, the Category B rating is 
more appropriate.. 
12
 
At negotiations, the Project Implementing Entities confirmed that the Project will be carried out on public lands and that it 
will not trigger the Bank’s policy on Involuntary Resettlement that includes land acquisition.  As a result, there would be no 
land acquisition costs – which were to be fully financed by the Project Implementing Entities - related to the Project as 
originally anticipated.  It was further agreed that the gap filling measures related to Bank’s piloting of its policy on 
Involuntary Resettlement under OP 4.00 (including associated effectiveness conditions of the Loan) will not be included in 
the Project.  A definition consistent with the Bank’s resettlement policy was retained in the Appendix to the Loan Agreement 
and undertakings were entered into by the two Municipalities to ensure that the carrying out of the Project would not cause, 
or result in, resettlement.

Bucharest and Arad for the bulk of investments), it was possible that candidate sub-projects might 
have included rehabilitation or extension of drinking water systems where supply is obtained from 
dams or other control structures. New dams would not have been financed by the project, nor would 
dams have been rehabilitated under the project, but the capability of Romanian authorities to ensure 
dam safety was considered important should water supplies under the project be associated with 
control structures. Such sub-projects are not, however, currently included in the project but the 
resultant 
“equivalence and acceptability” assessment is left included in this report for possible 
reference use in future projects. 
3.1.2 
Romania Transport Sector Support Project   
 
16. 
Environmental Assessment.
 As described above, the proposed Transport Sector Support 
Project will assist Romania in its efforts to maintain, rehabilitate and modernize national and country 
roads and railways. Rehabilitation and maintenance activities under the proposed project could result 
in some adverse environmental impacts, unless appropriate design, construction and operational 
practices are followed. Potential adverse environmental impacts are expected to be local, and occur 
during implementation/construction only, and the project has been categorized as “B”.  
17. 
Involuntary Resettlement
.
Under the current scope of the project, investments (such as 
resurfacing of roads, improvement of signaling, and maintenance of rail) are largely expected to incur 
within the existing right of way. The road rehabilitation component is not expected to require the 
acquisition of land. With regard to the railway component it cannot be excluded that acquisition of 
small amounts of land may be needed, for example to maintain yards or sub-stations or realign tracks, 
and the Bank’s policy on Involuntary Resettlement is therefore also considered applicable to the 
proposed TSSP. Physical relocation of households or businesses is not expected to take place.   
18.  
Other Safeguards
.
There is no information to indicate that other environmental and social 
safeguard policies of the Bank are applicable to the proposed TSSP.  
3.2 
Methodology Used for Determining Equivalence 
19. 
This equivalence analysis was carried out by Bank staff in co-operation with Romanian and 
EU officials, consultants and legal and environmental counsel.13 The methodology included a desk 
review of current in-force Romanian legislation; Romania’s treaty of accession to the EU; relevant 
European Union Directives and International Conventions; discussion with Romanian officials and 
EU Commission staff; and a review of EU and Bank reports and studies.  
20. 
The equivalence analysis matrix (Annex II to this report) provides a comparison between EA, 
Involuntary Resettlement and Cultural Property policy objectives and operational principles, as stated 
in Table A1 of OP 4.00, with the requirements under the applicable Romanian laws, regulations, 
rules, and procedures. Information of the area of Dam Safety is left included in the matrix, despite the 
fact that has now become evident that that area is not triggered by the MSP.   
3.3 
Equivalence Analysis - Environmental Assessment  
3.3.1 
Romanian Laws and Regulations Applicable to the Projects 
21. 
Annex I to this report contains a list of laws, regulations, rules and procedures that govern 
EIA categorization in Romania. In addition, it lists relevant EU directives and international treaties to 
which Romania is party. Matrices comparing Romanian systems to the requirements of OP 4.00 for 
Environmental Assessment are included as Annex IIA to this report.  
13
 Key officials met during the major September 2005 study mission are mentioned in Annex III; the input of other staff 
during previous and follow-on meetings and discussions is gratefully acknowledged. 
Page  16

22. 
Joining the European Union is one of the central development objectives of Romania with the 
recently signed Accession Treaty, and the Government is committed to obtaining EU membership in 
2007. Article 148 (2) of Romania
’s Constitution (titled “on Integration into the European Union”) 
provides that, as a result of accession, the provisions of the constituent treaties of the European Union 
as well as the other binding community regulations 
shall take precedence
 over conflicting provisions 
of the national law, in compliance with the provisions of the accession act.  
23. 
European Union law on environmental protection comprises over 200 legal acts covering 
horizontal legislation, water and air pollution, management of waste and chemicals, biotechnology, 
nature protection, industrial pollution and risk management, noise and radiation protection. If it finds 
that an EU member state is not applying EU law, and therefore not meeting its legal obligations, the 
European Commission takes steps to put the situation right, though a process called the ‘infringement 
procedure.’ If this procedure fails to correct matters, the Commission must then refer the matter to the 
European Court of Justice, which has the power to impose penalties. The Court’s judgments are 
binding on EU member states and institutions.  
24. 
Preparation for EU accession has required wide ranging reforms of the Romanian 
administration and legal system in order to prepare for acceptance of the so-called 
acquis 
communautaire
,
and to improve physical infrastructure. The general framework Law 294/2003 
approving the Emergency Government Ordinance 91/2002 which amended Law 137/1995 was 
adopted, introducing a compulsory procedure for EIA for certain projects, including those with 
transboundary effects. Government Decision 918/2002 (transposing the EIA Directives) and four 
Ministerial Ordinances
14
 were adopted establishing the competencies, procedural stages and 
instructions including on public participation and preparation in the EIA procedure (screening of 
projects, scoping of EIS, and review).
15
 Screening of projects, to determine whether significant 
environmental impacts are likely to occur, and a full EIA has to be carried out, is based on 
quantitative and qualitative criteria. Competent authorities are MEWM (for certain important projects) 
and National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) at national level, Regional EPAs, and LEPAs 
(county level), depending of the type and anticipated impact of a proposed project. Annex I.1 and I.2 
of MO 860/2002, as amended by MO 210/2004 and MO 1037/2005, determines which competent 
authority is responsible with regards to which type of project. A Technical Review Committee 
comprised of several representatives of ministries and representatives of civil protection and the fire 
brigade, and which may be enlarged with experts as needed, participates in all stages, notably, 
screening, scoping, and quality review of the EIS. The EIS may only be developed by certified 
specialists. 
25. 
New projects, and any change, extension, or dismantling of projects that may have significant 
environmental impacts, related to activities listed in GD 918/2002 (environmental impact assessment 
framework) and EGO 152/2005 (on integrated pollution prevention, mitigation and control) require an 
environmental license to construct,
16
 and in many instances an integrated multi-media permit.
17
 A full 
EIA is required for projects of the types listed in Annex I of GD 918/2002, and for the types listed in 
Annex II of that same Government Decision, when the competent authorities have so determined on a 
case by case basis (screening). A detailed description of the Romanian Licensing and Permitting 
Procedures is presented in Annex IB of this document. The following table aims to provide an 
overview of EIA procedures applicable to the proposed sub-projects. Investment projects not subject

 The regulatory instruments in Romania include Laws, Decisions and Ministerial Ordinances. Decisions are issued to 
organize the application of laws. Ordinances are issued within the limits and conformity with the provisions of enabling 
laws. Laws are passed by the Parliament. Decisions and Ordinances are signed by the prime Minister and countersigned by 
the Minister(s) who carry-out their execution.

Current and Proposed Measures to Improve the System 
26. 
Romania is committed to improve the EA system as part of the EU accession process through 
the transposition and implementation of Directive 2003/35/EC which amends the EIA Directive. 
Improvement will bolster overall environmental sustainability of national programs, but is not 
necessary to meet OP 4.00 requirements for the Municipal Services and Transport Sector Support 
projects. It should also be noted that the Bank’s proposed Environmental Management Loan (slated 
for delivery in FY07) will provide considerable capacity building which will directly and positively 
improve Romanian systems at both the policy and field levels.  
3.3.2 
Analysis of Gaps 
27. 
As can be seen from the equivalence analysis matrix in Annex IIA, the Bank’s EA policy and 
the Romanian EIA system have many common features and principles and are considered compatible 
in most aspects.
 
Both the Romanian EIA system and the Bank’s policy on EA classify projects and 
activities into categories. The positive list of projects and activities subject to full environmental 
assessment or a more limited environmental analysis under the Romanian legislation is by nature 
similar to the classification (respectively) in Category A and Category B projects under the Bank’s 
policy.  
28. 
Overall, the Romanian system screening process is comprehensive and provides adequate 
procedural details (including checklists for the competent authorities). The differences between the 
Romanian EIA process and the principles stated in the Bank’s OP/BP 4.00 relate to (a) continuing 
consultation throughout implementation of high-risk projects and (b) use of independent advisory 
panels during the implementation of such projects. However, these differences are not pertinent to the 
proposed TSSP and MSP. 
3.3.3 
Proposed Measures to Address the Gaps of the Romanian EA System 
29. 
With regard to EA, no gap-filling measures are required for the MSP and TSSP, to achieve 
equivalence between Romania’s system and the objective and principles as stated in Table A1 to 
OP.400. 
30. 
Romania is committed to improve the EA system as part of the EU accession process through 
the transposition and implementation of Directive 2003/35/EC which amends the EIA Directive. 
Improvement will bolster overall environmental sustainability of national programs, but is not

3.4 Equivalence 
Analysis 
–
Cultural Property  
31. 
The EU has limited legislation in the area of cultural property, primarily addressing standards 
for the export of cultural goods/national treasures as well as measures to return illegally traded 
cultural property. Each member state has its own laws and procedures for protecting physical cultural 
resources (PCR), that go well beyond those of the EU in terms of comparability in scope to that of the 
World Bank safeguard policies.  
3.4.1 
Romanian Laws and Regulations Applicable to the Projects 
32. 
The comparison of Romanian systems for PCR with the objective and operational principles 
as stated in Table A1 of OP/BP 4.00 is included as Annex IIB.  
33. 
PCR protection in Romania is comprehensively governed by several pieces of legislation, the 
most pertinent being: Law 422/2001 on protection of historic monuments and Government Ordinance 
43/2000 (GO 43/2000) on Archaeological Heritage Protection and Declaring of Certain 
Archaeological Sites as Areas of National Interest (modified text following the Law 378/2000 and the 
Law 462/2003).  
34. 
Law 422/2001 establishes the principle of classification of historic monuments: Group A 
being historic monuments of national and universal interest, and Group B being historic monuments 
representative of the local cultural heritage. Classification for both groups is performed under an 
Order of the Minister of Culture and Religious Affairs (MCRA), at the proposal of the National 
Commission for Historic Monuments (NCHM).
2
1
Owners and the public as well as the NCHM, the 
National Commission for Archaeology (NCA), the local mayor, and local or county councils are 
entitled to participate in the listing process, as they can make proposals for listing; proposals that have 
to be taken into account by the county services of the Ministry of Culture. Any order of classification 
must be communicated to the owner of the property and the local public administration within 30 days 
of the decision being taken. On the other hand, the owner of a building proposed to be listed or 
rejected for listing is entitled to appeal against the decision at the MCRA within 30 days of receiving 
the communication.  
35. 
Law 422/2001 also contains provisions entitling the owner to receive scientific, technical, 
material and financial support for the conservation and restoration of his/her monument. This 
mechanism helps to bring the public effectively into the process of both listing and preserving historic 
monuments. There are approximately 29,000 listed monuments in Romania.
22
 
36. 
For each monument, an area of protection is created by the local public administration (with 
the engagement of qualified staff), and the protected area must be demarcated within the General 
Urban Plan of the municipality. Until a protection area has been established for a historical 
monument, it is considered to have a protection radius area of 100 meters in towns, 200 meters in 
villages, and 500 meters in the countryside. Newly listed buildings must be included in the General 
Urban Plan within 12 months of being listed, and the plan must be communicated to the MCRA every 
five years, along with all up-to-date information concerning historic monuments. 
37. 
Without exception, there can be no intervention upon listed buildings without the prior 
consultation and authorization of the MCRA. This means that the building permission request must be 
seen by the local representative of the MCRA, who will provide advice and recommendations on the 
construction works in the form of an administrative document. Only after receiving this document can 
21
 The NCHM is a 21 member body which meets once a month to advise the MCRA on classifications (particularly Group 
A), national strategies and methodologies for PCR protection, general urban plans, and criteria for selecting specialists and 
experts in PCR protection. Its membership comprises representatives from: the Romanian Academy, Ministry of Education 
and Research, Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing, NGOs, and the MCRA.

a
County Council, following the qualified advice of the MCRA and the NCHM, grant or refuse a 
construction request affecting a listed building / site. If the works are approved, they must involve 
design supervisor engineers and/or architects who have specific qualifications in the field of historical 
buildings, certified by MCRA.  
38. 
The same principles apply to located archaeological sites (the National Archaeological 
Repertory), which is maintained by the MCRA and includes some 5,600 locations.
23
 GO 43/2000 on 
Archaeological Heritage Protection set up a comprehensive system of preservation for Romania
’s 
archaeological heritage from areas of archaeological potential and from urban development areas, 
following on the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention of La Valetta (1992). The law 
makes it mandatory for an infrastructure project proponent to carry out field surveys at the feasibility 
study stage of the project, using qualified specialists. The project proponent must also pay for 
archaeological surveillance over the entire period of the works to protect the archaeology and chance 
finds. Research carried out in this manner is known as ‘preventive archaeological research’ and aims 
to find the most likely archaeological remains, to study them and to protect them in a specialized 
institution before the investment project could affect them. In certain cases, especially when there are 
structures with great historic, cultural or scientific importance that cannot be moved, the 
archaeological team can recommend the preservation of the remains by changing the initial plans. 
Planned building works on located archaeological sites cannot go ahead without the MCRA issuing a 
certification that all archaeological patrimony has been revealed and fully examined (the so-called 
“Archaeological Burden Discharge Certificate”).
2
4
If archaeological remains are discovered during 
any archaeological research, the location can be added by the MCRA to the National Archaeological 
Repertory and the National Office for Cadastre, Survey and Mapping must include these areas of 
located heritage on cadastre plans and topographical maps. 
39. 
Under the terms of GO 43/2000, ‘chance’ archaeological finds discovered during building 
works, or any human activity, must be reported to the town mayor within 72 hours of discovery. 
Following the discovery, and until an Archaeological Discharge Certificate is issued, the building 
permit is suspended or the town Mayor can order the interruption of all activity. Scientific, 
management and technical measures must then be adopted to preserve the vestiges uncovered by 
chance until the assets are classified or until the conclusion of the archaeological research. Law 
enforcement officials must also be notified to guard the area. 
40. 
Environmental Protection Law 137/1995 also stipulates measures for cultural heritage 
protection within the context of the Environmental Impact Assessment procedure (detailed in 
Government Ordinance 860/2002). In particular, affirmation that projects pose insignificant 
environmental impact, can only be issued after the project site location has been checked against its 
relative position to, 
inter alia
,
protected areas, and natural or archaeological monuments. The EIA 
must specify effects on material assets and cultural heritage at each stage of the process (screening, 
scoping and review) and, as necessary, experts from entities responsible for archaeological sites and 
historical monuments may participate in the Technical Review Committee for EIA. In addition, public 
consultation is foreseen at publication of the assessment study, before which the public may forward 
justified proposals concerning the EA. 
41. 
Romania became a member of the Council of Europe in 1993, which binds it to a number of 
conventions, which they have ratified, relating to the protection of physical cultural resources, 
including the European Cultural Convention, the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural 
Heritage of Europe, and the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage.  
42. 
To summarize, Romanian law specifies that inventories of buildings and sites of cultural 
significance are consulted to assess whether proposed investment projects might cause impact. Local

experts on archeology, architecture and other relevant fields are brought in for assessments before 
construction decisions are made, and after if 
“chance finds” are encountered during construction. Only 
when the finds have been fully analyzed are investment projects allowed to proceed. 
3.4.2 
Analysis of Gaps 
43. 
As can be seen from the equivalence analysis matrix in Annex II to this report, there are no 
gaps between Romanian laws, regulations and procedures on PCR and the objective and operational 
principles as stated in Table A1 of OP 4.00. Owners of property (archeology and/or monuments) that 
is to be classified are notified of the process and made aware of the obligations of having their 
property listed and can contest the decision. Public consultation does occur during the EIA process 
(which includes consideration of physical cultural resources issues), and hence this is considered 
equivalent to OP/BP 4.00. 
3.4.3 
Current and Proposed Measures to Achieve the Equivalence 
44. 
With regard to Cultural Property no gap-filling measures are required for the MSP and TSSP, 
to achieve equivalence between Romania’s system and the objective and principles as stated in Table 
A1 to OP.400. 
3.5 Equivalence 
Analysis 
–
Dam Safety 
3.5.1 
Romanian Laws and Procedures 
45. 
During the preparation of the Municipal Services Project (i.e. before the selection of 
Bucharest and Arad for the bulk of investments), it was anticipated that candidate sub-projects might  
have included rehabilitation or extension of drinking water systems where supply is obtained from 
dams or other control structures. New dams would not have been financed by the project, nor would 
dams have been rehabilitated under the project, but the capability of Romanian authorities to ensure 
dam safety was considered important should water supplies under the project be associated with 
control structures. Such sub-projects are not, however, currently included in the MSP. Nevertheless,  
the information gathered as part of the equivalence analysis in this area is left included here, for 
possible future reference. 
46. 
Romanian legislation (Water Law 107/1996 modified by Law 310/2004, and Government 
Ordinance 244/2000) and regulations (Ministerial Ordinance 128/2005) for dam safety are sufficiently 
broad and include coverage for water retention structures. Both categories were considered under the 
Bank-financed Hazard Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project (HRMEP), currently 
under implementation. Good alignment was found between Romanian requirements and those of the 
Bank. Experience by the World Bank in ongoing projects in Romania also suggests that the country
’s 
system for ensuring the safety of existing dams that are utilized for water supply is sufficiently 
equivalent to applicable aspects of the Municipal Services project. Depending on risk, key aspects of 
this system includes, for example, the assurance that: 
ƒ
For each of the control structure associated with the project, emergency preparedness plans 
(EPP) would be in place and periodically updated. 
ƒ
That operations and maintenance plans are in place for each dam or control structure. 
ƒ
For higher risk control structures, a Panel of Experts (POE) including certified independent 
experts would be tasked to undertake reviews of designs and technical specifications for 
works; the POE will further advise on construction quality. 
Dam safety issues do not arise in Transport Sector Support Project. 
Page  22
12
 
3.5.2 
Analysis of Gaps 
47. 
When limited application of dam safety provisions arose as a possibility in the Municipal 
Services project (now no longer deemed applicable), no significant gaps were found between 
Romanian law on dam safety and the operational principles as stated in Table A1 of OP 4.00.  
3.5.3 
Current and Proposed Measures to Achieve the Equivalence 
48. 
The policy is not triggered and no gap-filling measures are required.  
3.6 
Equivalence Analysis - Involuntary Resettlement 
49. 
The equivalence analysis for Involuntary Resettlement focuses on expropriation and land 
acquisition as the Transport Sector Support Project is not expected to cause physical relocation of 
households or businesses.  It should be noted, however, that Romania has selected a conventional 
approach to due diligence for this safeguard policy area, and OP 4.12 will apply rather than OP 4.00.  
Nevertheless, the results of the equivalence review are presented for general information and possible 
use in future pilots.  Involuntary Resettlement is not triggered for the Municipal Services Project.  
50. 
The EU does not have a common policy or standards regarding resettlement or expropriation. 
Each member state has its own laws and procedures in this area.  
3.6.1 
Romanian Laws and Procedures 
51. 
In Romania, expropriation at all levels is governed by a general framework Expropriation 
Law 33/1994, the implementation of which is guided by Government Resolution 583/1994
25
.
The 
basic principles are straightforward: expropriation must be justified and minimized; compensation is 
in cash based on market value and damages; contracts are subject to judicial review and ratification; 
failed negotiations regarding compensation are settled by the courts, informed by an expert valuation 
assessment; and civil works can start only after the transfer of the title is ordered by the courts and full 
compensation is paid
26
 
52. 
The Romanian Constitution (Art. 44, para. 3.6) protects the ownership of private property and 
provides that 
“nobody may be expropriated unless for a cause of public use, established according to 
the law, subject to a fair and prior compensation.” Implementation of this clause is the subject of the 
Expropriation Law (33/1994) regarding the Process of Land Acquisition for Reasons of Public Use, 
referred to as the “Expropriation Law.” Procedures for establishing public use are articulated in 
Government Resolution 583/1994 on “Regulation regarding the procedure of the commissions for 
performing a prior investigation to declare a public use for national or local interest works”.  
53. 
The Expropriation Law specifies conditions under which different governmental authorities 
(national, country and local) can expropriate private land and outlines procedures for doing so. 
Government Resolution 583/1994, a companion to Law 33/1994, sets procedures and the functioning 
and membership of review commissions involved in making the Expropriation Decision. These 
procedures apply to all levels of government. The process consists of three stages that are described in 
Law 33/1994. The following titles were assigned to these stages for clarification: 
ƒ
Declaration of Public Use
—based on a feasibility study and economic analysis, in the 
25
 Another law, No. 198/2004, accompanied by Methodological Rules of June 10, 2004, for the application of Law 
198/2004, simplifies expropriation for highways and national roads by establishing provisions to use escrow accounts to 
deposit funds for complicated cases involving disputes, absentee owners or uncertain owners. This law does not apply to the 
pilot projects, although there is an attempt underway to pass similar legislation for the railroads.  
26
 These Romanian laws and procedures apply to the expropriation of private land for public use. A specific Act of 
Parliament would be required for the relocation of a village, presumably because the cost of such an undertaking would be 
considerably higher than simple expropriation, but this is not relevant for the projects at hand.  
Page  23
13
 
expropriation request the expropriator must demonstrate public need
 (“Public Use”); 
document that the investment is included in the urban or regional plan; and include a 
preliminary assessment of land acquisition and cost. Documentation is reviewed by a 
commission (county, local), which obtains inputs from utilities, agencies and interested 
parties. People who feel they may be affected can inquire and raise objections at this time. 
The commission either accepts the proposal and issues a Location Permit, or returns it to the 
expropriator. Minutes of the decision meeting are posted and distributed to affected parties. 
The Location Permit is posted in the County or Local Council and published in a local 
newspaper. 
ƒ
Administration
—based on the Technical Design, which specifies ownership of affected 
parcels (approved by the Cadastre office) and compensation levels set by authorized 
assessors, the expropriator can acquire land or rights-of-way. The design and proposed 
aggregate compensation is posted in the County or Local Council and published in a local 
newspaper, and owners are notified of the intent to acquire land or right of way. Interested 
parties can challenge the Technical Design by writing to the mayor, who appoints a 
commission to review and respond to all inputs. The minutes of the deliberation of the 
commission are posted and the commission either endorses the design or instructs the 
expropriator to modify it. Owners must provide documentation of ownership to negotiate. By 
law, the expropriator cannot offer an amount less than the assessed value of the property (Law  
33/1994, Chapter IV, Art. 27). If the expropriator and owner agree on the compensation 
amount, a purchase contract is prepared and signed. The agreement becomes effective when it 
is ratified by the court and compensation is paid. If the two parties do not agree on a 
compensation amount, the expropriator or owner can submit the case for court adjudication.  
ƒ
Adjudication
—all agreements are reviewed by the court to determine whether or they 
followed proper procedures fulfilling legal requirements; if so, they are ratified and the 
transfer is immediate upon payment. In case of a dispute over compensation, the court 
commissions an expert valuation and sets the level of compensation. Ownership is deemed 
transferred when the transaction is registered in the cadastre and compensation is paid. The 
court also has the authority to sanction expropriation if owners cannot be located or 
ownership is disputed. 
54. 
Land acquisition must be completed before a Construction License is issued, after which civil 
works can start.  
55. 
The process can be time consuming, particularly if ownership is unclear or disputed, if 
owners cannot provide documentation of ownership or if owners cannot be located. Compensation for 
disputed lands is decided by the court and the expropriator deposits funds that are distributed once the 
dispute is settled. In cases where documentation is incomplete, the expropriator helps legitimate 
claimants acquire documents. If owners are not located, the expropriator follows a prescribed 
notification procedure. The law does not clearly limit the time required to complete expropriation or 
provide adequate guidance on how to conclude the process for complicated cases.
27
 Consequently, the 
expropriation process can be protracted.  
56. 
Once the court ratifies the arrangement, and money is deposited in a bank account, the 
transfer can take place. The owners of the land that was expropriated have three years to challenge the 
compensation amount, but cannot reverse the court decision to transfer ownership.  
27
 Law 198/2004 was enacted to simplify procedures for the construction of highways and national roads. Methodological 
Rules were issued to guide application of the law (June 10, 2004). The new law differs from Law 33/1994 in one principal 
respect
—the introduction of escrow accounts to deposit compensation when ownership is unclear or disputed or owners 
cannot be located. This law is not applicable in the pilot projects. 
Page  24
14
 
57. 
Disputes over ownership are resolved through a separate process outside the scope of the 
Expropriation Law. The process involves the cadastre office as well as courts, which make the final 
determination of the validity of conflicting claims and the distribution of assets. 
3.6.2 
Equivalence and Analysis of Gaps and Differences  
58. 
The expropriation system in Romania is broadly consistent with the objectives and many of 
the operational principles of OP/BP 4.00. However a number of the operational principles listed in 
Table A1 of OP 4.00 do not have specific corresponding requirements in Romania. The similarities 
and differences between principles in OP/BP 4.00 and Romanian legal requirements and practices are 
highlighted below. The text is structured following the objective and principles listed in table A1 to 
OP/BP 4.00 (see also summary matrix as Annex IID to this report). 
Objective:
 To avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement and, where this is not feasible, to assist 
displaced persons in improving or at least restoring their livelihoods and standards of living in real 
terms relative to pre-displacement levels or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project 
implementation, whichever is higher
.
59. 
The Romanian Constitution protects private property and provides that 
“
nobody may be 
expropriated unless for a cause of public use, established according to law, subject to a fair and prior 
compensation
”
(Art. 44, para.3.6). These provisions were further elaborated in the Expropriation Law 
(Law 33/1994) and Government Resolution 583/1994, which establish a standard that applies to all 
levels of government. Each act of expropriation is based on a request for an expropriation decision, 
which must justify “
the national or local interest, the economical-social, environmental or any other 
kind of advantages that justify the necessary character of works and could not be carried out except 
by means of expropriation
 (Art. 10 Expropriation Law).  
60. 
The Expropriation Law is based on the assumption that compensation at market value and 
“prejudice” (real value of the premises and the prejudice caused to the owner or other entitled persons 
(Art. 26, Expropriation Law) should be adequate to enable the affected people to maintain the value of 
their assets and, if relevant, to re-establish themselves under similar circumstances. Article 26 of the 
Expropriation Law loosely characterizes prejudice as “
damages caused to the owner or, if the case 
may be, to other entitled persons, also considering the justification submitted by them
.” The Civil 
Code defines prejudice as “
damage effectively suffered and unrealized benefits
.” Expropriation 
cancels tenancy agreements and the tenants are “
entitled to compensation
”
(Art. 28, Expropriation 
Law). It appears that prejudice thus covers impacts on income and livelihoods beyond the cost of 
affected assets, including impacts on third parties. 
Operational Principle
 
1.
 Assess all viable alternative project designs to avoid, where feasible, or 
minimize involuntary resettlement. 
61. 
Article 10 of the Expropriation Law requires a project proponent/expropriator to justify the 
need for expropriation and to demonstrate that the investment cannot occur without expropriation. A 
commission (at national, county or local level) is set up to review each proposal, obtain technical 
inputs from government agencies and inputs from interest parties, and recommend an expropriation 
decision or return the proposal to the project proponent. Various agencies and ministries also append 
specific requirements that must be fulfilled in the Technical Design. The process is essentially 
repeated when the Technical Design is completed and affected persons are identified.  
Page  25
15
 
Operational Principle
 
2.
 Through census and socio-economic surveys of the affected population, 
identify, assess, and address the potential economic and social impacts of the project that are caused 
by involuntary taking of land (e.g. relocation or loss of shelter, loss of assets or access to assets, loss 
of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the affected person must move to another 
location) or involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks and protected areas. 
62. 
The Expropriation Law does not require a baseline census or socio-economic survey. The 
expropriation request must identify economic and social benefits of the investment, however, and the 
Technical Design includes detailed information about land ownership and use (confirmed by the 
Cadastre Office) and estimated value of the land to be expropriated (Art. 12, Expropriation Law). This 
constitutes a de facto household census. Cases involving physical relocation and loss of access to 
assets are identified through the process of collecting information for the Technical Design. The loss 
of income sources or means of livelihood and transition costs can be included in calculations of 
compensation for 
“prejudice,” but they must be claimed by the owner or other affected person. 
63. 
No socio-economic surveys are required for expropriation. 
Operational Principle
 
3.
 Identify and address impacts also if they result from other activities that are 
(a) directly and significantly related to the proposed project, (b) necessary to achieve its objectives, 
and (c) carried out or planned to be carried out contemporaneously with the project. 
64. 
Legal expropriation standards and procedures and compensation standards apply equally to all 
aspects of an investment. 
Operational Principle
 
4.
 Consult project-affected persons, host communities and local 
nongovernmental organizations, as appropriate. Provide them opportunities to participate in the 
planning, implementation, and monitoring of the resettlement program, especially in the process of 
developing and implementing the procedures for determining eligibility for compensation benefits and 
development assistance (as documented in a resettlement plan), and for establishing appropriate and 
accessible grievance mechanisms. Pay particular attention to the needs of vulnerable groups among 
those displaced, especially those below the poverty line, the landless, the elderly, women and 
children, Indigenous Peoples, ethnic minorities, or other displaced persons who may not be protected 
through national land compensation legislation. 
65. 
Investments must be embedded in urban or regional spatial plans, which are adopted and 
revised through open meetings. Documentation related to justifying an investment and implementing 
it, to obtain a Location Permit and then Construction License, must be posted in County and Local 
Councils, offices of the expropriator, the official gazette and local newspapers. The documentation 
constitutes both expropriation and construction plans, owners and proposed compensation. The 
documentation prepared to request an expropriation decision and to obtain a Location Permit, is 
reviewed by officials from different agencies. The process is relatively open, although no public 
meetings are required. Affected persons are not specifically contacted at this point, but they and all 
other interested parties have access to officials to discuss various aspects directly or submit written 
questions or objections, which are considered in making the decision.  
66. 
Once the Location Permit is issued, the Technical Design is completed and posted in the 
country or local government offices, as well as the office of the expropriator. Interested parties who 
have questions or objections can express their reservations in writing to the mayor or head of the 
county, who establishes a commission to review and address each petition and consult with interested 
parties. These consultations can lead to revisions of the Technical Design. For example, input from 
local people, through the mayor, prompted the re-location of a bypass (Transport Restructuring 
Project) away from the city to give more room for urban development. Although there are no 
resettlement plans, as such, the documentation for the expropriation decision and the Technical 
Design can be seen as a reasonable proxy for a land acquisition or resettlement plan, especially since 
Page  26
16
 
the system is almost exclusively based on paying cash compensation to affected persons for lost assets 
and opportunities.  
67. 
Grievance mechanisms exist at successive stages in preparation and design of the investment. 
Prior to the issue of the Location Permit and completion of the Technical Design, interested parties 
can address their concerns regarding location, alignments and the scope of expropriation to agencies 
involved in the decision-making process, the mayor, and negotiation representatives of the 
expropriator (Art. 12-19 Expropriation Law). Expropriation must be concluded before the 
Construction License is issued. Once that occurs, affected persons can challenge the level of 
compensation in the courts, but cannot reverse the expropriation process. 
68. 
There are no regular mechanisms for public participation in monitoring the implementation of 
the investment and the impact of expropriation, although controversial projects are generally actively 
scrutinized by the press.  
69. 
Eligibility for compensation is consistent and straightforward, including owners, tenants and 
other individuals who occupy land to be expropriated (Art. 28 Expropriation Law). Tenants are 
compensated for damages and illegal occupiers can claim compensation for the loss of above ground 
assets (Art. 29 Expropriation Law) (
“value-added”). 
70. 
There are no special provisions for the vulnerable, minorities or others and, with the 
exception of squatters, there appear to be no displaced persons or minorities who are not protected 
through national land compensation legislation.  
Operational Principle
 
5.
 Inform displaced persons of their rights, consult them on options, and 
provide them with technically and economically feasible resettlement alternatives and needed 
assistance, including (a) prompt compensation at full replacement cost for loss of assets attributable 
to the project; (b) if there is relocation, assistance during relocation, and residual housing, or 
housing sites, or agricultural sites of equivalent potential, as required; (c) transitional support and 
development assistance, such as land preparation, credit facilities, training or job opportunities as 
required, in addition to compensation measures; (d) cash compensation for land when the impact of 
land acquisition on livelihoods is minor; and (e) provision of civic infrastructure and community 
services as required. 
71. 
Owners are notified by letter of the intent to expropriate, which includes a copy of the 
minutes of the expropriation decision. Since compensation is in cash, affected people are not given 
different options; rather, it is assumed that they can use the compensation to choose their own options. 
(a) 
Land acquisition must be completed—compensation must be paid and titles 
transferred—before a Construction License is issued for the investment. 
Compensation must be paid within 30 days of court judgments. Compensation is at 
market value, plus prejudice, which is considered sufficient to replace assets and 
restore incomes, and therefore equivalent to replacement cost. Occupants without 
legal titles to affected land can be compensated for their lost above-ground assets, 
expressed as “value added.” Affected persons and third parties who seek 
compensation for prejudice must present their cases to negotiators or the court. Crop 
loss is the only form of damage that is explicitly stated in the law; claims for other 
losses must be documented by affected persons on a case-by-case basis. They must 
claim compensation as “prejudice.” 
(b) 
Residences are rarely affected. If they are, the residents of expropriated properties 
move to housing arranged by themselves, following negotiation, compensation and 
the transfer of titles. If they ultimately need to be evicted, the expropriator must 
provide another “
dwelling space, in conformity with the law
”
(Art. 29 Expropriation 
Law). Tenants and illegal occupants of expropriated residences, even more rare, will 
Page  27
17
 
be provided with acceptable alternative housing to which to move (Art. 29 
Expropriation Law). 
(c) 
Relocation costs will be included in compensation for 
“prejudice.” Owners and others 
who have cause must make the claim for damages during the negotiation process or, 
in court, if their claim is not resolved to their satisfaction. The court renders final 
decisions on compensation levels that are under question. In the absence of strict 
guidelines, “prejudice” can cover a range of impacts, but it is up to the claimant to 
make the case. 
(d) 
Cash compensation is the norm. If most of a parcel is subject to expropriation, and the 
remainder is not viable or without value, the owner can appeal to have the whole 
parcel expropriated (Art. 24 Expropriation Law). 
(e) 
No community-wide involuntary physical relocation that would require the 
development of new urban infrastructure and services is envisioned under the pilot 
projects. The expropriation law will apply to all expropriation related to project 
investments. In the unlikely event that an investment entails the relocation of 
individual households, people would move to residences with appropriate 
infrastructure and community services, rather than to greenfield sites. 
Operational Principle
 
6.
 Give preference to land-based resettlement strategies for displaced persons 
whose livelihoods are land-based. 
72. 
Expropriation laws and procedures are based on cash compensation at market rate, which is 
assumed to enable owners to purchase land to replace the expropriated land. Land replacement is not 
prohibited by the law, but it is not expected and it would be impractical in the Romanian context to 
make administered land substitution a standard policy, given limited amounts of state land and the 
prevalence of ownership issues related to re-privatization and restitution of previously nationalized 
lands.  
73. 
Land can be bought and sold freely in urban and rural areas. The rural land market is open, 
but it is not really active, as sales are very limited. All informants claim that owners are generally 
amenable to sell land and buyers can find land easily. Reportedly, those who lose land to 
expropriation can readily purchase alternative land from others who would like to sell. Consequently, 
as the land market is open and active on the supply side, affected persons use the market for land and 
housing, if needed, and there is sufficient supply of land and housing, a land-based expropriation 
strategy is not necessary. 
74. 
Municipalities and local self-government authorities may own land that can be sold and/or 
exchanged to owners of expropriated land on a case-by case basis. When this occurs, if the alternative 
plot is either more valuable or less valuable than the expropriated land, the difference is settled in 
cash. For example, Arad has implemented such arrangements, as it has both urban and rural land 
available. 
Operational Principle
 
7.
 For those without formal legal rights to lands or claims to such land that 
could be recognized under the laws of the country, provide resettlement assistance in lieu of 
compensation for land to help improve or at least restore their livelihoods
.
75. 
The expropriator/project developer advises owners about the registration process for 
unregistered lands. This is a mutual interest, as lands have to be registered to be purchased. People 
who have been using state land for 30 years can apply for ownership and registration (governed by the 
Civil and Civil Procedure Codes). Households living on or using land they do not own are only 
compensated for their “value added” contributions (lost above-ground assets) (Art. 26 and 28 
Page  28
18
 
Expropriation Law). There is no specific provision for resettlement assistance in lieu of compensation 
for land, except as it would be claimed and included under 
“prejudice.” 
Operational Principle 8.
 Disclose draft resettlement plans, including documentation of the 
consultation process, in a timely manner, before appraisal formally begins, in an accessible place and 
in a form and language that are understandable to key stakeholders. 
76. 
Proposals for expropriation and Location Permits and Technical Designs are prepared in the 
local language and made available in the respective county or local council office and the 
expropriator’s office and are posted in the official gazette and local newspapers before expropriation 
is initiated. Interested parties, including actual or potential affected persons, can register their 
concerns verbally or in writing when the expropriation decision is under consideration and later, after 
the Technical Design is completed. No formal resettlement or land acquisition plans are issued in 
addition to the documentation required to justify expropriation and the Technical Design, but these 
documents are essentially equivalent to the plans specified in the principle. Documentation of the 
consultation process includes the minutes of the expropriation decision and the findings of the 
commission established by the mayor respond to complaints and objections.  
Operational Principle
 
9.
 Apply the principles described in the involuntary resettlement section of this 
Table, as applicable and relevant, to subprojects requiring land acquisition. 
77. 
The principles apply to all aspects of an investment involving expropriation, at each level of 
government, including all subprojects.  
Operational Principle 10.
 Design, document, and disclose before appraisal of projects involving 
involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks and protected areas, a participatory 
process for: (a) preparing and implementing project components; (b) establishing eligibility criteria; 
(c) agreeing on mitigation measures that help improve or restore livelihoods in a manner that 
maintains the sustainability of the park or protected area; (d) resolving conflicts; and (e) monitoring 
implementation. 
78. 
This issue is not relevant to the pilot projects. 
Operational Principle 11.
 Implement all relevant resettlement plans before project completion and 
provide resettlement entitlements before displacement or restriction of access. For projects involving 
restriction of access, impose the restrictions in accordance with the timetable in the plan of actions. 
79. 
Expropriation must be completed before a Construction License is issued, which enables the 
project proponent/expropriator to start civil works.  
80. 
There are no restrictions on access that require mitigation. 
Operational Principle 12.
 Assess whether the objectives of the resettlement instrument have been 
achieved, upon completion of the project, taking account of the baseline conditions and the results of 
resettlement monitoring. 
81. 
No ongoing monitoring of the expropriation process is required. Similarly, no follow-up 
assessments are undertaken, as compensation is assumed to be adequate unless it is revised by a court 
decision in response to a challenge.  
Page  29
19
 
Analysis of Gaps 
82. 
There are no salient differences between Romanian expropriation laws and Table A1 of OP 
4.00 in the objectives and principles 1, 3, 8, 9 and 11. Principle 10 is not relevant for the pilot 
projects. 
83. 
The principles in which there are differences are discussed below, with abbreviated titles of 
the respective principles. 
84. 
Operational Principle 2. Census and Survey.
 The expropriation documents and Technical 
Design include information on household land ownership, which constitutes a proxy for a household 
census.  This operational principle also requires a baseline household socio-economic survey to be 
carried out. However, Romanian expropriation laws and procedures do not require a survey. The pilot 
projects primarily involve land acquisition, not physical relocation, and would not require affected 
persons to change occupations, for which a socio-economic survey might have some value. Therefore, 
this difference does not compromise the objectives or outcome of the process and this is not a 
significant gap that would need to be filled in order for the projects to be piloted under OP 4.00 
85. 
Operational Principle 4. Consultation, Entitlements and Special Groups.
 The consultation 
and disclosure process is adequate, although a specific resettlement document is not required. The  
documents prepared for the Expropriation Decision and the Technical Design can be considered 
reasonable proxies for the plan specified in the principle.  
86. 
Eligibility for compensation is based on documentation of ownership or claims for damages. 
Within 15 days of the completion of the Technical Design, which identifies affected persons 
specifically, these are notified by letter of the intent to expropriate, along with a copy of the minutes 
of the Expropriation Decision. Negotiation for compensation can be complicated if the land is not 
titled and ownership is contested, however. The estimated cost of expropriation is included in the 
expropriation request and refined in the Technical Design, which includes estimates of the value of 
each parcel. Affected persons must request compensation for 
“prejudice,” during negotiation or in the 
court, if they are not satisfied with the outcome of negotiations.  
87. 
The process does not give special consideration to the vulnerable or excluded groups, but that 
difference is not considered to be significant if (a) assessed valuation is adequate and consistent and 
(b) people are informed of their rights and entitlements. Informants indicated little experience with the 
issue of illegal occupation and squatters, and this needs to be monitored closely during 
implementation.  
88. 
Operational Principle 5. Inform People of Rights, Compensate and Support Transition.
 
There are no provisions that require the expropriator to inform people of their rights. If information is 
provided, however, it is cursory and appears to be inadequate. This is a salient divergence from the 
principle which could have significant impact if it results in compensation below market value and 
people are unaware of opportunities to contest the amount. This gap will have to be filled. 
89. 
Prompt payment of compensation is required, and consistent with the principle, but violations 
of this principle in major highway construction have been reported, thus the issue will need to be 
monitored closely during implementation. 
90. 
Property values are assessed by certified assessors. Informants indicated some discrepancies 
in the extent to which specific assessment reports are prepared and whether they are prepared before 
or after negotiations. If the reports are prepared before negotiations, they are not necessarily shared 
with owners, thus potentially disadvantaging them in negotiations. This is a salient divergence which 
will be mitigated by standardizing the timing of assessments as well as requiring them to be shared 
with owners at the start of negotiations.  
Page  30
20
 
91. 
The quality and consistency of assessors appears to be subject to dispute, which undermines 
public confidence in the valuation process and could result in under-valuation, which would violate 
the principle. This divergence in practice will be mitigated.  
92. 
If people are adequately informed about their rights, a combination of compensation for assets 
and prejudice should be adequate for households to restore their assets, livelihoods and, if relevant, 
transition to another location. Improving the dissemination of information will help reduce the 
likelihood that compensation is inadequate, making the process and practice equivalent to the 
principle. To address the divergence in practice related to information dissemination, the letter that 
announces the intent to expropriate will be accompanied by a brochure that clearly describes the 
expropriation process and the rights of owners in the process, including the scope of prejudice.  
93. 
If affected persons are compensated adequately for their losses, there is land is available for 
owners to make their own adjustments, thus the divergence from the principle of a land based strategy 
is not considered to be material. Special cases involving major land losses and the loss of businesses 
and residences would need to be managed on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the Bank.  
94. 
Operational Principle 6. Preference for a Land Based Strategy.
 The use of cash 
compensation for expropriation in Romania differs from the principle that compensation of people 
displaced from land-based livelihoods and expropriation should be land based. Given the complex 
landholding situation in Romania and the lack of availability of State land that could be traded, and 
given the availability of private land for purchase and open access to the land market, the current 
arrangement is adequate to enable affected households to pursue a land based solution on their own, if 
they so desire. This difference from the principle is therefore not considered to be significant. 
95. 
Operational Principle 7. Provide Resettlement Assistance to those Without Formal Legal 
Rights to Land.
 Informants indicated little experience expropriating land used by people who are 
without use or ownership rights. Romanian law does not make specific provision to compensate 
people without legal rights to land, although they may be eligible to claim damages (prejudice). It is 
not expected that the pilot projects will encounter such situations, and Bank and Romanian authorities 
will establish a mechanism to address this issue in the unlikely event that people without legal title to 
land are affected by the pilot projects. Each case should subsequently be monitored. 
96. 
8. Follow-up Monitoring and Assessment.
 Romanian law and practices do not require 
monitoring or assessment of the impact of expropriation. This is a divergence that will be addressed 
through independent monitoring and regular Bank supervision.  
3.6.3 
Current and Proposed Measures to Address Gaps 
97. 
Two salient gap-filling measures were explored as a means to achieve equivalence. They are 
as follows: 
98. 
Notify Owners of Rights and Procedures.
 An information brochure acceptable to the Bank 
could be prepared for each government level (national, county and local) that outlines steps in the 
expropriation process; discusses the valuation and negotiation processes; describes the steps in 
obtaining compensation for damages (prejudice), including relocation costs and assistance to address 
impact on livelihoods, if relevant; provides information on the rights of owners at each step of the 
process and avenues of recourse at each step; and advises on how owners can obtain legal assistance, 
if needed. The brochure could then be distributed with each letter, notifiying an owner of the intent to 
expropriate. The practice should be specified in any guidance documents and manuals of the 
respective agencies. 
99. 
Monitor.
 A local independent monitor could report on expropriation activities and their 
impacts. The Bank will then monitor the promptness and adequacy of compensation, including 
prejudice, and the impacts of expropriation during regular supervision missions and recommend steps 
Page  31
21
 
to resolve significant problems that emerge during implementation as identified by project officials 
and independent monitors.  
4.0 A
CCEPTABILITY 
A
SSESSMENT
 
4.1 
Purpose and Scope of the Acceptability Assessment 
100. 
The previous sections on 
“equivalence” examined the Romanian system of laws, regulations, 
rules and procedures relative to the Objectives and Operational Principles as stated in Table A1 of 
OP/BP 4.00. The purpose of this acceptability assessment is to confirm that the implementation 
practices, track record and institutional capacity of relevant Romanian institutions in addressing 
environmental and social issues in the proposed MSP and TSSP are acceptable and meet the 
requirements stated in Bank Policy OP 4.00. It should be noted that the Bank will continue to 
supervise pilot projects during implementation; in fact with no diminution of attention. Ensuring a 
good “track record” in advance of project implementation should solidify lessons gained from 
piloting, however. 
4.2 
Methodology Used to Determine Acceptability 
101. 
To complete this assessment of “acceptability” several key factors were considered: (i) 
existing formal or informal processes in place to implement the laws, by-laws and procedures; (ii) 
capability in the field, as judged through selected field interviews, site visits and desk reviews of 
Bank-supported projects; (iii) evidence of progress towards meeting EU targets on transposition of 
legislation, staffing and budgets where these apply; (iv) informal consultations with specialist and 
stakeholders; and (v) the track record of Romania compared to other Bank middle-income countries in 
these regards. 
102. 
Regarding the field reviews, World Bank specialists visited ongoing, proposed and completed 
projects (Bank, Romania and EU-financed) in representative key cities slated for the Municipal 
Services and Transport Sector Support projects, including Bucharest, Brasov, Tirgu Mures, Arad, and 
Calarasi. Selected bidding documents and environmental reports were reviewed, as were government 
procedural manuals, compliance checklists and other information sources.  
103. 
Interviews with EU officials responsible for peer reviews of Romanian environmental 
systems, and for determining progress with accession requirements were also helpful. The World 
Bank files for the Railway Rehabilitation project (closed in September 2003) and ongoing Roads 2 
and Transport Restructuring projects, showing satisfactory progress on safeguards, were also 
reviewed. 
4.3 Acceptability 
Assessment 
–
Environment Assessment  
4.3.1 
Implementation Practices and Institutional Capacity 
104. 
Romania is committed to making enormous investments in environmental protection and 
management as part of its EU accession process. This commitment includes: (i) completing the 
transposition of the comprehensive EU environmental 
aquis
;
(ii) strengthening the institutional 
capacity in the environmental sector at local, regional and central level; (iii) investing in pollution 
control to meet media-specific directives; (iv) building enforcement and control capacity.  
105. 
Environmental protection investments in infrastructure are increasing dramatically; for 
example about Euro 347.8 million were spent during the period of January-July, 2005 on technology 
alone; largely in water and air pollution control by industry. An additional amount of Euro 1,200 
million has been allocated to Romania under the EU
’s ISPA program (through 2006) for critical 
investments in water and transport infrastructure; supported by environmental capacity-building at the 
local level.  
Page  32
22
 
106. 
Capabilities on the institutional front are also getting stronger and are considered sufficient to 
support piloting of Environmental Assessment. The establishment of an over-arching Ministry of 
Environment and Water Management (MEWM) with specialized Departments and Directions is 
considered by European Commission officials to be a very positive step. MEWM has eight Regional 
Agencies (REPA) and 42 County Agencies (LEPA). Staff is organized to carry out oversight (in 
parallel with routine World Bank supervision) on the types of investments planned to be supported by 
the Municipal Services and Transport Sector Support projects. Staffing in the MEWM has been 
increasing with approximately 949 specialists being added recently in the environmental sector at 
central, regional and local levels. Overall, the MEWM has developed a strategy to increase 
environment personnel by 1,660 persons/civil servants by 2006; driven again by meeting expectations 
of the EU regards with regards to capacity needs. The MEWM, its entities and supporting 
administrative structures implement relevant EA laws, by-laws, and established procedures through a 
practice which is embodied in the application, review and approval (or denial) of various licenses (to 
construct) and permits (to operate). As presented in more detail in Annex IB, these are effective 
analogies to World Bank procedures for the review of proposed projects under relevant safeguard 
policies.  
107. 
The importance of training and public awareness components have been recognized in the 
move towards EU accession. A total of twelve (12) training seminars for experts in the MEWM and 
their subordinate structures took place during 2005. About ten EU-twinning projects totaling Euro 
13.5 million are developed and/or scheduled to be launched during the period of 2005-2006 with a 
focus on training and technical assistance of government personnel. Public education and awareness 
programs are aimed at business operators, public officials and local stakeholders. 
108. 
In addition, environmental inspection, compliance and control is on track for significant 
improvement through the consolidation and growth of the National Environmental Guard (NEG), the 
national institution under the MEWM that is in charge with: (i) the inspection and enforcement 
activities for environment protection; and (ii) the issuance of penalties for exceeding discharges and 
emission limits. Control and monitoring actions have strengthened during the last year. For example, 
during the period of July 1-August 15, 2005, the representatives of NEG performed inspections at 958 
sites; a significant increase over previous periods. The process of assigning fees and fines has also 
evolved to reduce the potential for corruption, as contrasted to more favorable investments in 
pollution control technology.  
109. 
The NEG works closely with other institutions on monitoring; for example the National 
Water Agency, 
“
Apele Romane,
”
which is responsible for ambient water flow and quality and. On the 
transport side, we also found capability for setting and tracking environmental requirements in such 
institutions as: (i) National Railway Company (SNCFR), (ii) Roads Design Institute (IPTANA) and 
(iii) Railway Design Institute (ISPCF). These entities help set performance or technical standards in 
bid documents for maintenance projects that are comparable to the Bank’s Environmental 
Management Plans for such relatively lower risk investments.  
110. 
The National Environmental Protection Agency is an entity with growing responsibilities and 
influence. It plays a key advisory role in policy and strategy formulation and implementation. Key 
Directorates include one for nature conservation, biodiversity and soil protection, and another for 
monitoring and data coordination and synthesis. Additional institutional information is provided in 
Annex IC. 
4.3.2 
Analysis of Gaps 
111. 
In system design and general implementation, there are no gaps regarding the acceptability of 
Romanian systems that would inhibit piloting for Environmental Assessment. It is recognized, 
however, that some regional and local arms of the MEWM (including the NEG) are still staffing up, 
and that experience is only now being gained on new monitoring, inspection and compliance 
programs. Therefore the only weakness identified here is a limited “track record” of improved 
Page  33
23
 
performance under a strengthening structure. As noted below, however, this will be addressed through 
mutually-beneficial pilot project implementation. 
4.3.3 
Current and Proposed Measures to Maintain Acceptability 
112. 
There are no gaps in application of the Romanian system which require modification to 
increase acceptability. Nevertheless, to avoid any significant differences in the environmental 
protection outcome of the EA process, and maintain acceptability during the pilot program, the Bank 
and Romania have agreed on an approach to initially review and clear sub-project EAs jointly, as 
follows: 
ƒ
the first three environmental impact assessment reports and the first three environmental 
permits/licenses that maybe required under Romanian Law for the carrying out of the Project, 
shall be submitted to the Bank for its prior review; and  
ƒ
As an integrated part of the normal procurement practice (with commensurate 
ex-ante
 and 
ex-
post
 provisions), review of relevant annexes of bid documents describing environmental 
mitigation and monitoring procedures to be carried out by works contractors, supervisory 
contractors, etc.. 
113. 
To reinforce the importance of good compliance, monitoring and enforcement, the Bank will 
receive regular updates of sub-project compliance with Romanian environmental laws. To the extent 
practical, the Bank will coordinate supervision visits with local environmental officials.  
114. 
Strengthening of the EA system is underway as part of the EU accession process and would 
be helpful more broadly for environmental performance improvement, but it is not necessary to meet 
the due diligence requirements for the Municipal Services and Transport Sector Support projects. It 
should also be noted that the Bank
’s proposed Environmental Management Loan (slated for delivery 
in FY07) will provide considerable capacity building which will directly and positively improve 
Romanian systems at both the policy and field levels. A strong and well equipped administration is 
needed for the application of the EU acquis.
28
 
4.4 Acceptability 
Analysis 
–
Cultural Property 
4.4.1 Implementation 
Practice 
and 
Institutional 
Capacity 
115. 
As noted earlier, the Romanian system of laws and procedures on cultural property is quite 
comprehensive. Bank staff reviewed Romanian implementation practices, track record, and capacity 
in this regard in connection with the implementation of Bank projects, and more broadly in 
discussions with officials in Bucharest, Arad, Brasov and other cities.  
116. 
In practice, the wide applicability and comprehensiveness of the Romanian legal system in 
this area can mean a backlog on processing applications by relevant bodies, with the potential for 
some applications not getting full review. This is not unexpected given the rapidity of investment 
growth in the country. In addition, the level of public awareness of the law on protection of PCR is 
fairly limited and, if known, often seen as being of secondary importance to new investments and 
development (especially in historic town centers which often have older road, energy, 
telecommunications, and water infrastructure). Although the MCRA has carried out awareness raising 
campaigns of the law in national newspapers, local museums do not always have a particularly 
interactive dialogue with the public, seeing themselves more as research institutes. The lack of 
awareness is aided by the fact that not all historic monuments are marked with a clearly identifiable 
sign, as mandated in Law 422/2001.  
28
 http/europa/Eu.int/enlargement negotiations/chapters/chap22/index.htm. Capacity-building support through the EU 
IMPEL/ECENA networks is particularly relevant. 
Page  34
24
 
117. 
The MCRA has a decentralized staff, with one representative in each of the 42 Counties of 
Romania. Most municipalities, however, do not have services for PCR analysis and support, so this 
work is typically carried out by local museums (according to a list of experts maintained by the 
MCRA). In addition, the MCRA notes that in only three counties do they have an archaeologist 
working at local level for the MCRA.  
118. 
Public consultation is provided under EIA procedures, whereby PCR must be identified 
during the screening, scoping and review phases. This can help to supplement the traditional lists of 
classified monuments and sites by taking into account, through studies and consultation, the entire 
project impact area. MCRA, the NCHM and NCA together do work out programs for training 
specialists, as well as plans of teaching and specialization in the field of protecting PCR. 
4.4.2 
Analysis of Gaps 
119. 
In practice, the principles and procedures outlined in section 3.4.1 are satisfactorily 
implemented but, as noted, there are instances when applications for building permission do not get 
fully reviewed, and occasions when the local representatives of the MCRA are not consulted prior to 
applications being granted. In addition, not all General Urban Plans are being systematically 
communicated to the MCRA and reviewed by the NCHM. 
120. 
The Romanian system has exhibited good practices including: (i) inventories of buildings and 
sites of cultural significance, (ii) inventories being supplemented by in-field surveys where 
inventories are insufficient, (iii) use of local experts on archeology, architecture and other relevant 
fields for assessments before construction decisions are made, and after if 
“chance finds” are 
encountered during construction, and (iv) full approvals by relevant local bodies before construction 
and operation takes place. Nevertheless, there have been reported situations of gaps in diligence.  
4.4.3 
Current and Proposed Measures to Maintain the Acceptability 
121. 
In light of the assessment above, to maintain acceptability the Bank will supervise the project 
to ensure cooperation between environmental and cultural property specialists. Example good 
practices include:  
ƒ
More routine representation of the MCRA staff or suggested experts on EIA Technical 
Review Committee/s; 
ƒ
PCR experts, as identified by the MCRA, are used to help draft the PCR aspects of the EIA 
study, and 
ƒ
Where appropriate, provisions for safeguarding PCR, including those for ‘chance finds should 
monitored under individual licensing procedures. 
122. 
With such measures taken to maintain acceptability, we do find the system appropriate for 
piloting. 
4.5. 
Acceptability Assessment - Dam Safety 
123. 
OP 4.00 allows piloting of borrower dam safety requirements as they apply to three types of 
projects: (i) construction of new dams, (ii) rehabilitation of existing dams, and (iii) carrying out 
activities that may be affected by an existing dam.  
124. 
The World Bank has financed projects covering points (ii) and (iii) and, regarding 
acceptability, has found good progress to date. Dam safety safeguards requirements are implemented 
by the Borrower (through the Ministry of Environment and Water Management).  
Page  35
25
 
125. 
During the preparation of the Municipal Services Project (i.e. before the selection of 
Bucharest and Arad for the bulk of investments), it was possible that candidate sub-projects might 
have included rehabilitation or extension of drinking water systems where supply is obtained from 
dams or other control structures. New dams would not have been financed by the project, nor would 
dams have been rehabilitated under the project, but the capability of Romanian authorities to ensure 
dam safety was considered important should water supplies under the project be associated with 
control structures. Such sub-projects are not, however, currently included in the project but the 
resultant 
“equivalence and acceptability” assessment is left included in this report for possible future 
reference. 
126. 
In Romania the implementation of the dam safety policy is achieved though ten consulting 
firms experienced in dam safety design. The MEWM has five specialists, who work closely with 
CONSIB (two of them being also members) while the National Agency “Apele Romane” has ten 
specialists including two in the headquarter office and eight in the regional branches (one for each 
river basin department). The CONSIB experts are in charge with the review of the dam safety designs 
as well as with periodic inspections and reviews of dam safety operations.  
127. 
Training options on dam safety were scarce. Recently, the World Bank HRMEP project 
currently under implementation in Romania offered the opportunity of a USBR training course on 
dam safety and plans to continue to enhance the technical capacity of Romanian engineers in the field. 
Contacts with international experts are held periodically through participation in seminars and 
workshops, but the participation is limited to a small number of experts. 
128. 
Satisfactory progress was made since: 
ƒ
A
Panel of Experts (POE) including independent experts certified by MEWM and members 
of CONSIB was selected by the implementing agency to undertake reviews of designs and 
technical specifications for works; 
ƒ
The POE advises on construction quality;  
ƒ
For each of the dams included in the project, emergency preparedness plans (EPP) are in 
place and periodically updated;  
ƒ
During the floods which occurred this year no dam was compromised and the functionality of 
Emergency Preparedness Plans was assessed, and  
ƒ
Operation and Maintenance plans are in place for each dam, and the dams subject to 
rehabilitation are operated under restrictions which were fully observed during recent floods.  
129. 
The Bank has noted good implementation practices on dam safety since implementation of 
HRMEP, and, should the policy have been triggered under the Municipal Services project (in the 
limited manner examined during preparation), Romanian procedures would have been acceptable for 
piloting under OP 4.00.

Acceptability Assessment - Involuntary Resettlement 
4.6.1 Implementation 
Practice 
and 
Institutional 
Capacity 
130. 
Implementing agencies and local governments have adequate staff with appropriate skills to 
undertake any land acquisition satisfactorily. In turn, they have access to qualified assessors, although 
some informants raised questions about the quality and consistency of assessments.  
131. 
The investigations for the acceptability analysis revealed that agencies at all levels 
consistently and systematically adhere to the standards and procedures specified in the Expropriation 
Page  36
26
 
Law and related regulations. Responsible officials are fully versed in the law and knowledgeable 
about both required practices and shortcomings. The official process required to justify expropriation, 
and practical consideration of the problems associated with establishing ownership and conducting 
negotiations are an effective deterrent to frivolous use of the expropriation process. Moreover, 
expropriating residences and businesses is even more difficult thus, in practice, alternative designs are 
considered and designs are revised to eliminate the need to abolish structures and relocate households. 
For example, the alignments of bypasses to be constructed under the Transport Restructuring Project 
deliberately avoided residences. 
4.6.2 
Analysis of Gaps 
132. 
The equivalence analysis discussed above identified two areas which would have required 
gap-filling had this policy area been selected for piloting under OP 4.00: notification of affected 
persons of the expropriation process and their rights and opportunities for redress; and monitoring of 
the impact of expropriation. Details on these measures for addressing these issues are discussed in the 
next section, though Romania has not selected this policy for piloting, and a conventional approach 
under OP 4.12 has been selected for the one project (TSSP) where this policy area is triggered.  
133. 
The expropriation process is clear and consistently executed, but there are three areas of 
weakness. First, the law requires that property valuation be carried out by certified experts, but the 
process is not fully transparent. Presumably, the purpose of the requirement is to protect the interests 
of both the government and private parties. The valuation assessments will serve both parties, not just 
the expropriator, thus they will be shared with owners, as well, in order to level the playing field. 
Second, compensation must be no lower than assessed valuation, but the lack of transparency in the 
valuation and negotiation processes makes it difficult for owners to be confident that they have 
received a fair price for their assets. Third, little documentation was received regarding some of the 
more complicated issues that the Bank
’s policies are designed to address, such as compensation for 
loss of livelihoods, illegal occupation, and direct and indirect impacts on businesses. It was concluded 
that the limited experience in dealing with these issues offers an opportunity for an ongoing dialogue 
between the Bank and expropriators, if such exceptional cases occur, to give both parties the 
assurance that best practices are followed.  
134. 
Gap-filling measures regarding how to address these three issues are discussed in the 
following section.  
4.6.3 
Current and Proposed Measures to Increase the Acceptability 
135. 
The several areas in which Romanian expropriation laws and practices diverge significantly 
from the principles in Annex A, OP 4.0, and areas in which experience is too limited to determine 
whether practices ultimately achieve the principles, have been discussed above. These divergences are 
discussed below, together with suggested actions which could be taken to comply fully with the 
Bank’s responsibilities had this policy area been selected for piloting.  
136. 
Share Assessments carried out by Qualified Assessors.
 To meet the requirements of OP 4.00, 
the Bank and the Client would have agreed on the timing of valuation assessments and the 
qualifications of assessors, such as the requirement that they be certified and trained in market-based 
assessments. In addition, the Client would require field staff to share assessment reports with owners 
at the start of negotiations, and incorporate the requirement in operational guidelines and manuals. 
137. 
Pay Compensation at the Assessed Value of land and Damages.
 Expropriators could be 
expected to document the fact that they did not pay too much for land, but not that the compensation 
at least equals the assessed value of land and other assets. Negotiators could be instructed to ensure 
that they pay assessed value at a minimum and that they document this in each expropriation file. 
Page  37
27
 
138. 
Inform of Exceptional Cases.
 The expropriation of residences and businesses appears to be 
rare, and there is little follow-up, thus there is some uncertainty about the final status of owners who 
lose more than land due to expropriation. Consequently, should this policy area been selected for 
piloting, the Bank would have needed assurances that unusual cases are handled appropriately. 
Specific arrangements would have been needed to address such cases. The Bank would then be 
informed promptly of cases such as those listed below and apprised of the proposed remedial 
approach, based on agreed arrangements, before proceeding. The following circumstances will require 
notification: acquisition of residences; acquisition of parts of an agricultural holding where the 
remainder is not adequate to allow people to sustain their livelihoods, compelling affected people to 
change their occupations; acquisition of commercial structures or businesses; and expropriation of 
land used by people without claim to legal title.  
Some gap filling measures were presented to Romania to achieve and sustain equivalence and 
acceptability in the area of Involuntary Resettlement, but in the end a conventional approach for due 
diligence in this policy area was selected. .Consequently, Bank guidelines on Involuntary 
Resettlement as embodied in OP/BP 4.12 will apply to the TSSP project.

Romanian Licensing and Permitting Procedures 
Introduction 
146. 
In conformity with the Law of Environmental Protection No.137/1995 including the 
respective updates - the Emergency Ordinance No.152/2005, the Governmental Decision No. 
918/2002, and the Ordinance of the Ministry of Environment and Water Management No. 860/2002 
and 863/2002, the decision making process of the EIA regarding the issuance of the Environmental 
License to construct and the Environmental Permit to operate is well developed. The Environmental 
Protection Law sets out the EIA requirements and principles; the GD 918/2002 sets out the 
procedures, while the OM 860/2002 and 863/2002 present in detail the procedures for EIA and for 
issuing the environmental license.  
147. 
Based on Romanian Law, any development of a new facility or modification of an existing 
one listed in Annex I of GD 918/2002 requires the approval of an EIA before the environmental 
license (environmental agreement) and permit to operate (environmental authorization) is approved by 
LEPAs. For any activities not covered in the list of mandatory EIA (Annex II of the GD 
no.918/2002), the LEPAs or REPAs use selection criteria to determine whether such activities could 
have a significant environmental impact. Existing facilities require an environmental permit from the 
LEPAs, which includes assessment of compliance with the environmental standards (e.g., conditions 
related to air, water, and soil reflecting existing standards).  
148. 
The GD 918/2002 presents the steps of the procedure, the requirements that the physical or 
legal certified persons to prepare the impact studies, and the list of activities which are subject to the 
EIA procedure. Overall, the EIA procedure includes a screening stage, a scoping stage, and a 
validation stage.  
Procedures for Receiving an Environmental License to Construct (OR the Environmental 
Agreement) 
149. 
The procedure for issuing the environmental license to construct is described in detail in the 
following steps and briefly presented in the flow chart. 
Step 1. The initial screening of the new project/investment  
This is determined by the local EPA responsible for the location (commune, city) where the 
investment will develop. When requesting the 
Environmental License to Construct
,
the 
Beneficiary/the Project Proponent (e.g., N
ational Railways Company SCNCF “CFR” SA; the City 
Hall) 
is responsible to present to the local/regional EPA or MEWM a 
Technical File 
including the 
following documentation: 
ƒ
Request Form
 of the EA in conformity with the MO No. 860/2002; this request is attention to 
the local or regional EPA or to the MEWM depending on the geographical location of the 
project; 
ƒ
Urban Planning Certificate
 and the corresponding licenses and permits (obtained at the level 
of Feasibility Study)
 
based on the corresponding law; 
ƒ
Contracts
 with the local solid waste company for collection of the solid wastes and with 
“Apele Romane” for water supply and sewage discharges (other authorizations from local 
utilities may be required based on necessity);  
ƒ
Technical Memorandum
 (standard form) in conformity with Annex II.2 of the MO No. 
860/2002 (prepared by the Consultant/Firm that developed the Feasibility Study); 
Page  44
34
 
ƒ
Technical Note
 (standard technical form) in conformity with the OMEWM No. 1943/2001 
(prepared by the Consultant/Firm that developed the Feasibility Study);  
ƒ
Fee
 (differs depending on the stage of the EA process); 
ƒ
Public announcement
 regarding the request to obtain the Environmental Permit in conformity 
with Annex II.4 of the MO No. 860/2002. 
Within the EPA, a Technical Review Committee (TRC) is formed based on the Ordinance of Prefect, 
which includes members of the local/regional EPA, the National Environmental Guard (NAG), the 
National Water Company 
“Apele Romane,” Sanitary and Urban Institutes and those authorities 
responsible for environmental permits authorizations. The TRC members analyze the documentation 
presented within the Technical File and issue one of the following three classifications of the project 
investments: (i) activities are of insignificant environmental impact and therefore the project is NOT 
subject to environmental procedure;
33
 (ii) activities are of low environmental impact and the 
simplified licensing procedure
 will apply;
34
 and (iii) activities are of significant environmental impact 
and the 
full environmental permitting procedure
 will apply.
35
 Furthermore, (for cases (ii) and (iii)) the 
EPA authorities together with the members of TRC and the Beneficiary are visiting the site of the 
future investment to: (i) verify its location as presented in the Technical File; and (ii) complete the 
List of Control
 developed according to the OMEWM No. 863/2002.  
Step 2. EIA Report Preparation  
The EPA
 reviews and approves the 
List of Control
 which includes the conclusion presented by the 
TRC, based on which documents it announces the Beneficiary of his obligation to develop the EIA 
study (the impact study). 
The Beneficiary
 is obliged to: 
ƒ
Prepare the EIA report
 in conformity with the OMEWM No. 863/2002. The EIA report 
should be developed only by physical persons or consulting firms independent
36
 of the 
Beneficiary and the person who developed the Feasibility Study, that are accredited for 
developing such technical studies for Infrastructure Projects/Investments (as defined in the 
Annex 4 of the OM No. 978/2003) including the legal conditions stipulated in the OM No. 
978/2003 and 97/2004;  
ƒ
Hire
 based on contract and competition through expression of interest/invitation to submit 
proposals process the firm/physical person who will develop the EA report; 
ƒ
Prepare and sponsor the public announcement
 of the definition of the project (this is the 2nd 
public information in the EIA process approval); 
Step 3. The review of the EIA Report 
At this stage, 
the EPA
 is charged with the following steps: (i) completing the 
List of Control
 for the 
EIA Report analysis process; (ii) preparing the 
Public Consultation;
37
 and (iii) communicating the 
results to the Beneficiary. 
33
 Stamp 
“A” will be placed on the technical file by the environmental authority. 
34
 Stamp “B” will be placed on the technical file and the project is subject to environmental procedure WITHOUT an 
environmental agreement 
35
 Stamp “B” will be placed on the technical file and the project is subject to environmental procedure WITH an

Additional points: 
ƒ
The EIA report is prepared at the level of the project
’s Feasibility Study, in conformity with 
GD No. 918/2002;  
ƒ
The minimum information presented by the Beneficiary during the request to obtain the 
Environmental License should be also completed based on conditions recommended by the 
foreign donors (EBRD, WB, EIB) and/or as required by the EU legislation and the Romanian 
legislation in force; 
ƒ
For those investments obtained through ISPA or SAPARD funds, the conditions during the 
project operation established through the Environmental Permit will take in consideration the 
limits of the pollutants’ discharges required by the EU and Romanian legislation. However, 
the national limits will prevail if they are more restrictive than those imposed by the EU 
legislation. 
ƒ
The Environmental License is valid during the entire period of the project construction, but 
will expire if the investment works will not start in maximum 2 years from its approval. 
During the period of investment constructions, the local environmental protection authorities 
will monitor those conditions imposed by the Environmental License (please note detailed 
information on the monitoring process in the next section);  
ƒ
The Beneficiary is obliged by law to inform the environmental protection authorities in 
writing any time when there is a significant modification of the initial conditions of the 
project based on which the current Environmental License was issued.

150. 
The Environmental Permit to Operate investments with 
significant
 impact on the environment 
is issued by the EPA in conformity with OMEWM No. 876/2004. The local EPA together with the 
local National Environmental Guard as well as representatives of National Agency 
“Apele Romane” 
is inspecting the site after construction and issue a technical note with observations at the site (e.g., 
Environmental Audit).  
151. 
The Environmental Audit of existing facilities is carried out only by certified persons paid by 
the Project Proponent and includes: (i) a checklist including characteristic elements of the investment; 
(ii) an environmental study including data collection and technical review of all environmental 
aspects, before taking a decision on the scale of potential or existing environmental impacts from the 
site; and (iii) site investigations to quantify the potential scale of contamination of the site. 
Compliance programs are usually required based on the result of the environmental audit.  
152. 
The Beneficiary
 is charged with: 
ƒ
Requesting the Environmental Permit from the local EPA; 
ƒ
Preparing a 
Technical File
 as in the previous case; 
ƒ
Announcing the public about the request to start operations; 
ƒ
Seeking annual renewal of the permit once it is issued (it is valid for 5 years). 
153. 
Standards (ambient and emission limits) are usually followed to comply with the 
environmental protection as requested by EU. Currently there are ambient standards for air, noise, 
waste and discharges of certain substances in the water.
40
 
Monitoring Capacity during the Constructions Period and After the Issuance of the 
Environmental Permit to Operate  
154. 
During constructions, LEPAs together with the NGA and “Apele Romane” are in charge with 
visiting the site of the project and inspecting the environmental compliances stipulated in the 
Environmental License and Environmental Permit. Also, within the technical Department of SNCFR, 
one permanently evaluates the impact of the railway activity regarding water, air, soil and noise 
pollution. This monitoring is achieved by analyses and measurements of environmental factors 
concentrations performed in the environmental protection laboratories network of SNCFR (there are 8 
regional laboratories). These laboratories are certified by the European RENAR.  
155. 
The NGA inspectors may accompany the LEPAs’ inspectors for site visits according to an 
inspection program. Following the site visit and checking the compliance, the inspectors prepare a 
report based on which they may advise the operators on how to meet standards and permit conditions. 
If a facility/project does not comply with relevant standards, it will first receive a warning from the 
inspector followed by a certain amount of time necessary to take care of the steps that comply with 
the permit. If these steps are not performed, an administrative fine will be imposed (the size of the 
fine varies as presented in the legislation). Finally, non-compliance will result in court action.

Introduction 
156. 
The costs that Romania needs to adjust to the EU environmental requirements by 2018 -the 
final year of the longest transition period obtained by Romania to comply with the EU environmental 
requirements - totals Euro 29.3 billion, out of which about 20% will be covered from the State and 
local budgets, 34% from the EC funds, 26 % by the business operators, and the rest of about 20% 
from other sources (credits, loans, bilateral agreements). The environmental protection investments 
totaled about Euro 347.8 million during the period of January-July, 2005, representing mainly the 
business operators
’
contribution in the industrial pollution control and air quality. The water sector 
requires the highest costs of the total needed expenses, specifically 65% (or Euro 19 billion) are 
estimated to account for wastewater treatment while about Euro 6.5 billion will be needed for the 
drinking water quality sector. 
157. 
The commitment undertaken by Romania during the Chapter 22 Environment negotiations 
refers to the following actions: (i) finalization of the environmental aquis transposition by the end of 
2006; (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity in the environmental sector at local, regional and 
central level; and (iii) enforcement and control of the relevant legislation.  
158. 
In order to strengthen the administrative and institutional capacity for implementation of the 
environmental legislation at national, regional and local level and for the country preparation for EU 
accession, the Government of Romania undertook a number of steps during 2004 and 2005 which are 
outlined in the following sections. 
Transposition of the EU Legislation and Its Enforcement 
159. 
By the third quarter of Calendar Year 2005, 95% of the EU environmental aquis is 
transposed, specifically the water quality sector, nature protection, noise and nuclear safety and radio-
protection. In sectors such as air quality or industrial pollution control, chemicals and waste 
management, transposition rates are about 90%; all institutional capacity of structural and cohesion 
funds absorption have been built and enhanced; all technical implementation measurements currently 
scheduled for 2005 have been completed.  
160. In 
the 
water sector
 the main legal acts are the Environmental protection Law and the Water 
Law 107/1996, recently amended in order to amend the Water Framework Directive. In order to 
improve the quality of waters, the 2004 National Report including management plans for the 
development of hydrographic basins in Romania was developed. Moreover, the maximum limits of 
certain dangerous chemical substances discharged into the surface waters were established. Also, the 
activity of reviewing and transposing the permit conditions of wastewater treatment plants discharges 
in surface waters has been launched.  
161. In 
the 
transport sector
,
the air quality problem is approached by imposing the use of less 
pollutant fuels and by rehabilitating the trans-European roads (GD 343/2002). In addition, regulations 
were adopted on certification of vehicle equipment, spare parts and materials (Law 671/2002), on 
periodical inspection of the vehicle technical quality to ensure safety on roads and environment 
protection (Law 167/2003), and on gas and particle emission limitation from internal combustion 
engines used for mobile equipment that are not vehicles (GD 743/2002).  
Institutional Consolidation 
162. 
Institutional consolidation through establishment of specific institutions for an adequate 
enforcement of the environment aquis and through approval of supplemental staff positions in the 
main institutions responsible for environmental protection to increase the efficiency of environmental

activity (Table xx). There are currently institutions with very clear responsibility in the 
implementation and control of the environment legislation enforcement as following:  
ƒ
the MEWM, by its specialized Departments and Directions (e.g., EU Integration; 
Environment; and Water), is in charge only with the development and supervision of 
application of the environment protection policy and strategy, programs and plans and 
concentrates on the coordination, elaboration, and promotion of norms that entirely transpose 
the EU legislation into the Romanian legislation. The MEWM has in its subordinate the 
NEPA, together with its eight Regional Agencies (REPA) and 42 County Agencies (LEPA); 
ƒ
the NEPA is the national institution that: (i) ensures the technical support of the MEWM; (ii) 
coordinates REPAs and LEPAs; and (iii) implements and monitors the environmental action 
plans at national, regional and county level;  
ƒ
the REPAs (8) are in charge with the environmental management at regional level and 
coordination of the LEPAs; 
ƒ
the LEPAs (42) are in charge with the coordination, implementation and monitoring of the 
environmental action plans at county level;  
ƒ
The NGA, which is directly subordinated to the MEWM, is the national authority for control 
and complying with the environmental protection legislation. The NGA is in charge with: (i) 
the inspection and enforcement activities for environment protection; and (ii) the issuance of 
penalties for exceeding discharges and emission limits; 
ƒ
The National Agency 
“Apele Romane” is the governmental authority responsible for the 
management of water quality and quantity of the Romanian hydrographical basins. Together 
with MEWM is the institution in charge with water as physical resources. 
ƒ
The MTCT is in charge with development of policies and activities in the transport sector, 
being the main regulation authority for vehicle emissions. Responsible also for activities 
concerning land use planning and tourism. 
ƒ
The Environmental Fund identifies environmental priorities and totals about Euro 50 million 
in 2005 mainly from environmental taxes.  
Other institutions involved: 
ƒ
ICIM – operates under the MEWM authority and caries out complex research studies 
concerning surface and underground water quality, air quality, pollution sources, 
environmental radioactivity, technical assistance and environmental expertise, training 
courses for the personnel in the environmental and water field. Although plays an important 
role in the overall functioning of the MEWP (including harmonization process, environmental 
monitoring and coordination of data provided by local EPAs, reference body for the Danube 
river areas conservation), ICIM has no regular yearly income secured from the State budget 
and about 85% of its funding is based on contracts with economic agents and private sector 
(e.g., EIA studies, environmental audits);  
ƒ
Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Water Management – operates under the National 
Agency “Apele Romane” authority and monitors, forecasts, and carries out research on 
meteorology, hydrology and water resource management as well as information on the ozone 
layer and wind speed; 
ƒ
SNCFR – implements the environmental implementation programs of an ecological railway 
transport in the country

163. 
Approximately 949 additional experts have been employed in the environmental sector at 
central, regional and local level. Overall, the MEWM has developed a strategy regarding the 
environment personnel increase by 1,660 persons/civil servants until 2006, as noted in the following 
table:

The Control and Monitoring Activities process including the prevention, observation and 
penalty application for avoiding the law regarding environmental protection strengthen during the last 
year. For example, during the period of July 1
st
-August 15, 2005, the representatives of NEG 
performed inspections at 958 economic agents concluding the following: (i) about 47% of the 
required environmental measures were adopted totaling 121,170 RON; and (ii) about 53% of other 
environmental protection investment measures proposed for 2005 were already developed totaling 
about 70,760 RON. Moreover, the NEG will perform a regular inspection together with 
representatives of MEWM (e.g., “Apele Romane”) and LEPA/NEPA in conformity with a program 
approved by the MEWM and LEPA/NEPA.  
Personnel Training 
166. 
A total of twelve (12) training seminars for experts in the MEWM and their subordinate 
structures took place during 2005. About ten (10) twinning projects totaling Euro 13.5 million are 
developed (and/or scheduled to be launched) during the period of 2005-2006 involving the daily 
training of REPA personnel as well as regular technical assistance for the personnel of NEPA and of 
the General Direction in charge with managing the Structural Funds within the MEWM. In 2004, the 
SNCFR achieved the training of 4 employees in Management integrated systems for quality (ISO 
9001), environment (ISO 14001), and health and work security (OHSAS 18001). Also, 7 SNCFR 
employees participated at ISO 1400 training while other 2 employees participated at the 
environmental auditors testing laboratories (ISO/EC 17025).  
Financing and Other Activities 
167. 
Financing and facilitating access to viable environmental technologies through strengthening 
the Environment Fund capacity: the number of applications and concrete projects using allocation of 
appropriate amounts from the EF has increased considerably. The amount of Euro 1,200 million 
allocated to Romania under the ISPA program until 2006 for the improvement of the environmental 
infrastructure has been covered through the projects submitted so far to Brussels. A new portfolio of 
projects able to absorb the future funds that Romania will benefit from in the future is in process to be 
established.

168. 
Supporting public education and awareness through specific programs related to 
environmental issues: numerous actions and awareness raising campaigns regarding the possibility of 
business operators, public administration, and all stakeholders in the environment protection have 
been carried-out.

Art 1 Law 137/1995 
 
Art 3(2) GD 918/2002 
 
More generally, environmental 
assessment is governed by the 
following Romanian legislation: 
Law 137/1995

Operational 
Principles: 
 
1. Use a screening 
process for each 
proposed project, as 
early as possible, to 
determine the 
appropriate extent and 
type of environmental 
assessment (EA) so that 
appropriate studies are 
undertaken proportional 
to potential risks and to 
direct, and, as relevant, 
indirect, cumulative, 
and associated impacts. 
Use sectoral or regional 
environmental 
assessment when 
appropriate.
 
A
screening process is in 
place and consists of three 
categories: (a) projects that 
require the preparation of a 
full EIA, either mandatory or 
after screening by the 
competent authorities 
(Category A); (b) projects 
that are subject to an 
“unique 
agreement” and require only a 
summary description of the 
project, its impacts and 
appropriate mitigation 
measures (Category B); (c) 
projects that do not require an 
EA (Category C). 
 
Competent environmental 
authorities review all category 
A
and B projects for their 
potential impacts and 
determine the scope of the 
EIA, or a limited 
environmental analysis  
 
On Category A
GD 918/2002, Art 3(4) 
EIA is achieved in 3 stages as follows: 
(i) the environment impact assessment 
screening stage; (ii) the environmental 
impact assessment scoping stage and 
(iii) the review of the environmental 
impact statement stage. 
 
Art 6(2): EIA is mandatory for 
projects of Annex 1 of GD 918/2002. 
Art 6(3), (4), (5): screening is 
mandatory for projects of Annex 2, 
using criteria of annex 3, to determine 
need for full EIA.  
 
Art 8: Competent authority provides 
guidance to developer on type and 
extent of issues to be addressed in 
impact study. Minimum information 
to be provided by the project 
developer at the screening stage is 
listed in Annex 4 of the same GD 
918/2002, and includes direct, 
indirect, secondary, cumulative, 
positive and negative impacts.  
 
Details of the screening and scoping 
procedures are given in MO 860/2002 
and MO 863/2002, which include 
checklists for both the screening and

In the case of infrastructure 
projects in areas with 
located archaeology, 
project proponents are 
obliged to finance any 
modifications to the project 
necessary to protect 
archaeological discoveries. 
In some cases, if there are 
structures with great 
historic, cultural or

cannot be moved (such as 
churches, temples, 
monumental tombs, 
fortified settlements), the 
archaeological team can 
recommend the

Summary Minutes of December 12, 2005 Public Consultation 
169. 
A half-day public discussion on the proposal to pilot the use of Romanian systems to address 
environmental and social safeguard issues in two proposed World Bank supported projects (under Bank 
Operational Policy 4.00), was organized by the Romanian Ministry of Environment and Water 
Management (MEWM) and the World Bank (WB) on December 12, 2005. The meeting attracted about 
35 specialists including municipal government representatives, environmental authorities (MEWM, 
National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), regional and local EPAs), the local design institutes 
for roads and railways, as well as NGO groups, private sector consultants, and other members interested 
in the subject. The meeting was held in Bucharest at the council hall of the MEWM headquarter. The 
invitation, the proposed agenda and the list of participants are attached.  
Background 
170. 
The meeting was an important step in consultation with stakeholders as required by the World 
Bank OP/BP for piloting country systems. The informative and informal meeting discussed the primary 
conclusions of the noted draft report for which an Executive Summary had been sent to the attendees in 
advance and posted on the MEWM web site. The full draft report (comprising the detailed technical and 
policy analyses which supported the conclusions of the Executive Summary) were then under review by a 
Working Group organized by the MEWM to ensure factual representation and the Government view on 
the proposed study. Their comments will be incorporated and a revised draft will be available for public 
review in early January 2006. This disclosure date will be in advance of formal World Bank project 
appraisal, thereby meeting the World Bank
’s policy on this point.  
Introduction/Opening Section 
171. 
Opening remarks for the MEWM were given by Mr. Attila Korodi, Secretary of State for EU 
Integration; touching on the overall goals of two WB proposed project investments for piloting, the 
situation of the country’s needs in the water and transport sector (expansion and rehabilitation of 
sewerage networks, railway and secondary roads rehabilitation), and the proposed funds to cover these 
needs. It was underlined the necessity of increasing the country’s capacity on implementing systems 
related to the assessment of the impact on environment, physical cultural resources and safety of dams. 
The role of the National Environmental Guard (GNM) as an independent agency within the MEWM, with 
the respect to project compliance was also highlighted.  
172. 
Opening Remarks for the World Bank were presented by Mr. Ron Hoffer, ECA Regional 
Safeguard Coordinator, who recognized the tremendous amount of work that is underway in Romania on 
all fronts to transpose and adopt EU systems. It was underlined that Romania is making great strides in 
strengthening environmental and social protection to meet the requirements of both the EU environmental 
acquis, as well as the interest of citizens and business. He emphasized that the discussed pilot program 
will not lead to a lowering of standards or the WB’s supervision of project implementation, but allows 
Romania to substitute the Bank’s process on some areas of environmental and social safeguards to 
achieve comparable positive end points. It was underlined that international best practices will continue to 
be followed but in a way that supports the good direction that Romania is going. Furthermore, the agenda 
was presented and the main presentations were announced while the public was invited to listen and 
comment on any discussed aspects. The introduction section closed with an invitation to the members of 
the public to introduce themselves.

Background Presentation on the Use of New World Bank Policy on Country Systems 
173. 
Presentations on (i) background on Bank
’s policy piloting the use of Romanian System to address 
Safeguards and (ii) comparison of systems, approach to equivalence and to assess adequacy were made by 
Mr. Ron Hoffer before the participants articulated their own perspectives. The principal observations 
related to the potential safeguards policies triggered by the two proposed pilot projects - Environmental 
Assessment, Involuntary Resettlement, Cultural Property and Safety of Dams – were presented and 
conclusions related to the overall study goal were listed. 
Overview of Romanian EA systems  
174. 
Ms. Angela Filipas, Director of the EIA Division in the MEWM, highlighted the new key 
developments in the Romanian legislation, almost entirely transposed to the EU, related to the application 
of the EIA in the country.  
Progress on EU Accession 
175. 
Mr. Attila Korodi briefed on the progress of the country to the EU accession, highlighting in 
particular the legislation update related to the solid waste management and IPPC.  
Overview of World Bank Romania Municipal Services Project 
176. 
The consulting firm (Romair Ltd.) that developed the feasibility studies for the proposed 
investments under the Municipal Services Project briefly presented the main objective of the project, the 
envisaged investments and affiliated costs as well as the benefits achieved by the affected population.  
Questions and Answers Section 
177. 
Following the presentations, Mr. Hoffer invited questions and comments from members of the 
public. The following issues were raised: 
ƒ
A
representative of the REPA asked where the storm waters are envisaged to be discharged. The 
reply included explanation based on the feasibility study findings. 
ƒ
A
representative of the MEWM (Biodiversity Conservation Department) asked for explanation on 
the two types of natural habitats defined by the World Bank in the new operational policy OP/BP 
4.00-Table A1. A follow-up question requested information on the classification of those sites 
that are not included in the Natura 2000 network. Information on these points was provided by 
the World Bank. 
ƒ
A
question was raised on the status of highway bypasses with World Bank financing in the Targu 
Mures area. It was clarified that these are supported by a different World Bank project and 
progress on technical and safeguards aspects was satisfactory. 
ƒ
A
comment was made on the new approval of Romanian Order 60 (GD 918) related to shorten 
the period of certain documents during the approval of the EA process. It was confirmed that 
these are not related to the public consultation schedule but rather to the timing allowed to read 
and send comments on the main documentation. It was also underlined that according to the 
Romanian law each environmental project and its impact will be evaluated differently based on 
the site characteristics.
