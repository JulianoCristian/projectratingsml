Amendment to the Loan Agreement                                                   
Dear Mr. Belka:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Emergency Flood Recovery Project) dated December 23, 1997, 
between the Republic of Poland (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank), as amended.  We also refer to the letter from the Ministry of Finance, dated 
October 4, 2001 requesting that incremental operating costs for the Project be financed retroactively from 
date of loan signing.
I
am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to said request and accordingly the Loan 
Agreement is amended as follows:
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended per Annex to this 
letter.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by countersigning, dating and 
returning to us the enclosed copy of this letter. This amendment will become effective as of the date of 
countersignature upon receipt by the Bank of the countersigned copy of this letter.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
 AND DEVELOPMENT
