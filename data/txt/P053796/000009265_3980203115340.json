and\n            rural areas affected by the flood by repairing structures\n            and facilities of economic and social importance, and by\n            restoring lifeline facilities and services for currently\n            displaced people; and b) reducing vulnerability and risk of\n            future floods. The project encompasses three main\n            components. First, the municipal and rural infrastructure\n            component includes technical assistance, design, and\n            investments to restore infrastructure at the municipal and\n            gmina level. Second, the flood management and hazard\n            reduction component includes technical assistance, design,\n            and urgent investments to upgrade hydrotechnical\n            infrastructure; modernize flood management systems, and\n            improve forecasting and planning. Third, the project\n            administration and technical assistance component will\n            establish a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to help\n            implement procurement and disbursement activities associated\n            with the Project."}, "docdt": "1997-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
