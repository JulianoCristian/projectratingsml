Management of large amounts of TA can be\n            burdensome for borrowers, particularly borrowers lacking\n            experience in managing large numbers of consultants. The\n            Bank should offer training for borrowers (perhaps through\n            the EDI) in the Management of TA. This would\n            enhancepossibilities of maximizing the \"transfer of\n            technology\".
