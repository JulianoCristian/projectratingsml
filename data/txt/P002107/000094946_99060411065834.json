{"cdata!": "The overall assessment of the project is\n            rated as satisfactory. The main lessons drawn for the future\n            operations in the road sector include: 1) Nigeria is blessed\n            with numerous experienced highly capable road contractors\n            and engineering consultants. Through the strict application\n            of the Bank's procurement procedures, unqualified firms\n            can be weeded out. 2) Through adequate incentives, including\n            the provision of training, motivated project management\n            units can be created to execute projects. 3) The current\n            set-up for the management and financing of roads in Nigeria\n            is not viable. Any future engagement of the Bank in the road\n            sector in Nigeria should only be considered after the\n            successful implementation of the reforms proposed under the\n            Road Vision 2000 Initiative. 4) After the enactment of the\n            National Roads Board Fund Decree, the Bank should assist\n            preparatory activities for the implementation of the reform.\n            Thereafter, an adaptable program lending might be the right\n            tool to carefully reengage the Bank and to expand the\n            Bank's possible involvement based on clearly defined\n            and agreed upon benchmarks. 5) Possible Bank/International\n            Development Association financing could cover initial\n            years' peak demand of a road recovery program,\n            provision of guarantees for private sector road management\n            concessions, and funding for the rehabilitation of the badly\n            deteriorated rural road network."}, "docdt": "1999-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
