The project will be a first phase of a\n            national state roads program that could eventually cover\n            most Nigerian states.  It will be executed in two states,\n            Jigawa and Kano, and will include:  (1) road maintenance,\n            rehabilitation and strengthening to reduce the backlog of\n            rehabilitation and strengthening works on priority state\n            roads; (2) road upgrading of selected high priority, high\n            volume unsurfaced roads to appropriate design standards; (3)\n            vehicles and equipment to strengthen institutional capacity\n            to design and supervise the project work; and (4)\n            institutional development to establish appropriate\n            arrangements within the SMOWTs for planning, design,\n            construction and maintenance, including the replacement of\n            force account operations by private contracting for carrying\n            out road maintenance and rehabilitation."}, "docdt": "1992-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
