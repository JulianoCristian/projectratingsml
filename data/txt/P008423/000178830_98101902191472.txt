INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO GREECE
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Greece for the equivalent of US$23.5 million to help finance a
second education project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, includ-
ing 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Greece" (EMA-49a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 22,
1972.  Country data are presented in Annex II.
3.        During the 1960's, the Greek economy has enjoyed a period of
rapid economic growth which is still continuing. Growth since 1968 has been
characterized by above average and steady increases in manufacturing, with
engineering, metallurgy, chemicals, and shipbuilding being the most dynamic.
In these sectors, new capacity has been created, partly through the inflow
of foreign capital and knowhow, and large-size plants have come into produc-
tion for both domestic and export markets. The size of the merchant shipping
fleet has increased substantially and shipping has become a major source of
foreign exchange earnings. Agriculture has tended to lag behind other sec-
tors. The main stimulus to growth has been a buoyant domestic demand, stem-
ming from large increases since 1968 in private fixed investment, especially
housing, and in public investment, mainly infrastructure. Private consump-
tion has risen annually by around 6 percent in the period 1968-1970, remain-
ing below the rate of growth of total domestic demand. Rapid economic growth
has also been associated with relative stability of prices. During 1968-1971,
consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 3 percent, while wages per employee
in industry rose by 7.5 percent and unit labor costs have risen at an annual
rate of about 2.0 percent between 1968-1971.
4.        In recent years Greece has made substantial progress in industrial-
ization. Nevertheless, agriculture still accounts for 20 percent of GDP,
about 45 percent of employment and 50 percent of exports. A basic objective
of the Government is progressively to industrialize the country whilst simul-
taneously making agriculture more productive and efficient. The key problems
in this respect are structural. In agriculture, production is characterized
by low productivity; farms are small and fragmented, thus making mechaniza-
tion difficult and costly; progress is also hindered by organizational and
financial constraints and particularly by lack of training and extension
services. With the exception of a limited number of large-scale enterprises,
Greek industry is small-scale and predominantly oriented to the domestic mar-
ket. Major impediments to industrial modernization are lack of capital, in-
herent conservntism of many businessmen and their reluctance to relinquish
full control over their enterprises. Good management and skilled labor are



-2-
in short supply and underdeveloped infrastructure hinders regional decentral-
ization. Moreover, marked disparities remain between economic sectors and
geographical regions; the modern sector is mainly limited to industry and
certain service trades and is largely concentrated in the Athens and Salonika
areas.
5.        Greece's rapid growth have been accompanied by increasing imports
which, during the period 1968-1971, rose at an annual rate of about 12 per-
cent, while exports expanded by an average of only 7 percent. With exports
traditionally covering only about one third of imports, the trade deficit
rose from $783 million in 1968 to $1.3 billion in 1971; a further increase
to about $1.5 billion is forecast for 1972. However, the deterioration of
the trade balance was offset in 1971 by a spectacular increase of 44 percent
in net receipts from invisibles. Emigrants' remittances ($458'million in
1971) benefited from the increased number of Greek workers abroad (net emi-
gration has been 40-50,000 per year since 1969), foreign exchange7income from
shipping rose substantially despite a weak freight market and the vigorous
recovery of tourism initiated in 1969 continued. As a result, the current
account deficit decreased from $415 million in 1970 to $377 million in 1971.
This trend is expected to continue in 1972. The reduction in current account
deficit and increased net capital inflows-brought'about a rise in gross for-
eign exchange reserves of $215 million to a total of $525 million at the end
of 1971, equivalent to about three months of imports.
6.        Greece's geographical location', its association with the EEC and
the level of development already achieved enhance the possibilities. of
maintaining a rate of economic growth in the order of 6-7 percent a year
during the next few years. The Government counts on integration with the
EEC to force the pace of organizational and technological modernization.
Under the terms of the Association Agreement of 1961, tariffs-on2. industrial
imports from the EEC will b-e eliminated through 1974, except for a number
of industrial goods produced locally, for which the transitional period ex-
tends through 1984. Access for agricultural products has been liberalized,
but special arrangements remain in force for a number of key items in this
sector.
7.        The availability of labor at a cost which is still low by
European standards remains an important asset, but a general surplus of
labor co-exists with acute shortages of skilled manpower in particular
sectors of the economy. Emigration is largely prompted by the fact that
the supply of unskilled workers inTthe non-agricultural sector exceeds
demand. Workers returning from abroad have acquired a familiarity with
certain kinds of semi-skilled industrial work, but rarely possess specialized
skills. Consequently, labor-supply in the most rapidly growing sectors--
industry and services--will remain tigh't unless training or retraining ar-
rangements are made.
8.        The institutional reforms- needed to sustain growth and,modernize
the economy which were initiated or envisaged under the current 1968-1972
development plan will be pursued under the 1973-1977 plan which is now being
prepared. The main objective, rapid growth based mainly on private initiative,



- 3 -
will prevail, but the Government will place greater emphasis on self-sufficiency
in agriculture. Direct intervention will remain limited, and the Government's
role will continue to center on supplying necessary economic and social infra-
structure.
9.        Given the structure of the economy, the balance of payments may
increasingly become a constraint on growth in the medium term. The de-
cision of the Government in 1971 to leave the dollar-drachma rate unchanged
has improved the prospects for commodity exports, particularly in the EEC
market, but imports of investment and intermediate goods needed to expand
capacity and improve competitiveness will continue to rise rapidly. To
utilize the high growth potential of the economy and at the same time reduce
the balance of payments constraints requires a high level of domestic savings
and, as noted above, an improvement in the structure of the economy. However,
the efficiency of public administration needs improvement to effectively sup-
port the implementation of desired structural changes.
10.       Greece's external deficit reflects her continuing dependence on
foreign capital. National savings increased in proportion to GNP from about
17 percent through 1967 to about 22 percent in 1971, but the resource gap,
excluding transfer receipts from abroad, still exceeded 30 percent of gross
capital formation and 8 percent of GDP. Since 1967, Greece has had limited
capacity to raise long-term capital abroad and access to concessionary funds
has been reduced. For example, the financial protocol on which the European
Investment Bank's lending was based expired in 1967 and was not renewed.
Consequently, Greece had to resort to substantial short and medium-term
borrowing and suppliers' credits. Taking into account additional public
sector borrowing, the debt service ratio will increase from the present 5
percent to between 11 and 15 percent over the next 5 to 6 years, and short-
term borrowing should be limited. Considering, however, the favorable pros-
pects for future economic growth, Greece continues to be creditworthy for
Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
11.       Bank lending to Greece started in 1968 after the country's
pre-war debt had been substantially settled. The proposed loan would be
the Bank's sixth operation in Greece and the second for education; it would
bring the total of Bank lending to $95.4 million less cancellations. The
amount outstanding and held by the Bank as of July 31, 1972 was $89.4 mil-
lion, including amounts not yet disbursed. Besides the first education
loan of $13.8 million, which was signed in November 1970, past Bank lending
to Greece consists of three loans totalling $57.5 million to a development
finance company (NIBID) for financing of industrial expansion and moderniza-
tion, and one groundwater development loan of $25 million. Except for ini-
tial delays incurred under the first education and the groundwater develop-
ment projects, implementation has been satisfactory. Annex I contains a sum-
mary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of July 31, 1972, and
notes on the execution of on-going projects.



- 4 -
12.       IFC has made investments totalling about $15.5 million in five
Greek enterprises.  An equity investment in NIBID of $720,000 was made in
1965; an equity and loan investment of $600,000 in a fertilizer company in
1962 (sold in 1970); $5 million in two cement companies in 1965 and 1966;
and altogether $9.1 million in an aluminium company in 1970 and 1972.
13.       Although Greece's economy has reached a relatively advanced stage
of development, important sectoral and regional disparities r'emain.  Further-
more the economy, and particularly the industrial sector, is ill-prepared for
increasing competition from the EEC as tariffs and other protective barriers
are gradually reduced.  The Bank intends to contribute only a limited part
of the capital inflows required, bit it can asbiist the Government in making
reforms in important sectors with a''view to promoti'ng structural modernization
and reducing regional disparities.
14.       A surface irri'ga't'ion project is due for appraisal in the last
quarter of 1972 and for pr"esentation to the Executive Directors before the
end of the current fiscal ye'ar.  A third irrigatioh projeXct is being pre-
pared under the groundwater developimient project, signed'in June 1971.  The
Bank is acting as executing agency for a UNDP financed highway reconnaissance
survey, expected to lead in due ti 'e to a road construction project.  No IFC
investments are presently in an adva:nced'stage 'of preparation.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
15.       The  Ministry of National Education an'd Religion is 'responsible
for education at all levels except for a number df vo'cational tZr-aining
schemes administered by the Ministries of AgricuLture, Social' WeIfare
(Health), Labor and the Merchant Marine, and th'e National Tourism Organi-
zation.  The function of cbmprehensive education and manpower'pl-'anning
has recently become the res'ponsibility of the Ministry of Planniig and
Governmental Policy, which is also 'expect'ed to coordihate the Vt-rining pro-
grams of the various minis'tries.
16.       Basically, the education system consists of a 'three-'tiered
structure comprising: (i) 6 prim'atry grades of compulso'ry educa'tion, (ii)
6 secondary grades, divided into a first and second cycle of three grades
each, and (iii) 1-6 years of post-sOecondary or higher educatidn.  In com-
parison to other developing countries, it is quantftatively`well developed
and has a number of favorable features on which to base future-development
and reform.  Enrollment rat'ios are high (univ6r'sal primary'education, 59
percent of the relevant'age,group in secondary education, and .11 percent in
higher education); promotion and retention rates'''are sat'isfadt6ky and, in
terms of formal academic qualifications, the teaching force is well qualified.
Nevertheless, the system suffers from'quantitative and struc'tural weaknesses.
A manpower study undertaken in 1970 by'OECD concluded that'the present system
cannot meet the annually required numbers of trained personnel.   Furthermore,
imbalances within the system have res'ult'ed in a surplus in s9ome-fields, e.g.
law and political sciences,'while shortfalls in other areas,su'ch as en-
gineering and science, persist.



- 5 -
17.       Greece has presently no well defined educational development
strategy. However, rapid economic expansion and the concomitant demands
placed on the education system to satisfy the equally rapid changes in
manpower requirements have created an awareness that the system has to be.
made more relevant and responsive to labor market requirements. This aware-
ness is especially prevalent among the ministries and agencies responsible
for training in the crucially important sectors of agriculture, industry,
merchant marine and tourism, and they have prepared detailed plans for the
expansion and up-grading of the specialized training institutions under their
jurisdiction.
18.       The main structural weakness of the education system is at the sec-
ondary level. The lower level vocational section recruits pupils directly
from the primary schools, with the result that 12-year old children are heavily
involved in narrow vocational training before they have the maturity or the
general education to enable them to choose a career. The climate for intro-
duction of a more comprehensive secondary school system has improved consid-
erably, and discussions on this subject are continuing both between the Bank
and the Government and within the Government. The Ministry of Education is
considering implementation of the following reforms in the 1970s:
(a)  introduction of 9 years of compulsory general education,
thus phasing out the technical lower secondary schools;
(b) controlled expansion of the second cycle secondary school
of all types coupled with improved testing, selection and
guidance services; 
(c) channelling of a greater proportion of students into
directly productive courses at the secondary and higher
education levels.
19.       Meanwhile, the Ministry's immediate objectives are: (a) to upgrade
the quality of instruction in the primary schools through a reform and con-
solidation of the primary teacher training system, and (b) to bring about
change in the universities to increase the supply of degree engineers and
scientists. The proposed project would assist in the financing of these
programs.
20.       The improvement of primary teacher training is to be achieved
throughi the consoliclation of existing pedagogical academies into a smaller
number of better equipped institutions, and a curriculum reform which will
emphasize modern education principles and more effective use of educational
technology.
21.       The long-needed reform of the universities is more complex. The
traditional "professorial" system and the practice of electing rectors at
short intervals have stifled attempts at innovatlon and long-term planning,
and have obstructed the major administrative, organizational and institu-
tional changes. Management practices, staff selection and promotion proce-
dures need to be revised as well as the structure and content of programs



and courses. Furthermore, there is an acute need for channelliug more
students away from law and political sciences (which presently account
for 32 percent of university enrollments) into scientific and technologi-
cal studies to redress the present imbalances of the output of the univer-
sities.
22.       Post-secondary vocational training has expanded slowly and
represents at present only 16 percent of the -total post-secondary school
enrollment.  The first education project (Loan 711-GR) helped introduce the
concept of the multi-disciplinary, post-secondary training institution.
The five institutions financed under this project, scheduled to open in late
1974, will train students for sub-professional employment in engineering,
agriculture, food processing, business administration and health in accord-
ance with regional needs.
23.       Total expenditures on education in Greece are estimated at.about
3.4 percent of GNP. The Ministry of Education accounted for 64 percent of
total expenditures, other.government agencies.for.another-4.-percent, and
the remaining 32 percent was from private sources. Educational expendi-
tures are low in relation to other countries in -a comparable.stage of devel-
opment. This suggests that money.could be found for a more rapid introduc-
tion of reforms and improved teaching methods in-the public.schools.
PART IV -- THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "rAppraisal of a'Second'Education Project - Greece"
(PE-48a) dated August 22, 1972, is being distributed separately. A,Loan and
Project Summary is attached-as Annex III. A.-map showing the,location of the
project institutions is also -attached.
25.       The proposed project was -identified in May 1971 .by .a joint Bank/
UNESCO/FAO mission and was substantially prepared by Government task forces.
It was appraised in September/October 1971. Negotiations were;held in
Washington in July 1972. 'The Greek delegation-was.headed.by'Mr.'Papadakis,
Director of Public Investments.and Physical Planning, Minis.try of Planning
and Governmental Policy.
26.       The proposed-project would assist-the.Government.in.its efforts
to: (a) improve the quality of education across a-broad spectrum of levels
and types of institutions, (b) start to modernize the university.system by
developing the Universi-ty of Patras along lines new to Greek universities,
and (c) increase the supply of better trained degree engineers-.and scientists
and other specialized:manpower. -A'feature common to all.prodJect.elements -is
the combination of, on the one hand, expansion:of capacities .and, on the other
hand, introduction of-improved, more -flexible--and more-relevant.-training in
fields essential to the.maintenance of economic growth.
27.       tore specifically the proposed project,.details of- which are given
in Annex III, would include:



-7-
(a) design, construction, furnishing and equipment for:
- five primary teacher training pedagogical academies
- the Schools of Engineering and Natural Sciences at the
the University of Patras
- eight new centers, three new mobile units and equipment
only for ten centers, all for accelerated industrial
vocational training                      I
- three new agricultural vocational schools and the ex-
pansion of an existing one
- twelve new farmer training centers
- five new hotel schools
- four merchant marine schools (equipment only)
(b) technical assistance of: (i) 14 man-years of specialists,
primarily for the establishment of new engineering pro-
grams at the University of Patras, and (ii) 43 man-years
of fellowships for the training of key personnel from the
project institutions.
28.       The total estimated cost is $43.9 million (net of duties and taxes),
with an estimated foreign exchange component of $23.5 million which would be
financed by the proposed loan. If more orders than expected fall to Greek
suppliers the foreign exchange component would be lower, and part of the
loan would in effect finance local expenditure. Academic and communal build-
ings would account for 35 percent of project costs, boarding accommodations
7 percent, staff housing 1 percent, equipment and furniture 45 percent, tech-
nical assistance 2 percent, professional services 4 percent and site develop-
ment 6 percent.
29.       The five pedagogical academies for primary teacher training are
part of the program to consolidate the existing 15 inadequate academies
into eight larger and better equipped institutions. The combined output of
the project academies would represent about 60 percent of total annual re-
quirements for primary school teachers. The existing legislation governing
the curriculum and operations of the pedagogical academies is rigid. As the
curriculum revision should be a continuous process and the management prac-
tices of the academies may also need revision from time to time, the relevant
legislation will be modified within six months after signing of the proposed
loan so as to permit changes in curriculum and management practices as and
when required without the necessity of enacting new legislation each time.
30.       A major project item is the construction, equipment and technical
assistance required for the first development phase of the University of
Patras. At present the university comprises the School of Natural Sciences



-8-
with an enrollment of 1,290 students and the School of Engineering with an
enrollment of 220 in electrical engineering only. Both schools are located
in inadequate temporary quarters. The project would relocate the university
at a new site in Patras and expand the Schools of Natural Sciences and
Engineering to a combined total of 4,300 student places for undergraduates
and 450 for graduates.
31.       The University of Patras, founded in 1964 and unfettered by
tradition, provides an opportunity for innovation in an otherwise overly
conservative academic environment. It is staffed by able and progressive-
minded engineering and science educators, and is expected to be the fore-
runner of university reform in Greece through the demonstration effect of
a new law, prescribing for the University of Patras a novel organizational
and administrative structure and flexible administrative procedures. Agree-
ment was reached during negotiations on the main principles to be- embodied
in the reform law. Because some time will be required to pass,this law, its
enactment would be a condition of disbursement for this particular project
item, allowing independent implementation of the other project components.
32.       The Ministry of Labor has developed, with UNDP/ILO assistance,
five accelerated industrial vocational training centers which offer inten-
sive six-month courses in skilled trades. In view of the success of this
scheme, the Ministry of Labor is in the process. of establishing new centers
strategically located to help meet regional needs for skilled industrial
workers. In certain areas lacking a sufficient basis for the establishment
of permanent centers, mobile training units will be provided..
33.       To support this training program, the proposed project would
finance: (a) supplementary equipment for the five existing centers and com-
plete equipment for five centers now in various -stages of construction, (b)
construction and equipment of eight new accelerated- vocational training cen-
ters, and (c) three mobile training units. These facilities, when fully
operational, will have an annual output of about 6,X000 workers.
34.       The Government's main obj-ective in agricultural training is to
increase the productive capacity of farmers with a view to enhancing the
competitiveness of Greek agriculture. To this end, the Ministry of Agri-
culture plans to expand its network of farmer training centers, upgrade and
improve its agricultural schools, expand the extension services and integrate
these three services with each other whenever possible.
35.       Due to the low entry level (grade 7) and an insufficiently prac-
tical course of only nine months, the existing agricultural schools have
had difficulties in achieving their objective of preparing youths for em-
ployment in agriculture. Under a proposed reform, students will be admitted
after completing grade 9 and the program will be lengthened to two years
with intensive practical training in the type of agriculture prevalent in
the school region.  The American Farm School at Salonika has been singularly
successful with a four-year heavily practical agriculture course (grade 7
through 10). Under the project, this school would develop also a three-year
study program. The farmer training centers provide short courses in modern



-9-
farming techniques. Under a new program, they will offer an improved range
and content of courses and would, through their close association with the
extension services, assist in extending the coverage of these services into
regions not reached at present.
36.       The proposed project comprises the construction and equipment of
three new post-primary agricultural schools and twelve new farmer training
centers, as well as expansion of the American Farm School.
37.       The American Farm school is owned by a private American foundation
and the Government will, as a condition of disbursement for-this school, ob-
tain a legal agreement with the foundation to the effect that the facilities
to be provided under the proposed loan will be utilized for the purposes of
the project.
38.       The agricultural schools included in the proposed project would
have an annual enrollment of 490 students and an annual output of 180. The
farmer training centers are expected to reach about 36,000 farmers annually.
39.       Unless immediate action is taken, shortages of hotel workers will
remain a serous bottleneck to the expansion of tourism. The main thrust of
the Government's present plans in this field is to establish five hotel
school insititutions with a combined enrollment of 1,170 students and an
output of about 1,000 hotel workers annually. These schools would offer
one and two-year courses to students having completed grade 8 and be stra-
tegically located to serve the major tourism areas. The proposed project
would assist in financing the construction and equipment of these institu-
tions. Since the schools will operate as hotels providing in-service train-
ing during the tourist season, it was agreed during negotiations that in
this period they will be run along the same commercial principles as those
applying to other government-owned hotels. Furthermore, to minimize drop-out
rates during the tourist season the compensation of trainees placed in such
hotels will be competitive with that offered to trainees by private hotels.
40.       The bulk of the manpower needs of the merchant marine is presently
met by on-ship training. This system requires modification to include formal
pre-service training at an advanced level in order to produce the kind of
marine officers required by a modern merchant fleet. Consequently, the
Government has assigned high priority to the development of institutions
to increase the supply of trained officers and crew. Four such institu-
tions, with a combined enrollment capacity of 4,400 in navigation, engineer-
ing, communications and basic crew training are either under construction or
in an advanced stage of planning. The proposed project would assist in the
financing of the equipment required by these institutions.
41.       Project Administration.   Implementation of the individual project
items will be the responsibility of the technical services units of the
government entities involved. These will be answerable to a Central Pro-
ject Unit, to be established as a condition of effectiveness at the Ministry
of Planning and Governmental Policy. This unit will provide overall manage-
ment, coordinate and advise the participating technical services units and



- 10 -
be responsible for liaison between the Bank and the implementing agencies.
A Coordinating Committee composed of senior officials of the agencies in-
volved will provide the Central Project Unit with broad policy directions
and advice on matters relevant to the Unit's functions.
42.       Technical Assistance and Professional Services.   To assist in its
orderly and effective implementation, 14 man-years of expert services and
43 man-years of fellowships have been included in the proposed project.
MSost of the expert services (7 man-years) are for thie establishment of new
departments and preparation of programs at the Schools of Engineering and
Natural Sciences at the University of Patras. The remainder will assist in
launching the reform of agricultural and industrial vocational training, in
establishing and organizaing the Central Project Unit and advising the
technical services units of agencies involved in project implementation.
The fellowships will be extended for the training abroad during varying
periods of time of key personnel from the project institutions. Except for
a limited number of cases where an implementing agency would have the re-
quisite capability, consultant architects would be employed to assist in
building design, evaluation of civil works tenders, and supervision of con-
struction.
43.       Procurement.   Contracts for civil works,.furniture and equipment
would be awarded in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for internation-
al competitive bidding. It is expected that relatively few foreign firms
would submit bids for civil works (totalling $18.1 million), since Greece
has a competitive construction industry. Similarly, the Greek furniture
industry is well developed and is likely to win a substantial amount of
furniture constracts, the total estimated cost of which is $1.4 million.
Equipment and furniture items will be grouped so far as possible to form
sizable bid packages. Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would
be allowed a margin equal to the existing rate of custom duty generally
applicable to competing imports or 15 percent of c.i.f. prices, whichever
is lower. Under its Association Agreement with the EEC, Greece accords pre-
ferential tariff treatment to suppliers in EEC member countries. However,
in bid evaluation as between foreigni bids customs duties will be disregarded.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Hellenic State,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreement generally conforms to the normal pattern for loans for
education projects.



45.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECT EXECUTION AND DISBURSEMENTS
Loans 665-GR and 791-GR NIBID's portfolio and financial position are sound,
of 1970 and 1972          and its profitability improved sharply in 1971 and
respectively. (National   the first half of 1972.  Approval of loans and equity
Investment Bank for       investments are expected to reach Dr 1,400 million
Industrial Development    ($47 million equivalent) during 1972.  The pace of
(NIBID)                  disbursements under the first loan and commitments
under the second loan has been satisfactory.
Loan 711-GR of 1970       The Project Administration Unit initially was not
(First Education         as effective as required due to (i) delays in com-
Pr6ject)                  pleting support personnel staffing (ii) limita-
tions on its authority. The Unit is now properly
staffed, has been been given the necessary author-
ity, and is operating satisfactorily.
An additional delay of four months resulted from
the need for revision of the preliminary architec-
tural designs. The final designs have been com-
pleted and are being reviewed by the Project Unit.
Bidding documents for civil works are being
prepared with the expectation that bids will be in-
vited in late September, 1972, and that construction
will begin in late December, 1972, about eight
months behind the original schedule.
Due to delays in the selection of specialists, the
technical assistance program is about six months
behind schedule, but is operating satisfactorily
at present.
Loan 754-GR of 1971      This loan finances drilling about 1,600 production
(Groundwater Develop-    wells, equipping them and providing facilities to
ment Project)             irrigate about 40,000 ha in the Thessaly plain.
Despite a delay in preparing suitable tender docu-
ments and awarding contracts, the project is now
under way and progress on implementation is now
generally satisfactory. While expenditures have
been incurred, there has been no request for dis-
bursements against the loan.

at factor cost for 1971, converted into dollars at the current exchange rate and divided by the estimate
of mid-year population. The figure of $1,219 results from the new method of calculation of ON? at market
prices in current U.S. dollars,designed for inter-country comparison. The method of calculation will be
described in the forthcoming issue of the World Bank Atlas.
