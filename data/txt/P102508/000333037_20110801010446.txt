Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
ERSG II was the first in the series of two grants designed to assist the Government of
Burundi (GoB) in implementing the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) of the country in
order to transition from a post-conflict economy with a focus on maintaining peace and
stability to one geared toward designing and implementing policies to accelerate growth
and human development. It will continue supporting the government in: (i) reforming the
public financial management (PFM) system to improve fiscal transparency and
accountability; (ii) reforming the business, legal, and institutional environment to foster
private-sector-led-growth; and (iii) supporting reforms in the coffee sector.

  As a follow-up of ERSG II, ERSG III was focused on the same issues, which included:
(i) improving public finance management; and (ii) promoting private sector development.
As in ERSG II, the PSD component of ERSG III had two main subcomponents: (a)
improving the business environment; and (b) restructuring the export crops sector. In
addition, ERSG III attempted address issues affecting the supply and price of petroleum
products, which are critical to support activities of private enterprises.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Burundi emerged from a thirteen-year civil war after the signing of the comprehensive
peace and reconciliation agreement by 39 political parties in Arusha (Tanzania) in August
2000 which marked a significant turning point. Peace is still in the process of the
consolidation--with intermittent negotiations, deadlocks, and ceasefires between the
elected government and the rebel movement. Hence, the overall political situation
remains fragile at best.

Nonetheless, recent economic developments have created positive prospects for Burundi.
The economy has gradually recovered from the shocks experienced during 1999-2003
such as political turmoil, embargos, deteriorating terms of trade (partly stemming from
being a landlocked country with political conflict adversely affecting trade routes), and
severe drought. Annual real GDP growth is estimated to have risen to 5.1 percent in 2006
from an annual average of 1.8 percent during the decade of economic and political
turbulence. Since January 2004, the government authorities have implemented an
economic reform program supported by the Bank and the IMF.1

In short, within a difficult political, social, and economic environment, the GoB has made
good initial progress in macroeconomic stabilization, implementation of financial and
structural reforms, and restoration of social services. In September 2005, Burundi
reached the HIPC decision point and was granted access to interim debt relief, which will
reduce its debt by over 90 percent in NPV terms, and its scheduled debt service, by some
US$30-40 million annually for the next 30 years. As was expected, the country reached
the HIPC completion point in January 2009.

Notwithstanding these developments, Burundi will continue to require significant
external assistance (including Bank’s concessional assistance) as domestic savings—even
augmented by those resulting from the HIPC initiative—will be far below the level
needed to make substantial progress in accelerating growth, raising living standards,
reducing poverty, and making progress toward meeting the MDGs.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

ERSG II built upon on the Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC, 2000), the
Economic Recovery Credit (ERC, 2002), and especially the ERSG (2006), and

1
 In September 2006, the government approved its first full PRSP which was presented to IDA and the IMF
Boards in March 2007. The government program, set out in the PRSP, intends to redirect the economy
away from a post-conflict focus toward economic growth and development. The PRSP aims to strengthen
political stability, consolidate peace, and reduce poverty through accelerated, sustainable, and equitable
growth. The principal axes of the PRSP are: (a) improving governance and security; (b) promoting
sustainable and equitable economic growth; (c) developing human capital; and combating HIV/AIDS.


                                                    1
accompanying technical assistance with these operations. Notably, ERSG II incorporated
lessons from the ERSG I (a stand-alone grant) which had slightly ambitious objectives in
supporting the government in implementing the interim PRSP in three areas: (a)
improving public expenditure management (PEM) and the impact on the poor; (b)
reviving agriculture export crop sectors (coffee, tea, and cotton); and reviving the private
sector by improving business climate, accelerating State divestiture, and settling the
government domestic arrears to the private sector.

ERSG II had less-varied PDOs of supporting the GoB to continue: (a) reforms in the
PFM system to improve accountability and transparency in public spending; (b) reforms
in the business, legal, and institutional environment to foster the private-sector-led-
growth; and (c) reforms in the coffee sub-sector. It proposed to: (a) consolidate reforms
already underway (in PFM as indicated in the completed joint PEMFAR); and (b) re-
energize the reform process in private sector development (the legal and regulatory
framework for the general business environment and the coffee sub-sector). Further, it
aimed at continuing diagnostic work and to develop a strategic approach in areas where
action was needed but the existing knowledge was too limited (public enterprise reform).

As a follow-up of ERSG II, ERSG III was focused on the same issues, which included:
(i) improving PFM; and (ii) promoting private sector development. As in ERSG II, the
PSD component of ERSG III had two main subcomponents: (a) improving the business
environment; and (b) restructuring the export crops sector. In addition, ERSG III
attempted to address issues affecting the supply and price of petroleum products, which
are critical to support activities of private enterprises.

Not Applicable.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The ERSG II and ERSG III program structure kept a balance between the need for
essential reforms and the simplicity dictated by weak institutions and national
implementation capacity, with a bias toward deepening the reform process in areas
already supported by the earlier ERSG.

Overall, this programmatic series (ERSG II and III) continued to support the
establishment of new legal and institutional frameworks to implement essential reforms.
It was also designed to help the GoB in securing sustained financial resources through:
(a) economic growth; (b) external financial assistance; and (c) debt relief.

Specific policy areas emphasized by the program consist of:

   (i)    More accountable and transparent budget management process through: (a)
          budget preparation and alignment with PRSP; (b) budget execution; and (c)
          budget accounting and control.
   (ii)   Improved business, legal, and institutional environment for growth.
                                             2

interviews with GoB authorities or principal stakeholders in the country].

2.1 Program Performance

The details of achievements to date are enumerated in the Results Framework Analysis,
which compares the performance against benchmarks and targets (Section F of the ICR).
Additionally, the current status of the prior and subsequent actions taken under the series
is listed in the subsequent section below.

To reiterate, ERSG II focused on three principal areas, all of which envisaged to be
implemented in a high-risk environment (mainly: political fragility and weak institutional
capacity).

   (i)    More Accountable and Transparent Budget Management Process: (a) budget
          preparation and alignment with PRSP; (b) budget execution; and (c) budget
          accounting and control.

Significant progress has been made in the enactment in 2009 of the Organic Law
organizing public finance (Budget Framework Law). Its implementation, initially
gradual, is now picking up pace. Importantly, several off-budget items have been closed,
and cash management has been streamlined. Under the ERSG III, the GoB plans to
introduce program budgeting in selective ministries by 2014. In the context of
transparency, the national accounts are available on a government website:
www.ISTEEBU.BI. Unfortunately, there seems to be a technical glitch, which has
affected the normal functioning of the website of the National Statistical Institute
(ISTEEBU) in recent days.
As for the PFM strategy, its implementation is also on track with the coordination of the
Council of Ministers. A core strategy has been developed with donor assistance.
Institutional arrangements are in place under the direction of the Technical Committee
Support Unit.

   (ii)    Improved Business, Legal, and Institutional Environment for Growth.


                                               3
This is perhaps a weak area of implementation, whereby more concerted actions would
be required in the subsequent budget support operations. To date, there are not enough
mechanisms and for consultations between the government and the private sector.

   (iii)   Renewed Impetus in Coffee Sector Reforms.

It is premature to determine how the contemplated divestiture options have materialized
in reforming this export crop sector.

Subsequently, ERSG III--amongst its other objectives--attempted to address issues
affecting the supply and price of petroleum products, which are critical to support
activities of private enterprises.

   (a) Establishing a transparent PFM. Notwithstanding substantial improvements,
       additional efforts are needed to improve the strategic content of the budget
       planning process.

   (b) Improving business environment. The main challenge to the development of the
       formal sector and privatization of public enterprises is institutional constraints.
       Notably, these are: the small size of the domestic market, the landlocked position
       of the country, an uninviting business climate, and the absence of an effective
       dialogue between the government and the private sector.

   (c) Restructuring the coffee sector. The process is in nascent stages, beginning with a
       Presidential decree for establishing a regulatory authority.

   (d) Reforming the domestic downstream petroleum sector. The government has
       established a quasi-automatic mechanism for adjusting local prices to changes in
       the international market.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

From the outset, the ERSG grant series were understandably considered as high risk
operations (because of the factors mentioned earlier). Most of these implementation risks
were however mitigated by the availability of accompanying technical assistance (TA)
and capacity building efforts through the EMSP and in partnership with the IFC PEP-
AFRICA program.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design, implementation, and utilization relied exclusively on government
arrangements and country systems. However, in the Burundi setting, no major efforts
were made to strengthen the capacity of the weak institutions—especially for the focus
on results, beyond focusing on fiduciary (Financial management and Procurement)
safeguards.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

ERSG IV was approved by the Board in December 2010. As the first in a new series of
two DPOs, ERSG IV will aim to consolidate many of the reforms that begun in the
ERSG II and ERSG III series. This follow-on operation will be focused on: (a)
improving budget credibility, planning, and controls; and (b) strengthening the business
environment and performance of the traditional export crop sectors. The PFM
component of ERSG IV has three main sub-components: (a) strengthening strategic and
budget planning to improve the quality of public spending; (b) reinforcing PFM systems;
and (c) improving the management of the public wage bill. The PSD component of
ERSG IV also has three main sub-components: (a) promoting private investment
development through improvements in the legislative framework and economic
infrastructure; (b) facilitating the restructuring or privatization of public enterprises; and
(c) modernizing export sectors. In addition, ERSG IV will lay the groundwork for
reforms in future budget support operations in the energy sector—the success of which is
critical to support private-sector-led-growth.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The programmatic series was timely and highly relevant to the country conditions. It was
fully consistent with the CAS and the PRSP.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The PDOs emphasized mainly outputs and activities—rather than outcomes. Hence,
these interventions achieved their intended purposes of creating building blocks for future
development operations.



                                              8
3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings:

ERSG II: Moderately Satisfactory.
ERSG III: Satisfactory.

The first operation provided the building block for the subsequent operation(s). However,
a major pre-requisite for programmatic DPLs (the formulation of a concrete and clear
long-term vision (even an evolving MTEF) was not in place, and which was delayed until
the initiation of ERSG III). Further, ERSG III was much more focused on key issues and
removing the concomitant impediments toward their resolution.

The achievements to date are reiterated below:

First, important progress was realized toward the deployment and institutionalization of
the central and sectoral MTEFs, through the development of the central tools, and
engagement at the highest levels (second Vice President of Burundi) to ensure that the
tools become later standardized amongst the agencies and institutionalized in the budget
preparation process. A model of central MTEF developed with a Bank technical
assistance in December 2009 was only developed in May 2010 when the Directorate
General of Budget significantly improved its initially limited involvement in the
deployment of this tool. Nevertheless, this central MTEF is not yet used to define the
overall budget envelope and to allow for inter-sectoral budgetary choices consistent with
national priorities.

Second, the authorities have made efforts toward the application of the new Procurement
Code, particularly through the creation of the new agency to regulate procurement
(Agence de Regulation des Marchés Publics, ARMP), along with the provision of budget
and the recruitment of main members of the staff. Visits by the team to the ARMP and
the Direction Nationale des Marchés Publics (DNMP) indicate that these units are
functioning, however significant capacity constraints remain.

Third, the new Investment Code was promulgated, and several actions were undertaken
to apply the code, including the establishment of the new Investment Promotion Agency
(API). Later missions conducted for the follow-on operation (ERSG IV) indicated that
the Agency had become operational in April-May, with the naming of key staff and the
establishment of an office of the Agency.

Finally in the coffee sector, 13 of the country’s 117 coffee washing stations were sold to
an international company (WEBCOR) after competitive bidding. There were other
interested parties, but their applications were rejected after the price proposed fell below
the authorities’ reservation price (which was not published). The authorities are
considering putting this reservation price in the bidding documents in the future, but a
definite position on this issue has not yet been taken. It is anticipated that the next round
of bidding would begin in August 2010, after the end of the 2010 coffee campaign. The
first year of operations of WEBCOR appears to have gone well, and the coffee regulatory
                                              9
agency (ARFIC) and the recently established inter-profession entity (INTERCAFE)
appear to be pleased with the investment and capacity building efforts that the firm has
conducted. For the next round of bidding process of washing stations, and to avoid some
of the problems with the implementation of the strategy encountered during the first
round, the authorities have commissioned a study aimed at analyzing the implementation
of the first round of bidding process. Results of this assessment will be reflected in the
second phase of bidding process of washing stations.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The ERSG series have had a significant impact on enhanced resource allocation for
priority social areas. Likewise, business climate reforms are expected to have a long-
term positive growth and poverty implications. But, most of these actions are yet to be
translated into visible improvements in poverty reduction.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Even in more advanced countries, institutional change/strengthening requires a longer gestation.
So, it is quite premature to witness immediate results in the Burundi context.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

None.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings:
Moderate.

With the inception and implementation of the ERSG series (and follow-on operations),
the risks to development outcome have been upgraded from Substantial to Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Ratings:
Satisfactory.



                                              10
The Bank relied considerably on the lessons learned from the previous operations as well
as from the experience other fragile countries. Consequently, and especially with the
ERSG, the PDOs were kept simple and less complex under the overall umbrella of the
PRSP. Further, the Bank developed a strong relationship with other key development
partners—especially the IMF, the Netherlands, and Norway. These co-financiers (i.e.,
the Netherlands and Norway) contributed US$23.4 million to the ERSG II-III series.
Additionally, the resort to accompanying technical assistance and capacity-building
efforts through the IDA’s Economic Management Support Project (EMSP), and
coordination with the IFC PEP-Africa program has been instrumental to program design.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Ratings:
Satisfactory.

Initially, the ISR for ESRG was too optimistic (and less candid) for the achievement of
DO and the Implementation Progress. It should have taken into account the shortcomings
in government capacity and flagged these lacunae to the Bank management for feedback
to the government authorities. The subsequent ISR was more focused on these issues.
Several supervision missions of ERSG III were conducted in the course of FY10-11.

The most recent supervision missions, which also coincided with the preparation of the
new programmatic series (ERSG IV-V) found that the targeted reform measures were
being achieved and that progress continued in the consolidation of these reforms.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings:
Satisfactory.

In light of the factors mentioned earlier, considerable improvements took place in the
Bank’s attention, performance, and supervision with respect to ERSG III compared with
those in the context of ERSG II. The intended reforms will be further targeted and
consolidated in the new programmatic series (ERSG IV-V).

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Ratings:
Moderately Satisfactory.

Though the government’s commitment to policy reforms was evident at the highest levels,
the consensus building amongst the implementing agencies needed enhanced efforts. In
sum, there should have been a greater involvement of sectoral ministries and the key
officials responsible for the implementation of the reform program.


                                            11
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Ratings:
Moderately Satisfactory.

The implementing agencies are still too weak to implement the envisaged reforms, and
would require hands-on training and technical assistance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings:
Satisfactory.

The operations were conducted satisfactorily on the Bank side.

Notwithstanding the limited implementation capacity of the government authorities, the
Bank is making concerted efforts of remedying these shortcomings in the context of the
preparation of the new series ERSG IV and V.

6. Lessons Learned

(a) Operation specific

-   The programmatic series of DPOs in a fragile setting has served as a useful grant
    instrument to progress toward the intended program results. Specifically, the ERSG
    II and III have provided the building blocks for institutional development and
    capacity building for enacting the regulatory framework for private-sector-led-growth
    in Burundi. Still, the program components needed to be embedded in a viable MTEF
    to enable the envisaged PFM (especially budgetary formulation and execution).

-   Unavoidably, the program has focused on activities and outputs—rather than on
    outcomes. The subsequent operations (e.g., ERSG IV and beyond) need to focus on
    results that can be monitored and evaluated. Hence, more emphasis should be placed
    on the “evaluability” of indicators to be tracked; in other words on robust M&E. The
    PETS findings for health and education would be crucial for better understanding
    transparency and accountability-related issues in these sectors.

-   GoB’s commitment to the reform program may be present at the highest echelons.
    But, it is not clear that broad consensus exists at the level of the implementing
    agencies. Accordingly, the design of future operations (ERSGs) should attempt to
    engage the broader audience (including program beneficiaries).

-   For fiduciary safeguards in DPOs, it may be commendable to rely on GoB’s systems
    of procurement and financial management. Nonetheless, the Bank needs to ensure
    that the systems of control and compliance are robust enough (through diagnostic
    CFAAs, CPIPs, and CPARs).


                                           12
(b) Bankwide general application

-   With the Bank’s increasing emphasis on Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC),
    greater attention is needed on: (a) political economy analysis; (b) fraud and abuse of
    government funds; and (c) voice and accountability (the demand side of governance).
    For complying with the expanding agenda, the Task Team would need to take
    cognizance of the recommendations of the Bank’s GAC Council.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies [None received]

Persons Interviewed via video conference:

-   Mr. Bwabo, Head of Reform Unit in the Ministry of Finance.

(b) Cofinanciers

Written comments were received from Ms. Anja Sundby Hem from the Royal Norwegian
Embassy in Kampala on the behalf of the co-financier Norway. These comments essentially
endorsed the findings of the ICR. More important, the co-financier emphasized the importance of
the lessons learned and their incorporation in future development interventions in Burundi.

 “Norway acknowledges the receipt of the ECR for ERSG II-III to which Norway
contributed with NOK 160 million. It is rewarding to learn from the report that a number
of indicators have been achieved, in particular in the PFM field.

Of particular issues we would like to highlight:

- The report says that the ERSG series has had a significant impact on enhanced resource
allocation for priority social areas. We would like to learn more about this. Which social
sectors and sub sectors have benefited the most and how has this affected other (non
social) sectors? Have there been any absorption challenges?

- We notice one of the lesson learned, which recognises that the programme has focused
more on activities and outputs rather than on outcomes. It further states that future
operations will need to focus on the “evaluability” of indicators and ensure a robust M&E
framework. If this implies that there will also be more focus on outcomes that would be
very much welcomed by Norway.

- In the lessons learned chapter it further says that greater attention is needed on political
economy analysis, fraud, etc. Norway would like to stress the importance of including
gender as a cross cutting issue as well. In the next operation we would like to see how the
objectives and planned interventions have taken gender issues into consideration and how
they to the extent possible are gender sensitive.”
