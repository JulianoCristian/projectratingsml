ERSG supported a fragile country with institutional\n            weaknesses and thereby prevented, to some extent, a conflict\n            reversal. In addition, the risks of the operations\n            counter-balanced potential rewards of macroeconomic stabilization."}, "docdt": "2011-04-14T05:14:02Z"}
