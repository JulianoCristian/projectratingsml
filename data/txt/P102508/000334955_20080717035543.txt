                       two grants designed to assist the Government o f Burundi in implementing the
                       country's poverty reduction strategy in order to transition from a post conflict
                       economy with a focus on maintaining peace and stability to one geared towards
                       designing and implementing policies to accelerate growth and human development.
                       The proposed Economic Reform Support Grant I1 (ERSG 11) will continue

                       instability, affecting prospects for economic growth.       Second, weak institutional
                       capacity may slow reform progress. Further delays in implementation o f the
                       structural reforms, including the coffee sector and the public enterprise sector would
                       adversely affect private sector development and growth prospects o f the country.
                       Third, the variability in the performance and the dominant role o f the agricultural
                       sector in economic growth and poverty alleviation can affect the ability o f the
                       authorities to manage the transition from a post-conflict to a development economy.
                       Fourth, Burundii s highly dependent on aid inflows and any difficulty inmaintaining
                       donor support or delays inmobilizing such support can derail fiscal performance and
                       hamper the efforts o f the authorities to manage budgetary and economic stability.
                       The fiscal risks o f public enterprises for the central budget will need to be monitored
                       during the life o f this grant. Fifth, there is a high risk o f debt distress, even after
                       HIPC completion point and MDRI assistance mainly due to the low export base o f
                       the country. Sixth, recent increases in the prices o f food and oil are expected to
                       affect the national budget and the living standard o f the poor in Burundidue to the
                       increased costs o f transportation and imported foods. Seven, as a landlocked country,
                       Burundi faces increased risks associated with its dependence on neighboring
                       countries for its trade routes, which only regional peace-building and economic
                       integration will mitigate.

                                  I. INTRODUCTION

1.      Burundi emerged from a thirteen-year civil war, following the signing of a
comprehensive peace and reconciliation agreement by 39 political parties in Arusha
(Tanzania) in August 2000 which marked a significant political turning point. After the
establishment o f a transitional Government in 2002, a new constitution, intended to
provide appropriate ethnic checks and balances, was approved in February 2005.
Presidential and parliamentary elections were held in August 2005 and the new
Government took office in September o f the same year. In September 2006, a cease-fire
accord was reached with the last hold-out rebel movement, the FNL-PALIPEHUTU
faction. Peace i s still inthe process o f consolidation as the Government i s innegotiations
with FNL-PALIPEHUTU.The political situationremains fragile; inearly 2007 following
the changes in the leadership o f the main political party (CNDD-FDD) a political
deadlock ensued that lasted several months and frozen political activities. In October
2007, the political deadlock was broken with the nomination o f a more representative
Government and the Parliament resumed its legislative role. However, early 2008
witnessed further political infighting, leading to a new political deadlock at the
Parliament. Furthermore, armed skirmishes with the FNL-PALIPEHUTU flared again in
mid-April 2008, ahead o f a new round o f negotiations in May in Bujumbura. The
leadership o f the FNL-PALIPEHUTU returned to the capital in early June 2008 to
finalize the negotiations and a new cease-fire was signed.

2.      Recent economic developments have created positive prospects for Burundi.The
economy has gradually recovered from the shocks experienced during 1993-2003 such as
political turmoil, embargos, deteriorating terms o f trade, and severe drought. Annual real
GDP growth i s estimated to have risen to 5.1 percent in2006 from an annual average o f -
1.8 percent during the decade o f economic and political turbulence. Since January 2004,
the authorities have implemented an economic reform program supported by the World
Bank and the IMF. As a result, within a difficult political, social and economic
environment, the Government has made good initial progress interms o f macroeconomic
stabilization, implementation o f financial and structural reforms, and restoration o f social
services. In September 2005, Burundireached the HIPC decision point and was granted
access to interim debt relief, which will reduce debt over 90 percent in NPV terms, and
scheduled debt service, by some US$30-40 million per year for the next thirty years. The
authorities have made progress in fulfilling the HIPC conditions, and the country i s
expected to reach the HIPC Completion Point in early 2009. But Burundiwill continue
to require significant external support, as domestic savings, even augmented by those
resulting from the HIPC initiative, will be far below the level neededto make substantial
progress in accelerating growth, raising living standards, reducing poverty and making
progress towards the MDGs.

3.      In September 2006, the Government approved its first full Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) which was presentedto IDA and IMF Boards inMarch2007. The
Government program, set out in the PRSP, intends to redirect the economy away from a
post-conflict focus, towards economic growth and development.          The PRSP aims to
strengthen political stability, consolidate peace, and reduce poverty through accelerated,
sustainable, and equitable growth. The principal strategic axes o f the PRSP are: (i)
improving governance and security; (ii)     promoting sustainable and equitable economic
growth; (iii) developing humancapital; and (iv) combating HIV/AIDS.

4.      The proposed Economic Reform Support Grant I1(ERSG11) i s the first ina series
o f two grants designed to assist the Government o f Burundito continue implementingthe
country's poverty reduction strategy in order to transition from a post conflict economic
environment to one that i s focused on economic development driven by private sector
growth. The ERSG series builds on the Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC,
2000), the Economic Rehabilitation Credit (ERC, 2002), and especially the Economic
Reform Support Grant (ERSG, 2006). The 2006 stand alone ERSG aimed at supporting
the Government in implementingthe interim PRSP in three areas: (i)        improving public
expenditure management and the impact on the poor; (ii)    reviving agriculture export crop
sectors (coffee, tea, and cotton) and ensure better revenue distribution sectors among
actors; and (iii)reviving the private sector by improving business climate, accelerating
State divestiture, and settling the Government domestic arrears to the private sector.

5.      The proposed ERSG I1grant will support the Government to continue: (i)     reforms
inthe public finance management system to improve accountability and transparency in
public spending; (ii)  reforms the business legal and institutional environment to foster
private-sector-led growth; and (iii)  reforms in the coffee subsector. It proposes to: (i)
consolidate reforms already underway (inpublic finance management as identifiedinthe
recent joint PEMFAR) and to (ii)reenergize the reform process in private sector
development (the legal and regulatory framework for the general business environment,
and the coffee reform process). In addition it aims at continuing diagnostic works and
support development o f a strategic approach in areas where action i s needed but
knowledge i s too limited (public enterprise reform).

6.      The program structure aims at keeping a balance between the need for essential
reforms and the simplicity dictated by the weak institutions and national implementation
capacity, with a bias towards deepeningthe reform process in areas already supported by
the 2006 ERSG. Overall, the program continues supporting the establishment o f new
legal and institutional frameworks to implement essential reforms. It was also designed
with the view to help the Government in securing sustained financial resources through:
(i) economic growth; (ii) external financial assistance; and (iii) relief.
                                                                debt

7.      The ERSG I1 grant would be disbursed in a single SDR 18.5 million (US$30
million equivalent) tranche, which would be released upon effectiveness in 2008,
providing that macroeconomic performance continues to be satisfactory.           A set of
indicative triggers are suggested for the ERSG 111(FY10). The progress in the overall




                                            2

reform program will be tracked over the life o f the ERSG grant series through these prior
actions, indicative triggers, and other related measures inthe policymatrix.

8.       The ERSG grant series are highrisk operations, necessary to support a politically
fragile and institutionally weak country with a high dependence on budget support to
transition out o f a post-conflict economic environment to one that i s focused on designing
and implementing policies to accelerate growth and human development. The risks are
balanced by the potential rewards o f macroeconomic stabilization through external
funding o f the budget and the support o f core policy reforms. Furthermore, while the
risks are high, the fiduciary section o f this document outlines the measures that will be
taken to mitigate the risks attached to these operations.

9.       The design o f the ERSG series as a two-operation programmatic series i s one
major way o f mitigating the risks associated with these budget support operations while
aligning the tranche releases to the country's budget cycle. The continuity o f the policy
dialogue and reform agenda set out inERSG grant series, together with the accompanying
technical assistance and capacity building from Economic Management Support Project
(EMSP), and in partnership with IFC PEP-AFRICA program, will contribute to
strengtheninstitutional capacity and to support reform that is expected to help the country
transition to an economy focused on development objectives. The alignment o f ERSG
series with the budget cycle should be complete by the effectiveness o f the second grant
(ERSG ID), expected in August 2009. This tranche release will coincide with the new
budget cycle expected to be adopted by the Authorities (July 2009 to June 2010) as part
o f their recent membership inthe East African Community.

10.      Thus, at the conclusion o f the proposed ERSG series, one would expect to see
tangible progress with respect to each component o f the proposed reform program
including: (i)   measurable improvement in public finance management; (ii)       measurable
improvements in the environment for private sector activities; and (iii)     progress in the
execution o f the coffee sector reform program.

                            HISTORICAL POLITICALCONTEXT
                                         AND

11.     Burundi has a history of conflict since its independence in 1962 and the latest
conflict, which started in 1993, exacted a heavy toll on the population, the social fabric
and the economy. 300,000 people have lost their lives and about 1.2 million (16 percent
o f the population) had been internally displaced and became refugees. The war has had a
devastating impact on Burundi's economy compounded by an economic embargo by
neighboring countries, and several episodes o f drought. As a result, GDP per capita fell
by almost 40 percent, from US$180 in 1993 to US$109 in2006.

12.     With the signature o f the Arusha Agreement in August 2000, Burundi emerged
from this latest episode o f political and civil tensions and obtained a new window o f
opportunity for peace and stability. Between 2000 and 2005 the country made a
successful transition to a multi-party system and in August 2005 Pierre Nkurunziza was
chosen as the new President. The peace agreements signed during this period allocated
the new signatories with ministerial and other power positions in the army, the central,
provincial, and district Governments roughly in accordance with the relative political
weight o fthe respective groups.

13.     2007 and early 2008 have been politically difficult for the country, leading to
some deterioration in the security situation, but the second half o f 2008 holds some
promise for improvement. In early 2007, following the removal o f the old leadership o f
the ruling party (CNDD-FDD), the political tensions increased as the Government lost its
parliamentary majority, leading to a political deadlock. The security situation deteriorated
somewhat following the last rebel group's (FNL) withdrawal from the peace negotiations
in July 2007. Nonetheless, an agreement with the major opposition political parties was
reached inNovember 2007, resolving the political deadlock. The Cabinet was reshuffled
to bring in representatives o f the two major opposition parties. The Parliament, whose
activity had been blocked by the political impasse, resumedits activity. 2008 started with
a political crisis related to the dismissal o f the first Vice President due to political discord
within her ownparty leading the parliament to another political deadlock. Also, the FNL-
PALIPEHUTU, which had declared it willingness to restart peace negotiations, broke the
cease-fire in April 2008, leading to repeated armed skirmishes with government troops
and some 100 deaths. Inearly May 2007, FNL-PALIPEHUTU leadership again declared
their willingness to reach a negotiated peace and returned to Burundi to restart peace
negotiations in early June 2008. A new cease-fire has been signed; increasing the hope
that the consolidation o f the peace process will advance during 2008 and permitting
further demobilization andreintegrationo fthe ex-combatants into civilian life.

14.     Despite the recent disturbances, prospects remain positive for the integration o f all
armed factions into new security and defense forces, and demobilization and reintegration
o f former combatants that will not be enlisted in these forces. The national
Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration program (DRR), launched in 2004, has
benefited from the support o f the Bank and Multi-country Demobilization and



                                              4

Reintegration Program for the greater Great Lakes (MDRP). The presence o f the UN
peacekeeping operation (UNOB) played a major role infacilitating the implementation o f
the DRR program and the accompanying security sector reform program'. The peace
process has attracted considerable attention. InJune 2006, the UN's new Peace building
Commission (PBC) decided to create a country-specific group for Burundi, one o f only
two countries benefiting from this status.

15.      The general progress towards the consolidation o f peace notwithstanding, the
underlying economic forces leading to recurrent conflicts will need to be addressed
through economic and legal reforms, as well as economic diversification and growth to
achieve lasting peace and stability. Burundi i s a small country with a high population
density. While the country i s agriculturally rich, there i s strong competition for resources,
especially for land in rural areas where 90 percent o f the population lives. This i s
exacerbated by a growing population and at times ethnic differences. Furthermore, the
peace era i s seeing the return o f large numbers o f internal and external rehgees to land
that has been cultivated by others in their absence. This i s leading to tensions about
resource ownership and use and affects earningpotential o fpast and present users.

                        RECENT ECONOMIC            DEVELOPMENTBURUNDI  IN

16.      Burundi's economic performance improved noticeably between 2001 and 2006
relative to the previous decade. Nevertheless, Burundi faces a number o f significant
challenges, including the need for a more diversified agricultural and economic base and
higher agricultural productivity, as well as investment in human resources in order to
increase economic growth andreduce poverty.

17.      As o f 2006, the structure o f the economy still points to the dominance of
agriculture (48.4 percent o f GDP), followed by services (35.2 percent o f GDP) and
industry (16.4 percent o f GDP). Agriculture remained the dominant sector both interms
o f its contribution to GDP and size o f employment despite a decline in agriculture's
contribution to GDP due to poor productivity, an effect o f weather and periodic civil
strife. Foodproduction and livestock contribute 91 percent of the agriculture production.
On the other hand, agricultural exports, especially coffee, earn more than 70 percent o f
the export revenues. The service sector contribution has steadily increased over the
recent past largely due to a rise inpublic services and to a much lesser extent the transport
and trade sub-sectors. The industrial sector slight increase i s mainly attributable to
constructions.

18.      The consolidation o fthe peaceprocess has helpedstart reconstruction, and created
positive prospects for the country, but the country has not experienced the typical post-
conflict bounce in GDP growth. Since 2000, the country has progressively recovered
from the negative growth (average -1.8%) o f the decade o f political and economic

turbulence to a positive growth rate with 5.1% in 2006 (see table below) Economic
growth i s largely determinedby the widely fluctuating agricultural sector, mainly coffee.
While in2004 real GDP growth reached 4.8 percent, a severe drought in2005 led to 0.9
percent growth, bouncing back to a strong 5.1 percent in 2006.                    A decline in real
economic growth to 3.6 percent i s estimated for 2007, despite increased donor-financed
capital expenditure, reflecting a poor agricultural harvest.

19.       Fiscal performance in 2005-06 was satisfactory, but mixed in 2007. The 2007
Budget Law was to continue to reorient expenditures toward poverty reduction and
demobilization while containing the budget deficit (excluding grants). The 2007 outlook
was affected by a slower than expected demobilization and the payment o fUS$17 million
(1.6 percent o f GDP) made to Interpetrol outside the proper budget procedures. The
breakdown o f the peace talks with the last rebel group (FNL) slowed the demobilization
process, contributing to larger than expected wage bill, which amounted to close to 10.8
percent o f GDP in 20072. The Government took mitigating measures, increasing some
taxes, cutting expenditures and postponing increases in benefits payments to the civil
service to 2008. The budget deficit (excluding grants) i s expected to reach 20.1 percent o f
GDP in2007 (compared to 19.3 percent o f GDP in2006), as a result of a decline intotal
revenue to 18.7 percent o f GDP and an increase o f public spending from 38.2 percent o f
GDP in 2006 to 38.7 percent in 2007. Nonetheless, the overall fiscal position improved


2The wage bill includes pay for the army and the police forces, which are necessary for a post-conflict
country,


                                                   6

from -1.8 percent o f GDP in2006 to 0.8 percent o f GDP in2007 due to a slight increase
inexternal grants.

20.        The Government expenditure pattern highlights a rapid increase, focused on
capital expenditure. Total expenditure rose from 27.2 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 38.2
percent in 2006. This i s considerably higher than many Sub-Saharan African countries.
The increase is largely due to the fact that capital expenditure has doubled from 6.4
percent o f GDP in 2001 to 14.8 percent in 2006 (including special programs for
demobilization and reintegration o f ex-combatants) due to foreign grants. In the
meantime, while recurrent expenditure accounts for 60 percent o f total expenditure, it has
risen only slightly over the last six years. One of its main components has beenthe wage
bill, which rose to nearly 10percent o fGDP in2006, reflecting the hiringofnewteachers
in2005 anda 15percent salary increase in2006, the first since 2001.

21.        Despite continued increases in overall security sector expenditure, the
Government's public expenditure allocation to priority sectors has significantly improved
inthe past few years, reflecting, inpart, the PRSP priorities outlined inthe InterimPRSP
o f November 2003 and the new PRSP o f September 2006. The reduction in the share o f
militaryexpenditure in2001-2006 has been more than offset by the increase inthe police
force. Giventhe post-conflict nature of the country and the need to ensure the security o f
the population, higher security expenditures are to be expected in the medium term.
Nonetheless, the availability o f HIPC funds in 2006 and increased donor support helped
increase the share of economic and social priority sectors from 28.6 percent o f total

 BURUNDIPEMFAR, 2008.


                                                               7

22.      At this stage o f Burundi's transition from a post-conflict environment to one
focused on economic development, aid flow, especially budget support from multilateral
and bilateral donors, has proven vital to the sustainability o f the national budget and the
stability o f the economy. Budgetsupport from international partners covered about halfof
the overall budget deficit o f 19.3 percent o f GDP in2006, and is expected to cover almost
half o f the estimated deficit o f 20.1 percent o f GDP in2007.

23.      Burundi has consistently run large current account deficits, reflecting the
country's narrow range o f exports, which still consist almost entirely o f tea and coffee,
and its dependence on the import of capital goods and fbel. The current account deficit
(including grants) increased from 14.5 percent of GDP in 2006, to an estimated 16.0
percent in2007, reflecting a decrease inexports coupledwith an increase inimports.

24.      Monetary policy has remainedprudent. Inflation (CPI), which topped 13.4 percent
in2005, dropped to 2.8 percent in2006 due to tighter monetary policy. It is projectedto
rise to 8.3 percent in2007. The projected rise ininflation can be attributed to increases in
food and petrol prices. Monetary aggregates have increased ina sustainable manner, with
M3 increasing by 18.3 in 2006 and an estimated 15.8 percent in 2007. Credit to the
economy continued to recover, increasing sharply in 2006 from 25.1 percent to an
estimated 10.4 percent in 2007, driven by bank financing o f the coffee crop and o f
business development.

                     POVERTY OUTLOOK AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

25.      For many years conflict displaced a large portion o f the rural population and
destroyed important economic and social infrastructure. As a result, poverty i s
particularly widespread in rural areas, which account for over 90 percent o f the
population. 63 percent o f the population suffers from food insecurity. Surveys estimate
that poverty incidence stood at 66.9 percent in 2006, a noted drop from 81 percent in
1998 yet far from the 2015 MDGtarget o f 30 percent. Rural poverty is estimated at twice
the rate o f urban areas. Regional differences are particularly acute, with poverty rates
fluctuating from a low o f 28.7 percent in Bujumbura to a high o f 82.3 percent in the
province o f Kirundo. The intensity o f poverty also varies among groups. Households
living in urban areas whose head or spouse has a better education and who benefit from
better employment are less likely to be poor or feel poor.

26.      Available social indicators show progress, but Burundi still ranks 169thout o f 177
countries in the UNDP's Human Development Index in 2006 and the odds o f Burundi
reaching most o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 are slim. Life
expectancy rose from 42.8 years in 2000 to 44.6 years in 2005. Vaccination rates have
improved. The Government has attempted to increase services coverage by announcing in
May 2006 that health services to children under five and women during delivery are free.
However, the lack o f essential medicine and qualified staff i s affecting service delivery
severely. The spread o f HN/AIDs i s taking a heavy toll with the prevalence rate in the
general population of 4.8 percent in 2007. Only 60 percent o f the urban population and
40 percent o f the rural population benefit from safe water. In education, progress has



                                             8

been made, but further progress i s critical to the future growth o f the country. Currently,
less than half o f the population i s literate (only 43 percent o f adults are literate (53
percent males versus 32 percent o f females) and education at all levels suffers from a lack
o f qualified teachers, teaching material and adequate infrastructure.         Disparities in
education outcomes among gender and regions are large. Since the "free school" policy
was introduced in September 2005, primary education enrollment has significantly
improved from 80 percent in 2003-04 to about 100 percent in 2005-06 (matching the
MDG target o f 100 percent by 2015). However, quality is low and completion rate is
only 37 percent.     The accompanying CAS document and the annex o f this document
provide more details regardingthe social sectors and the outlook for reaching the MDGs.

27.      The Government o f Burundi i s trying to rebuild the social services (a strategic
axis in the PRSP) with the assistance o f HIPC funds and the international community.
The Government has sectoral strategies and i s undertaking budget tracking exercises and
user and provider evaluations to identify the problems and develop an action plan to
address them. Also, public spending inthe social sectors has increased. For instance, the
share o f education rose from an average o f 3.3 percent o f the GDP in recent years to 4.6
percent in2005 to more than 6 percent o f GDP in2006 (the SSA average i s 3.9 percent o f
GDP). Budget allocation for health has also increased, though public expenditure as share
o f total government expenditure i s still one o f the lowest in SSA and actual expenditure
has been affected by disbursement bottlenecks and low execution capacity o f the health
ministry. According to the revised2006 budget, 47 percent o fthe US$39.5 million HIPC
funds (recurrent and investment) were allocated to education and 35 percent to public
health and HIV-AIDS. Due to procurement and capacity issues, HIPC expenditures in
2006 were only about US$15 million, representing an execution rate o f 38 percent.

                                       GOVERNANCE

28.      The Government faces important challenges injudicial and financial governance,
which it i s addressing.

29.      Inthejustice system these challenges include: (i) indispensation ofjustice
                                                            delays
and(commercial) disputeresolution, as shown by a backlogs and a legal systemunsuited
to a market economy; (ii)lack o f technical and human capacity to deliver expedited
dispute resolution; (iii)corruption.    The Government i s drafting new investment and
commercial codes with the assistance o f the EMSP and IFC PEP-Africa. It has increased
the salaries o f thejudges and magistrates as an incentive against corruption. Finally, it has
established an Arbitration Center.

30.      The Government has acted swiftly to redress two recent financial governance
incidents, showing a serious commitment to address governance issues. The first incident
was the inappropriate sale o f the presidential plane in 2006, which was addressed by an
external audit and the adoption o f a related action plan inSeptember 2007. As part o f the
action plan, the government developed and presented a draft law on the sale o f public
goods to the Parliament in May 2008. It also created a Parliamentary commission to
further investigate the case in September 2007. The report o f the commission i s expected



                                            9

by end-June 2008.             However, the judicial process has not advanced in bringing
responsible parties to justice.

31.     The second Government incident relates to the payment o f US$17 million made
outside the budgetprocess to a petroleum trading company (Interpetrol) inApril and May
2007. The Government acted quickly to condemn this action and launched a preliminary
internal audit which was published. The authorities have agreed also to a governance
action plan that includes pursuing responsible individuals and reforming the public
finance management system quickly to avoid a recurrence o f such incident^.^                          The
Government moved quickly to address the weaknesses o f the PFM system through
changes introduced inits 2008 annual budget law and a new organic law it has presented
to the Parliament in May 2008. Furthermore, the recommendations o f the recent joint
Government-IDA Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR) are also being developed into a PFM action plan to be implementedin the
framework o f the Cadre de Partenariat. However, the legal case has lingered since May
2007, when the former Governor o f the Central Bank was arrested. N o further progress
has beenreported inbringingthis case to legal closure.

32.     The government faces weak institutional capacity which it is addressing with the
assistance from IDA and other memberso f the international community such as Belgium,
France, The Netherlands, DFID and EU. IDA'SEconomic Management Support Project
(EMSP) has been instrumental in supporting technical assistance and capacity building
for a large number o f activities, especially inPFM and PSD reforms. For instance, it has
supported the start-up o f the Audit Court. InJune 2008, it facilitated the training o f 98
staff from various ministries inthe implementation o f the new procurement law that was
promulgated in February 2008. Starting with this ERSG program and in coordination
with the EMSP, IFC PEP-Africa is providingtechnical assistanceand capacity buildingin
PSD issues. The new CAS also plans a public enterprise and financial sector Technical
assistanceproject for 2010.

33.     Finally, the Government i s committed to an ongoing comprehensive program o f
reform at the Central Bank and i s adopting a number o f laws and measures to improve
transparency o f financial transactions, including an anti-money laundering law which i s
currently with the Parliament.

Macroeconomic Outlook



4 The action plan included the following: (i)to conduct an external audit o f the arrears in the petroleum
sector; (ii)
           inthe short term, to agree on an action program to close the loopholes so that such payments
cannot recur in the h t u r e (including revisions to the Organic Law (Loi Organique) and the 2008 budget
law); and (iii)
              inthe medium term, to strengthen the accountability and transparency o fpublic spending by
implementing the reforms proposed in the PEMFAR, which i s currently under preparation, and would be
supportedby the proposed ERSGI1grant and other international partners.

34.     The macroeconomic framework and reform agenda framework i s consistent with
the Government objectives o f fostering growth and poverty reduction. The growth path
takes into account recent developments in the economy and i s in line with the latest IMF
analysis The medium-term economic framework assumes an acceleration o f real GDP
growth from 3.6 in2007 to 4.5 percent in2008 to 5 percent for the remaining period. The
main driving force behind the real GDP growth rate remains the primary sector, which
contributed on average 49 percent to GDP between 2000 and 2006, although a slow shift
to the secondary and tertiary sector i s expected5. The increase in the secondary sector
from 2009 onwards i s due to higher value added from agro-processing and mining
prospects6.

35.     Annual average inflation (measured by the GDP deflator), which spikes in2008 to
18.5 percent due to the sharp increases in international food and petroleum prices, i s
expected to decrease dropping to 8.7 percent in 2010, helped by the improved liquidity
management o f the Central Bank, and limited financing o f Government activities by the
Central Bank7.

36.     The current account deficit (excluding official transfers as percentage o f GDP)
narrows from 36.3 percent in2006 to 31.9 percent in2010. The improvement stems from
an increase in exports due to success o f the reform process especially inthe coffee sector
and developments in the mining sector. Imports are expected to increase at a slower pace
as the mainpost-conflict reconstructionand rehabilitation efforts come to an end.




 After a disappointing year with no growth in 2007, the primary sector is expected to recover from 2008
onwards. The main contribution to the primary sector comes from food crops (on average 80 percent
between 2000and 2006) A strong reform process in the agricultural sector will be necessary to achieve this
improvedperformance.
  The reform o f the coffee sector is expected to lead to higher output and quality o f coffee. Additional
stimulus is expected in the tertiary sector from strong public expenditure in the priority sector, renewed
investment in the telecom sector following the expected privatization o f ONATEL and the increased
dynamism o f the financial sector with the recent reopening o f the headquarter o f the Eastern and Southern
African Trade and Development Bank inBujumbura.
7World Bank medium term projections suggest that the prices will ease as supply responses will kick in.

GovernmentFinancial Outlook

37.          The outlook for Government finances is for a continued overall fiscal deficit
(including grants), except for 2009 whenthe country reaches HIPC completion point. The
fiscal deficit excluding grants i s estimated at 20.1 percent o f GDP in2007 and i s expected
to decrease to 19.9 percent o f GDP in 2010. Revenues are expected to remain relatively
constant as in the medium term the country will implement tariff policies related to its
2007 membership inthe East African Community, reducing its tariff intakes. Also, inthe
next 1-3 years the tax base i s not expected to increase notably as informality, tax evasion
and exemptions are relatively high and will only start to come under control once the tax
reforms have started to be implementedin 2008. Tax reforms include improvements in
tax information (registration and computerization o f the tax processes), reform o f the tax
rates and better collection. Recurrent expenditures will decrease as a result o f a drop in
interest payments from reaching the HIPC Completion Point in 2009. The debt stock i s
expected to fall substantially for the same reason. Wage and salary restraint will also

contribute to expenditure discipline, reflecting the demobilization effort and wage
restraint. It i s important to note, however, that the post conflict nature o f the country
requires higher police and armypresence.

38.       Aid pledges for 2007 are expected to meet projected requirements and consist
largely o f external grants. External grants for 2007 are projected at FBu221.3 billion (or
25.7 percent o f GDP), o f which 45 percent i s budget support (including special programs
for demobilization and reintegration o f ex-combatants), 37 percent project grants and 18
percent HIPC relief. The financing gap in the following years i s expected to be covered
by additional bilateral and multilateral assistance, provided Burundi stays on track with
its reform agenda.

39.        Inthe absenceoffullHIPC relief, Burundiwould be indebt distress, highlighting
the need for accelerated efforts to meet the HIPC completion point triggers. Even after
enhanced HIPC and MDRIassistance, Burundi i s at highrisk o f debt distress mainly due
to the low export base o f the country'. Burundi's end-2006 stock o f public and publicly
guaranteed debt was US$1,464 million (US$1,5 17 million including arrears), US$51
millionhigher than at the end o f 2005.

40.        The baseline scenario assumes continued interimHIPC relief. Under this scenario,
all debt sustainability indicators will breach the policy dependent thresholds, except for
the debt-service to revenue indicator (see Table 5). Hence, Burundiis considered to be in
debt distress. Full delivery o f HIPC and MDRI assistance, assumed in the alternative
scenario, would lead to a substantial decline o f the debt indicators, compared to a
scenario with only interim debt relief. Most o f the debt indicators would remain below

their indicativethresholds. The NPV o fdebt-to-exports ratio, however, will remain above
its threshold for the entire period, thereby placing Burundi in the `high risk o f debt
distress' category. Further stress tests indicate that less concessional borrowing as well as
lower GDP and export growth substantially increase the risk o f debt distress.

41.     Overall, for Burundi to lower the debt indicators related to exports and maintain
the other indicators below their thresholds, particular emphasis has to be placed on: (i)
implementation o f a strong and sustained reform effort, especially a diversified export
base to support robust growth in exports and GDP; (ii)        implementation o f prudent and
fiscal monetary policies to ensure fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability; (iii)
prudent debt management and meeting financing needs in the short- and medium-term
with grants and highly concessional loans; and (iv) strengthening o f debt management
policies and institutions, which would also contribute to higher indicative debt thresholds.

                                        2006 ERSG(ERSGI)9

42.     The 2006 ERSG was a stand-alone two-tranche operation, which closed end o f
March 2008, after successful tranche releases inNovember 2006 and December 2007. It
was designed to support reforms in public financial management (PFM) and promote
policies to accelerate growth.            The ERSG objectives were to:           (i)improve public
expenditure management and its impact on the poor; (ii)                revive agriculture export crop
sectors (coffee, tea, and cotton) and ensure better revenue distribution sectors among
actors; and (iii)  revive the private sector by improvingbusiness climate, accelerating State
divestiture, and settle the Government domestic arrears to the private sector. While
progress in PFM has been relatively steady and the Government has taken a number o f
important measures to improve the business environment, the pace o f structural reforms
was slower than anticipated.

43.      The ERSG program in PFM has progressed well given the weak institutional
capacity. For instance, a new and unified nomenclature has been implemented, helping
identify pro-poor expenditures.            The new double-entry accounting system has been
implemented.       The Interim computerized financial management information system
(SIGEFI) was functional for the 2006 budget year and produced quarterly budget
execution reports for 2007 and early 2008.                      The Government has progressively
consolidated its cash management by closing off-budgetary accounts. The General State
Inspectorate (Inspection Ge'nkraZ de Z'Etat) was created and became active in 2006.
Nonetheless, given the scope o f the ERSG program and the country's political fragility
and institutional weaknesses, not all reforms progressed as quickly as was hoped. For
instance it i s only in February 2008 that the new procurement law was promulgated and
the planned reconstitution o f the control unit o f the MEFCD is only materializing under
the ERSG11grant.

44.     In the PSD area, the ERSG program made progress but at a slower rate than
expected.     It focused on (i)     reviving the private sector by improving business climate,
accelerating State divestiture and settling the Government domestic arrears to the private
sector; and (ii)reviving agriculture export crop sectors (coffee, tea, and cotton) and
ensuringbetter revenue distribution sectors among actors. Despite good progress toward
reforming the business legal and regulatory environment, the pace o f structural reforms
was affected by several Government changes in2006-2007, low institutional capacity and
lack o f a unified and strategic approach in some policy areas. The Government has taken
a number o f measures to improve the business environment and promote private sector
development. For instance, in 2006, the Chamber o f Commerce and Industryestablished
the BurundiArbitration Center, to facilitate arbitration as a means o f commercial conflict
resolution. loBy August 2007, the authorities followed through their commitment to
settle Government debt to the private sector, providing it with some financial space. The
Government has enacted the insolvency law. Burundi became a member o f the East

African Community (EAC) in mid 2007 to facilitate its integration into the regional
economy.

45.      The Government's strategy to divest from economic activities has been to
undertake (i)    a differentiated approach to privatization o f the public enterprises and (ii)            a
reform program for the agricultural sector (coffee, tea and cotton) to revive exports and
improve revenues to producers. The Government has made some progress inprivatizing
public enterprises. They have liquidated some bankrupt enterprises, re-launched bids for
the sale o f Government shares in other enterprises and recently have finalized studies o f
the financial status o f seven major public enterprises. However, the privatization law still
in force is outdated. The institutional framework to prepare, manage and monitor the
reform o f the public enterprises is highlyinadequate. Finally, the overall approach for the
reform o f the remaining public enterprises still lacks a solid analytical underpinning
around which to build a consensus about the way forward.

46.      In the coffee sector the Government adopted a law in 2005, which liberalized
coffee prices and commercialization, and a rolling three year action plan in late 2006 to
reform the sector. It has undertaken a number o f activities to reform the sector, such as
creating the coffee reform committee in 2006, undertaking major studies supported by
IDA and the EU, and facilitating visits for international buyers. However, the sale o f the
washing stations has experienced a long delay. Also, the reforms experienced setbacks in
mid-2007, with two announcements (that set coffee prices and granted a monopoly for the
commercialization o f all Burundian coffee for 2006-2007), going against the 2005 law.
The program o freform intea and cotton sectors did not progress.                11




                            IV.      THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

47.      The Government's PRSP, which was formally adopted in September 2006 and
was presented to the IDA andIMFboards inMarch2007, intendsto redirect the economy
away from a post-conflict focus and towards economic growth and development. The
PRSP aims to strengthenpolitical stability, consolidate peace, and reduce poverty through
accelerated, sustainable, and equitable growth. There are four principal strategic axes in
the PRSP: (i)       improve governance and security; (ii)           promote sustainable and equitable
economic growth; (iii)develop human capital; and (iv) combat HIV/AIDS. The
accompanying CAS document provides a discussion o f these four axes.

48.      Both the Interim PRSP and the PRSP call for a reorientation o f public
expenditure, with a need to increase hnding for health and education, while ensuring
adequate funding for governance and security. They also list priority programs and cost

Government has developed a strategy for reform COTEBU that includes opening to enterprise to private
sector investment, most likely inpartnership with investors from People's Republic of China. SCEP has
developed an action planbasedon this strategy

these programs. Also, public expenditure financed from HIPC funds only started inmid-
2005. Nonetheless, the reduction in the share o f defense and security in 2001-2005 and
availability o f HIPC funds in 2006 helped increase the share o f economic and social
priority sectors from 28.6 percent o f total public expenditures in 2001 to 34.1 percent in
2005 and 38.2 percent in2006. While procurement issues and lack o f capacity ledto the
disbursement o f only 38 percent o f the 2006 HIPC total envelope o f 39.5 BFbu(or US$4
million), the HIPC funds that were used went predominantly to finance capital
expenditures (73 percent). Education received nearly half o f total HIPC funds, and over
98 percent o f these hnds financed the construction o f primary schools, in line with the
large expansion o f primary education, following the Government's decision in September
2005 to make primary school education free. In health, 24 percent o f total HIPC funds
were used to finance recurrent expenditure-such     as programs that promote the health o f
mothers and infants, subsidies for caesarians, and community based family planning
activities-while    only 0.2 percent financed health infrastructure.     In June 2007 the
authorities established a HIPC supervisory committee to better monitor HIPC
expenditures.

                    BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S           STRATEGY

49.     The proposed grant continues to support the Government o f Burundito transition
from the current post-conflict economic environment to one that i s focused on designing
and implementing policies that support economic development driven by private sector
activities. To consolidate recent progress inreconstruction, effectively mobilize increased
donors support, accelerate growth and reduce poverty, the Government needs to remove
bottlenecks to economic growth and governance. To this end, progress i s critical in the
priority areas already identified by two PRSP axes: (i)to improve governance and
security; and (ii) to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth. Specifically, to
improve governance the Government has identified several priorities: (i)     strengthen the
legal andjudicial framework and the democratic culture; (ii)   promote an efficient public
administration; (iii)reinforce decentralization; and (iv) to put in place a transparent
system o f management for public finance management and fight against corruption. To
promote sustainable and equitable economic growth, the priorities of the Government are
to: (i)reenergize the sectors that contribute to growth, notably agriculture (food and
exports),   livestock,  commerce, mining and industrial processing; (ii)diversify
opportunities for employment and revenue in the rural sector; (iii)        rehabilitate and
modernize infrastructure (transport, energy and telecommunications) to increase the
competitiveness o f the economy; and (iv) reestablishmacro-economic stability.

50.     The proposed ERSG 11aims to support authorities to implement a number o f
priorities identified in these two PRSP axes. Specifically, the program supports the
Government objectives to: (i)  put inplace a transparent systemo fmanagement for public
finance management through the PFM reforms with the ultimate goal o f improving
allocative efficiency in public service delivery; (ii)strengthen the legal and institutional
framework for private sector development by developing and adopting best practice laws
and regulations and by supporting analysis o f and the development o f a systematic
approach to public enterprise reforms; and (iii)reenergize a key export sector that


                                           17

contributes to growth and to diversifying opportunities for employment and revenues by
supporting reforms in the coffee sector. Finally, the grant supports macroeconomic
stability by providing continuedbudget support.



51.     The series is also in full alignment with the new CAS that is under development
and will be presented to the Board alongside this operation. The new CAS pursues and
consolidates the objectives set forth in the ISN, which were to assist the Government
contain strong social demands while identifying areas and mechanisms to promote
sustainable economic growth. Its goal i s to support Burundi transit from a post-conflict to
a development economy by selectively assisting the Government inthe implementation o f
the PRSP. The strategic objectives o f the CAS are: (i) to promote sustainable and broad-
based economic growth; (ii)improve access to social services and consolidate social
stability. Governance will be a cross-cutting objective.

Relationshipto Other BankOperations

52.     The proposed grant series i s a follow-up to the ERSG operation approved by the
Board in 2006. It i s developed in close coordination with the Economic Management
Support Project (EMSP), an IDA financed project, which provides technical assistance
and capacity building in all areas o f economic reforms to the authorities. This proposed
grant series i s also closely coordinated with IFC's PEP-AFRICA which i s starting an
extensive program o f technical assistance and capacity building to improve the business
environment inBurundi.

                  COLLABORATIONWITHTHE IMFAND OTHERDONORS

53.     Coordination with IMF. The proposed grant is beingprepared inparallel with
the sixth review o fthe first 3-year PRGF andhas coincidedwith the discussions to launch
the second 3-year PRGFthat took place inMay 2008. The aim is to ensure coordination
and consistency o f the macroeconomic and structural policy programs o f the grant and the
PRGF. The grant's focus on PFM is to improve the transparency and quality of
expenditures and on PSD sector reforms to support broad-based diversified growth
complement the IMF's areas o f focus.

54.     Coordination with other donors. The team i s working in close coordination
with several bilateral and multilateral donors within the existing Cadre de Partenariat
established for the ERSG grant. The Netherlands and Norway, which have provided co-
financing of the ERSG grant, have committed to continue co-financing the ERSG11.The
team will continue to promote enhanced coordination and harmonization among donors,
in order to improve the predictability of budget support and coordination of donor
supports for the PFM and PSDreforms.

                                    LESSONSLEARNED

56.     Lessons from previous support for Burundi, such as the Emergency Economic
Reform Project and the Economic and Rehabilitation Credit, indicate that these
instruments were effective injumpstarting the economy in a post-conflict environment
and initiating key reforms that helped the authorities show the benefits o f peaceful
settlement o f conflict.     However, in order to be effective, project design and
implementation needed to be sensitive to the prevailing circumstances. It i s unrealistic to
expect a Government to carry out a broad and complex economic reform program.
Therefore operations shouldbe sharply focused. Also, the need to payparticular attention
to "poverty alleviation" components o fpost-conflict programs cannot be overemphasized.

57.      Review o f the Economic and Rehabilitation Credit also highlighted that before
launching a privatization program, it i s important to liquidate those public enterprises that
are technically bankrupt. The reform o f the coffee industry i s essential for improving
Burundi'sexports and the incomes o f a large number of small farmers. Improvingpublic
finance management was essential for enabling the transition Government and its
successor to finance critical programs aimed at national reconciliation, enhanced security,
and rehabilitation o f economic and social infrastructure.

58.      Lessons from the 2006 stand-alone two-tranche ERSG (ERSG I)operation
indicate that several factors are key to the sustainability o f the reform program. First,
operation design needs to be sensitive to the internal consensus building process, in
particular around difficult structural reforms. This i s all the more important if
Government changes in a fragile and conflict prone environment, with the incoming
Government needingto first establish its own understanding o f policy priorities. Second,
the creation, proper functioning and continuity o f technical and policy level institutions
will ensure institutional memory and help avoid backtracking or repetitive / parallel
initiatives in the reform process. Third, the design and scope o f the program need to be
simpler, less ambitious and more focused to take into account the fragile political
environment and weak institutional and human capacities to implement reforms. For
instance, the ERSG program could have been more focused in the scope o f its overall
program, both in PFM reforms as well as agriculture. In the later case, the reforms
envisioned for tea and cotton sectors did not progress as expected. Agreeing to critical
yet realistically achievable measures with the authorities is key to minimizing delays in
implementing reforms and will avoid budgetary issues related to delayed tranche release.
Fourth, closer coordination with other development partners from the early stages o f the
development o f the operation will help strengthen the "Cadre de Partenariat", unify
budget support process among donors further and lessen the transaction costs to the
authorities o f dealing with the conditionalities and administrative processes o f multiple
donors. Fifth, the importance o f in-depth analytical work in informing policy dialogue
and reforms can not be over-emphasized.

                               ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

59.     The Public Finance Management components o f the ERSGseries are based on the
analytical underpinnings o f a Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR) under preparation.             While reviewing the reforms
already made in improving public expenditure and budget reforms - supported by the
2006 ERSG and other donors - the PEMFAR highlights the need for continued: (i)
progress in updating the legal and regulatory framework; (ii)reforms in budget
preparation practices; (iii) streamlining o f budget execution practices; (iv) strengthening
o f cash management; and (v) further developing the internal and external audit systems.
A summary o f PFM findings from the PEMFAR is provided in the annex 5.                    The
preliminary findings o f the PEMFAR were presented in a joint workshop held with the
authorities inOctober 2007 inBujumbura, where some o f the directors and technical staff
o f the MEFCD participated inpresenting the results o f the study. The feedback from this
joint workshop was incorporated into the PEMFAR. A validation workshop will take
place inlate summer 2008.

60.     The PSD component o f the ERSG series i s based on three existing analytical
pieces: (i) the Sources o f Rural Growth prepared in 2007 (a summary o f findings is
provided in the annex 7); (ii) Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS, 2004); and
                                the
(iii)backgroundstudyonthepublicenterprises. TheDTISstudyisbeingupdatedand

complemented by the diagnostic work from IFC PEP-Africa specialists who visited the
country in 2007 at the request o f the President o f the Republic to assist the authorities in
improving the DoingBusiness Indicators.


     0  The Sources o f Rural Growth i s intended to highlight key priority areas with
        potential to generate a rapid increase in agricultural production in the short- to
        medium-term. Inthis regard, it recommends transforming the use o f Burundi's
        rural assets, notably coffee, to enable this sector to become a better contributor to
        shared growth inthe short term and to provide the state with sufficient revenues to
        assist in the long term diversification o f the economy. The reinforcement of
        export crops' contribution to growth will require a sound privatization o f the
        coffee and tea sub-sectors as a means o f improving the sector's competitiveness
        and o f contributing to shared growth. The results o f the study were presented in a
        two day workshop in Bujumbura in May 2007 with active participation by the
        representatives o f the Government and the private sector. The feedback from the
        workshop was incorporated into the analysis. Annex 7 provides an extensive
        summary o fthe study and issues related to coffee and tea subsectors.


     0  The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS, 2004) recommends sweeping
        reforms to restore competitiveness after a decade lost to internal conflict. Indoing
        so, the study highlights five priorities: (i) regional integration; (ii)
                                                    further                          develop
        and implement an export promotioddiversification strategy; (iii)introduce
        measures to reform the coffee sector; (iv) update and revamp the entire business
        regulatory framework, including the Investment code, the Commercial Code, the
        Labor Code, Energy Code, Telecommunication Code, and the Bankruptcy

        legislation to foster and attract foreign direct investments (FDI); and (v) trade
        facilitation and customs administration to reduce the cost o f doing business by
        eliminating the unnecessary administrative burdens and lowering the cost o f
        imports and exports.


    0   The background study on the public enterprises summarizes the known facts and
        figures about the universe o f public enterprises in Burundi. It also provides
        historical background about the reform efforts, the institutional framework to lead
        the reform, results o f the reform process and explanations as to its failure. From
        the scant information available, the study notes the poor financial conditions o f
        many o f these enterprises and highlights the need to undertake further in-depth
        financial studies before launching into a reform o f the sector. Such an analysis
        will allow the authorities to better understand what approach to adopt for the
        reform o f the public enterprises.

61.     Generally, more in-depthstudies are neededto identify the economic and sectoral
issues before suggesting wide ranging reforms to the authorities. The upcoming ERSG111
will benefit from an analysis of the institutional capacity to reform the public enterprises
and more complete information on the financial situation o f public sector enterprises and
their potentialimpact onthenationalbudgetand the economy ingeneral. An ICA isbeing
finalized, following the investment climate survey conducted in July 2006 and the
validation seminar held in Bujumbura in April 2008. The study on divestiture o f the
coffee sector assets and the sectoral environmental assessment will provide hrther
analytical bases for the Government policy choices. Inthe PFM area, several surveys are
underway that will inform the improvements o f the allocative efficiency o f the budget.
These are: (i) education, health, and justice sectors budget tracking exercise (PETS -
                the
budget monitoring) o f public spending on the delivery o f pro-poor; (ii) evaluation by
                                                                            an

problems identified.

                                   OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

62.     The design o fthe ERSGseries as atwo-operation programmatic series is basedon
successful examples in fragile states where peace and national reconciliation has led to
significant improvements in the prospects for reform. In the case o f Burundi several
factor weigh in favor o f such an approach. The country i s working towards consolidation
o f peace as shown by the Arusha peace agreement in 2000, the democratic elections and
peaceful transition o f power to the elected Government and continued efforts by the
authorities to consolidate peace. The Government i s committed to the reform process at
the highest level and engages inpolicy dialogue with the international community, where
it has strong support.      The Government's reform agenda, as outlined in the PRSP,
embraces governance as well as social and economic issues.           The Government has



                                            21

undertakennoted measures inreforming and improving public finance management with
the support of IDA,the IMF, European Union and bilateral donors.

63.     The programmatic approach o f the ERSG series can act to mitigate the risks
associated with budget support operations in Burundi. It signals commitment by the
Bank and other donors as well as by the Government to follow-on support, compared to a
stand-alone single tranche operation. The continuity o f the policy dialogue and reform
agenda that started with the 2006 stand alone ERSG grant and i s now set out inthe ERSG
series, together with the technical assistance and capacity building from Economic
Management Support Project (EMSP), and in partnership with the IFC PEP-AFRICA
program, will contribute to support the reform agenda that i s expected to help the country
transition to an economy focused on development goals. This approach will also provide
adequate time to ensure that policies are built on analytical work and the policy adopted i s
country-owned, especially as it relates to the coffee sector and reform o f the public
enterprises. The programmatic approach o f the ERSG series offers the benefit o f laying
out a clear road map for obtaining future support, without forcing the definition o f
binding tranche release conditions in areas where policy formulation is ongoing (i.e., in
the coffee sector). Future support will hinge on sufficient progress against policy
objectives attached to identifiedreforms. Finally, the ERSGseries will be developed on a
time table that will align its tranche release to the country's budget cycle. This alignment
with the national budget cycle is expected to be complete by the effectiveness of the
second grant (ERSG 111),which i s expected for August 2009. July i s the beginning o f the
new budget cycle expected to be adopted by the Authorities as part o f their recent
membership inthe East African Community.

64.     The proposed Economic Reform Support Grant I1(ERSG11)is the first ina series
o f two grants designed to assist the Government o f Burundito continue implementing the
country's poverty reduction strategy inorder to transition from a post conflict economy to
one that i s focused on economic development driven by private sector growth. The
proposed ERSG I1will support the Government to continue: (i)reforms in the public
finance management system to improve accountability and transparency in public
spending; (ii)reforms in the business legal and institutional environment to foster
private-sector-led growth; and (iii) reforms inthe coffee subsector.

                            Box 1: GoodPractice Principleson Conditionality
Principle 1:Reinforcecountryownership
The Government o f Burundii s strongly committed to the reforms supported under the operation. The grant
supports the Government's PRSP, which was developed ina participatory manner involving consultation o f
a wide range o f stakeholders and including 17 provinces and sectors. The process was led by the Permanent
Secretariat for Monitoring Economic and Social Reforms, with the support o f international partners and
local non-Governmental organization (NGOs), quantitative and qualitative surveys were undertaken in all
the provinces and more than 145 grassroots civil society groups were consulted. The Bank has actively
supportedthe Government inthis process.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountabilityframework
The Government and the budget support donors have agreed on a common framework "Cadre de
Partenariat" and the Government is developing a P F M action plan based on the PEMFAR (2008) around
which donors can consolidate their support.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The ERSG series i s fully aligned with the PRSP and has been developed through extensive consultations
with the Government, the private sector and development partners. The ERSG series should be seen as the
overall umbrella for Bank support and policy dialogue, which is complemented by specific projects
providing focused investment assistance. Budget support i s seen as necessary instrument to address the
budgetary needs o f Burundi while strengthening the Government's systems. The series is designed to give
the necessary space to develop critical, but sensitive, reforms in coffee and public enterprise reform. This
approach i s fully consistent with the Government objectives, and in some areas broadens the setting o f the
policy dialogue to multiple stakeholders, beyond Government policy declarations.

Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresultsas conditionsfor disbursement
The ERSG series focuses on a few selected prior actions and triggers that are based on the PRSP. The prior
actions and indicative triggers were chosen based on extensive discussions with the authorities and the
private sector to identify the actions that would be critical steps for implementing the Government's
program within a realistic timeframe. They would provide meaningful outcomes and help loosen major
constraints or facilitate further reforms. A higher number o f measures are included in the policy matrix
(annex) as measures o f progress to monitor the overall progress o f the reform program.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progressreviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financialsupport
A full and close supervision o f the program progress review will take place in line with the agreed
PartnershipFramework between the Government o f Burundiand the budget support donors

                                             POLICYAREAS

65.      The table below provides the prior actions and indicative triggers for the ERSG
series program. The choice o f the reforms and the content o f the policy matrix were based
on ensuring country ownership and priorities, as expressed in the PRSP; capacity o f the
country to implement the reforms, realism o f the timeline to implement them; the need
for a simple methodology for monitoring progress; results focus with a medium-term
horizon and the need to provide technical assistanceon several o f the measures.

  66.     The findings from PEMFARsuggest that Burundiwould benefit from:

      0   The implementation o f sound budgetary operating procedures, as provided for in
          the draft organic law and evidenced by the assessmentsprovided by internal audit
          and inspectionbodies;

      0   A higher degree o f consolidation o f public expenditure into the budget than is
          currently the case (an increase o f on-budget expenditure);

      0   A reasonable degree o f financial discipline, as evidenced by the credibility o f the
          budget (comparison o f budget estimates and outturns, both in aggregate and by
          sector);

      0   Reasonably accurate recording and reporting o f financial and physical data, as
          evidenced by the regular production o f consistent Government accounts and the
          opinions o f auditors.

  67.     Continuing the reforms supported by the 2006 ERSG, the ERSG series supports
  additional PFM reforms that take into account PEMFAR's findings and will improve
  fiscal transparency and accountability, with the ultimate goal o f improving service
' delivery. The ERSG I1 will focus more tightly on reforms related to preparation,
  execution and reporting o f the budget and internal audits. This focus i s grounded in the
  experiences from the 2006 ERSG two-tranche operation, the governance issues that arose
  during its implementation highlighting the need to focus on the basics o f budget
  operations, and the findings o f the PEMFAR. ERSG m will follow up on reforms
  launched with the support o f ERSG11, but will also focus more on the issues related to
  budgetary allocative efficiency. This later goal will be informed by results of: (i)      the
  education, health, andjustice sectors budgettracking exercise (PETS- budgetmonitoring)
  o f public spendingon the delivery o f pro-poor, (ii)an evaluation by users o f the quality o f
  services provided; (iii) an evaluation by providers o f constraints to effective delivery o f
  pro-poor services; and (iv) the preparation o f an action plan to address problems
  identified.

  68.     While progress has been made in this area since 2005, further progress i s needed
  inseveral areas.

          0   Legal and Regulatory Framework. The current legal framework Law o f
              March 19, 1964 i s outdated and a source o f many derogations and exceptions.
              The new draft law ("Loi organique") developed during the 2006 ERSG
              program and supported by the Economic Management Support Project
              (EMSP), sets the fundamental principles and rules for sound public finances.
              Inaddition, complementary laws would further set the rules for the application

              o f the organic law in public finan~e.'~The new draft organic law was
              approved by the Council o f Ministers in March 2008 and submitted to the
              Parliament inMay 2008 as a prior action for ERSG II.A next step under the
              program through 2008 i s the implementation o f the law, including
              development and adoption o f the manual o fbudget executionprocedures.


         0    Budget comprehensiveness and coverage. As noted in the 2006 ERSGand
              in the PEMFAR, the budget ought to become comprehensive, integrating
              recurrent and investment budgets, civil service payroll, domestic and foreign
              expenditures. In2007 the Government adopted a unifiedbudget nomenclature
              and i s now working towards electronic integration o f the recurrent and
              investment budgets, working with the support o f technical assistance financed
              by the EMSP.

              The 2006 ERSG reforms have helped strengthen the link between the PRSP
              and the annual budget, as seen by the higher expenditures in social sectors.
              The Government is now working to push these reforms forward. The non-
              recording, or partial recording o f foreign-financed, and NGO-financed
              operations i s a serious handicap for the authorities to devise a meaningful
              strategy for the fight against poverty. Also, the authorities, aware that the
              method adopted for the codification o f poverty reduction expenditures needs
              to be further refined, simplified the methodology and improved the
              identification o f expenditures for poverty reduction in the functional
              classification based on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (PRSP).
              This improvement i s a prior action for ERSG II. The on-going public
              expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) in health, education and justice sectors
              and beneficiary assessment, which are supported by the EMSP, are expected
              to inform the Government's decision for the 2009 budget cycle. The proposed
              ERSG111program will follow the preparations for the 2009 budget to make
              sure the link and consistency between PRSP and annual budget 2009 will
              improve.       Submitting       a draft budget law for 2009 to the parliament by
              October 2008 reflecting a (i)closer alignment with PRSP goals and (ii)an
              increased share o f expenditures directed to health, education, agriculture and
              social protection compared to 2008 i s an indicative trigger for ERSGIII.The
              finalization o f the public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) and beneficiary
              assessmenti s also an indicative trigger for (ERSGIII).

         0    Budget preparation. As noted by the PEMFAR, the budget preparation
              process needs improvements at all levels. In June 2008, the authorities
              adopted a decree establishing a new budget preparation timetable,


l3The most important of these laws is the new law on public accounting which would set the essential rules
and procedures for the execution o f the budget and would cover : (i)    the streamlining o f the expenditure
circuit; (ii)
            the clarification and strengthening o f the internal control and audit systems. A new law would
better define the architecture of the control and audit systems. Related decrees would clarify the
presentatiodscope and the preparation o f the budget law and the budgetary and accounting plan o fthe
State.

               responsibilities and the content o f the lettre de cudruge (framework letter) to
               improve timeline and efficiency in the budget preparation process. The new
               decree includes a budgetprocess that starts inFebruary/March by ensuringthe
               availability o f the macro-economic framework. The lettre de cadruge i s to
               include expenditures ceilings by ministry, information on the macroeconomic
               forecasts, and the general trend o f public expenditures on the Government
               economic and social strategy and the expected results, particularly inthe fight
               against poverty. The adoption o f this decree i s a prior action for the ERSGII.
               The issuance o fthe related "lettre de cudruge" and ensuing budget preparation
               process for 2009 will be next steps during 2008. IDA has provided technical
               advice on the content o f the decree. These steps should prepare the country
               for an eventual MTEF, which, when implemented, should help allocate
               resources in accordance with the PRSP priorities. In the medium term, the
               authorities need to strengthenthis capacity for multi-year budgetary planning.
               This includes creating capacity to manage and supervise budget limits,
               arbitrage, improve the macroeconomic and revenue forecasts, consolidate and
               synthesize the budget. It i s also necessary to build capacity to prepare a
               reliable multi-year plan that takes into account expenditures for each budget
               entity and allocates the resources according to the medium-term priorities
               definedbythe Government.

               Budget execution. As noted in the 2006 ERSG and the PEMFAR, budget
               execution i s overburdened by a multiplicity o f compliance/regularity controls,
               most o f the time redundant, leading to substantial amount o f expenditures to
               be executed using exceptional procedure^'^. They obscure the budget process,
               and reduce the relevance o f reports on budget execution. It will also be u s e h l
               to abolish redundant controls and reinforce the levels o f critical controls. The
               adoption and implementation o f manual o fbudget executionprocedures based
               on the new organic law during 2008 will help streamline budget execution
               process including redundant controls.           Also, to improve execution o f the
               budget, the new procurement code, promulgated in February 2008 and going
               into effect in October 2008, will need to be implemented correctly and
               systematically. Already, 98 staffs from different ministries andpublic entities
               have been trained about the implementation o f the new law with the assistance
               o f EMSP project. The establishment o f the regulatory framework required by
               the new law will provide the necessary oversight o f procurement practices
               from the beginning. Establishing the procurement regulatory authority in
               accordance with the new procurement code i s an indicative trigger for
               ERSG 111.




14This is particularly the case for: (i) foreign-financed expenditures are paid from accounts opened in
                                        most
commercial banks; (ii)  extrabudgetary accounts; and (iii) expenditures made from Government accounts by
non autonomous public entities. A payment is derogatory to the rules when allocations are made available
to entities without legal personality and financial autonomy.


                                                    28

               Furthermore, the authorities should reintegrate the state's operations in the
               normal expenditure process and in the interim Integrated Financial
               Management System (SIGEFI).''               SIGEFI needs to be further developed,
               strengthened and be fully owned by the authorities.                    The Government is
               working with the support o f the EMSP to improve the interim SIGEFI in
               general and its weak management o f salaries, including the obsolete software
               for the computerized management o f the payroll.'6 The Government has
               created a project management structure within MEFCD, to execute an action
               plan for the finalization o f SIGEFI which takes into account the required
               documentation and training for the users; and the specifications elaborated by
               the end-users o f the system. Improving the SIGEFIwould involve ensuring
               that (i) state operations are included in the normal expenditure process
                        most
               and (ii) allows minimum standard budget execution process including
                        SIGEFI
               the monitoring o f the file's movements, the reservation o f appropriations and
               transfers, the control o f commitment through appropriation quota, the partial
               payment, and the closing o f the Government balanced account. As regards
               payroll functions, the SIGEFI started in early 2007 to incorporate wages and
               salary data comprehensively at the payment order stage. As an additional step
               to control the wage bill, the authorities have launched a comprehensive census
               o f the civil service and the police with the assistance o f EMSP and the Dutch
               Government. They have launched a census o f the military and security forces,
               financed out o f the Government's own budget. Following the census, a new
               database o f public service personnel will be created. Also, the authorities are
               moving to develop, test and implement a module as part o f SIGEFI to
               calculate and process the wage bill. Improvement o f the SIGEFIand including
               the functional model for the calculation o f the payroll are major reform
               measures o f the ERSG series program. Both measures are indicative triggers
               for the ERSGIII.

               Budget reporting. While progress is being made in budget accounting,
               processes need further strengthening and reports need to be prepared more
               accurately, regularly and ina timely fashion. A new budgetary and accounting
               plan is being implemented since 2005 and substantial progress has been
               achieved by authorities inaccounting.




l5  Since the inception o f the SIGEFI in 2005, the four steps o f the expenditure chain (commitment,
liquidation, payment orders, and payments) have been integrated into the system. The system i s still an
interim system and was not based on a defined general architecture with the target o f integrating all public
finance operations. Also, the Government still i s burdened by an sizeable wage bill as share o f the state's
budget, with weak management of salaries. The software for the computerized management o f the payroll
i s obsolete, and the MEFCD i s not in a position to effectively ensure the verification o f the delivery o f the
goods or services and the amount to be paid ("liquidation") and the payment o fthe public servants' wages.
l6 The transfer o fthe wage billmanagement from a private enterprise to the MoF is underway withthe
assistance o f the World Bank, which is also assisting inthe development of a new software program for the
management o f the public service data, which should inthe medium-term facilitate the control o f the wage
bill


                                                    29

  There are still difficulties with the reliability and regularity o f budget and
  accounting reports: (i)  data on expenditures are not accurate as they do not
  include most foreign-financed operations and expenditures; (ii)budget
  implementation reports are not produced at regular intervals; (iii) are
                                                                        there
  important delays between the time funds are cashed andthe accounting report;
  and (iv) accounting procedures are not fully mastered leading to discrepancies
  in 2005 and 2006 accounts. Progress on the first problem will depend on
  greater efforts from the donor community to share its planned program o f
  assistance. With technical assistance from IMF, the authorities are working on
  revising the 2005 accounting plan and procedures to ensure the last two
  outstanding problems are corrected.       These revisions would lead to more
  accurate, timely and regular reports. The adoption o f the revised accounting
  and budgetary chart and implementation o f the revised manual o f accounting
  procedures i s an indicative trigger for ERSGIII.

  The authorities still need to ensure the comprehensiveness o f their budget
  process by recording all transaction in SIGEFI at various stages o f the
  expenditure process, including expenditure from the HIPC fund, and foreign-
  financed and counterpart funds. Regularizing the periodicity o f the general
  balance o f accounts and reports on revenues and expenditures will further
  facilitate budget management. As part o f its reform program, the Government
  plans to create a unit within the Directorate o f Accounting in charge o f
  centralizing the information on executions from different sources (project
  executions, disbursements from Central Bank, and the like).


0 Cash management. Cash management remains weak.                The state's cash
  resources remain fragmented, budget revenue projections are not exhaustive
  and expenditures did not benefit from a systematic quarterly programming.
  Some progress has been made recently. An effort has been made to move
  towards the single treasury accounting with the authorities closing 125
  accounts in 2005 and 2006 and another 50 in the first half o f 2007. All the
  transit accounts at customs and tax directorates inthe commercial banks have
  beenclosed. The MEFCD and BRB have established ajoint cash management
  committee. Domestic debts were audited and a debt settlement plan was
  implemented, closing end August 2007.          Finally, to better forecast cash
  balances and cash flow needs to smooth out budget execution, the MEFCD
  has developed and is implementing in close consultation with five main line
  ministries (health, education, defense, police and agriculture) to develop
  revolving quarterly cash flow plans which are (i) based on comprehensive and
  realistic revenue forecasting and assessment o f seasonal expenditure
  requirementsand (ii)providing line ministries the quarterly ceiling o f
  commitments. Developing and implementing these revolving quarterly cash
  flow plans starting for the second quarter o f 2008 was a prior action for the
  ERSG 11grant. Implementation of subsequent quarterly cash flow plans will
 be anext step under the Government program.



                                   30

             To further improve cash management, the Government should request donors
             through the "Cadre de Parenariat", to transfer project accounts to the sub
             accounts o f the Directorate o f Accounting at the BRB and to provide the
             schedule and amount o f their budget support for integration into budget
             previsions. Also, it would be useful to establish a Cash Management
             Committee, under the authority o f MEFCD who chairs its meetings, along
             with a technical group with a permanent secretariat to assist the Cash
             Management Committee.

             Internal audit. Internal controls are weak. They are the responsibility o f
             "Inspection Gkne`ral de Z'dat" (IGE) created in September 2006 under the
             aegis o f the Minister o f Good Governance, the control unit o f the MEFCD,
             which i s to be reconstituted in2008, and internal units insome line ministries,
             that suffer from low capacity'

             The authorities are working to strengthen the audit functions.                 They have
             started to submit the general accounts o f the Government to Audit Court. To
             support this effort, submitting 2006 and 2007 Government general accounts
             and extra budgetary accounts for audit to the Audit Court is a prior action for
             ERSG 11. Another important step i s to speed up the full start o f the operations
             o f the MEFCD internal inspection and control unit. Given the clear interest
             expressed by the authorities, and since both the 2006 ERSGandthe PEMFAR
             note the importance o f re-establishing internal control at the MEFCD, re-
             establishment and satisfactory staffing and functioning o f this unit i s a prior
             action for the ERSG I1program. The Minister o f Economy, Finances and
             Cooperation for Development has signed a decree inearly 2008 to re-establish
             the unit. The staff o f the unit has been nominated and a work plan for 2008
             developed. The staff o f the ministry i s developing the internal regulations for
             the new unit.

                                 PRIVATE SECTORDEVELOPMENT"

69.      The overall approach o f the ERSG series builds on the 2006 ERSG reform
program. Given the scope o f the 2006 ERSG program and the experience in
implementing it (discussed above), the ERSG series has opted for a simpler, less
ambitious and more focused approach to accommodate the political and institutional
realities o fthe country. The proposed ERSGI1program also benefits from reforms which
were shepherded by the 2006 ERSG and the EMSP project. It has also benefited from
new analyses on the agriculture sector and the public enterprises.

Background

70.      There i s very little information about the size and impact o f the private sector
(both formal and informal) inthe Burundi economy. Most notably, there i s no estimate o f

the size o f the informal sector (excluding agriculture) in terms o f contribution to the
economy or employment. The ongoing Investment Climate Analysis supported by IDA
and the upcoming technical assistance to foster private sector development by IFC will
provide much needed insight to inform further policy dialogue. A better knowledge o f
the structure o f the labor force (by pullingtogether data from different statistical sources
like tax and social security records), a survey o f the informal sector and a new household
survey would help enrich the informational and analyticalbase o f this dialogue.

71.      The private sector, while very small, has remained an important actor in some o f
the economic sectors such as energy, ago-industry, mining and communications. The
formal private sector consists o f about 3000 registered enterprises, largely small and
medium sized, employs some 37,000 workers (2004) and produces mainly for the local
market".       Estimates o f Direct foreign investment vary according to different sources,
between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent o f GDP for 2005 compared to 0.4% inRwanda and
3.5 percent in Uganda."           Private sector growth i s hampered by the small size o f the
domestic market, the landlocked position o f the country, other structural constraints and
anuninvitingbusiness climate.

72.      The scant available information on employment suggests that the agriculture
sector employs over 90 percent o f the total workforce o f 3.9 million (2006), but
underemployment i s rampant. The modem sector i s very small; it i s estimated to employ
107,000 persons in2004, o fwhich two-third are inthe civil service andparastatals.

73.      The Government is aware that to secure peace it needs to promote sustainable and
diversified economic growth led by the private sector - an objective identified as one o f
the PRSP axes. Coffee i s currently an essential source o f income for the country, and a
recent IDA study recommends diversification to higher value added crops within
agriculture as one major source o f rural growth and income creation2'. The authorities are
also interested in developing other sectors to strengthen the economy's ability to
withstand external shocks inthe mediumto long run.

74.      To achieve a diversified and private sector led growth, the pace o f reforms needs
to be accelerated and their scope broadened. The authorities are committed to improve
the current legal and regulatory framework o f the business environment. They intendto
retrench from economic sectors by undertaking a systematic and economically sound
reform o f public enterprises. The structural reforms o f the coffee sector, which stalled in
mid-2007 due to contradictorypolicymeasures, will be launched again.




'* Data from tax records suggests that about 3000 enterprises are formally registered, o f which 300 are
registered with the UnitC des Grandes Entreprises o f the Tax Directorate. These 300 enterprises account for
92 percent o f the income tax revenue.

75.       The constraints to private sector driven growth and income creation include
inadequate infrastructure (transport, energy and telecommunication)2'.                    The proposed
ERSGgrant series was not deemed the appropriate instrument to facilitate infrastructure
development at this stage o f the country's development due to lack o f a comprehensive
analytical background; the complexity o f these types o f reforms and lack o f national
capacity to properly undertake them; and the length o f time needed to develop such a
program and implement it. IDA i s already engaged in the road sector and a project in
water and energy was presented to the Board o f the World Bank in May 2008. Also,
Burundiwill participate inregional telecommunications program supported by IDA that
will facilitate the country's connectionto the world.

Business environment

76.       There i s much room for improvement inthe business environment and promoting
private sector development. The average time for completing the steps for registering a
business i s reported to be 43 days andthe cost i s about 200,000 FBu, almost twice the per
capita income. This performance i s only slightly above the average for sub-Saharan
Africa. Furthermore, a 2006 enterprise survey indicates that a firm's senior management
spends on average about 5.7 percent o f their time in dealing with requirements o f
Government regulations. 22 Unofficial payments for a typical firm to `get things done'
amount on average to 4.5 percent o f turnover; more specifically, 23 percent o f firms
indicate that they are expected to make such payments (or `gifts') in meetings with tax
inspectors.

77.       Major reforms would foster a more favorable business climate for investmentsin
Burundi.They include: (i) business laws and administrative regulations to avoid
                                   clarify
provisions open to interpretations or discretionary decisions, (ii)                reform the judiciary
system to reduce excessive delays in the commercial court and promote arbitration and
mediation as a means o f settling commercial disputes; (iii)                  strengthen public-private
dialogue; (iv) facilitate business registration; (v) simplify the tax system for small
businesses; and (vi) develop a better analytical understanding and a systematic approach
to the reform o f public enterprises. Successfully implementingreforms (i), and             (iii) (iv)
will have the added benefit o f facilitating starting a business, registeringproperty, getting
credit, protecting investors, paying taxes, enforcing contracts, and closing a business.


21 Inlandlocked Burundi, road transport determines access to markets for subsistence produce and export
crops and therefore their quality and prices. Burundi has a meshed system o f roads, but out o f the 11,300
kilometers, only 1,209 kilometers are paved. The short-term key priority is to strengthen the rural road
network and develop physical capital at the community level. Energy i s a critical constraint to growth.
While the country is endowed with abundant water resources that could provide up to 250 megawatts, the
population suffers daily power outages. So far the lack and unreliability o f energy generation and
distribution has prevented development o f processing activities that would provide much needed added
value to agricultural produce. Therefore, rationalizing energy production and distribution to better use
existing facilities would support sustainable growth.      Finally, the country lacks an Internet backbone
reaching all provinces and enabling connections to other countries o f the region. The development o f a
quality telecom network would be critical for accessing market intelligence that will be fimdamental to
reach the coveted specialty coffee, tea, and horticulture markets.

(9 Improve the legal and regulatoryframework for businesses and thefunctioning of the
commercial court

78.       Background and key issues. The business laws and regulatory framework in
Burundi lack overall coherence and have not adapted to an increasingcomplex business
environment, deterring investments.


          0    Investment Code: The current Burundi investment code needs to be revised
               as it lacks some o f the basic guarantees which foreign investors expect, such
               as transferability o f dividends, and capital in case o f closure o f the business.
               Fiscal incentives for local and foreign investors are discretionary and do not
               allow for planning untilthe lengthy approval process i s completed.

               In June 2008, the Council of Ministers adopted and submitted to the
               Parliament a new draft code, which includes best practice features in
               investment legislation, including investor protection and freedom to transfer
               capital and dividends and a streamlined approval process. Non-discretionary
               incentives are included in the tax law and the tariff book. This action was a
               prior action for the proposed ERSG II.Technical support from the World
               Bank will continue to beprovided as needed.

               Business laws. The Government is in the process o f updating the 1993
               Commercial Code (Code du Commerce) and the 1996 Company law (Code
               des sociitis privies et publiques) with the assistance o f the EMSP. A
               competition law i s also being drafted23.The country has recently adopted two
               insolvency laws (loi sur lesfaillites et loi relative au concordatjudiciaire de
               l'entreprise en d@cultb, 2006) and has legislationon real estate collateral.

               The adoption o f a new commercial code and a code for private and public
               companies by the Council o f Ministers and submission to the Parliament i s an
               indicative trigger for the ERSG I11grant. The adoption of these laws by the
               Council o f Ministers will follow a wide validation process to ensure national
               ownership. Technical assistance from the World Bank will continue to be
               provided as needed.

               Commercial court. The functioning o f the commercial courts needs to be
               improved. Burundi has only one commercial court in the capital Bujumbura,
               which while fully staffed (with about 15 full-time magistrates), still lacks
               adequate facilities, equipment, and skills, despite receiving some training and
               equipment through EMSP. The high turn over o f magistrates contributes to a
               relatively low performance in terms o f caseloads. Also, there i s a significant
               level o f corruption i s reported inthe judicial system in general, and especially
               at the commercial court were stakes are higher financially. Getting sentences


23The draft competition law will also be finalized an adopted, either as part of the general commercial law
or as a free-standing text. Both approaches are used inother African countries and are acceptable.

            enforced constitutes an additional problem for the party who wins a court case.
            These shortcomings significantly affect the duration o f the court proceedings
            -theaveragecasetakesfouryearsbeforeasentenceisrendered,andan
            estimated backlog o f about 400 case files i s pendingat any time.

            To improve the functioning o f the judiciary in general, the Government has
            increased the salary o f judges and magistrates significantly to discourage
            corruption. The remaining agenda i s twofold. First, the court needs to reduce
            the average duration o f court cases by reforming its internal organization
             (r2glement interieur) to improve magistrates' performance. The Ministry o f
            Justice also needs to ensure a certain stability o f the magistrates posted to the
            court.    Second, the court should develop a realistic plan for resolving the
            backlog o f pending cases. Improving the performance o f the Commercial
             Court, specially the maximum delay in renderingjudgments on cases is an
             indicative trigger for the ERSG111grant.

(ii) Strengthen theprivate-public dialogue
79.     Background and key issues. There i s no systematic policy dialogue between the
private sector and the public sector on issues that affect the business environment and
economic growth.        A framework for public-private sector consultation (cadre de
concertation a r r W du Vice-president n"05/VP/03/du 03/I0/2003) was created in 2003.
Two high-level meetings took place since then. However, there was no specific agenda
and the meetings producedno recommendationor follow-up.

             A well-organized dialogue between the public and private sectors to promote
             the right conditions for private sector development and poverty has become an
             important part o f the private sector reform process. The public-private sector
             dialogue can facilitate investment climate reforms by supporting champions
             for reform, creating momentum, and accelerating the reform process.
             Governments that listen to the constraints o f the private sector are more likely
             to devise sensible prioritization plans and workable reforms. This, inturn, can
             encourage investors to take a longer view and cooperate with laws and
            regulations. The monitoring and evaluation systems put in place by a public-
            private dialogue initiative promote a culture o f compliance and entice
             Governments to perform regulatory impact assessments.               Given these
             considerations, in June 2008 the government adopted a decree to relaunch the
            public-private consultation framework to facilitate dialogue on economic
            policy between the private sector and the Government. The adoption o f the
             decree i s a prior action for the ERSG II.The content o f the decree was
             developed in extensive consultation with private and public stakeholders and
            with the support o f the EMSP and IFC PEP-AFRICA. Technical assistance
             from the World Bank Group will continue to support implementation o f this
             activity.

(iii) Facilitate business registration




                                             35

80.       Background and key issues.               As noted above, registering new businesses is
lengthy and costly. With the support o f the EMSP, the business registry located in the
Commercial Court i s in the process o f being computerized to speed up one o f the legal
requirements for the business registrationprocess.24

81.       This measure is part o f the overall ERSG program. Simplifying the business
registration procedures would improve Burundi's ranking in the "Creating a Business"
sub-indicator inthe DoingBusiness ranking.

(iv) Simplifi the tax systemfor small businesses

82.       Background and key issues.              Paying taxes in Burundi i s cumbersome and
complicated by the multiplicity o f taxes25, stifling private sector development as it
affects the formalization o fbusinesses and leaves room for uncertainty and corruption.

              A study on the reform o f the tax code completed in2007 suggested replacing
              theforfait and other small taxes paid by the small businesses by a simplified
              small business tax (imp6t synthe`tique) based on verifiable and mostly
              quantitative criteria    26927,  This reform would have several benefits: (i) well         a
              designed tax system will help draw into the formal economy those informal
              entities whose primary motivation for evading tax i s not fraud, but the
              complex and burdensome rules and regulations (such as multiplicity o f taxes);
              (ii) entrepreneurswill know in advance their tax liability and the Government
              will have a more predictable revenue stream; (iii) newly formal businesses
                                                                             the
              usually have better access to credit and procurement opportunities allowing
              them to grow and contribute economically to the country; (iv) the reform will
              reduce the possibility o f corruption involved in the present method o f
              "estimating" business turnover; and (v) formalization o f informal businesses
              will contribute economically and expand the tax base providing some tax
              relief for the existing formal businesses.




24 A preliminary study financed by the Economic Management Support Project is under way and will be
followed by the development and installation o f the software and training o f staff.
25The country ranks 109 out o f 178 inthe Doing Business Indicator "Paying Taxes".
26 At present, Burundi's tax code that affects small businesses includes a number o f small taxes, including a
tax option calledforfait for small registered firms (below a turnover o f 15 million Burundi Francs (Fbu)
annually - equivalent to appr. US$ 15,000 - for services, and below 20 millionFBUfor all other activities);
eligible firms do not have to comply with accounting regulations. Theforfait is not a lump sumpayment (as
its French name might suggest); it i s calculated as a percentage o f a prior "estimate" o f the turnover by the
tax inspector.
27 Assessment o f the amount o f tax will be made by easily verifiable, mostly quantitative indicators: the
nature of the economic activity, the geographic location o f the business (city-centre or outskirts), the type o f
construction and/or the square footage o f commercial space, the number o f employees, and the capacity o f
equipment used. A system o f predetermined coefficients based on the above indicators would be used to
calculate the business tax due.

         0    The inclusion o f the simplified small business taxation (imp6t synthe'tique)
              into the annual budget law for 2009(Loi desfinances), the traditional vehicle
              for modification o fthe tax code, i s an indicative trigger for ERSGIII.

(v) Public Enterprise Reform

83.      Background and key issues: The Burundi economy appears to be dominated by
public enterprises (PES), many o f which are in poor financial shape with potential
disastrous consequences for the central budget. Many have provided poor level and
quality o f goods and services. The 2006 PRSP acknowledges that the States needs to
retrench from productive sectors to allow a sustainable and accelerated growth led by the
private sector.       However, the existing analytical base does not provide sufficient
information to fully understand and evaluate the financial situation o f many o f the PES,
their impacts on Government finance and on the opportunity cost to the country and the
best option for the reform each PE. The Government still lacks a well-informed and clear
reform strategy.

              A 2007 overview study o f the status o f the PESin Burundi found that as o f
              mid-2007, the State had shares in 48 entities (40 enterprises and eight banks
              and financial institutions), of which 16 are fully publicly owned2'. However,
              accurate and reliable data was not available for an in-depth analysis o f a
              majority o f these enterprises. The study focused on a broad review o f the 12
              filly publicly owned enterprises within the productive sector, where data was
              most available andreliable.

          0   As o f 2005, these 12 enterprises employed more than half of the civil service
              (23, 259 persons) and contributed 7.4 percent o f the fiscal revenues to the
              State. However, they are also the most heavily indebted (155 B Fbu or
              approximately 18 percent o f GDP as o f 2005). In fact, three o f the major
              enterprises, The OfJice du The'du BURUNDI (Tea company, OTB), the OfJice
              National     des   Telecommunications (the telecommunications                       company,
              ONATEL) and the Re'gie de Production et de Distribution d'Eau et d'
              Electricite' (the water and electricity company, REGIDESO) owe over 60
              percent o f total debt. The State continued to subsidize the PESin difficulty
              since the 1980s, paying 2.7 Billion Fbuin2005 to keepingthem afloat. These
              subsidies adversely affected the central budget and the competitiveness o f the
              economy. Introduction o f management contracts did not bear positive results
              and large PES that dominated major productive sectors had to declare
              bankruptcy (for instance, VERRUNDI in glass making and COTEBU in
              textile). The effects o f these bankruptcies still ripple through the economy in
              the form o f unemployment, loss o f exports, and the like. A handfil o f PES
              dominate the exports o f the country: coffee, tea, beer, sugar and cigarettes (to
              the subregion), while all PESimport mostly sector specific products.



** The State has majority ownership in 16 and minority ownership in another 17. The 17 enterprises where
the State has minority ownership are mostly o f small size and most do not provide reliable data to the State.

           0   The most recent Government efforts at reforming PEShave been focused on a
               graduated approach, supported by the 2006 ERSG grant".                   This approach
               involved:    (i)proceeding with simple privatization transactions that don't
               require extensive preparatory work, and (ii)assisting the Government in
               conducting the preparatory work for more complex ones, in particular public
               utilities. As discussed above (Section     In),the Government hasmadeprogress
               in implementing its approach: it has liquidated several bankrupt enterprises,
               sold some public properties, re-launched bids for the sale o f Government
               shares in some enterprises and banks. The gains from privatization receipts to
               the central budget have been modest: 0.4 percent o f GDP in 2006 and an
               expected 0.5 percent o f GDP in 2007 and 2008. Also the Government, with
               the support from the EMSP project, has recently finalized studies o f the
               financial status o f seven major fully public enterprises (OTB, ONATEL,
               SOSUMO, REGIDESO, COTEBU, OCIBU and SRDI).

84.        Even this graduated approach to PE reforms seems optimistic in hindsight. In
post-conflict countries it takes time to undertake a proper preparation and evaluation o f
the various options to improve productivity in PES, including restructuring, contract
management,          private-public partnership,        or outright privatization,        and involve
Government and stakeholders in a decision making process leading to consensus on
reform measures. Moreover, the political economy implications o f these options need to
be considered explicitly.           The Government should consider a more systematic and
transparent approach to the reform o f the public enterprises. To start with, the
Government needs to strengthen the institutional framework to prepare, manage and
monitor the reform process. Therefore, it has launched a study that will analyze the
existing institutional capacity for public enterprise reform and that will include a related
action plan to strengthen said capacity. Launching this study i s a prior action for the
ERSG 11program. Secondly, the authorities need to have a better understanding o f the
financial status o f all 13 fully publicly owned enterprises to understand their potential
implicit and explicit risks to the central budget3' To follow on the study that analyzed
seven PES,the authorities intend to launch a financial study/audit o f the remaining six
fully publicly owned enterprises (Air Burundi, APB, ECOSAT, FIC, FOSIP and
OTRACO). Finalizing this second study i s an indicative trigger for ERSG111. Finally, as
the Government may decide to privatize some o f the PES,it should revise the current
outdated Privatization Law and adopt one that includes international best practices.
These activities can be supported through the EMSPproject as needed.


Agriculture

85.       Background. Agricultural sector growth has been slow and volatile in line with
the weak performances o f the predominant coffee sector, which provides direct income


29 In2005 some privatization transactions were launched but most either failed to attract bidders or were
temporarily interrupted by the new post-transition Government who was willing to reconsider the evaluation
o f assets and insome cases, the privatization strategy.
30Fromthe 16 fully publicly owned enterprises, one has disappeared (OPHAVET), another one is ina
liquidationprocess (BCC) while a third one (ONAPHA) i s currently ina privatizationprocess.


                                                    38

for 67 percent o f the households in the country. Resuming rural growth entails boosting
food production and enhancing coffee and other export crops' contributions to growth
both significantly and durably. Since the Arusha peace accord (2000), the Government
has given high priority to the promotion o f agricultural exports as a way to enhance
shared growth and debt sustainability. However, the effort has lacked consistency and
direction, and results have been modest to date. The coffee sector has a prominence in
these reforms due the subsector's dominant position in the economy and the need to
strengthenits competitiveness. The reform agenda also included targeted actions in the
tea and cotton sub-sectors. The three agendas included the following objectives: (i)
removing constraints associated with price policy and marketing in order to increase
returns to producers; (ii)  enhancing the legal, regulatory and institutional framework to
encourage incremental private investment ; (iii)    divesting the state's assets in order to
reduce the fiscal burden and bring in more effective and flexible management; (iv)
improving services to producers and processors to increase production and improve
quality; and (v) assuring continued access to requiredpurchased inputs. However, little
progress has beenmade yet inimplementingthese measures.

86.     IDA currently supports the rehabilitationo fdomestic agricultural markets through
the Burundi Agricultural Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land Management Project
(PRASAB), a US$35 million lending operation, granted in 2004. PRASAB seeks to
increase crop and livestock production and productivity, diversify farm income, support
farmers' organizations, and promote sustainable land use. IDA approved a supplemental
budget o f US$15 millions in 2008 to strengthen the project's results and help Burundi
scale up activities. Under the next CAS, a follow-on agricultural project i s programmed
to promote high value export crops such as coffee, tea and horticulture. Other donors
such as the European Union, FDA, USAID and Belgiumalso provide direct investments
inbothdomestic and export agriculturalmarkets.

87.     Given this background, the proposed ERSG series, building on the work
undertaken under the ERSG Igrant, focuses on continued practical measures to help the
Government develop, assess and implement state divestiture options inthe coffee sector,
the first source o f export revenues. The ERSG program will also follow the reform
progress in the tea sector, the second source o f export revenues. Proposed activities
under the ERSG IIfocus on coffee sector reforms, with the objective to help Government
o f Burundi overcome institutional and regulatory constraints preventing sector growth.

(0 Coffee

88.     Background and key issues.         Coffee i s the major export o f the country,
accounting for more than 70 percent o f export revenues and providing income to
approximately 800,000 people.       The Burundian coffee sector suffers from low and
declining coffee production and yields, aging plant stock, high intermediary costs, low
export prices and an inadequate incentive framework. Yields are approximately halfthose
inneighboring countries (200/250 grams per tree versus 450/500 grams pertree inKenya
for instance). Production dropped from 42,000 tons in the early 2000s to 6,000 tons in
2007-08, which i s one o f the country's historic lowest records, although part o f this i s due



                                           39

to cyclical fluctuation. The current market structure does not allow direct contracting, and
most production i s sold on the commodity market at relatively low prices. Fully-washed
coffee, which commands higher quality and premium prices than washed coffee, i s only
50 percent o f the production this year while it was more than 75 percent o f the production
since the washing stations were built in the nineties. Declining and volatile production
also affects buyers' perceptions o f the reliability o f Burundi as a supplier, and therefore
further reduces prices. Inefficient intermediation under the present ownership structure
and marketingrules further increase costs and reduce returns to producers.

89.      Increasing the coffee sector competitiveness and diversifjmg export risks and
revenues will necessitate improved competitiveness inthe commodity market and a focus
on high value-added cultures, which has a better potential to increase the share o f
revenues benefiting the most vulnerable3'. Required investments in market intelligence
andmore productiveplant stock are at present constrained by institutional and regulatory
conditions that depress returns to producers and discourage potential investors and
foreign trading partners.

90.      Despite significant public attention to reforms in the coffee sector, little practical
change has beenaccomplished to date. Government still owns most o f the sector's assets
(133 washing stations, and two large dry mills factories), which have operated since the
early nineties by local entrepreneurs (SOGESTAL and SODECO), under a lease
agreement. Reforms o f the sector resumed in2005 - after a longhiatus related to the civil
war - with the adoption o f a presidential decree to liberalize price setting and marketing
activities, to reduce taxes on orchards, and to remove state guarantees for financing the
sector. Several key studies were undertaken (see annex) and in March 2006 the Coffee
Reform Steering Committee was created. The Government adopted a sectoral action plan
inNovember 2006 that included developing a strategy for the privatization or divestiture
o f 133 washing stations as a key reform measure. However, development o f this strategy
has experienced a long delay. In May 2007, the President o f the Republic declared that
coffee producers were owners o f the coffee bean (cherry and green). This latter step was
an important confirmation o f the right o f producers to undertake their own decisions
regarding marketing, but its import was poorly understood.                          Lack o f clarity was
compounded by the Government's decision in 2007 to fix prices and contract all
externally marketed fully-washed coffee to a single foreign buyer. It i s therefore
important to clarify the implications o f the President's declaration and to spell out
subsequent changes in roles and responsibilities inthe sector. Rules governing campaign
preparation, marketing, and exportation must be clarified urgently. Key issues to address
are: (i)  are the producer organizations representative and effective; (ii)                  whether these
producer organizations have to pre-finance the coffee campaign now (to pay for input
provision, etc.) and if so, how, given their absent credit history; (iii) can they reach
                                                                                      how



31Two studies were performedas background work for the study on the sources o f rural growth in Burundi.
The first study assessed the potential to develop productionand sales o f specialty coffee from Burundi
(Integrative Report inSupport o f the BurundiCoffee Value Chain Diagnostic and Strategy Development,
MSU,February2007), while the second studyidentifiedcandidates for fast-tracking privatizationpilots
(BurundiCoffee pilot selectionandplanning, MSU,June 2007)

the markets (commodity and specialty) at the best possible price; (iv) what are the
consequences on coffee price setting (how do they share international market prices with
other stakeholders o f the sector, who provides them with wet and dry mill services,
extension, rural road maintenance, etc.).     Eventually, any actual changes in business
conduct induced by the May 2007 presidentialmedia statement should be reflected inthe
legal and regulatory framework.

91,     Reinvigorating the coffee production and introducing high value added culture
call for reforms that invoke complex issues o f political economy.             In addition,
uncertainties regarding practical modalities to implement the Government's intentions
remain.    For example, the decision to divest o f the coffee washing stations requires
determination o f the method o f divestiture; e.g., sale to prospective buyers, transfer to
producer organizations, or other approach. Which approach i s preferred i s in part an
empirical question, and requires determination o f the existence o f potential buyers,
reservation prices, and (in the alternative approach o f transfer to producer organizations)
an assessment o f needs for enhanced capacity for producer organizations. Moreover,
once decisions are made regarding the modality o f divestiture, new arrangements to
assure continued financing o f purchased inputs must be put in place that are consistent
with the new ownership structure ofthe processing sector.

92.     Inlight of the above, the ERSGseries will help Government of Burundiidentify
and assess alternative options for the ownership structure, organization and regulatory
framework, to improve the competitiveness and profitability o f the coffee sector, with
particular emphasis on a sustainable increase inreturns to producers. Ina first critical step
the government has issued in April 2008 a new regulation for commercialization of the
green coffee for the 2008-2009 season to stakeholders in the coffee sector elaborating on
the implications o f the May 2007 Presidential declaration for marketing options. This
regulation has been advertised widely in French and Kirundi in the national media to
inform producers and other stakeholders o f the different marketing options available to
them, such as direct sale to buyers. Issuance of this regulationwas a prior action for the
ERSG 11program. A second critical step is to explore divestiture options based on the
specificities o f the Burundian coffee sector. Undertaking this divestiture study, managing
public consultations on the options suggestedby the study, and adopting an option and a
related actionplanconstitute an indicative trigger for ERSG111.

93.     These reforms are part o f a comprehensive coffee sector reform process which i s
receiving support from the EMSP project. They are expected to lead to the
implementation o f the state divestiture option with the best potential to increase the
sector's competitiveness and producers revenues. The coffee sector reform action plan
would entail strengthening the leadership provided by the Coffee Reform Committee and
clarifying its mandate, enriching public information and understanding, and addressing
practical bottlenecks to change inthe ownership structure and regulatory framework.

(io Tea

94.       Background and key issues. Tea i s the second largest agricultural export after
coffee. Between 2001 and 2006, average tea production amounted to 7,500 tons. Two
thirds were producedby smallholder^^^. The average earning for a Burundian tea grower
in 2006 was about US$46. Most production, transformation, trade, marketing, and
regulatory aspects o f the industry are handled by the parastatal Office du ThC du Burundi
(OTB). Despite changing world market conditions such as declining prices, demand for
quality differentiation, and competition from man-made beverages (especially soft
drinks), and the structure o f Burundi's tea industryhas remainedlargely unchanged since
its inception. The sector faces numerous constraints, including structural inefficiencies o f
the tea factories and plantations, poor incentives to smallholders and estate laborers,
limited use o f inputs and extension services, and non-existent research. These constraints
have led to a considerable decline in the quality and the price o f Burundian tea. For
example, during 2005 and 2006, Burundian tea was traded with a 30 percent discount
over Kenyantea at the Mombasatea auction where most East African tea i s traded.

95.        To improve the income earning capacity o f the Burundi tea growers, reforms in
the tea sector should address constraints to profitability, competitiveness, and the ability
o f the industry to innovate in response to new opportunities. The reform program will
include five main activities.         A financial and technical audit o f OTB is necessary to
identify clusters o f assets that can be divested as units, and assets that should be closed to
reduce excess capacity and improve profitability. A time-bound plan for divestiture and
modality o f proceeding should be developed.                 Prior to divestiture and while divestiture
i s being planned, outsource management o f the asset clusters.                        Clarify formula for
division o f net revenues (after subtraction o f the management fee) between and among
actors in the industry (separately for those working in and with state farms, and
smallholders).       It is also necessary to identify residual functions o f OTB and assess
capacity to fulfill them. Finally, depending on the industry structure selected (e.g., fully
competitive, territorial concessions, regulated monopoly, or other) identify the set o f
complementary regulations required to facilitate good performance o f the structure, and
the entity or entities responsible for undertaking the regulation.                      These reforms are
discussed inmore detail inthe appendix.

96.        Inbalancingthe low nationalimplementationcapacity, the needto keep the ERSG
11grant focused and the need for structural reforms inthe tea subsector, the program will
closely follow a number o f recommended actions to reform the subsector as part o f the
preparatory work for ERSG III.The ERSG111grant will consider the possibility o f fuller
engagement inthe reforms o f this subsector.




32 Tea i s produced infive regions by estates and smallholders. Average green leaf yields were about 4.0
tons per hectare for the smallholders compared to 4.8 tons per hectare for the factory estates. Yields o f
made tea (the finished product) o f one ton per hectare are less than halfo f the regional well runplantations.
Inaddition to their sub-standard equipment, Burundi's tea factories are using only 41% o ftheir installed
capacity compared to 70% for competing producers.

                                     POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

97.       The proposed ERSG series is expected to have likely and significant impact on
poverty.

98.       Improvementsinthe management o f scarce public resources are expected to make
more resources available to finance PRSP priorities and to achieve the Government
poverty reduction objectives. The PEMFAR provides indicative results by simulating the
impact o f fiscal consolidation (debt relief) and changes to the level and the composition
o f public expenditure on real growth and poverty in Burundi in the medium-term (2008-
2015). A baseline simulation based on increasing real GDP per capita from 1.3 percent in
2007 to an average 1.6 percent between 2008 and 2015 leads to a large drop in poverty
rate (from 66.9 percent to 44.8 percent) by 2015. Several policy alternatives are analyzed
and the simulation results suggest that the composition o f public expenditures has a large
impact on economic growth and poverty.33 For instance, increasing the share o f capital
expenditure financed by external assistance by four percentage points between 2008 and
2012 will lead to the poverty rate falling from the baseline poverty incidence o f 44.8
percent to 18.2 percent by 2015, as real GDP per capita rises34. Likewise, reducing the
wage billby 1.5 percentage points o f GDP in2009 inrelation to the baseline scenario will
reduce poverty by 17.5 percentage points below the baseline rate. On the other hand, the
impact on poverty o f a budget neutral reallocation o f spending from recurrent
expenditures to capital expenditures i s lower: poverty rates fall by 15.8 percentage points
inrelationto baseline rates.

99.       Public enterprise reforms are in a process o f policy formulation. In reviewing
options for state or private ownership o f the public enterprise portfolio the Government
will be encouraged to weigh economic, poverty, and social benefits on the basis o f the
studies o f individual enterprises.

100.      Business climate reforms are expected to have long-term positive growth and
poverty implications. Given that ESRG I1focuses on administrative measures to facilitate
business registration,          court proceedings, and investor protection, no significant
distributional implications are expected from these measures.

101.      Inthe long run, the coffee sector reforms aim at accelerating growth and more
specifically increasing producers' production factors and income.                          Following the
monopoly marketing arrangement for sale o f coffee set up in 2007 by the authorities, the
adoption of a regulation to commercialize green coffee for the 2008-2009 coffee season, a
prior action for the ERSG 11, i s intendedto clarify the different marketing arrangements
available to producers, including the option o f directly selling to foreign buyers, and to


33The five policy alternatives are: (i) increase inpublic investment financed by aid; (ii)budget-neutral
                                         an                                                 a
reallocation o f spending from other recurrent expenditures to capital expenditures; (iii)
                                                                                         a reduction o f debt;
(iv) a total forgiveness o f foreign debt; and (v) a reduction inwages and salaries.
34Based on an assumed growth-poverty elasticity o f -0.5, poverty will fall by 5.2 percent.



                                                      43

avoid monopoly trading by coffee washers. By clarifying these options, which leave the
current institutional arrangements inplace, it i s hoped that producers would benefit from
more competitive market conditions, selling at higher prices and therefore earning a
higher income. Thus, the regulations would give farmers additional options and better
prices for selling their crop, and thus are not likelyto have significant negative impact on
poverty or income distribution.         The ERSG 111 will support the identification o f
divestiture options and adoption o f an action plan for the chosen option during 2008. The
identification o f divestiture options will be through undertaking due diligence studies
(financial, judicial, regulatory, institutional and environmental, evaluation o f enterprises
and marketing) as well as developing and presenting different divestiture options to the
authorities. The options presented will be developed in consultation with the
stakeholders, especially coffee producers, to ensure that the interests o fthe majority o f the
actors in the coffee sector are taken into account. The authorities, in turn will decide
about the appropriate divestiture option after extensive national consultation. Review o f
the options will include a review o f the likely poverty and social implications o f reform
options.

                    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                       AND

 102.   Monitoring and evaluation arrangements will continue to rely on Government
arrangements with the aim o f strengthening Government capacity and institutions, with
particular attention to the regularity and quality o f the M&E process and its outcomes.
Discussions with the national partners and the working arrangements during the pre-
appraisal mission have led to the development o f the following national M&E structure
(see figure below). Sector or subject specific technical units who work on the details o f
the reform program (including prior actions and triggers) feed information to the
Coordinating Technical Unit, which includes a representative from REFES. REFES i s
the technical committee that follows up the progress in the implementation o f the PRSP
as well as the global reform programs o f the State, provides regular progress reports to
national policy makers (such as the second vice presidency and the inter-ministerial
committee for the follow up o f the reforms located at the second vice presidency), and
seek policy guidance. Strengthening the institutional and technical capacity o f REFES
would endow both the Government anddonors with a better M&E system.

103.    The Coordinating Technical Unit in turn reports to the Policy Committee,
mandated by the Second Vice-presidential and presided by the Minister o f Economy,
Finances and Cooperation for Development.               This Policy Committee includes
representation by different relevant ministries and representation by the second Vice-
Presidency. This Comittee supervises         the implementation o f the economic reforms
included in ERSG I1 and will supervise the development and implementation o f the
ERSGIIIreform program (see figure below).

104.    The M&E structure takes into account the scope o f the proposed reform in each
sector or area in defining the nature and complexity o f the national intervention. The
existing technical units at the MEFCD and Ministry o f Commerce remain primary
interlocutors for the development and follow up o f reform program in PFM and PSD.



                                            44

The technical unit at the Ministry o f Commerce i s complemented by representatives from
other relevant ministries (such as the Vice Minister o f Planning and MEFCD) to ensure
inter-ministerial coordination and development o f a unified vision for the PSD reforms
and their expected outcome. For coffee and the reform o f the public enterprises, the
contact for technical monitoring and evaluationi s directly with the related institution.

105.   IDA will work closely with the Government and other international partners
within the Cadre dePartenariat to monitor the reform agendaunder the proposed grant.

                                         FIDUCIARY     ASPECTS

106.     Like many low-income countries, Burundi's financial management systems suffer
from serious weaknesses in budget formulation and execution, financial reporting,
procurement and oversight systems. There i s also typically a weak linkage between
agreed policies, budget planning and execution. Inthe case o f Burundi, the destruction o f
relevant institutions and humanresource base during the years o f conflict has contributed
to these fiduciary risks.          The provision o f budget support is acceptable if clear
expenditure priorities and a strong Government commitment for addressing institutional
weaknesses reduce the risk to an acceptable level relative to expected benefits. Budget
support should help strengthen partner countries' public financial management systems,
including transparency and accountability. Improvements in this area are both a
precondition for, and objective o f the proposed ERSG 11.

107.     The authorities have made significant progress in the past few years to improve
management o f the public resources and to mitigate fiduciary risks. These mitigating
measures include measures to improve transparency o f the budget process (revision o f the
organic finance law, adoption o f a new budget classification, the creation o f an interim
computerized financial management information system (SIGEFI) for the 2006 budget
and subsequent years, production o f quarterly budget execution results) and to control
expenditures and expenditure processes (establishment o f an audit court, publication o f
the first audit o fbudget execution, audits o f the treasury). The Government is committed
to implementing additional reforms and i s preparing an integrated medium-term reform
action plan, on the basis o f the PEMFAR, covering the legal framework, budget
formulation, budget execution, public procurement, financial management and reporting,
internal control and audit, external oversight, and control over the wage bill.

108.     The Burundian authorities also have repeatedly stated their commitment to fight
corruption, and have asked for Bank support in designing an anti-corruption strategy.
Furthermore, they have taken swift action when governance issues have arisen. For
instance, they acted swiftly to adopt mitigating measures related to the sale o f the
presidential airplane, including: undertaking an external audit o f the sale and adopting a
related action plan in September 2007.35 Similarly, in the aftermath o f the Interpetrol
affair, the authorities once again acted swiftly by undertaking an audit, taking legal
measures and agreeing to a program o f action to improve the governance o f public
resource management.




35 The action plan includes development and adoption o f a law on sales o f public goods and establishment
o f a Parliamentary commission to pursue the investigation and identify the responsible individuals. A
technical group has already been formed to develop a draft o f the law and the Parliamentary commission
has also been created in September 2007.
36 The program included: (i) conduct an external audit o f the arrears in the petroleum sector; (ii) the
                              to                                                                     in
short term, to agree on an action program to close the loopholes so that such payments cannot recur in the
future (including revisions to the Organic Law (Loi Organique) and the 2008 budget law); and (iii)   inthe
medium term, to strengthen the accountability and transparency o f public spending by implementing the
reforms proposed in the PEMFAR, which is currently under preparation, and would be supported by the
proposed ERSG I1grant and other international partners.

                                                    47

109.    Key fiduciary risks and risks mitigation measures have been identified in the
PEMFAR under finalization and the draft Program Document for the proposed ERSG11
continues to address the status o f fiduciary assessments and the risk mitigation measures
(see details inAnnex 2) as was the case for the precedent operation (ERSG).

110.    The proposed operation treats public financial management reforms inBurundias
a priority area and improving public expenditure management and its impact on the poor
i s a major component. Inparticular: (i) assessment o f the fiduciary environment o f the
                                         an
country i s included, based on the 2004 CFAA and the PEMFAR; (ii) policy matrix
                                                                          the
reflects actions that constitute a sound strategy to improve public financial management
and lower fiduciary risks in Burundi; (iii)  technical support to implement this financial
management reform agenda and capacity building in this area i s provided by IDA
Economic Management Support Project (EMSP) approved in 2003; and (iv) the funds
flow arrangements have been adequately described, including the disbursement
procedures to be followed and the modalities to be adopted.

111. The IMF completed a safeguards assessment o f the Burundi Central Bank (BRB)
in January 2006, and reported that the BRB was committed to improving financial
reporting procedures and strengtheningits system o f internal control. However, IDA was
unable to obtain a copy o f the report. Furthermore, the governor o f the BRB was accused
o f being involved in the Interpetrol scandal referred to in the governance section above,
which evidenced weak controls over payments made by the BRB. The governor i s
currently under arrest awaiting further legal proceedings. These two developments
constitute sufficient grounds to request additional steps needed to secure acceptable
fiduciary arrangements for development policy lending. Given the circumstances,
appropriate additional steps would involve the setting-up o f a dedicated account in the
BRB. IDAreserves the right to request an annual audit o fthe dedicated account.

112.    These actions are sufficient to ensure the operation will support the mitigation o f
fiduciary risks related to the management o f public funds, particularly the support the
operation lends to the long term strategy for public expenditure management reform.
Recent public financial management improvements and the strong Government
commitment to improving governance as demonstrated by the recent actions taken inthis
area are encouraging.

                              DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                                                AND

113.     A single-tranche of SDR 18.5 million (US$30 million equivalent) will be
disbursed upon effectiveness.    The proposed grant will follow the Bank's disbursement
procedures for development policy operations. Grant proceeds will be disbursedagainst
satisfactory implementation o fthe development policyprogram.

114.    Once the Grant i s approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f
the Grant will be deposited at the request o f the Recipient by IDA ina DedicatedForeign
Currency Deposit Account (DFCDA) designated by the Recipient at the Central Bank
(Banque de la Rkpublique du Burundi, BRB) and forming part o f the official reserves o f
Burundi. Within a week, the BRB will credit the local currency (Burundi Franc)
equivalent o f the Grant proceeds to the Government Treasury account. The BRB will not
impose any charges or commissions on the Government for these transactions. The
                                           48

conversion from United States Dollar to Burundi franc will be based on the prevailing
exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the Treasury Account. The
Government will be requiredto provide confirmation to IDA that an amount equivalent to
the grant proceeds from the IDA has been credited to the Treasury Account, with an
indication o f the exchange rate applied and the date o f the transfer. IDA reserves the right
to request an annual audit o f the DFCDA. If the proceeds o f the grant are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Grant Agreement, IDA will require,
promptly upon notice from IDA, the Recipient to refund an amount equal to the amount
o f said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be
cancelled. The administration o f this grant will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Economy, Finance and Cooperation for Development.

                                ENVIRONMENTAL     ASPECTS

115.    The proposed ERSG 11focuses primarily on institutional reforms, which are not
expected to have likely and significant effects on Burundi's environment, forests, and
other natural resources. The agricultural reforms that will be undertaken once the studies
on divestiture options are finalized (in December 2008), may have environmental effects.
The reform aims at increasing the share o f producers in the border price and increasing
boththe production and quality o f coffee. The increase inproduction i s expected to come
from an improvement inthe current extremely low productivity and more efficient use o f
land not through clearing o f forests, nor extending cropping into marginal lands and
commons. To build sufficient analytic knowledge under the program for follow-on
operations, the terms of reference o f the studies on divestiture options for the coffee
sector take into account the environmental aspects.          In addition, in order to fully
understand the potential environmental consequences o f such a reform and suggest
mitigating measures when needed, a coffee sector environmental assessment will be
undertaken.

Regulatory and Institutional Framework

116.    Environmental management and natural resources management institutions have
developed slowly in Burundi since the creation o f the Ministry o f Environment, Land
Management and Tourism in 1989. Today it i s called Ministry o f Environment, Land
Management and Public Works. This ministry has the responsibility o f planning,
coordinating, implementing and monitoring all activities and actions related to the
environment. In a bid to improve and facilitate coordination and collaboration o f all
ministries with activities related to the environment, the Government set up a National
Commission for Environment. This Commission has representatives o f line ministries
which include environmental matters and the Environment Directorate o f the Ministryo f
Environment, LandManagement and Public Works i s the secretariat o f this commission.

117.    In June 2000, the country adopted an environmental code (Code de
1'Environnement) that places environmental impact assessment (EIA) at the heart o f
Government efforts towards achieving the goals o f sustainable development. The
environment directorate at the ministry i s responsible for reviewing and approving EIAs.
The capacity o f the directorate to review, monitor and enforce compliance with national
environmental regulations i s weak. This i s compounded with the fact that, since the

                                          49

adoption o f the code, there has not been any procedural guidelines on how to prepare
EIAs. Other legal and policy frameworks include Land Code (Code foncier), Forestry
Code (Code forestier), Mining and Petroleum Code (Code minier et petrolier).
Implementationo f these different codes has beenweak due mainlyto staffing and funding
concerns. Plans are underway to review these codes.

EnvironmentalPolicyImplementation

118.     In 1996, the country prepared and adopted a National Environmental Strategy,
which highlights the focus o f the Government in the area o f environment and natural
resource management. Acknowledging the fact that there i s limitedinstitutional capability
at the environment directorate, the ministry assessed the need to strengthen the national
capacity to comply with national environmental regulations as well as to monitor and
effectively enforce compliance with environment regulations. After consultations with
donors, a five year action plan was prepared and adopted inJanuary 2006. The actionplan
i s based on four global objectives: (i) promotion o f coordinated management o f the
                                            the
environment; (ii)   the sustainable management o f land, water, forest and the atmosphere;
(iii) conservationofnaturalhabitatsandbiologicaldiversityand;(iv)thepromotion
     the
o f the tourism sector. On each o f these objectives, the action plan specifies the activities
to be put inplace, the performance indicators, the responsible institutions, the budget and
calendar. The authorities are seeking funding from the international community for most
o f activities elaborated inthe action plan.

                                R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

119.     Despite the commitment o f the Government which remains unequivocally strong,
especially at the highest level, the years o f civil conflict have accentuated the weak
technical capacity and sub-optimal institutional and organizational arrangements. As a
result, the expected outcomes o f the proposed ERSGI1are subject to a number o f risks.
These risks are mitigated to a large extent by several factors, including: (i) design o f
                                                                               the
the proposed operation; (ii) strengtho fthe Government's ownership and commitment,
                              the
affirmed at the highest level, to implement the proposed measures and the Government's
resolve to advance its reform agenda; (iii)      an active and continuous policy dialogue
between the Bank and the Government; and (iv) a close collaboration betweendonors to
provide technical assistance and ensure full financing o f the reform program.

120.     The main risks are the following:

         First,Burundi is apost-conflict country with a longhistory of ethnic conflict and a
         fragile political stability that has had deleterious effects on economic growth,
         poverty reduction and the pace o f implementation o f the reforms. The new and
         more representative Government taking power in November 2007 will help
         mitigate this risk. Also in early 2008, the FNL-PALIPEHUTU, the last rebel
         group, announced its intention to return to the peace negotiations, which are
         expected to re-start in the first quarter o f the year. The Bank will continue to
         encourage the authorities to finalize negotiations with FNL-PALIPEHUTU to
         reap the full socio-economic rewards o fpeace.


                                              50

0 Second, there i s the risk o f the macroeconomic program going off track. The
  performance of the dominant agricultural sector and external shocks affect
  economic growth and overall macroeconomic performance. Many o f the public
  enterprises are inpoor financial shape and can have serious impact on the central
  budget in terms o f direct and contingent liabilities. Also, the combined impact o f
  recent increases infuel and food prices on the 2008 budget are estimated to leadto
  an additional financial need of FBu 11billion (or about 1.1percent o f GDP). The
  recent increases in the prices o f food and oil are believed to be medium term
  phenomena and are expected to affect the poor in Burundi due to the increased
  costs o f transportation and imported foods. These impacts are expected to be
  mitigated by recent government policies, such as reducing tariffs on diesel imports
  (from 12 percent to 9 percent) which has a higher direct impact as it i s used by
  poorer households. To reduce the risk, IDA, the Fund and other development
  partners will work closely with the Government to help in monitoring
  macroeconomic performance and in taking corrective actions in a timely manner.
  Also, IDA already has a successful agricultural project (Agriculture Rehabilitation
  and Sustainable Land Management - PRASAB) to support food production in
  Burundi, which is being given an US$15 million in additional funding inFY08.
  The new CAS also includes further support o f the agricultural sector in the form
  o f a follow-on project.


0 Third, there is also a risk that even if the macroeconomic program is in place,
  structural measures are not implemented in time. This risk has been partially
  mitigated by the resumption o f the Parliamentary activities, allowing approval o f
  long delayed legislations related to the reform program.             Furthermore, the
  commitment to reforms at the highest levels i s highlightedby the recent creation
  o f the Ministry o f Good Governance, Privatization, General State Inspectorate and
  Local Administration. This ministry i s directly attached to the Office of the
  President o f the Republic.


0 Fourth, as discussed earlier, there i s a high risk of debt distress, even after HIPC
  completion point and MDRI assistance mainly due to the low export base o f the
  country. The Government will need to ensure more concessional borrowing, and
  foster continued economic and export growth to avoid substantial risks o f debt
  distress. Inthe mediumterm the diversification o f the economy - a main objective
  o f the authorities and the proposed ERSG program - will mitigate the
  vulnerability o f the economy and the Government's management capacity to
  natural shocks.


0 Fifth, as a landlocked country, Burundi faces increased risks associated with its
  dependence on neighboring countries for its trade routes. For instance the recent
  unrest in Kenya limited the import o f petroleum products to Burundi and put
  upward pressure on their prices. The authorities have joined the EAC in July
  2007 to cement regional cooperation and peace building, reduce potential risks
  and create further economic opportunities through integration.               Already,
  prospective regional programs and projects (such as a regional telecoms project,



                                     51

       the Burundi-Tanzaniaroad and the Burundi-Rwanda-Tanzaniarailroad) signal the
       promise o f improved and cheaper infrastructure services.


   0   Sixth, Burundi is highly dependent on aid inflows and any difficulty in
       maintaining budget support or delays in mobilizing such support can derail fiscal
       performance, affect the ability o f the authorities to manage budgetary processes
       effectively and potentially destabilize the country.      Aid pledges for 2007 are
       expected to meet projected financial requirements(FBu251.3 billion) and consist
       largely o f external grants; the financing gap in the following years i s likely to be
       covered by additional bilateral and multilateral assistance. The staff will work
       closely with the authorities to improve and regularize the existing donor
       coordination framework (Cadre de Partenariat).

   0   Seventh, the recent governance scandals indicate that economic governance
       remains challenging and a source of continued risk. The proposed grant i s
       attempting to mitigate this risk by helping the authorities reform public finance
       management and increase transparency and rule o f law in the business
       environment. Moreover, the authorities have agreed to work with IDA and other
       donors to improve public financial management (PFM) systems. Inthat context, a
       public expenditure management and financial accountability review (PEMFAR)
       co-prepared with a national counterpart team is being finalized and will serve as a
       key inputto the authorities' PFMreform actionplan.

   0   Eighth, there is a risk that the Government will struggle with lack o f technical
       capacity for the implementation o f the reforms supported by the proposed grant.
       To ensure that this risk i s mitigated the proposed grant i s being developed inclose
       coordination with the EMSP technical assistance project, which i s geared to
       provide technical assistance and capacity building in PFM and PSD to the
       authorities.

121.   As a result o f the above risks, the Bank faces reputational risks in supporting
programs in post-conflict country, especially as regards political instability that leads to
substantial delays in reform implementation and governance issues. However, it should
be noted that inthe context of Burundi, the cost o f the Bank not gettinginvolved will be
higher than these reputational risks. To mitigate these risks, the team will work closely
with the authorities to ensure that (i) simplified and realistic measures are included inthe
program and (ii)governance measures are implemented, especially in public finance
management.

                          I. INTRODUCTION             GENERALE

1.      L e Gouvernement sollicite un appui de 1'IDA pour soutenir son programme des
reformes economiques de la periode 2008-2009 qui visent l'ajustement et la stabilisation
macrokconomique ainsi que la mise en Oeuvre des reformes structurelles pour la reduction
de la pauvrete a travers la consolidation des progrbs deja realises dans la cadre des
reformes de la gestion des finances publiques et de la promotion de l'environnement des
affaires du DARE II.L a presente lettre de politique resume le contexte social et
l'evolution recente de l'economie. Elle decrit les politiques que le Gouvernement entend
poursuivre dans les domaines concernant (i)    l'elaboration d'un cadre strategique de lutte
contre la pauvrete (CSLP); (ii) mise en Oeuvre des politiques pour le developpement du
                                 la
secteur prive et principalement le developpement du secteur cafe; iii)les reformes visant
l'amelioration de la gestion des depenses publiques.


2.      L e programme du Gouvernement, enonce dans le CSLP vise a assurer la transition
d'une Cconomie de post-conflit vers une situation de croissance economique et de
developpement. L e CSLP a donc pour objectif le renforcement de la stabilite politique, la
consolidation de la paix et la reduction de la pauvrete a travers une acceleration de la
croissance Cconomique durable et equitable. Les principaux axes strategiques du CSLP
sont les suivants: (i)  l'amelioration de la gouvernance et la securite, (ii) promotion
                                                                               la
d'une croissance Cconomique durable et equitable, (iii)le developpement du capital
humain et (iv) la lutte contre le V M / SIDA. Des progrbs ont et6 rtalises dans les quatre
domaines.


3.      L a mise en Oeuvre satisfaisante des rkformes deja engagkes a permis le
rktablissement des equilibres financiers qu'il convient de consolider. La decision des
conseils d'administration de 1'IDA et du FMI approuvant en aoQt 2005 l'eligibilite du
Burundia l'initiative PPTE en est une preuve eclatante. Pendant la pkriode de transition,
l e Gouvernement a enregistre des progres en matiere de reformes qu'il entend poursuivre
en vue d'accelerer la croissance et assurer l'irreversibilite des politiques deja mise en
Oeuvre. Cela permettra au Gouvernement duBurundid'acceder au point d'Achevement de
l'hitiative PPTE attendu en Decembre 2008.

4.      Toutefois, ces resultats ne doivent pas occulter le constat que notre Cconomie est
encore confrontee A de nombreux defis et qu'il existe d'importantes opportunites que le
Burundi devrait saisir en vue de l'amelioration de l'environnement kconomique, la
modernisation de l'outil de production et son positionnement sur le marche international.
Les sources de croissance actuelles sont l e fait du secteur agricole, essentiellement les
filibres exportatrices telles que le Cafe, le Coton et le The. Les autorites pensent que les
reformes a engager dans ces filibres agricoles permettront d'assurer une expansion du
secteur agricole avec: (i)une contribution accrue a la croissance; (ii)des revenus
importants pour les producteurs agricoles et notamment ceux du milieurural.


5.      L e Burundi sollicite aussi d'autres contributions des bailleurs de fonds dans la
realisation de ce programme et aura besoin d'un cadre de reference pour une politique
harmonisee des bailleurs de fonds. A cet kgard, le Gouvernement souhaite obtenir une

                                              56

coordination plus accrue de 1'IDA et l'adhesion de l'ensemble des partenaires financiers
autour du CSLP dont le premier rapport d'kvaluation est a la phase de rkdaction et sera
disponible au mois de Juillet 2008.


6.      La presente lettre traduit le programme du Gouvemement en matike des rkformes
sur les deux prochaines annees, mais elle presente aussi les indicateurs de performance
qui permettront de juger de la qualitk de sa mise en ceuvre. Conscients des difficultes
inhkrentes aux reformes economiques et fortes de l'expkrience du pass&, les autorites
entendent impliquer judicieusement tous les acteurs en vue de rechercher l'adhesion
necessaire A la reussite de toute reforme ayant des implications socio-economiques.

              11.     DEVELOPPEMENTSECONOMIQUESRECENTS

7.      Durant la periode 2001-2006, la performance Cconomique du Burundi s'est
sensiblement amklioree; cependant le taux de croissance annuel moyen demeure faible
(aux alentours de 3.2 %) du fait notamment des fluctuations cycliques de la production
agricole. Au cours des six dernibres annees, le Gouvemement a restructure les depenses
publiques, augmentant la part des crkdits affect& A l'kducation, a la santk et aux
infrastructures et doublant les dkpenses d'investissement. Neanmoins, pour accelerer la
croissance et reduire la pauvrete, le Burundi doit relever plusieurs dkfis : diversifier la
production agricole et la structure de l'economie, accroitre la productivitk de l'agriculture
et investir dans l e dkveloppement des ressources humaines et les infrastructures.

8.      Jusqu'en 2006, la structure de l'economie restait dominee par l'agriculture (48,4%
du PIB), suivie des services (35,2% du PIB) et de l'industrie (16,4% du PIB).
L'agriculture demeure le principal secteur economique aussi bien de par sa contribution
au PIB qu'en tennes de nombre d'emploi que ce secteur gknke en dkpit d'une baisse
relative de sa contribution au PIB causee par une faible productivitk et les effets des
conditions climatiques et les episodes de plusieurs annkes de guerre civile. Les
exportations agricoles en particulier le cafe, representent plus de 60% des recettes
d'exportation. L a contribution du secteur des services n'a cesse d'augmenter au cours des
demibres annees. Le secteur industriela connu une lkgbre augmentation qui pourrait Stre
attribuee principalement a unregain d'activite dans le domaine des constructions.


9.      L a consolidation du processus de paix a contribue a relancer le processus de
reconstruction nationale, et cr& des perspectives positives pour le pays. Depuis l'an
2000, le pays a progressivement rkcupere de sa croissance economique negative (-1,8%
en moyenne) de la decennie caracterisee par des problemes politiques et economiques,
pour se situer a untaux de croissance economique positif de 5,1% en 2006. L a croissance
economique est largement influencee par la forte volatilite du secteur agricole. Alors
qu'en 2004, la croissance du PIB rkel avait atteint 4,8%, une grave secheresse en 2005 a
conduit A une croissance du PIB reel estime A 0,9%, avant de revenir a 5,1% en 2006.
Selon les statistiques provisoires, la croissance tconomique delle pour 2007 a connue
une legere augmentation (a 3,6%) et moins forte que celle de l'annee prkckdente, malgre
l'accroissement des dkpenses en capital principalement financees par les appuis des
bailleurs de fonds. Cette contre performance est due A une mauvaise recolte agricole.


                                             57

10.     L e taux d'inflation, mesure par l'indice des prix a la consommation, a atteint une
moyenne de 7.2% par an de 2001 a 2006. Cette moyenne cache des fluctuations
considerables avec un pic de 13.6% en 2004 et un minimum de 2.7% en 2006. Les
ajustements des prix administrks qui ont eu lieu fin 2007, de mCme que le
rencherissement recent des denrees alimentaires et la desorganisation de l'offfe
d'importations imputable aux difficultes que le Kenya a connues apres les elections, ont
exacerbe la hausse des prix a la consommation, qui a et6 portee a 14'7% en glissement
mensuelfin 2007 -contre unobjectif d'inflation a unchiffre. Le taux moyend'inflation
A fin dkcembre 2007 Ctait de 8.3%. A moyen terme, on prevoit que le taux d'inflation
restera inferieur A lo%, grkce  au recours limite au credit bancaire pour le financement des
depenses publiques. L'indice des prix a la consommation est calcule a partir d'un panier
de biens de consommation - base sur les prix pratiques sur le march6 central de
Bujumbura - qui n'a pas ete modifie depuis 1991. Une enquCte sur la consommation des
menages est envisagee ; elle devrait permettre de modifier le panier utilise pour le calcul
de l'indice.

11.     Les resultats sur le plan de la politique budgktaire en 2005-06 ont kt6 satisfaisants.
Le programme du Gouvemement pour 2007 avait pour but de poursuivre la stabilisation
macro-economique, de surmonter les retards dans l'application de certaines rkformes
structurelles, et continuer le renforcement de la gestion des finances publiques. L a loi de
finances 2007 a continue de reorienter les depenses publiques vers les depenses de
reduction de la pauvrete tout en contenant le deficit budgktaire (hors dons). Le contr8le de
la masse salariale (10,6% du PIB en 2007) et la demobilisation continuent d'Ctre parmi les
priorites du Gouvemement. L a demobilisation et les reformes du secteur de la sCcuritC
devront continuer afin qu'une reorientation des dkpenses publiques des secteurs de
securite vers les secteurs sociaux (et pro-pauvres) soit possible.

12.     L a performance budgetaire de 2007 en deqa des attentes s'explique par le
ralentissement du processus de demobilisation. D e plus, la rupture des pourparlers de
paix avec le demier groupe rebelle (FNL) a aussi contribue au ralentissement du
processus de demobilisation, ce qui a conduit A une masse salariale relative au PIB plus
grande que prevue. L e besoin de financement budgktaire a conduit le Gouvemement a
prendre des mesures compensatoires telles que l'augmentation de certains imp8ts' la
reduction de certaines depenses nonprioritaires et le report de l'augmentation des salaires
de prestations A la fonction publique pour 2008. Nearnoins, le deficit budgetaire (hors
dons) devrait atteindre 22'4% du PIB en 2007 (comparativement          a 19'4% du     PIB en
2006), A la suite d'une augmentation des depenses publiques de 38,4% du PIB en 2006 a
40'5% en 2007.

13.     La position exterieure du Burundi est restee compatible avec les objectifs du
programme du FMI en 2007. Bien que les exportations aient baisse (14%) -du fait de
stagnation des exportations du cafe - et que les importations aient connu un vif essor
(20%' dii principalement a l'augmentation de la demande de biens intermediaires et
d'kquipement), les flux d'aide exterieure ont contribue a maintenir la balance exterieure
dans les limites escomptees.

A.       Les leqons du dernier accordDARE

14.      L e Gouvernement avait sollicit6 l'appui de I'IDA a travers l e Don d'Appui aux
Rkformes Economiques pour pouvoir faciliter la mise en Oeuvre de sa politique de lutte
contre lapauvretk et 1'accClCration de la croissance.

15.      Les reformes, notamment dans les domaines de la stabilisation macrotconomique,
de la gestion des finances publiques, de la politique monCtaire et de change ainsi que des
reformes structurelles comme la privatisation des entreprises publiques et le secteur du
cafk etaient entrain d'Ctre entrepris.

16.      Ces rkformes, qui sont A la base du dkveloppement et de la croissance kconomique
nkcessitaient des appuis des bailleurs de fonds pour leur mise en Oeuvre effective. C'est
dans ce contexte que le DARE a ete conch entre le Gouvernement du Burundiet 1'IDA.

17.      Dans le domaine de la gestion de finances publiques appuyees par le DARE, des
resultats importants ont kte enregistres.

18.      Uncadre legidatifet reglementaire coherent de lagestion des finances publiques a
ete amorce notamment par l'adoption par le parlement du nouveau code des marchks
publics ; l'adoption par le Gouvemement de la nouvelle Loi organique relatives aux
finances publiques ;le nouveau code des douanes a et6 mis en vigueur ;la rationalisation
des comptes de 1'Etat vers un compte unique du tresor est en cours de finalisation et la
reorientation des depenses publiques vers les secteurs de lutte contre la pauvrete a ete
introduite dans la structure du Budget de 1'Etat depuis l'exercice 2006.

19.      Dans le domaine de la relance du secteur prive, le Gouvernement a fait des efforts
remarquables en apurant la totalite des arrikrks de la dette envers le secteur privk. Cette
action qui a et6 appuyee par le DARE a abouti par la mise en place d'une strategic
d'apurement des arrieres de la dette interieure de 1'Etat envers le secteur prive.

20.      A cet effet, un march6 de bons et obligations du Trksor a Ctk mis en vigueur et
fonctionne correctement.

21.      Dans le domaine de la privatisation des entreprises publiques et du
desengagement de 1'Etat des secteurs economiques, des efforts ont et6 men&. L e
Gouvernement a adopt6 un plan detail16 des entreprises publiques A privatiser et la mise
en Oeuvre duprogramme de privatisation suit son cours.

22.      Dansunenvironnement post-conflit difficile, l'exkcution dudemier accord DARE
(2006-07) a Ctk dans l'ensemble satisfaisante. L a plupart des rtformes engagtes dans les
domaines de la gestion des finances publiques et dans le secteur du cafe ont bien
progress&, ce qui a permis au Gouvemement de mettre en Oeuvre les politiques qui ont
maintenu l'economie relativement stable. L e Burundi a aussi mis fin A            certaines
restrictions du commerce et de change. I1a en outre adhkre a la Communaute de 1'Afrique
de 1'Est (CAE).

23.     L e DARE visait a soutenir le Gouvernement dans la mise en Oeuvre du CSLP
intkrimaire dans quatre domaines: (i)   l'amelioration de la gestion des depenses publiques
et son impact sur les pauvres, (ii) reforme des secteurs de culture de rente (cafe, the et
                                    la
coton), (iii) relance du secteur prive, et (iv) la reforme des entreprises publiques a
              la
travers le desengagement de 1'Etat.

24.     L e Gouvernement a fait des progrbs satisfaisants dans l'execution de son
programme de rkformes. En plus des actions prkalables qui avaient conduit au
dkcaissement de la premiere tranche du Don en 2006, d'autres actions contenues dans
l'accord de Don pour le dkcaissement de la seconde tranche du Don ont &e remplies en
2007. Ces dernieres sont rksumkes ci-dessous:

    0   Production d'un rapport trimestriel complet d'exkcution budgktaire,               en
        commenpnt par celui qui couvre le premier trimestre de 2006. Cette condition a
        et6 remplie. Les rapports sont, dans la forme et le fond, jug& satisfaisants par
        1'IDA. L e Ministere en charge des Finances a fourni des rapports trimestriels sur
        l'execution du budget depuis la mi-2006. Ces rapports sont bases sur le systeme
        informatique de gestion des dkpenses (SIGEFI) qui a ete introduit en Janvier
        2006, en utilisant la nouvelle nomenclature budgetaire. L e systeme permet
        d'identifier le cycle budgetaire (dotation budgetaire, engagements, liquidations,
        ordonnancement, paiements), mais la couverture est encore partielle. Avec l'aide
        de laBanque mondiale et duFMI,les autorites font des efforts considkrables pour
        amdiorer la couverture et la fiabilitk du systeme.

        Prksentation a 1'Assemblee nationale d`une version revisCe de la loi sur les
        marches publics, dont le fonds et la forme sont jug& satisfaisants a 1'IDA. Cette
        condition a kt6 remplie. IDA a examine et juge satisfaisant le droit des marchks
        publics adoptk par le Gouvernement et present6 au Parlement. L e projet de loi a
        CtC presente au Parlement en Octobre 2006. L a loi permettra un processus de
        passation des marches publics plus moderne et plus transparent. Le projet de loi a
        ktk approuve en commission parlementaire en Octobre 2007, et promulgue par le
        Chef de 1'Etat en Fevrier 2008.

        arrieres de 1'Etat vis a vis du secteur privk, y compris les banques, tels que
        certifies par un audit externe indtpendant. Cette condition a et6 remplie. Les
        progrbs rCalises dans le reglement des arrikrks du Gouvernement au secteur prive
        national ont CtC, sur la forme et le fond, juges satisfaisants par IDA. L e reglement
        des arrierks a CtC men6 pour allkger le fardeau financier du secteur prive et
        renforcer l'activitk kconomique. Un audit externe des arriCrCs avait et6 finalise en
        Fkvrier 2006. Les autorites ont adopte une stratkgie nationale d'apurement de ces
        arrikres. Cette strategie a ete elaborke en coordination avec le FMI, et adopt6 par
        le Conseil des ministres. L a strategie a permis la mise en place d'un march6 de
        bons et obligations du TrCsor en 2006 et 2007. D e plus, les autorites ont allouk a
        chaque creancier la somme de 100 millions de Fbu (1'6quivalent de 97000 dollars

        cafe. Cette condition a et6 remplie. L e plan d'action est sur la forme et le fond,
        jug6 satisfaisant par IDA. A la fin de 2006, le Gouvernement a lance unprocessus
        de consultation elargie avec les principaux acteurs du secteur du cafe, ce qui a
        conduit A la conception d'unplan d'actions detaille pour la reforme du secteur. L e
        plan d'actions enonce le processus de mise en Oeuvre de la reforme du secteur du
        cafe. I1 englobe la gestion de la dette du secteur, la conception d'un cadre legal,
        reglementaire et institutionnel, et la conception de l'execution d'une strategie
        efficace permettant la vente d'actifs publics du secteur. Ce plan d'action a et6

B.      DCfis relever

25.     L e Burundi est confronte a des dkfis considerables tant sur l e plan politique
qu'economique et social. Sur le plan politique, ils'agit de consolider le processus de paix
et la stabilite politique. En vue d'eradiquer definitivement les sequelles d'un conflit qui
vient de durer environ 15 ans et dejeter des bases solides pour undeveloppement durable
et harmonieux, le Gouvernement a initie des cadres de dialogue et de concertation
impliquant tous les partenaires socio-politiques. Cette option a permis au pays de
retrouver un environnement serein et propice a la restauration de la confiance entre les
                                             61

parties prenantes de la sphbre politique nationale, notamment a travers la mise en place
d'un gouvernement d'union nationale en novembre 2007. Cette avancke sur le plan
politique a et6 quelquepeuperturbke par la reapparition de quelques cas d'insecurite suite
au brusqueretrait du PALIPEHUTU-FNL du Mouvement Conjoint de Verification et de
Suivi (MCVS).

26.     Depuis le mois d'avril 2008, cependant, gritce a l'appui de 1'Initiative Regionale
et du Directoire Politique dont la mission premibre consistait a renforcer la mediation
entre l e PALIPEHUTU-FNL et l e Gouvernement, l e dernier mouvement rebelle, le
PALIPEHUTU-FNL, vient de reprendre et de poursuivre la mise en application de
l'accord de cessez-le-feu. L e Gouvernement est convaincu que le processus de cessation
definitive des hostilitks amorce, permettra la reinstauration de la skurite sur tout le
territoire national et partant la reprise effective de l'activitk economique et la lutte contre
lapauvrete.

27.      Sur le plan economique et social, il s'agit de realiser une croissance forte et
durable pour faire reculer la pauvrete et progresser vers les Objectifs du Millenaire pour
l e Developpement (OMD). L e Burundi est l'un des pays les moins avances du monde, l e
niveau de pauvrete demeure important. L'incidence du VIH/SIDA est klevee et les
infrastructures sociales peudkveloppees. Le Gouvernement devra s'atteler a :

            Assurer laviabilitk budgetaire afin de reduirela lourde charge de la dette.

            Ramener le taux d'inflation      a un chiffre. Des progrbs significatifs ont et6
            accomplis sur le plan de la stabilisation macroeconomique, mais beaucoup
            reste a faire pour maitriser l'inflation surtout dans le contexte international
            caracterise par les prix eleves dupetrole et des produits alimentaires.

             Renforcer les capacites institutionnelles et la bonne gouvernance. Les
            reformes structurelles demeurent essentielles pour rehausser la croissance et
            faire reculer la pauvrett. L e renforcement des capacitts institutionnelles et
            l'amelioration de la gouvernance seront primordiaux a cet egard.

            Progresser dans l'integration regionale. L'appartenance a la CAE ouvrira au
            Burundi des debouches economiques klargis. Toutefois, le pays a encore
            beaucoup a faire pour developper une strategie globale, mettre en Oeuvre les
            reformes institutionnelles indispensables et negocier avec le secretariat de la
            CAE les modalites de sa mise en conformite avec les conditions posees par la
            Communaute. Pour ce faire, une assistance technique et financibre de la part
            des donateurs est indispensable et urgente.

durable et equitable ainsi que dans la lutte contre la pauvretk tel que spkcifik dans le
Cadre Strategique de Lutte Contre la Pauvrete. Le DAREIIconstitue donc une continuit6
des objectifs du premier don dans le domaine de la gestion des finances publiques et de
la promotion du secteur privk.

29.    Le DARE 11a pour objectifs spkcifiques, 1'amClioration de la transparence dans la
gestion des finances publiquesainsi que l'amelioration de l'environnement des affaires.

30.    Dans le domaine de la gestion des finances publiques, un PEMFAR a et6 organis6
conjointement par les autorites et la Banque Mondiale. Une demarche largement
participative a ttk utiliske. L'etude a identifib des reformes prioritaires qui sont
indispensables pour ameliorer la transparence dans la gestion des finances publiques. Ces
rkformes identifikes par le PEMFAR seront mises en Oeuvredans le cadre du DARE11.

3 1.    Les mesures prioritaires concernent entre autres l e renforcement des capacites
pour preparer, gerer et contr6ler les rkformes des finances publiques ; continuer a
renforcer le cadre legal et reglementaire par la mise en vigueur de la L o i Organique
relative aux finances publiques, renforcer la supervision parlementaire ; etablir
progressivement un compte unique du trksor ; renforcer les capacitks et rationnaliser le
fonctionnement du systbme d'audit des services publics.

32.     Dans le domaine de l'amelioration de l'environnement des affaires, la strategie du
Gouvernement est de crker des conditions institutionnelles et juridiques destinkes A
promouvoir le secteur prive.

33.     Dans ce cadre, le Gouvernement a deja adopt6 et transmis au parlement le projet
d'un nouveau code des investissements qui a kt6 largement discute avec tous les
partenaires privks. I1 entend aussi accelerer la    finalisation des nouveaux codes du

Dear Mr.Zoellick,

We have the honor to transmit to you the attached Letter o f Development Policy prepared
under the new budget support program agreed between Burundi and the International
Development Association (IDA), within the context o f the Economic Reform Support
Grant (ERSG11).

    1. The Government o f Burundi sucessfully implemented, from 2006 to 2007, a
       program supported by the Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG); significant
       progress was made during this period, with respect to stabilization and economic
       reform, as well as poverty reduction, through the implementation o f the Poverty
       Reduction Strategy Paper.

    2. On the political front, the Government o f Burundi continues to consolidate the
       peace process by pursuing the implementation o f agreements signed between
       Burundiand all armed opposition.

    3. To address the major challenges facing the country, the Government o f Burundii s
       seeking new IDA support for the implementation o f an economic reform program
       covering the period from July 30, 2008, to July 31, 2009, under ERSG 11, for an
       amount equivalent to SDR 18.5 million, or USD 30 million. The Government i s
       also requesting the continuation o f the interim aid granted by IDA under the
       enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries' Initiative (enhanced HPC). IDA
       assistance will enable Burundi to make progress towards the completion point o f
       the H P C Initiative, expected before end-December 2008.

       that the Government o f Burundi intends to implement within the framework o f an
       economic reform program in the areas o f public finance management and
       improvement o f the business climate. However, it should be mentioned that the
       reform o f the coffee sector remains a key Government priority inthis context.

   5. The Letter o f Development Policy also describes the medium-term economic
       reform strategy that the Government intends to implement under the Grant and
       beyond, in order to carry out the key elements o f poverty reduction with support
       from Burundi's other development partners.

   6. The Government believes that the policies and measures described inthe Letter o f
       Development Policy will make it possible to pursue the recent efforts undertaken
       to strengthen public finance management and improve the business climate,
       including in other areas, with a view to accelerating economic growth and
       ensuring the irreversibility o f ongoing policies. Therefore, the Government is
       ready to adopt any additional measures that IDA may deem necessary to ensure
       the success o f the program. Finally, the Government i s ready to respond to any
       request for information from IDA to help monitor the progress achieved in the
       implementation o fpolicies and measures contained inthe program.

                 80

                            I. GENERALINTRODUCTION

1.        The Government is requesting IDA support for its 2008-2009 economic reform
program aimed at macroeconomic adjustment and stabilization and the implementation o f
poverty-reducing structural reforms through consolidation o f the progress already made in
public finance management and the improvement o f the business environment under
ERSG II.This policy letter sums up the social context and recent economic
developments. It describes the policies that the Government intendsto implement inareas
related to (i)   the preparation of a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP); (ii)the
implementation o f private sector development policies, especially in the coffee sector;
and (iii) reforms aimed at improving public expenditure management.


2.        The Government's program, as presented in the PRSP, seeks to ensure the
transition from a post-conflict economy to a situation o f economic growth and
development. Accordingly, the objective o f the PRSP i s to reinforce political stability,
consolidate peace and reduce poverty by boosting sustainable and equitable economic
growth. The main strategic axes o f the PRSP are (i)    improving governance and security;
(ii) promoting sustainable and equitable economic growth; (iii)  developing humancapital;
and (iv) controlling HIV/AIDS.Progress has beenmade inall four areas.

3.        The satisfactory implementation o f reforms already initiated made it possible to
restore the financial balances that need to be consolidated. The decision o f the IDA and
IMF boards, approving Burundi's eligibility to the HIPC Initiative in August 2005, is
eloquent proof o f this. Duringthe transition period, the Government made progress inthe
reforms it intends to pursue in order to boost growth and ensure that the policies already
implemented are irreversible. This will enable the Government o f Burundi to reach the
completion point o fthe HIPC Initiative inDecember 2008 as expected.

4.        However, these results must not obscure the fact that our economy still faces
many challenges and that there are important opportunities which Burundishould seize in
order to enhance its economic environment, modernize its productive base, and improve
its position on the world market. The current sources o f growth are in the agricultural
sector, especially export sub-sectors like coffee, cotton, and tea. The authorities believe
that the reforms to be initiated in these agricultural sub-sectors will lead to an expansion
o f the agricultural sector with (i)a higher contribution to growth; and (ii)significant
incomes for farmers, especially those inrural areas.


5.        Burundiis also requestingother contributions from donors for the implementation
o f this program and will need a reference framework for a harmonized donor policy. In
this regard, the Government wishes to obtain greater IDA coordination and the adherence
o f all financial partners to the PRSP, whose first assessment report i s being drafted and
will be released inJuly 2008.


6.       This letter presents the Government's reform program over the next two years as
well as the performance indicators       that will be used to assess the quality o f its


                                             81

implementation. Aware o f the difficulties inherent in economic reforms and drawing on
past experience, the authorities intend to judiciously involve all stakeholders in order to
secure the support needed for the successful implementation o f any reforms that have
socio-economic implications.

                    11. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

7.      From 2001 to 2006, Burundi's economic performance improved substantially;
however, the average annual growth rate remains low (about 3.2%) on account o f cyclical
fluctuations in agricultural output. Over the last six years, the Government has
streamlined public spending, stepped up allocations to education, health and
infrastructure, doubling investment spending. Nevertheless, to accelerate growth and
reduce poverty, Burundi needs to address several challenges, namely: diversify
agricultural production and the structure o f the economy, increase agricultural
productivity, and invest inhuman resource development and infrastructure.


8.      Until 2006, the structure of the economy remained dominated by agriculture
(48.4% o f GDP), followed by services (35.2% o f GDP), and industry (16.4% o f GDP).
Agriculture remains the dominant sector in the economy by virtue o f its contribution to
GDP and in terms o f the number o fjobs it creates, despite a relative decline in its GDP
contribution due to low productivity, poor weather conditions, and multi-year episodes of
civil war. Agricultural exports, particularly coffee, account for over 60% o f export
earnings. The contribution o f the services sector has been growing steadily over the last
few years. The industrial sector recorded a slight improvement which could be attributed
mainly to increased construction activity.


9.      Consolidation o f the peace process has helped revive the national reconstruction
process and has created a positive outlook for the country. Since 2000, the country has
gradually recovered from its negative economic growth (-1.8% on average) o f the decade
characterized by political and economic problems to achieve a positive growth rate o f
5.1% in 2006. Economic growth i s largely affected by high volatility in the agricultural
sector. Although the real GDP growth rate reached 4.8% in 2004, it fell to an estimated
0.9% in 2005, due to severe drought, before rallying back to 5.1% in 2006. According to
provisional statistics, the real economic growth rate for 2007 only increased slightly
(3.6%) compared to the previous year, despite an increase in capital expenditures
financed mainly with donor support. This weak performance i s due to poor harvests.


10.     The inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index, reached an annual
average o f 7.2% from 2001 to 2006. This average masks considerable fluctuations with a
peak o f 13.6% in 2004 and a trough o f 2.7% in 2006. The adjustment o f administered
prices at the end o f 2007, the recent hike in food prices, and the disorganization o f import
supplydue to post-electoral difficulties inKenya, exacerbated the rise inconsumer prices
which stood at a month-on-month rate o f 14.7% at the end o f 2007 - compared to a
single-digit inflation target. The average inflation rate at the end o f December 2007 was
8.3%. In the medium term, the inflation rate i s projected to remain below lo%, due to


                                             82

limited recourse to bank credit to finance public spending. The consumer price index is
calculated based on a basket o f consumer goods - at current prices in the Bujumbura
central market - which has not changed since 1991. A household consumption survey i s
envisaged; it should make it possible to modifythe basket used to calculate the index.


11.     Fiscal policy performance for 2005/2006 was satisfactory. The goal o f the
Government's program for 2007 was to pursue macro-economic stabilization, make up
for delays in the implementation o f certain structural reforms and continue consolidating
public finance management. The 2007 budget law has continued to reorient public
spending towards poverty reduction expenditures while containing the budget deficit
(excluding grants). Control o f the wage bill (10.6% o f GDP in 2007) and demobilization
continued to feature among the Government's priorities. Demobilization and security
sector reforms need to be pursuedto help reorient security sector public spendingtowards
social (andpro-poor) sectors.


12.     Fiscal performance for 2007 fell below expectations because o f the slowdown in
the demobilization process. Moreover, the breakdown in peace talks with the last rebel
group (FNL) also contributed in slowing down the demobilization process, thus
generating a larger than expected wage bill as a percentage o f GDP. The need for budget
financing led the Government to take offsetting measures such as raising certain taxes,
scaling back some non-priority expenditure items and postponing a public service salary
increase to 2008. Nevertheless, the budget deficit (excluding grants) should reach 22.4%
o f GDP for 2007 (compared to 19.4% o f GDP in 2006) following an increase in public
spending from 38.4% o f GDPin2006 to 40.5% in2007.


13.     Burundi's external position remained compatible with IMF program targets in
2007. Although exports declined (14%) - due to the stagnation o f coffee exports - and
imports surged (17% due mainly to higher demand for intermediate and capital goods),
foreign aid flows helped maintain the external balance within the expected limits.

    111.   LESSONSLEARNED FROMTHE LAST ERSGAGREEMENT AND
                                     CHALLENGES

A. Lessonslearnedfrom the last ERSGagreement

14.     The Government had requested IDA assistance through the Economic Reform
Support Grant to facilitate the implementation o f its poverty reduction policy and enhance
growth.

15.     Reforms, especially in the areas o f macroeconomic stabilization, public finance
management, monetary and exchange policy, as well as structural reforms such as
privatization o fpublic enterprises and the coffee sector, were being implemented.




                                             83

16.     These reforms, which are the basis for development and economic growth,
required donor support for their effective implementation. It is in this context that the
ERSGwas concluded betweenthe GovernmentofBurundiand IDA.

17.     Inthe area of public finance management, supportedby the ERSG, important
results were recorded.

18.     A coherent legal and regulatory framework for public finance management was
initiated including through the adoption by parliament of the new public procurement
code; the adoption by the Government o f a new public finance organic law; the new
customs code has become effective; the streamlining of Government accounts into a
single treasury account i s being finalized; and the re-orientation o f public spending
towards poverty-reduction sectors has been introduced in the budget structure since
FY2006.

19.     With regard to the promotion o f the private sector, the Government has made
remarkable efforts by clearing all debt arrears owed to the private sector. This action,
which was supported by the ERSG, was concluded through the adoption o f a strategy for
clearing the Government's domestic debt arrears to the private sector.

20.     To that end, a market for Treasury bonds and bills has been established and is
fully operational.

21.     Efforts were also made in the privatization o f public enterprises and in the
Government's divestiture from economic sectors. The Government adopted a detailed
plan for public enterprises to be privatized and the privatization program i s being
implemented.

22.     Ina difficult post-conflict environment, the implementationo fERSG(2006-2007)
was satisfactory on the whole. Most of the reforms initiated in public finance
management and in the coffee sector went on well, and this enabled the Government to
implement policies which kept the economy relatively stable. Burundi also eliminated
some trade and exchange restrictions. It also joined the East African Community (EAC).

23.     The ERSGwas aimed at helpingthe Government implementthe interimPRSP in
four areas: (i)improving public expenditure management and its impact on the poor; (ii)
reforming the cash crop sector (coffee, tea, and cotton); (iii)   jump-starting the private
sector; and (iv) reformingpublic enterprises through Government divestiture.

24.     The Government has made satisfactory progress in implementing its reform
program. Inaddition to the prior actions which had led to the disbursement o f the first
tranche o f the Grant in 2006, other Grant agreement conditions for the disbursement of
the second tranche were fulfilled. These conditions are summarized below:

    0   Production o f a complete budget execution quarterly report, starting with the one
        covering the first quarter o f 2006. This condition was met. The IDA deems the
        reports satisfactory in format and content. The Ministry in charge of Finance has



                                             84

  provided budget implementation quarterly reports since mid-2006. These reports
  are based on the computerized expenditure management system (SIGEFI)
  introduced in January 2006, using the new budget nomenclature. The system
  makes it possible to identify the budget cycle (budget allocations, commitments,
  settlements, payment orders, payments), but its coverage i s still partial. With
  World Bank and IMF assistance, the authorities are making considerable efforts,
  to improve the coverage and reliability o f the system.


0 Presentation to the National Assembly o f a revised version o f the public
  procurement law, whose content and format were deemed satisfactory by the IDA.
  This condition was fulfilled. The IDA examined and deemed satisfactory the
  public procurement law adopted by the Government and presented to Parliament.
  The bill was presentedto Parliament in October 2006. The law will allow a more
  mordern and more transparent public procurement process. The bill was approved
  by a parliamentary commission in October 2007 and promulgated by the Head of
  State inFebruary 2008.

0 Progress in implementing the strategy on the settlement o f Government arrears to
  the private sector, including banks, as certified by an independent external audit.
  This condition was fulfilled. The progress made inclearing Government arrears to
  the private sector was deemed satisfactory, in form and content, by the IDA.
  Arrears were cleared to ease the financial burden on the private sector and boost
  economic activity. An external audit o f arrears had been finalized in February
  2006. The authorities adopted a national strategy for the settlement o f these
  arrears. This strategy was prepared in coordination with the IMF and adopted by
  the Council o f Ministers. The strategy made it possible to set up a Treasury bills
  and bonds market in 2006 and 2007. Furthermore, the authorities allocated
  FBu 100million (the equivalent o f US$ 97,000) to each creditor. The settlement
  o f arrears was finalized at the end o f August 2007.

0 Adoption o f a three-year action plan (2006-2008) for coffee sector reform. This
  condition was fulfilled. The IDA deems the action plan satisfactory, informat and
  content. At the end o f 2006, the Government launched a broad-based consultation
  process with key coffee sector stakeholders, which led to the preparation o f a
  detailed action plan for sector reform. The action plan outlines the coffee sector
  reform implementation process. It covers sector debt management; the design o f a
  legal, regulatory and institutional framework; and the preparation o f a plan for
  implementing an efficient strategy for selling the sector's public assets. This
  action plan was shared with the IMF, EU/Stabex and the World Bank. It had been
  adopted by the Council o f Ministers on 28 December 2006.

0 Restart the biddingprocess for: (i) sale o f all shares heldby Ofice du Cafe' du
                                       the
 Burundi (OCIBU) in Socie'te'H6teliBre du Burundi (NOVOTEL); and (ii)        the sale
  o f all OCIBU assets in sectors other than coffee. This condition was fulfilled and
  published. The relaunch o f the biddingprocess for the sale o f all OCIBU shares in
 Socie'te' H6teliBre du Burundi was published in the government newspaper Le



                                         85

        Renouveau. The sub-condition "sale o f all OCIBU assets in sectors other than
        coffee" was not correctly formulated due to lack o f information on OCIBU's
        ownership structure at the time the Grant was prepared. The Government provided
        a signed agreement in 1993, showing that OCIBU does not own property, but
        rather manages State property inthe coffee sector.


    0   Publication o f the audit results on the sale o f the presidential plane to Delaware
        Corporation by the Government in June 2006, and adoption o f a related action
        plan reflecting audit recommendations. This condition was fulfilled. The audit
        was published in its entirety in the government newspaper Le Renouveau o f 28
        May 2007. The Council o f Ministers adopted the related action plan in September
        2007. This action plan covers: (i) adoption o f a communication plan; (ii)
                                            the                                          the
        presentation to Parliament o f a bill on the sale o f public property; (iii)     the
        continuation o f investigations on the sale o f the plane by setting up a
        parliamentary commission; and (iv) the promotion o f transparency in the
        management o f economic, political and administrative rights. In September 2007,
        a commission responsible for preparing the bill on the sale o f public property was
        established and in October 2007, the parliamentarycommissionwas created.

B.      Challenges

25,     Burundi faces considerable political, economic and social challenges. Politically,
it has to consolidate the peace process and political stability. In a bid to eradicate the
vestiges o f a conflict that has lasted for about 15 years and lay a solid foundation for
sustainable and balanced development, the Government has initiated dialogue and
consultation frameworks involving all socio-political partners. This measure has made it
possible for the country to create a serene and enabling environment to restore confidence
among stakholders on the national political arena, mainly through the formation o f a
national unity government in November 2007. This political achievement was somehow
disruptedby the resurgence o f a few cases o f insecurity following the briefwithdrawal o f
PALIPEHUTU-FNL from the Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (MCVS).

26.     Since April 2008, however, the last rebel movement, PALMEHUTU-FNL has
resumedand is pursuingthe implementationo fthe ceasefire agreement, thanks to support
from the Regional Initiative and the Political Directorate, whose primary mission was to
reinforce mediation between PALIPEHUTU-FNL and the Government. The Government
strongly believes that the ongoing process for final cessation o f hostilitities will help
restore security across the entire national territory and thus, effectively revive economic
activity and poverty reduction.

27.    From the economic and social standpoint, the idea i s to achieve robust and
sustainable growth, reduce poverty and progress towards the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Burundi i s one o f the least developed countries in the world and its level
of poverty remains high. HIV/AIDS incidence is high and social infrastructure i s hardly
developed. The Government must strive to:

        0  Ensurebudgetary sustainabilityinorder to reduce the heavydebt burden;


                                             86

        0     Bring inflation down to single digits. Significant progress has beenmade in
             macroeconomic stabilization, but a lot remains to be done to curb inflation,
              especially inan internationalcontext characterized by highoil and food prices.


        0     Build institutional capacity and promote good governance. Structural reforms
              remain essential to boost growth and scale back poverty. To that end,
              institutional capacity-building and the improvement o f governance will be
              primordial.

        0     Enhance regional integration. Membership o f the EAC will open up greater
              economic opportunities for Burundi. However, the country still has much to
              do to develop a comprehensive strategy, implement key institutional reforms
              and negotiate with the EAC secretariat on the terms o f compliance with the
              conditions laid down by the Community. To that end, the technical and
              financial assistanceo f donors i s indispensable and urgent.


             IV.      THE NEW ECONOMIC REFORM SUPPORT GRANT
                                     (ERSG11):2008-2009

28.     The new Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG 11) i s aimed at helping the
Government implement its reforms with a view to achieving sustainable and balanced
economic growth as well as poverty reduction, as specified inPoverty Reduction Strategy
Paper. ERSG 11therefore pursues the objectives o f the first grant in the area o f public
finance management and private sector development.

29.     The specific objectives of ERSG11are to increase transparency inpublic finance
management and improve the business environment.

30.     In the area o f public finance management, a PEMFAR was jointly organized by
the authorities and the World Bank. A largely participatory approach was used. The study
identified the priority reforms which are indispensable for increasing transparence in
public finance management. The reforms identifiedby the PEMFARwill be implemented
under ERSG II.

3 1.    The prioritymeasures include, inter alia, buildingthe capacity to prepare, manage
and control public finance reforms; continuing to strengthen the legal and regulatory
framework through implementation o f the public finance organic law; reinforcing
parliamentary supervision; gradually establishing a single Treasury account; building
capacity and streamlining the operation o f the public services audit system.

32.     With regard to the improvement o f the business environment, the Government's
strategy i s to create institutional and legal conditions for private sector development.

33.     Inthis area, the Government has already adopted and transmittedto parliament a
new draft investment code which was widely discussed with all private partners. It also




                                                 87

intends to accelerate the finalization o f new codes on trade and on private and public
enterprises so that they can be adopted by parliament soon.

34.     Thus, the ERSGI1program includes six preliminary measures grouped under two
components: (i)measures supporting public finance management reform; and (ii)
measures supporting private sector development reform, including the coffee sector.

1.      PublicFinanceManagement

35.     The authorities and the World Bank team have agreed on the following six prior
actions to support public finance management reform:

36.     The new organic law, which is in line with international best pratices, must be
adopted by the Council of Ministers and submitted to Parliament. The law was adopted
by the Council of Ministers on 26 March and the Government sent it to Parliament on 21
May 2008.

37.     Adopt a decree defining the budget preparation schedule, the responsibilities o f
the various stakeholders and the content o f the budget guideline letter to improve the
deadlines and efficiency o f the budget preparationprocedure. A draft decree reflecting the
main observations sent by the IDA on 5 February 2008 to the Ministry o f the Economy,
Finance and Developement Cooperation was adopted by the Council o f Ministers on 20
March 2008. The decree was signed bythe President o f the Republic on 3 June 2008.

38.     Improve identification o f pro-poor expenditures in the functional classification,
based on the PRSP. The Government and the IDA agreed on the need to do the technical
work together in order to better identify the pro-poor expenditures which effectively
reflect the budgetary efforts that Burundi will make to allocate domestic resources to
poverty reduction. A note describing the methodology to be followed to improve the
identification o f pro-poor expenditures has beendeveloped. It describes the identification
criteria retained in the budget allocation forecasts for 2007 and 2008; these criteria are
based on this new methodology and prove the credibility o f the new classification o f pro-
poor and non-poor expenditure.

39.     The participation o f local economists in the work. Treasury cash flow and the
provision o f international expertise by IDA contributed to the finalization o f this process.

40.     The Ministry o f the Economy, Finance and Development Cooperation, in
consultation with the five main sectoral ministries, should prepare and implement
quarter-on-quarter Treasury cash flows (i) on revenue estimates and an assessment
                                            based
o f the seasonality realistic expenditures; and (ii)setting quarterly sectoral commitment
ceilings starting in the second quarter of 2008. Implementation o f this measure will help
increase revenue and expenditure predictability and thus, enhance expenditure
management during the fiscal year. The authorities have already identified, and started
working with, five sectoral ministries with significant budgets (Health, Education,
Agriculture, Defence and Interior). These ministries are represented in a working group
on cash management, together with the BudgetDirectorate.



                                            88

41.      Two meetings were held mainly to discuss issues regarding the seasonality o f
expenditure commitment in the sectoral ministries. By letter o f 13 March 2008, the
Minister o f the Economy, Finance and Development Cooperation asked the ministries
concerned to forward their commitment forecasts for the second quarter o f 2008. The
Treasury cash flows for the last quarter o f 2007 were compared with actual
implementation in order to fine-tune the assumptions retained. Based on this study,
annual budget cash flow forecasts for all ministries were prepared and will be updated
regularly.

42.      Restore the internal audit and inspection unit o f the Ministry o f the Economy,
Finance and Development Cooperation by providing it with adequate staff and ensuring
its satisfactory operation. Order No. 540/0014 o f 9 January 2008 to organize the internal
inspection and control unit o f the Ministry o f the Economy, Finance and Development
Cooperation was signed by Madam the Minister o f the Economy, Finance and
Development Cooperation. By Ministerial Order No. 540 /659 o f 16 /06/2008, the
Minister of the Economy, Finance and Development Cooperation also appointed the
managers and staff members o f the internal inspection and control unit. Competence and
professional know-how were the criteria used in selecting the members o f this team. A
work plan for 2008 and a draft procedures manual have already been prepared. This
manual will be developed by the inspection and internal control unit team with the
assistance o f a consultant inorder to comply with applicable international standards. The
ministry will provide the new structure with working premises and operational means as
soon as possible.

43.      Submit the Government's revenue and expenditure accounts and extrabudgetary
accounts for 2006 and 2007 to the Audit Court. The revenue and expenditure account for
2006 was forwarded to the Audit Court in May 2007, and the corresponding budget
review law in September 2007. The Audit Court produced its report on FY 2006 budget
implementation on 12 December 2007.         The Ministry o f the Economy, Finance and
Development Cooperation could not respond to the Audit Court within the prescribed
deadlines as the 2008 budget was beingprepared during the period concerned. However,
it sent its comments on the Audit Court's report at the endo fMarch2008. The authorities
and the IDA agreed that the 2007 revenue and expenditure account be sent to the Audit
Court with a one-month delay after the official deadline o f 31 March 2008. The 2007
revenue and expenditure account was indeed sent to the Audit Court on 30 April 2008.

2.       Private Sector Development

44.      The new Investment Code, in keeping with international best practices, should be
adopted by the Council o f Ministers and submittedto Parliament. Duringa brainstorming
workshop, organized in collaboration with the Vice Minister in charge o f Planning, and
with the participation o f the authorities and the private sector, the authorities and the
World Bank agreed on the approach as well as the major components and measures to be
included inthe new Investment Code. An InvestmentCode follow-up committee was set
up. A new draft code was prepared with the technical assistance o f the World Bank and
the InternationalFinancial Corporation (IFC). This draft code was reviewed by Burundian



                                            89

stakeholders, and the comments o f the World Bank and the IFC were included. The
Council o f Ministers adopted the new code on 14 June 2008 and transmitted it to the
National Assembly for consideration and adoption on 16June 2008.

45.      Adopt a decree defining the conditions for constructive consultations between the
public and private sectors. The adoption o fthis decree i s the first step to revive public and
private sector consultations on economic policies impacting private sector growth. The
decree will define the framework, the partnersand the mechanisms o f such consultations.
The authorities and the World Bank agreed on the work plan, and technical assistance
supported by the World Bank has already started. The draft decree was prepared for
discussion by local partners in mid-April. The World Bank and IFC presented their
comments in a timely manner. The decree was signedbythe President o f the Republic on
17 June 2008.

46.      Launch a study to analyze institutional capacity-building needs for public
enterprise reform, including an action plan to build such capacities. The authorities
presented draft terms o f reference which were reviewed by the World Bank. This prior
action was fulfilled as the identification and signature o f the contract o f the consultant
have already been achieved.

47.      The OCIBU Board o f Directors should adopt regulations for the sale o f coffee in
order to clarify marketing rules for the 2008/2009 crop year, and disseminate these
regulations widely inFrench and Kirundi.The authorities and the World Bank agreed on
the critical importance o f disseminating sales regulations, which clarify the rules that will
govern the marketing o f raw coffee. The draft regulations on the sale o f raw coffee
exports were prepared by the OCIBU and discussed publicly with the technical and
financial partners operating in the coffee sector, who were asked to make improvement
suggestions within a week. The objective i s to improve these regulations so they can
become an instrument to promote transparency and competition in the coffee sector.
Using the improvement suggestions received from the World Bank, USAIDand IMF, the
authorities finalized the draft coffee sale regulations for the 2008/2009 crop year. The
sales regulations were adopted by the OCIBU Board o f Directors on 24 April 2008. An
information notice on coffee marketing will be presented to the Ministry o f Agriculture
and Livestock by the Council o f Ministers. This notice will be sent to IDA infulfillment
o f the prior action.

                  V.    MONITORINGOF THE GRANT PROGRAM

48.     The program and the measures listed in the structural reform matrix will be
monitored by the Government through the institutional committee responsible for the
monitoring and assessment o freforms supported bythe ERSG11and the future ERSGIII.
The authorities will ensure that the Committee i s closely monitoring ongoing reforms by
coordinating and supervising the work o f the inter-ministerial team and technical
committees.




                                             90

49.     The inter-ministerial team includes focal points in the Ministry o f the Economy,
Finance and Cooperation for Development; the Ministry o f Commerce; SCEP; and the
coffee sector committee. The technical committees deal with public finance reform, the
business environment, and the coffee sector. These national teams have actively
participated inthe development o f the economic program and inthe preparationo f the list
o fpreliminary measures for the two ERSG11components.

        VI.     TRIGGERSOFTHE NEXT ERSGI11BUDGET SUPPORT38

50.     Six indicative measures supporting public finance management reform were
chosen by the Government and the World Bank team for ERSG III.These measures,
which should be implementedno later than December 2008, include:

        1. Finalizing public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) inthe education, health
           andjustice sectors, as well as beneficiary surveys; publishthese reports on the

           ANNEX 3: BURUNDIERSGI1 Poverty OutlookAnd Social Development
                                           -

1.      For many years conflict displaced a large portion o f the rural population and
destroyed important economic and social infrastructure. As a result, poverty i s
particularly widespread in rural areas, which account for over 90 percent o f the
population. 63 percent o f the population suffers from food insecurity. Surveys estimate
that poverty incidence stood at 66.9 percent in 2006, a noted drop from 81 percent in
1998 yet far from the 2015 MDG target o f 30 percent. Rural poverty i s estimated at twice
the rate o f urban areas. Regional differences are particularly acute, with poverty rates
fluctuating from a low o f 28.7 percent in Bujumbura to a high o f 82.3 percent in the
province o f Kirundo. The intensity o f poverty also varies among groups. Households
living inurban areas whose head or spouse has a better education and who benefit from
better employment are less likelyto be poor or feel poor.

2.      Health. Life expectancy rose fi-om 42.8 years in 2000 to 44.6 years in 2005,
however, much more needs to be done as the conflict affected health services delivery
severely, with shortages o f essential medicines and qualified staff. Major causes o f
morbidity and mortality include malaria, acute respiratory infections, diarrhea,
tuberculosis, and malnutrition. The spread o f HIV/AIDS is taking a heavy toll on
communities, with the prevalence rate in the general population o f 4.8 percent in 2007,
leaving many households vulnerable. Infant mortality rates are as high as 114 (2004) per
1,000 (compared to African averages o f 103.1 per 1,000, and to the MDGtarget o f 36 per
l,OOO),  and maternal mortality rates average 990 (2000) per 100,000 (compared to
African averages o f 916.8 per 100,000, and to the MDG target o f 202 per 100,000 by
2015). As a consequence o f the long civil strife, child immunizations for under-five years
old fell dramatically during the 1990s. However, recent efforts have led to increases in
vaccinations rates again: the measles vaccination coverage rate has increased from 78
percent in 2004 to 92 percent in 2006. The coverage o f the vaccine DTC-Hib-Hep3
increased from 83 to 92 percent, while Polio3 coverage increased from 76 to 88 percent.

3.      Sanitation and potable water. Sanitation services inrural areas are quite limited.
Only 22 percent o f the population has access to functional facilities; 90 percent o f these
are traditional pit latrines. Inrural areas, only 43 percent o f the population has access to
potable water. Forty percent o f the rural water supply i s derived from the existing 22,000
improved spring facilities, the bulk o f which are nonfunctional. This situation can be
explained by the lack o f maintenance o f water-related infrastructure. Furthermore, the
distances to traditional potable water sources are long.

4.      Education. Less than half o f the population i s literate (only 43 percent o f adults
are literate (53 percent males versus 32 percent o f females) and education at all levels
suffers from a lack o f qualified teachers, teaching material and adequate infrastructure.
Disparities in education outcomes among gender and regions are large.               Females
comprise 45 percent o f the studentsat the primary level, 41 percent at the secondary level,
and 25 percent at the university level. The gross enrollment rate (GER) goes from 130
percent inthe city o fBujumbura to 50 percent inthe provinces o fNgozi and Muyinga.




                                                 102

5.        Primary school enrollments were restored to the pre-crisis long-term trend level,
with a net primary enrollment ratio o f 57 percent by 2002. Since the "free school" policy
was introduced in September 2005, primary education enrollment has significantly
improved from 80 percent in 2003-04 to about 100 percent in 2005-06 (matching the
MDG target o f 100 percent by 2015). However, completion rate is just 37 percent and
only 47 percent o f those children that start first grade finish the primary cycle in2005. At
the secondary level, the GER o f 13 percent i s below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) (25 percent). In the non-formal education system, approximately 300,000 people
are enrolled for basic literacy and numeracy instruction. However, the quality o f this type
o f education i s very low.

         Box 2: Burundi'sProspects for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015

Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.
Unlikely. The internationally agreed baseline year o f 1990 for the MDGs coincides with the beginning o f a
decade o f political turmoil and civil war during which GDP fell by almost 20%. The national poverty
headcount increased from 36% to 67% during that period. About 55% o f the population still lives on less
than US$l/day (the MDGtarget is 18%).

Meeting the hunger target is unlikely. Malnutrition rates were very high even before the crisis, and in2000
Burundi had the highest under-five malnutritionrates inAfrica with 57%. However, according to the latest
2005 survey, malnutrition rates decreased to 44% (the MDGtarget is 23%).

Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education.
Likely. Burundi will potentially meet the target for universal primary enrollment. Since free universal
primary education was introduced in September 2005, gross enrollment reached close to 100%. But
completion rates remain low at only 36%.

Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women.
Likely. The target on gender equality inprimary education will very likely be met with the ratio o f girls to
boys currently at 0.8. The target on women participation in parliament has been met. However, women's
lack o f control over resources will remain a key challenge.

Goal 4: Reduce child mortality.
Highly unlikely. Child and infant mortality rates remain high at 190 and 114 (per 1,000 live births) but
show improvements from their 2000 peak rates o f 291 and 156, respectively. Communicable diseases, such
as malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections, and the compounding effect o f malnutrition are the major causes
o f mortality and morbidity especially among children.

Goal 5: Improve maternal health.
Highly unlikely. Maternal mortality remains very high at 1,000 (per 100,000 live births).At the same time,
the proportion o f births attended to by skilled health personnel is only 31%, well below the MDG goal of
100%. The key challenges to enhance utilization o f health services are: (i) to households; and (ii)
                                                                             cost                         lack
o f trained people.

Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
Likely. Burundi will potentially meet the HIViAIDS target. Overall HIV prevalence o f 3.4% i s low.
However, Burundi's rate o f 12% HIV affections among pregnant women is quite high compared with
neighboring countries (Rwanda 9.8%, Uganda 8.5%, and Tanzania 7.5%).

Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability. Unlikely. Only 50% o f the population has access to
improved water resources. Among these, 75% live inurban areas and only 45% inrural areas.

    ANNEX 4: BURUNDI ERSGI1 Statusof ReformsInitiatedUnder 2006 ERSG(ERSGI)
                                    -

1.      The 2006 ERSG was a stand-alone two-tranche operation, which closed end o f
March 2008, after successful tranche releases inNovember 2006 and December 2007. It
was designed to support reforms in public financial management (PFM) and promote
policies to accelerate growth.     The ERSG objectives were to:              (i)improve public
expenditure management and its impact on the poor; (ii)       revive agriculture export crop
sectors (coffee, tea, and cotton) and ensure better revenue distribution sectors among
actors; (iii)revive the private sector by improving business climate, accelerating State
divestiture; and settle the Government domestic arrears to the private sector.              The
Government has made uneven progress in implementing its reform program.                   While
progress in PFM has been relatively steady and the Government has taken a number o f
important measures to improve the business environment, the pace o f structural reforms
was slower than anticipated.

2.      The ERSG program in PFM included two major subcomponents: (i) the            deepen
reforms o f the Public Expenditure Management (including external oversight and
procurement); and (ii)increase the volume o f high quality pro-poor expenditure
(including development o f basic mediumterm forecasting and programming, undertaking
PETS and strengthening statistics).    The focus coincided with the country acceding to
HIPC Initiative decision point. The ERSG was geared to support Government efforts to
reach several o f the conditions for the HIPC Completion Point.39 The reform, which
includes several components, has progressed well given the weak institutional capacity.
A modem organic law of finance consistent with international standards, was developed
with the support o f the program and was just approved by the Council o f Ministers in
March 2008 and submitted to the Parliament in May 2008 as part o f the ERSG I1
program. The law will help streamline budgetary procedures and ex-ante controls. A new
and unified nomenclature has been implemented, helpingidentify pro-poor expenditures.
The new double-entry accounting system has been implemented.                       The Interim
computerized financial management information system (SIGEFI) was functional for the
2006 budget year and produced quarterly budget execution reports for 2007 and early
2008. It i s now being further updated to process a comprehensive budget and eventually
include the full payroll process for the civil service. The Government has progressively
consolidated its cash management by closing off-budgetary accounts. The General State
Inspectorate (Inspection GCnCralde 1'Etat) was created and became active in2006.

3.      The scope o f the 2006 ERSG program in PFM combined with the country's
political fragility and institutional weaknesses led to other reforms not progressing as
expected.    For instance, the control unit o f the MEFCD (Inspection Ge'ne'ral des
Finances, IGF), which was supposed to be reconstituted in 2006-2007 was not. A
modem draft procurement law was submittedto the parliament inthe fall o f 2006, but not
promulgated until early 2008 due to the political stalemate at the National Assembly
delaying the reform process. It was finally promulgated in February o f 2008 and will
become effective in October 2008. Furthermore, while the authorities have succeeded in


39See Burundi - EnhancedHeavily IndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. IDNR2005-0174,


                                                104

redirecting more budget towards the social sectors, especially inlight o f the HIPC interim
debt relief, the slower than expected demobilizationhas ledto a constrained fiscal space.
The lack o f capacity did not allow the adequate development o f medium term forecasting
and program budgets. Improvements in monitoring and evaluation are still critically
needed, including improvements in statistics, finalizing the surveys on expenditure
tracking in education, health andjustice as well as undertakingpoverty and social impact
analysis to examine the likely effects o f the future coffee reforms on differentgroups.

4.       The ERSG program in PSD focuses on (i)reviving the private sector by
improving business climate, accelerating State divestiture; and settle the Government
domestic arrears to the private sector; and (ii)        reviving agriculture export crop sectors
(coffee, tea, and cotton) and ensure better revenuedistribution sectors among actors; The
Government has taken a number o f measures to improve the business environment and
promote private sector development. The Government has enacted the insolvency law
and i s developing a commercial code, a company law and a draft competition law. It has
developed a draft law to modernize the investment code and i s revising its privatization
law. In2006, the Chamber o f Commerce and Industry established the BurundiArbitration
Center, to facilitate arbitration as a means o f commercial conflict resolution.         40  By
August 2007, the authorities followed through their commitment to settle Government
debt to the private sector, providing it with some financial space. An investment climate
assessmenti s being finalized. Burundibecame a member o f the East African Community
(EAC) inmid2007, to facilitate its integration into the regional economy.

5.       Despite good progress toward reforming the business legal and regulatory
environment, reforms in the financial sector stalled due to the absence o f needed
microfinance entities and the inability o f the World Bank and IMF to accommodate the
Government's request for an FSAP. Also, the pace o f structural reforms has been much
slower than anticipated due to several Government changes in 2006-2007, low
institutional capacity and lack o f a unified and strategic approach in some policy areas.
The Government intended to divest from economic activities by undertaking (i)a
differentiated approach to privatization o f the public enterprises and (ii)    a reformprogram
for the agricultural sector (coffee, tea and cotton) to revive exports and improve revenues
to producers.

6.       The Government has made some progress inprivatizing public enterprises, under
a differentiated approach as agreed with IDA. The authorities started with some o f the
simpler privatizations. They have liquidated some bankrupt enterprises, re-launched bids
for the sale o f Government shares in some enterprises and recently have finalized studies
o f the financial status o f seven major public enterprises. However, the privatization law
still in force i s outdated. While the Sewice Charge' des Entreprises Publiques (SCEP) has
received some technical assistance and capacity building, and undertaken the
privatization discussed above, the institutional framework to prepare, manage and
monitor the reform o f the public enterprises i s highly inadequate. Finally, while the
President o f the Republic and the second Vice President has repeatedly expressed a wish


40  with financial assistance under the IDA supportedEconomic Management Project


                                                       105

for reform, there i s no clear and systematic reform strategy. The overall approach for the
reform o f the remaining public enterprises still lacks a solid analytical underpinning
around which to build a consensus about the way forward.

7.      Inthe coffee sector the Government adopted a law in 2005, to liberalize coffee
prices and commercialization, and a rolling three year action plan in late 2006 to reform
the sector. It created the Coffee Reform Committee in 2006, undertook studies, and
facilitated visits for international buyers. However, the reach o f the authority o f the
coffee reform committee has not been clear and the President made two major policy
decisions during in mid-2007 that led to setbacks for the reform process, as they set
coffee prices and granted a monopoly for the commercialization o f all Burundian coffee
for 2006-2007, going against the 2005 law. Finally, the sale o f the washing stations has
experienced a long delay. The program o f reform in tea sector did not progress as
expected. The Authorities set up a Tea Reform Committee but it did not become
operational and the technical and financial audit o f the Office o f Tea o f Burundi (OTB,
Office du The' du Burundi) was not undertaken. In the cotton sector, the state weaving
company (COTEBU) i s in bankruptcy and has closed its doors. The Government has
developed a strategy for reform COTEBU that includes opening to enterprise to private
sector investment, most likely in partnership with investors from mainland China. SCEP
has developed an action planbased on this strategy.

                            ANNEX 6: BURUNDIERSGI1 Summary of
                                                           -

                        The Roleof PublicEnterprisesinthe EconomyofBurundi

1.     The parapublic sector in Burundi represents a large share o f the economy. Overall, it
comprises about 50 public projects; about 15 public administration entities (Etablissements
Publics CE    CaractBre Administratif     - EPA); about 30 state entities (Administrations
Personnaliskes de 1.Etat -APE) and agencies, as well as about 50 semipublic enterprises (SPE).
O f the SPEs listed in the productive sector, 17 are fully-owned public enterprises (PE); 16 are
mixed enterprises inwhich the state has a majority ownership- SM1 (more than 50 percent); and
17 are mixed enterprises inwhich the state has minority ownership - SM2.

2.     Because o f the state's control o f the management of SPEs (the focus o f this analysis)
these SPEs weigh heavily on public finances. This management does not ensure efficient
resource allocation or better redistribution, and inhibits economy from being more dynamic.
These economic distortions translate notably into poor management resulting in poor
performance, state subsidies and an often unsustainable debt level.

3.      To address this problem, the state initiated a reform that led to the adoption o f a
privatization policy. This reform advocated a policy of openness/liberalization aimed at
withdrawal o f the state from the productive sector through privatizatiodtransfer o f its shares to
private economic operators; as well as promotion o f the private sector through a host o f
incentives, including, inparticular, the investment code, which has been revisedseveral times to
this end.

4.      To achieve this objective, the state put in place a legal, regulatory, and institutional
framework to guide the process. The legal and regulatory framework comprises notably a
privatization law, a code for public and private enterprises, as well as a series o f schedules. At
the institutional level, the Government has set up an interministerial privatization committee
(IPC), responsible for leading the process, with decision-making prerogatives on all
privatizations. This committee was to be supported by the public enterprises division (Sewice
chargk des Entreprises Publiques -SCEP), created for this purpose.

5.      Little progress has been made since the launching o f the privatization process in 1991-
1992 and in 1994, despite the measures put in place. Less than one quarter o f SPEs were
subjected to asset transfers by the SCEP. The proceeds from these transactions would have been
paid into a treasury account; however, this cannot be verified from existing documentation.

6.      Several main constraints explain the poor performance o f the recent reform process. The
main ones are (i) political crisis that broke out in 1993, creating an environment that was not
                   the
conducive to private investment or to the pursuit o f sustainable institutional reforms, and that
curbed donor support (notably for pre-privatization studies, investments to upgrade equipment,
financial restructuring funds, technical and financial support to the SCEP, etc.); (ii)  low public
support, owing to lack o f communication on the reform process, thus worsening its poor
perception and rejection by society; (iii)lack o f access to credit and insufficient national private
savings; (iv) poor preparation oUsupport for potential national buyers with respect to the real
requirements of taking over comparatively bigger entities in terms o f managerial capacity; (v)


                                                 109

lack o f reliable data; and (vi) continuous changes in the trusteeship o f the SCEP and the
presidency o f the 0,which are not geared to facilitating the rapid processing o f reform
documents.

7.      The relaunching o f the privatization process consisted in a series o f reform measures.
These measures included: (i) commitment to adopt a new approach, including the preparation
                                the
o f a road map comprising sectoral studies o f enterprises in different sectors, the improvement o f
the institutional framework for privatizations, and the strengthening o f human and institutional
capacities; (ii)the preparation o f communication plans for the privatization program to ensure
the involvement o f the different actors, including civil society; and (iii)prioritization based on a
differentiated approach, from the easiest transactions to more and more complex transactions.

8.      The analysis takes into account all the SPEs, including those with at least a 40% state
ownership, except for those in the banking and financial system, which are not included here.
Ultimately, the analysis involves 27 SPEs, 17 o f which i s PES(70%), 7 SM1 (30 %) and 3 SM2.
As well, deeper analysis was conducted on the 12 SPEs inthe productive sector (44%), 6 (22%)
o f which export their products. Some investigations were rather limited because o f data
unavailability or unreliability. Overall, the 12 SPEs in the productive sector were analyzed,
reviewing indicators such as taxation, value added, indebtedness and subsidies; employment and
labor costs; investment; profits and savings; exports, imports and protection.         Inaddition, a
sectoral analysis was conducted where data was available, including inthe main agri-food sectors
(coffee, tea, cotton, sugar, rice andbeer); textile, chemistry, energy and telecommunications.

9.      Financial analyses revealed that the majority o f PESoperating in these productive sectors
no longer have equity capital and are almost in default and bankruptcy. Inthe agri-food sector,
PESoperating inthe coffee sector is almost indefault and bankruptcy, as well as those operating
inthe rice and tea sectors, while the cotton sector is experiencing serious difficulties related to
the obsolescence production tools. Similarly, the textile sector is totally bankrupt, as is the
energy sector, while the PE operating inthe chemical sector no longer exists. Only the sugar and
telecommunications sectors have shown some viability.

10.     There i s chronic debt in the productive parapublic sector, taxation i s often avoided and
fraudulent, and the level o f competitiveness i s very low. In 2005, the debt o f the 27 operational
SPPs stood at Fbu 175 billion, or exactly 102% o f Government revenues (excluding grants) and
20% o f GDP. Government subsidies o f about Fbu 3 billion fill the deficits resulting from often
chaotic management, while the state resorted to the treasury, worsening the domestic deficit, in
addition to the guarantees given to PESin difficulty, which, in turn, asphyxiated the financial
system, which is still very fragile.

11.     The immediate causes o f this situation are linked primarily to the choice o f economic
policy and thus, to the political economy o f developing countries, particularly the least developed
ones. These include primarily: (i)Government protection, which in turn promotes lax
management that does not necessarily adhere to management standards for a competitive
environment, nor to any obligation for results, which in turn erodes the profitability and
performance o f the enterprise; (ii) the recourse to state subsidies and to chronic debt - with or
without state guarantees - to address the said consequences; and (iii)   resistance to change and to



                                                  110

reform, well orchestrated by interest groups (lobbies) and pressure groups (union), which are
better   organized    socially    than  downstream    consumer     organizations    (recipients    o f
products/services from the said enterprises).

12.     The consequence o f this type o f choice is the introduction o f distortions that inhibit the
dynamism o f the economy. The state has in fact continued to maintain inefficient units through
subsidies and all types o f tax exemptions and waivers; the provision o f debt guarantees with no
hope o f reimbursement and/or protection schemes that are not accompanied by catching-up
policies and, therefore, are not based on any form o f economic rationality or guarantee o f long-
term efficiency. These distortions generally weaken the financial system (which i s itself in an
embryonic stage); combined with the effects o f the protection o f public entities inthe productive
sector, this weakening ends up stifling the development o f the private sector and, thus, o f the
economy.

13.     Inthe context o f Burundi, quality technical information, through comprehensive studies
on the entire state portfolio in the productive sector, would allow the Government to make
optimal choices in the reform o f the SPESand to justify them. Indeed, it would enhance the
authorities,  capacity to anticipate and take an option on the best possible reform choices when
necessary (restructuring, mixed or independent management, privatization o f management,
privatization, liquidation, etc.). It should be combined with a communications program on the
relevance o f the SPE reform, which i s indispensable, particularly for the different groups
involved.

14.     The objective o f the reform o f the parapublic sector in Burundi can be beneficial in at
least two aspects. A first benefit i s improving the Government's fiscal space, primarily by
reducing the weight o f public enterprises on public finances. This i s essentially by reducing
direct and indirect subsidies that had become rather heavy in the context o f an often deficient
state management. Also, streamlining and expanding the tax base by eliminating all types o f
exemptions conferred by the public status o f firms (for example, for imports), and improving
performance by streamlining the management. A second benefit i s to jump-start and boost the
economy by promoting the private sector, which plays the role o f engine o f the economy through
management based on a performance criterion (accountability) and promotion o f the productive
sector.

15.     Inprinciple, sustained and long-term growth is achieved when productive activity is
based on a dynamic private sector in a competitive environment. In this particular case, the
impact o f productivity and scale-based gains on the economy in general could translate into the
creation o fjobs and added value, and specifically, the impact on the budget could increase the
fiscal space and contribute more to the financing o f infrastructures to support the economy.
Conversely, when productive activity i s conducted by the state, as i s the case with public
enterprises operating in an "imperfect" market environment (and a more or less efficient
management), the impact o f enterprises on the economy in general can translate into debt that
undermines the financial system-often      with state guarantees-and   the specific impact on the
budget translates into subsidies that reduce the fiscal space and, while contracting investments,
runcounter to theveryprinciple ofoptimalresource allocation.

16.      Inthe context ofregionalization, temporary protectioncan only be efficient ifit covers a
dynamic internal process for transforming the economy, for catching-up, and for improving the
legal business framework. Technological progress i s unavoidable when one needs to be able to
compete eventually with dynamic partners. However, state management o f the productive
economy neither helps promote competitiveness nor close the technological gap, since the
behavior o f economic agents i s guided by signals from a very imperfect market inthis case. The
withdrawal o f the state from productive activity and the restoration o f the principle o f a market-
based competition are essential for a moratorium to be useful, particularly when the economy
must prepare itself for openness. The latter considers the improvement o f the business
environment as a sign o f the credibility o f policies that promote foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows. Hence, the vision o f an emerging private sector can draw on the theory o f regional
strategic partnerships Cjoint ventures, sub-contracting, sectors), with each party underscoring its
comparative advantages, revealedhistorical (market preeminence versus implantation costs,
knowledge o f the environment, availability o f cheap labor, etc.) or built (technological progress,
availability o f support infrastructures and o frelated services, etc.).

                                        Executive Summary

1.      Burundi, situated inthe heart o fthe Great Lakes Region, is one o f the poorest nations on
earth. As a small landlocked country with some 7 million persons it has one o f the highest
population densities on the African continent. Socio-economic fault-lines dating back to colonial
intervention in the nineteenth century have given Burundi a particularly violent and turbulent
history. Beset by coups d'etats, presidential assassination and genocide, the country has been
caught in a cycle o f violence and under-development whereby brief periods o f peace have been
followed by further state repression and armed conflict. Since the 2000 Arusha peace accords, the
Pretoria agreement o f late 2003 with the CNDD-FDD, the peaceful elections o f 2005 and the
recent Dar as Salaam peace agreement with the FNL have all ushered in a period o f relative
stability. However, this fragile political process has not been matched by a parallel rebound in
economic growth which i s the normal experience o f `post-conflict' countries in Africa. As
recognized in the country's PRSP and the concomitant UN Peace building Strategy, economic
growth i s a vital component o f national and international efforts to sustain peace in Burundi,
along with security sector reform and good governance. The critical question for policy makers i s
how to support economic growth insuch a way as to reinforce the durability o fBurundi'speace.

2.      The Sources o f Rural Growth (SoRG) strategy aims to identify those areas in Burundi's
rural economy with the most immediate potential that can be harnessed to stimulate growth in
such a way as to consolidate peace. In so doing, it provides guidance for the next three years on
the means with which the Bank with its partners can help the Burundian Government and its
people toward economic recovery after a long period o f civil war. Inproviding this counsel, it i s
recognized that by focusing on the rural economy inthe short term, the Government will have to
work on other critical areas in the medium term in order to sustain growth. This will be
particularly important for the industrial and service sectors to absorb a burgeoning youthhl and
increasingly urbanized generation. However, a sound agricultural base will be a vital foundation
for an economic model that helps break Burundi's tragic cycle o f violence. And therein lays the
central question -how can such a growth strategy break this cycle o f violence?

3.      The challenge for the Government i s to take stock o f the key lessons suggested by
international best practice and the Burundian history so as to develop the foundations for long-
lasting growth. Key lessons from international best practice suggest the need for outlining a
coherent peace building framework, designing pro-poor reforms, strengthening institutions to
enable effective aid absorption, and prioritizing reforms to overcome the most binding
constraints. In Burundi, the vicious cycle o f poverty and violence was fed by unbalanced
investmentsbetween the three main constituencies o f the society: the state, communities and the
private sector. Weak governance, political instability and the inability to set up a proper business
climate to soundly develop the private sector are important reasons why the state and the
Burundian communities have been so miserably supported and the private sector did not yet
become a fruitful source o f growth for the economy. In Burundi indeed, most investments were
poorly designed, channeling rent seeking for a private sector, which was typically made o f an
urban elite, specifically close to the ruling Government. The SoRG strategy builds upon




                                                113

international best practice and defines sectoral interventions that address key weaknesses the
three main constituencies o f the Burundiansociety.

4.     The main purpose o f the SoRG is to support an increase in economic growth to some 6
percent per year. The two objectives in meeting this aim are to i)boost food security by
strengthening food production and ii)transform use o f Burundi's rural assets, notably coffee, to
enable this sector to become a better contributor to shared growth in the short term and to
provide the state with sufficient revenues to assist in the long term diversification o f the
economy. Inorder to undertake these objectives, the SoRGstrategy is comprised o f three pillars:


    0  At the state level, our work advocates for a strong and effective macroeconomic
       management and the design and implementation o f radical reforms, which are pre-
       conditions for a steady and long-lasting growth. These changes would require drastically
       improving state capacity to effectively design pro-poor policies and undertake the much
       needed reforms (including the privatization o f the main series o f agricultural parastatal)
       and productive investments.

       At the communitylevel,the SoRGrecommends investing inhuman and physical capital
       to ensure food security and further develop the agricultural sector. Over the last forty
       years o f cyclical violence, communities have certainly been the most injured
       constituencies o f the Burundian society, struggling to make use o f trivial investments,
       totally unable to satisfy the most basic needs. The overarching objective should now be to
       move away from emergency conditions, where the focus i s on subsistence only.

       At the privatesector level, the report recommends a radical change inbusiness conduct
       and interventionto respond to the ineffective focus on commerce and under-investment in
       production. The development o f an economy i s generally made possible by the expansion
       o f a vigorous and scrupulous private sector, which serve the nation's interest while
        seeking (and finding) its own. One o f the roles o f the state i s to foster the reinforcement
       and the enlargement o f such a private sector by setting rules which makes private and
       public interests intersect. The ultimate goal i s therefore not only to increase the private
        sector involvement inthe economy, but also its very contribution to shared growth.

       The main interventions recommended by the SoRG are further explained and detailed in
        Chapter 1. The need for long-lasting and stable performance in Burundi i s developed in
        Chapter 2. The following Chapters 3 and 4 establish a diagnostic o f the agriculture sector,
       concluding with Chapter 5 which suggests ways to lift the most bindingconstraints.

    Key findings

A.      (Chapter 1)Breakingthe cycle: a strategy for conflictsensitive ruralgrowth

5.     Burundi's turbulent history reveals the inextricable link between civil war and the
country's growth, poverty levels, and economic composition. The vicious cycle o f poverty and
violence in Burundiwas fed by unbalanced investments between the state, communities and the

private sector. As part o f a longer term effort, the SoRG defines a new approach to better target
investments and reforms and enable the Government to drive positive change. It describes sector
interventions that the World Bank could carry out inthe next three years to help the Government
of Burundiaddress weaknesses o f the three main constituencies o f its society. The strategy builds
upon the main findings o f the contributors to the SoRG report in the light o f a three-pillar
approach, inspiredbyAddison, and presented inthe figure below.

B.      (Chapter 2) Burundi's growth:the needfor long-lastingandstableperformance

6.      The macroeconomic analysis identifies past sources o f growth and binding constraints. It
reveals that the weakness and volatility o f Burundian growth resulted from the economy's very
high dependence on coffee and the mediocre performances of the sector. Also, the analysis
underlines the impact o f high and ineffectively targeted Government expenditures and a debt
ratio above sub-Saharan average. It suggests that full attention should be given to reinforcing
State capacity and transformation toward the state being an instrument o f development rather
thanpredation.

7.      The poverty analysis acknowledges that growth i s a necessary but insufficient condition
for poverty reduction. It identifies specific vulnerabilities and potential opportunities in Burundi
that need to be considered to soundly tailor sector reforms and effectively target investments.
This analysis shows that households in agriculture are not only the largest but also the poorest
group. Hence, the State should target agricultural households first and this i s why the SoRG
strategy focuses on the rural economy.




                                                 115

C.      (Chapter3) Agriculturalrecovery:food securityandbeyond

8.      The food situation in Burundi remains a matter o f great concern. For several years, food
crises have been rife in certain parts o f the country, a consequence o f repeated conflicts,
insufficient food production and the rapid population growth resulting from highbirth rates and
the return o frefugees.

9.      Subsistence crops and livestock products represent the main source o f income for most
households and amount to 91% o f agricultural GDP. The current performance o f these sub-
sectors i s very low and imports o f foodstuff are increasing steadily, causing important currency
losses. The weak results o f the agricultural sector are partly explained by inefficient production
systems, arduous access to inputs and the dramatic lack o f investment in human and physical
capital. With a food demand increasing annually at a 3-6% rate, it i s urgent to endeavor turning
the subsistence crops and livestock sub-sectors into muchbetter contributors to growth. Chapter
3 points a way forward to ensure agriculture recovery and move beyond by promoting the
commercialization o f food produces.

D.      (Chapter 4) Exportcrops: towarda significantcontributionto growth

10.     Cash crops account for almost all export revenue. The main contributor by far i s coffee,
which i s produced by about 800,000 households and accounts for 85 percent o f the country's
export revenue despite its mediocre performance. Tea is currently Burundi's second largest cash
crop. It provides 12 percent o f total merchandise exports and i s producedby four estates and over
50,000 smallholders in arid highlands, where no competing crop can be grown. Burgeoning
horticulture has undergone recent efforts supported by the DTIS and appears as one o f the solid
candidates for diversification o f agricultural risk and revenue.

11.     Chapter 4 (D) suggests that the reinforcement o f export crops' contribution to growth will
require a sound privatization o f the coffee and tea sub-sectors and the development o f small
entrepreneurship inthe horticulture sub-sector. The privatization o fthe coffee and tea sub-sectors
should ensure that the property transfer, from the public to the private sector, i s a means o f
improving the sector's competitiveness and o f contributing to shared growth. Increasing the
contribution o f horticulture to growth entails a much different approach, as there i s no public
asset to privatize. It will mostly require improving the business climate and access to rural
finance.

E.      (Chapter 5) Overcomingthe mainobstaclesto growth

12.     Inpost-conflict Burundi, security o f goods and people is a prime obstacle. Overcoming
this major hurdle entails improving security and justice while reducing inequalities and
discrimination. Preventing conflict would also imply better managing the land tenure issues,
which fuel tensions and directly reduce investments and people's incentives to perform.

13.     Given its financial resources, landlocked location, and mostly rural nature, post-conflict
Burundihas encountered considerable difficulties indeveloping effective infrastructure services.
Short-term priority i s to strengthen the rural road network to unlock food production. The next
urgent step would entail rationalizing energy production and distribution to better use existing



                                                  116

facilities and enable sustainable growth. Developing electricity generation and distribution could
foster processing agricultural products and therefore increase value added. The country lacks an
Internet backbone reaching out to all provinces and enabling connections to other countries o f the
sub-region.

14.      Finally, doing business remains costly and riskyinBurundi.It is important to improve the
legal and regulatory framework and reduce costs while increasing availability o f production
factors. Another source o f improvement o f the investment climate would require strengthening
the public institutions, which support private businesses.

       ANNEX 8: BURUNDIERSGI1 The CoffeeSubsector Summaryof RecentAnalytical Work
                                             -                      -

1.       In2002, a very comprehensive technical and financial audit was performedby Agrifor
Consult with financial support from the European Comrni~sion~~.The work consisted o f three
main reports:

    0    an in-depth diagnostic o f the coffee sector inBurundi,

    0    a strategy for state divestiture from the Burundian coffee sector with a detailed action
         plan, suggestingthe needto privatize the sector's assets after refurbishment

    0    priority action plans to refurbishthe sector's assets and move towards privatization.

2.       Importantly, the strategy identified privatization as the best option for state divestiture,
but did not provide any further detail on the desirable privatization scheme (type o f investors,
unbundling strategy, deregulation process, sale method, etc.). Inparticular, the work suggested
that producer organizations could be given partial or full ownership o f a number o f washing
stations but didnot explain how they would be giventhe capacity (including financial) to become
such stakeholders. Let us note that the third report provides all relevant information on current
contractual arrangements with SOGESTAL, SODECO and OCIBU, as well as a technical and
financial evaluation o f each and every assets o fthe sector before and after its refurbishment.

3.       In2004, the findings ofthese reports and similar work conducted onthe tea and cotton
sub-sectors were included in the `strategy for State Divestiture from cash crops (coffee, tea and
cotton)',42 led by the Ministries o f Finance and good governance. The strategy was endorsed
same year by the Inter-Ministerial Counsel for Privatization.

4.       Based on these inputs, reforms of the sector resumed in2005 - after a long hiatus related
to the civil war - with the adoption o f a presidential decree43to liberalize price setting and
marketing activities, to eliminate taxes on orchards, and to remove state guarantees for financing
the sector. InMarch 2006 the Coffee Reform Steering Committee was created and inNovember
2006, Government o f Burundi adopted a sectoral action plan that included a strategy for the
privatization or divestiture o f the washing-stations and drill-mill factories as a key reform
measure.

5.       In2006 and 2007, the World Bank supported further work needed for determination of
the divestiture method with the highest potential to enhance the sector's contribution to shared
growth. Main findings are as follows. The World Bank poverty profile investigated how people
inBurundiperceivedtheprivatization agendas andenlightened the needto set forth the details o f

A study led by Michigan State University (MSU) provided an updated diagnostic of the
Burundian coffee sector, enlightening its potential to access high value export markets and the
sets o f actions needed to improve production and marketing capacities a~cordingly.~~assess             To
this finding, Government of Burundiorganized a couple o fvisits o f specialty coffee roasters and
major players o f the specialty market bought Burundian coffee. Marketing toolkits, including a
website and a media kit, were then developed to further promote Burundian coffee. This reality
check was followed by another study led by MSU, identifying pilots for fast-tracking
privatization. Candidate for eligible for such operation are washing stations with a clear potential
to produce specialty coffee.4sBased on objective criteria (soil, altitude, etc.), this work suggests
differentiating state divestiture methodology depending on whether the washing-stations can be
used to access specialty markets or commodity markets. Indeed, fully-washed coffee has a better
potential to access specialty markets if it i s processed in a station owned or operated by producer
organizations or small entrepreneurs while it could be more competitive on the commodity
market ifproduced by larger operators with the potential to benefit from scale and scope returns.
Inparallel, InternationalAlert carried out an in-depthanalysis ofrisks relatedto State divestiture
from the coffee sector in Burundi.46This analysis identifies tools meant at mitigating these risks
and making sure that coffee sector reform will fuel growth and not conflicts. It i s therefore an
important input for On the Frontier, the consulting company who i s helping Government o f
Burundi designs a national communication campaign on the objective and means o f the coffee
sector reforma4'Eventually, an audit has also been performed to update financial information on
the sector.

                                ANNEX 9: BURUNDIERSGI1 The Tea Subsector
                                                                     -

1.         Background and key issues. Tea i s the second largest agricultural export after coffee.
Between 2001 and 2006, average tea production amounted to 7,500 tons. Two thirds were
produced by the smallholders51. The average earning for a Burundian tea grower in 2006 was
about US$46. Most production, transformation, trade, marketing, and regulatory aspects o f the
industryare handledbythe parastatal Office duThk duBurundi(OTB).

2.         Despite changing world market conditions such as declining prices, demand for quality
differentiation, and competition from man-made beverages (especially soft drinks), and the
structure o f Burundi's tea industryhas remainedlargely unchanged since its inception. The sector
faces numerous constraints, including structural inefficiencies o f the tea factories and plantations,
poor incentives to smallholders and estate laborers, limiteduse o f inputs and extension services,
and non-existent research. These constraints have ledto a considerable decline inthe quality and
the price o f Burundian tea. For example, during2005 and 2006, Burundiantea was traded with a
30 percent discount over Kenyan tea at the Mombasa tea auction where most East African tea is
traded.

3.         Reforms inthe tea sector should address constraints to profitability, competitiveness, and
the ability o f the industry to innovate in response to new opportunities. A steering committee
with representatives o f all stakeholders to coordinate, manage and monitor reforms in the tea
sector has been created. This entity can provide leadership for the actions in the tea sector
identifiedbelow.

4.         At present the amalgamation of ownership, management, and regulatory authority within
the OTB i s serving the industry poorly and creating a drain on the public budget. In order to
understand options for alternative structures achievable with minimal disruption in the
performance o f the industry, a financial and technical audit o f OTB should be conducted.
Discussing the findings o f this audit will permit consensus building among all the stakeholders
around the reform process. The purpose o f this audit will be to identify clusters o f assets that can
be divested as unit, and also to identify those that should be closed in order to reduce excess
capacity and improve profitability. Once the asset clusters have been identified, a time-bound
plan for divesting these from state ownership should be formulated, together with an agreed
modality for proceeding. The state farms will require specific attention separately from the
industrial assets. During the interim and while divestiture i s beingplanned, management o f the
asset clusters should be contracted out with appropriate safeguards to protect their value from
further deterioration. The conditions o f the management contract should specify the fee and an
agreed formula for sharing o fnet revenues between and among actors inthe industry.

5.         Once the asset clusters have been identified and contracted, the residual functions o f OTB
can be identified and the capacity o f the entity to perform them assessed. For example, OTB may


5' Tea i s produced in five regionsby estates and smallholders. Average green leafyields were about 4.0 tons per
hectare for the smallholders compared to 4.8 tons per hectare for the factory estates. Yields o f made tea (the finished
product) o f one ton per hectare are less than halfo f the regional well runplantations. Inaddition to their sub-
standard equipment, Burundi's tea factories are using only 41% o f their installed capacity compared to 70% for
competing producers.



                                                            121

remain as a clearing house for information about market conditions and opportunities, or an
entity for registry o frecognized qualities andproducts. OTB mayrequire additional assistance to
undertakethe identifiedfunctions.

6.      Once the industry structure has been decided upon and the approach to divestiture agreed,
regulatory functions to complement the selected structure will need to be identified. For
example, if the structure chosen i s a territorial concession for processing, entry will need to be
regulated. Ifa fully competitive structure, mechanisms for registering liens against pre-financing
o f inputs will be required. These regulatory issues can be identified only after the decisions on
divestiture are made, and they will be very important for facilitating success o f the reforms.
Decisions about public and private participation in improved advisory services for tea growers
can also bemade after the basic structural issues are settled.

7.      In summary, the reform program will include five main activities. A financial and
technical audit o f OTB i s necessary to, identify clusters o f assets that can be divested as units,
and assets that should be closed to reduce excess capacity and improve profitability. A time-
bound plan for divestiture and modality o f proceeding should be developed. Prior to divestiture
and while divestiture i s being planned, outsource management o f the asset clusters. Clarify
formula for division o f net revenues (after subtraction o f the management fee) between and
among actors in the industry (separately for those working in and with state farms, and
smallholders). It i s also necessary to identify residual functions o f OTB and assess capacity to
fulfill them.   Finally, depending on the industry structure selected (e.g., fully competitive,
territorial concessions, regulated monopoly, or other) identify the set o f complementary
regulations required to facilitate good performance o f the structure, and the entity or entities
responsible for undertaking the regulation.

IMFCompletesSixthandFinalReview Underthe PRGFArrangementwith
BurundiandApprovesUS$11.4MillionDisbursement
Press Release No. 08/07
January 16,2008

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth and
final review o f Burundi's economic performance under the SDR 69.30 million (about US$110.3
million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion o f the
review will enable the release o f an amount equivalent to SDR 7.15 million (about US$11.4
million), which will fully disbursethe total amount available under the arrangement.

Incompleting the review, the Board also granted Burundi a waiver for the nonobservance o f a
quantitative performance criterion pertaining to a temporary accumulation o f external payments
arrears and a structural performance criterion on the establishment o f a unified data file for
computerized payroll management.

The PRGF arrangement was originally approved on January 23,2004 inan amount equivalent to
SDR 69.30 (about US$110.3 million) (see Press Release No. 04/13). In July 2006, the
arrangement was extended to September 30,2007, andthen again to January 22,2008.

The PRGF is the IMF'sconcessional facility for low-income countries. It is intendedthat PRGF-
supported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a
participatory process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This i s intended to ensure that PRGF-supported
programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and
social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of
0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5%-year grace period on principal payments.

Following the Executive Board's discussion on Burundi's economic performance, Mr. Murilo
Portugal, DeputyManaging Director and Acting Chair, stated:

"The authorities' commitment to sound macroeconomic policies, and the outlook for stronger
economic growth and reduced inflation in2008 are encouraging. Since mid-2007, the Burundian
authorities have taken steps to address governance issues, shore up fiscal balances, and improve
economic and monetary policy performance. Maintaining steadfast policy implementation will
beneededto raise investment,sustain higher economic growth andreduce poverty substantially.


                                               123

"Improved revenue performance coupled with careful management o f expectations for a peace
dividendinthe public sector will contribute to strengthening Burundi'sfiscal position. Enhanced
public financial management, incorporating effective financial controls, will help to ensure fiscal
integrity.

"Improvements in the governance and efficiency o f the central bank, including measures to
enhance its independence and accountability, are encouraging. The progressive strengthening o f
operations and the pursuit o f a proactive approach, along with reinforced cooperation between
the Ministry o f Finance and the central bank, will help to improve liquidity forecasting and add
to the effectiveness o f monetary policy. Work i s ongoing to bolster the banking system, by
improving supervision and raising bank capitalization norms.

"It is important that structural reform efforts, including preparations to privatize the productive
sectors o f the economy, especially the coffee sector, be accelerated. Improving the investment
climate will be vital to attracting private investment and spurring economic growth.

"Burundi is in debt distress. Progress toward the completion point under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative has been slower than envisaged. Efforts towards this end need
to be accelerated, debt-service payment procedures improved and recourse to external borrowing
on non-concessional terms should be avoided," Mr.Portugal said.
