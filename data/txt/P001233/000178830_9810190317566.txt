INTERNATIONAL DEVELOP WENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOHMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPIENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $12.6
million to the Republic of Kenya for a highway maintenance project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        During the past ten years the Bank Group has made six loans and
credits for highways and agricultural roads in Kenya. Because of concern
that new construction was in danger of outstripping Kenya's capacity to
maintain the road system in the face of rapidly increasing traffic, funds were
provided under the last highwiays project (Loan No. 639 KE) for a consultant`.z
study of the whole maintenance problem. The study was completed in
December 1969, and in January 1970 the Government requested Bank Group
assistance in financing a highway maintenance program based on the con-
sultant's recommendations. The project was appraised in the field in
March 1970.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington in
October 1970. The Kenya delegation consisted of:    Messrs. P. Shiyukah,
Permanent Secretary, IMTinistry of Works; N. Nganga, Chief Finance Officer,
Ministry of Finance; S. 1,ibugua, Engineer-in-Chief, Ministry of lorks;
N. P. Radier, Chief Engineer (Roads), Ministry of Works; and G. P. Manners.
Chief Engineer (Roads Supernumerary), Ministry of WVorks.
4.        The proposed credit would be the eleventh credit to Kenya, which
has also received four Bank loans. A loan of $8.3 million to the City
Council of Nairobi for the Nairobi WTater Supply Project, which was approved
by the Executive Directors on November 17, 1970, is expected to
be si&ned shortly. The position of the other loans and credits as of
November 30, 1970, is surmarized below:

5.        The situation with respect to the rate of disbursement of past
Bank loans and IDA credits in Kenya was described in detail in the Report
and Recommendation of the President to the E,cecutive Directors in connection
with a loan to the City Council of Nairobi for a water supply project
(Report No. P-872, dated November 4, 1970). No major changes have taken
place during the intervening four weeks.
6.        Other lending under active consideration for Bank Group financing
during the current fiscal year includes a $29 million loan for the Kamburu
hydroelectric scheme.

7.        In addition to the lending set out in paragraph 4 above, the
Bank has made six loans for common services in East Africa.   All these
loans are guaranteed jointly and severally by Kenya, Tanzania and Ugar,da;
the United Kingdom is also guarantor of the first loan for railways. The
following is a summary statement of Bank loans for common services as of

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CPRDIT
8.        BORPBWER:                 Republic of Kenya
AM"OUNT:                  US$12.6 million equivalent in various
currencies
PURPOSE:                  To help finance the Government's
highway maintenance program, including
the purchase of equipment, construction
and improvement of regional workshops,
offices and road camps, construction
of additional training center facil-
ities and provision of related con-
sultant and specialized staff services
AMORTIZATION:             In 50 years, including a ten-year
period of grace, through semi-annual
installments of one-half of one
percent from April 1, 1981 through
October 1, 1990 and of one and one-
half percent from April 1, 1991 through
October 1, 2020
SERVICE CHARGE:           3/4 of 1/ per annum
ESTEIA'TD ECONOIIC
RATE OF RETURN:         33%
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        A report entitled 'Ulppraisal of a Highwaay lMaintenance Project"
(No. PTR-61a) is attached. The project is desIgned to give the i'inistry
of TWJorks (NisOW) the capacity to maintain adequately the entire 25,000 mile
road network in Kenya, for which it will in future be responsible,
and to eliminate the backlog' of maintenance on about 12,000 miles of the
most important roads. The project comprises:
(a)  acquisition of road maintenance and workshop equipment,
including spare parts;
(b)  construction and improvement of 6 regional workshops and
of all necessary offices and road maintenance camps;
(c)  construction of additional training center facilities and
acquisition of training equiprment;



(d) provision of consultants services to introduce cost
accounting and management procedures in the Roads
Department and to assist with equipment procurement;
(e) provision of services of consultants or other qualified
staff to train maintenance personnel at all levels in
the Roads Department;
(f) provision of qualified personnel to fill key positions
in the Roads Department of the Ministry of W4orks and to
train Kenyans to take over these positions in due course.
10.       The total estimated cost of the project is US$18.1 million
equivalent and the foreign exchange component $13 million.   The United
Kingdom is making a grant of $0.4 million equivalent towards the foreign
exchange costs, the balance of which would be financed bar the proposed
$12.6 million IDA credit.  The local costs, amounting to $5.1 million
equivalent, would be met by the C-overnment of Kenya. Eapenditures
amounting to $150,000 incurred since January 1, 1970, for consultant
services for preparation of contract documents and for operation of
the training center would be eligible for reimbursement from the proposed
credit.
11.       Inadequate maintenance of the road system at a time when the
volume of traffic is rising rapidly is not only jeopardizing the past
heavy investment in roads but is also increasing transport costs to the
Kenya economy, particularly in the crucial sectors of agriculture and
tourism. The object of the present project is to bring poorly maintained
roads up to stzandard and to assure satisfactory standards of maintenance
for the system as a whole.  In terms of the resulting savings in vehicle
operating costs, the project is estimated to have an economic rate of
return of 33%, assuming a future growth in traffic of 7' a year, which
is equal to the average annual rate of increase realized during the last
ten years. At a rate of increase in traffic of only 5% a year, the rate
of return would still be 28%.
12.       The proposed project is closely related to the reorganization
of the Roads Branch of the illinistry of W*torks recommended in the consultants
study financed under the Bank's 1969 highways loan. In the past, res-
ponsibility for maintaining the Kenyan roads system was divided among the
1inistry of Works and twenty-eight local authorities, whose administrative
and executive capacity could not keep pace with the expansion of the roads
system and the wear and tear resulting from a rapidly increasing volume
of traffic. Complete responsibility for the maintenance of the entire
network of roads is in the process of beinE, transferred to a reorganized
and strengthened Roads Department of the MOiJ, which would be directly
responsible for the execution of the proposed project.



- 6 -
13.       To implement the proposed project successfully it is essential
that twenty-seven key positions at the headquarters and regional offices
of the Roads Department be filled with fully qualified staff.   Since most
of these positions cannot be filled by Kenyans at this time, the Governrent
is actively seeking to recruit overseas. To the extent possible the
Government is anxious to retain staff on a grant basis under bilateral
assistance and has therefore approached a number of possible donor countries.
The Government has already obtained the agreement of the Norwegian Govern-
ment to fill three of the headquarters posts and of the U.K. Overseas
Development Administration (ODA) to recruit staff for the remaining
headquarters posts, five of which the ODA has already filled. In the
event that efforts to recruit some or all of the regional staff through
bilateral assistance are not successful, the Government has made standby
arrangements to recruit them through the U.K. Crown Agents for Overseas
Governments and Administration on a contract basis, and the proposed
Credit provides funds to finance such appointments. To the extent that
staff are obtained under bilateral assistance an appropriate part of
the credit would be reallocated or cancelled. The draft credit agreement
provides that appointment of the 27 key staff must be made within 9 months
of the date of signature.
14.       An important objective of the proposed project would be to ensure
that in the future sufficient numbers of suitably qualified Kenyans are
available to fill professional and other tecinical positions within the
Roads Department. The Government has undertaken to prepare as a condition
of effectiveness a plan which is acceptable to the Association for the
appointment of as many understudies as can realistically be made available
for the twenty-seven positions described in paragraph 13 above. Recognizing
that alternative employment opportunities have often been more attractive to
qualified Kenyans than civil service positions, the Government has under-
taken to prepare within six months of credit signature a comprehensive
plan to attract and train professional staff for the Roads Department.
Finally, finance would be provided under the proposed credit for the
services of consultants to administer and operate a training center for
maintenance personnel at lower supervisory levels for the Roads Department.
15.       Procurement of all equipment and spare parts, except training
center equipment which would be financed under the U.K. grant by competitive
bidding within the U.K., would be on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Improvement and construction of the regional facilities would be
carried out by Government forces or by local contractors selected on the
basis of competitive bidding within Kenya. These buildings are mostly
of low standard construction, scattered throughout the country, and would
be unlikely to attract international bidding.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRU1YETS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of Kenya, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
under Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text



of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Development
Credit Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of Agreements for
projects of this kind.
PART V - THE ECOI\OI
17.       An economic report entitled "Economic Development Prospects
in Kenya" (Report No. AE-6a, in two parts, dated October 22, 1969) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on October 31, 1969 (R69-209).
Since then the Government of Kenya has published its 1970-74 Development
Plan which is essentially the same as the draft plan examined in the
economic report. The report found the Plan to be realistic, and concluded
that, on the basis of the past economic performance of the country and the
sound financial and economic policies of the Government, Kenya would
continue to warrant substantial external assistance. These views were
supported by representatives of other donors at the meeting of the
Consultative Group for East Africa on Kenya in February7 1970.  An economic
and preinvestment studies mission has recently returned from East Africa
and a report, reviewying recent economic developments and progress made
during; the first year of the 1970-74 Plan, will be distributed to the
Executive Directors in early 1971.
18.       Because of the probable increased inflow of private capital and
the end of post-independence grants, the average terms on which Kenya can
obtain external resources in the future are likely to be harder than in
the past. IWTithin moderate liriits, the econony can sustain a somewhat
harder blend of aid than in the past. However, given the likelihood of its
being able to absorb increasing amounts of external assistance, Kenya needs
to secure as much concessional aid as possible to keep its debt service
burden within reasonable limits.
19.       A basic data sheet is annexed.
PART VI - CO1T,?LIACE WITH APTICLES OF AGREE'i=T
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOM'MNDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
