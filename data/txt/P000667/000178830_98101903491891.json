(b) bituminous surfacing of two other primary\n            roads (approximately 170 kms); (c) the preparation of\n            feasibility studies and the review of designs for about 800\n            kms of high priority roads (including about 600 kms of\n            secondary roads); and (d) a program of advisory services,\n            technical assistance, and training designed to improve the\n            operation of the IHA. The project would provide reliable\n            all-weather access to areas of great agricultural potential\n            which can be developed only if adequate transport facilities\n            are provided.
