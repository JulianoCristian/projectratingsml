SECOND TRADE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Loan Summary
Borrowers               Jamaica
Amounts                 US$30.0 million
Termst                  Payable in 17 years, including a grace period of 5
years at the standard variable interest rate.
Loan Descriltions       The proposed loan would support the Government's
trade and financial sector reform program begun in
1987, the first phases of which were supported by
the first Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment
Loan (Loan 2848-JM). The trade reform would reduce
protection and make it more uniform across sectors
and subsectors and increase competition and the
efficiency of enterprises. The financial sector
reforms would strengthen the means for manaSging
monetary policy, improve the regulatory framework
and supervision of financial institutions and make
the allocation of financial resources more
efficient. The loan would finance general imports
subject to certain restriction.
Disbursement Estimate:  The loan would be disbursed in two tranches.  It is
expected that the first tranche of US$15.0 million
would be disbursed soon after loan effectiveness.
The second tranche of US$15.0 million would be
released subject to a review of the adjustment
program to be held within nine months from loan
effectiveness. Disbursement of the entire loan is
expected to be completed within 12 months of loan
effectiveness.
Benefits and Risks:     The trade reform measures are expected to result in
cheaper, higher quality goods for consumers and a
more efficient allocation and use of resources.
The financial sector reforms should help reduce
credit subsidies, improve the allocation of credit
and strengthen capital markets. The general
consumption (or equivalent) tax and improved
customs admiaistration, are expected to yield
additional revenues and should thus help bolster
the Government's medium term economic program.
There is a risk, however, that if the
implementation of the general consumption tax and
the new import tax regime is not carefully managed,
their fiscal impact in the short term could
exacerbate the public sector deficit, and lead to



¢    further increases in interest rates thus depressing
J    private investment.  The proposed strengthening of
customs and tax administration and the new import
tariff structure should reduce this risk as it
would facilitate duty collection and help reduce
evasion.  Opposition to the reduction of credit
*'    subsidies could arise from farmer and industrial
2     organizations.  From a more general point of view,
any major departure from the tight fiscal and
monetary policies of recent years could render
medium term prospects unviable.
Financing Plans          The loan would be cofinanced by the Interamerican
Development Bank and the Government of Jamaica has
also requested cofinancing from the Export-Import
Bank of Japan. Such funds would also be for the
financing of greater imports, with certain
restrictions. The financing plan would be as
followss

Total                          $.05.O million

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AN) DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR
A SECOND TRADE AND FINANCIaL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT OPERATION
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$30.0 million for a Second Trade and Financial
Sector Adjustment Operation. The loan would have a term of 17 years
including five years of grace, with interest at the standard variable rate,
The loan would be cofinanced by the Inter-American Development Bank in the
amount of US$50.0 million. The Government of Jamaica has also requested
cofinancing from Japan's Export-Import Bank for cofinancing in the amount
of US$25 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Backtround
2.       Jamaica is one of the larger Caribbean islands.  Its total area is
11 thousand square kilometers, 452 under agriculture; and its population,
growing at about 1.4? per year, now totals 2.4 million, 552 living in urban
areas. A middle-income country with a per capita GNP of US$1,260 (1989),
Jamaica is well-endowed with natural resources, has a relatively well-
educated and skilled labor force in adequate supply, enjoys proximity to
North American markets, and possesses a well-developed financial system.
The country's economy is, however, highly sensitive to international price
and demand changes, and is entirely dependent on imported oil for
commercial energy consumption. Its labor and capital have also proved
likely to leave the country in periods of prolonged economic uncertainties.
3.       The principal economic activities in Jamaica are bauxitelalumina
mining and processing, tourism, manufacturing, and, in terms of employment,
agriculture. Together, these sectors account for about 55? of the
country's GDP, SOZ of its employment and 75Z of its foreign exchange
earnings. Jamaica is well known for its bauxite/alumina exports; its
tourist attractions, especially the tropical resorts along its norther
coast; and its agricultural exports of bananas, sugar, rum, coffee, ginger
and pimento. More recently, nontraditional exports have also been
developed, based on agriculture as well as manufacturing, especially
garments, furniture and leather goods.
Economic Deterioration in the 1970s
4.       From its independence in 1962 and up to 1972, Jamaica enjoyed
steady growth, with GDP expanding at an average rate of 5? per year.
Direct foreign investment in bauxite, alumina and tourism, combined with
domestic financial stability, contributed to this performance. In that
same period, however, overall employment grew at a much lower rate,
reflecting in part a shift away from labor-intensive agriculture to
bauxite/alumina and import-substitution manufacturing.



- 2 -
5.       After 1973, and through 1980, the economy experienced a period of
sustained contraction resulting from externa_i shocks and domestic policies
pursued. Increases in petroleum import costs, the impact of the mid-1970s
recession in the industrial countries on sugar and aiuminum, and the
increase in international interest rates, all affected Jamaica negatively.
Government policies to tackle unemployment and enhance the role of the
State in the economy led to an overextended public sector and a disruption
of production. At the same time an increasingly populist approach by the
Government eroded private sector confidence, contributing to a reduction of
investment and an outflow of capital and skilled manpower.
6.       By 1980 the economy had deteriorated significantly, with most
macroeconomic aggregates well below their 1973 levels in real terms. The
only item that had grown in real terms by 1980 was government consumption,
which was about 20X above its 1973 level. Jamaica's financial situation
had also become difficult. The overall deficit of the Central Government
exceeded 14X of GDP in 1980, nearly 602 financed by domestic credit. The
monetization of government deficits contributed to inflation and to a
worsening of the country's balance of payments position. By 1980, gross
international reserves covered only one month of imports payments.
Policy Adiustments and Economic Performance Since 1980
7.       At the beginning of the 1980s Jamaica's economy was unviable.  The
excessive regulation and the inward orientation of the economy for nearly a
decade had led to severe losses of output, employment and revenues. To
alter that s."tuation, Jamaica embarked on a series of reforms aimed at
liberalizing the economy, developing exports and raising domestic savings.
8.       The program of economic liberalization has involved elimination of
the import licensing system; removal of quantitative import restrictions
and their replacement with tariffs; and a phased lowering of tariffs,
consistent with Jamaica's obligations under the Caribbean Community's
Common External Tariff. Export development policies for traditional,
primary items have emphasized lower costs of production to induce exporters
to regain world market shares. The tourism sector has been promoted
vigorously to increase earnings from this important source. And, to
increase nontraditional manufactured exports, government policy has been
oriented to reducing the anti-export bias through tariff reforms, expansion
of export processing zones, and upgrading of port and shipping facilities.
9.       International competitiveness was enhanced by establishment of a
foreign exchange auction system in 1983. Subsequently, competitiveness was
maintained by the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the lowering of
domestic inflation. Beginning in mid-1988 the Jamaican dollar came under
pressure until, in November 1989, the Government fixed the rate at J$6.5
per U.S. dollar. In February 1990, the rate was devalued to J$7 per U.S.
dollar, restoring the real effective rate of the Jamaican dollar to its
mid-1988 level. However, the exchange rate system once again came under
pressure and in September 1990 a market determined exchange rate system was
established.
10.      The reforms to raise domestic savings, especially of the public
sector, have included revenue measures--such as the overhaul of the tax
system to boost tax buoyancy and substantial increases in tariffs and



-3-
charges of various public enterprises--and expenditure controls, such as
retrenchment of public sector employment, reduction of capital expenditures
and cutbacks in subsidies, together vith partial and/or complete
divestiture of public enterprises. In addition, monetary policy, in recent
years, has encouraged domestic savings via positive real interest rates.
11.      Jamaica's economy has responded positively, albeit slowly, to the
reforms implemented since 1980. In the first half of tue past decade,
economic performance improved very little. While the policy adjustments
were being put in place, bausite and alumina exports fell. There was no
real economic growth during 1981-85. At the same time, on an annual
average basis, the overall public sector deficit remained excessively high
(162 of GDP), inflation ran at 152, and the external current deficit also
remained excessively high (14X of GDP). Official grants of US$320 million
in 1981-85 still left sizable capital requirements that should have been
increasingly met by an intensified fiscal effort but which were met with
external loans, pushing Jamaica's external debt in that period from
US$2,140 million (702 of GDP) to US$3,879 million (1932 of GDP). As a
result, the debt service ratio rose from 302 to 702 before reachedulings,
and from 261 to 452 after rescheduling.
Recent Economic Performance
12.      In the latter half of the 1980e, the economy began to turn around,
aided by an improvement in the terms of trade and by good economic
management. The latter included determined efforts to lower the public
sector deficit and enhance export competitiveness. Between 1987-89,
economic growth averaged 32 per year, the overall public sector deficit
equalled about 42 of GDP, inflation averaged 102 a year and the external
current deficit (excluding grants) equalled 62 of GDP.
13.      The containment of external current account deficits, increasing
direct foreign investment flows and rising grant receipts during 1986-90
helped Jamaica to stabilize the stock of its external debt at around US$4.5
billion. This amount of debt outstanding is, however, still quite large
(around 1252 of GDP) and the debt service burden remains onerous, with
interest payments equivalent to 82 of GDP in 1990 and the debt service
ratio amounting to an estimated 342 in 1990.
14.      Jamaica has been significantly affected by the recent rise in oil
prices and by the decrease in international airline travel since the
eruption of the Gulf war. The country's fuel imports amounted to over 72
of GDP in 1989. In 1990, these price increases are estimated to have
costed Jamaica an additional US$140 million. In September 1990, the
Government of Jamaica decontrolled domestic petroleum prices and allowed
for a full pass-through of the increase in import prices, including the
devaluation effects, to the consumer.
Social Policies
15.      Jamaica's social indicators have generally exceeded those of other
countries in the LAC Region at similar levels of income reflecting, in
part, the allocation of public resources to the social sectors. Moreover,
overall progress in social indicators has been significant despite the



- 4 -
economic difficulties. For example, the infant mortality rate was reduced
by two-thirds between 1960 and the mid-1980s to only 20 per 1,000; the
level of education of the education of the labor force continues to compare
favorably to that of other countries at similar and higher income levels,
as does female participation in education. However, deterioration of the
economy and the successive stabilization and adjustment programs did affect
the level of social services. Real GDP declined during the 1970. and
growth was almost nil du-:ing 1980-85, the period which encompassed the
first phase of economic adjustment. Budgetary pressures increased and
social expenditures declined. By 1986, real outlays in education were 252
lower than in 1981 and, in health, 35Z lower. There was an accompanying
deterioration in the capacity to deliver social services, in teIMs of
physical facilities, equipment and supplies, and staffing. Housing
standards deteriorated, end unemployment increased.
16.      In response to the mounting problems, a Social Well-Being Program
was introduced in 1988, evolving in 1989 into the 1989-94 Human Resources
Development Program (HRDP). The HRDP embodies the Government's commitment
to poverty alleviation and social sector development as economic adjustment
continues and represents a major effort to adapt and improve social
programs within the constraints of the Government's economic program. It
is being strongly supported by the Bank, mainly through the Social Sectors
Development Loan approved in 1990.   It encompasses nutrition programs,
employment schemes, public health projects and education programs. The
share of primary health care services and pre-primary and primary education
in the budgets of the Ministries of Health and Education, one being
increased; there is to be increased cost recovery in public hospitals and
for secondary education; improvee targeting and nutrition aid, utilizing
savings from the phasing out of general food subsidies, is a major
objective, as is better focusing of employment aid programs, including
rural works and related training for women and youth.
Main. EcnomicIs sues and Policy Aaenda
17.      Domestic policy reforms and favorable external circumstances,
especially in 1986-88, improved Jamaica's economy considerably during the
second half of the 1980a compared to the 19709.  The economy has become
more open and buoyant, while the rate of unemployment, excluding non-
seekers, has declined, from around 102 in the 1970s and the first half of
the 19809 to around 8X now. The export base has changed, with
nontraditional agricultural and manufactured items, tourism, and other
nonfactor services becoming more prominent than bauxite, alumina, sugar and
bananas. In the 1970s, the nontraditional goods and services comprised 40X
of total exports; that share rose to 502 by the mid-1980s and is now about
552. And, led by a turnaround of public savings, the rate of domestic
savings now, 182, is substantially higher than the 10 a decade ago.
18.      Jamaica's stabilization and adjustment process, however, must
still be advanced. In the short term, it will be important to ensure
viable financial balances via careful demand management. In particular
steps need to be taken to further reduce and subsequently eliminate the
overall public sector deficit (including the losses originating from the
Central Bank's operations). Beyond that, the country needs to continue to
promote and diversify exports and to increase savings significantly above
202 of GDP in view of the substantial debt burden. Accordingly, the



medium-term economic program will need to focus ons maintenance of the
free-market exchange rate policys further rationalization of the trade
regime; important fiscal reforms, such as the introduction of the general
consumption tax; improved programming of public expenditures; elimination
of the remaining agricultural price interventions; and the design and
implementation of viable sector strategies, especially industry and
economic services.
Macroeconomic ProaRects
19.      If the adjustment process is thus enhanced, the economy could
feasibly grow at over SS per year over the medium term. The major impetus
to growth is expected to arise from increased manufacturing exports,
further expansion of tourism, rehabilitation of export agriculture,
especially bananas and coffee; a further recovery in output of bauxite and
alumina, plans and markets for which are already secured; construction
activities; and improvements in social infrastructure. At the same time,
the growth of real consumption should remain below that of real GDP to
permit domestic savings, especially public sector savings, to finance
between 552 to 60S of the country's estimated public investment outlays in
1990191-1992193.
20.      Jamaica's commodity terms of trade worsened significantly in 1990
and are not projected to improve over the medium term. Hence, strong trade
policies, including continued promotion of tourism, will be needed to
reduce progressively the external current account deficit from over
equivalent of 102 of GDP in 1989/90 to less than 41 by 1995/96. Along with
the anticipated improvements in the external current account, Jamaica will
need to continue attracting private and official capital, including
exceptional financing (e.g., reschedulings), carefully matched to the
medium-term objective of reducing the country's debt overhang and its debt
service burden. The debt service ratio, before rescheduling, is projected
to decline from 342 in 1989 to between 202-252 by 1995. For the same
period, the interest to GDP ratio is projected to decline from over 81 to
around 62.
21.      Macroeconomic projections included in the Goverment's Medium-Term
Framework for 1990/91-1992/93, have been revised to reflect subsequent
developments including the impact of the Gulf crisis on the economy. These
are sumarized in Annex I. The key macroeconomic targets, as stated in the
Letter on Economlc Policy Adjustment accompanying this loan presentation
(Annex VI), are set out below.

External Capital Reouiretrate
22.      The bulk of external financing for 1990191 was secured for Jamaica
following various resource mobilization efforts undertaken during February-
April 1990. These includeds an IMP Standby program, commercial bank and
bilateral debt reachedulings, and pledges of official grants and loans
through the auspices of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development (CGCED).
23.      The proposed Loan would provide necessary support for Jamaica's
economic program in 1990/91 and 1991/92. The Financing Plan for
1990/91-1992/93 which is set out below allows for minimal growth in foreign
exchange reserves (gross reserves stood at only US$117 million, or less
than one month of merchandise imports at the end of 1989/90 and net
reserves were negative by US$474 million, including US$360 million in
obligations to the IMP). Total external financing requirements amount to
approximately US$340 million in 1990191 and 1991192, and US$280 million in
1992193. At the projected levels of grants, direct foreign investment and



other capital flows, the requirements for net disbursements of medium and
long term debt would be US$109 million in 1990/91, US$162 million in
1991/92 and US$104 million in 1992193, with the Bank's disbursements
approximately equal to amortization in all of these years. These amounts
are expected to be available from loans already committed and from new
loans, and an extensior of rescheduling arrangements with bilateral
creditors and conmmercial banks. The resulting increase in Jamaica's
external debt would be relatively modest and the ratios of debt to GDP
(estimated at 1242 in 1990) and to exports of goods and services (2032 in
1990) would decline during 1991/92-1992193 and in subsequent years, while
the Bank's share of total debt would be reduced.

PART II - THE TRADE REGTIE
Recent Trends in Manufacturing Industry and Exports
24. After a long period of decline in the 19708, manufacturing production
resumed moderate growth in 1981 through 1983. Production declined again in
1984 but stabilized in 1985 and resumed growth in 1986 as restructuring of
the sector strengthened industrial export orientation. This is reflected
in the comparison of Jamaica's merchandise exports between 1981 and 1989
shown in Table 1.

25.      Between 1981 and 1989 merchandise exports increased from US$964.8
million to US$1,103.8 million.  This occurred despite a 122 fall in bauxite
exports which were reduced in response to a worldwide fall in the demand
for, and prices of, aluminum products. To some extent the decline in
bauxitelalumina exports has been made up by increased exports of sugar and
bananas which are other traditional products. However, the decline has
been more than made up by greatly increased non-traditional exports, over
752 of which are manufactures. A significant share of non-traditional
exports (37Z in 1989) is clothing, produced largely in the export
processing zones, the export of which is supported by the tariff
concessions provided by the Caribbean Basin Initiative and other parts of
the US tariff code. Other non-traditional exports have grown as they
benefitted from the adjustments of the exchange rate as well as the removal
of most quantitative restrictions that hampered access by exporters to
imported inputs. Moreover, with CARICOM trade greatly reduced after 1983,
exports have been redirected to non-CARICOM markets. The product
composition has shifted from chemicals, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods
suitable for the protected regiwnal market to garments, beverages,
vegetables and processed foods which are competitive in North America and
Europe.
Structure of the Trade Reslme
26.      When the Government announced its trade reform program in January
1987, the trade policy system consisting of tariffs, stamp duties and
exemptions, combined with non-tariff restrictions, was inconsistent,
complex and inefficient. It was based largely on the CET of CARICOM which
reflected the import substitution industrial development strategy of
CARICOM in the 19609. The CET established duty rates mainly between OZ and
45X of import value, with some duties as high as 702. Stamp duties imposed
on top of the CET were introduced in stages between 1978 and 1985 to



- 9 _
provide additional protection and to generate fiscal revenues (the stamp
duties increased the effective tariff to 200X or more In some cases).
However, some 135 Jamaican enterprises had been afforded duty exemptions
for 5 to 10 year periods on imports of production inputs and capital goods
for investment promotion purposes, and imports by the bauxite industry and
imports of fuel, basic foods and drugs vere exempt from duty payment.
Another major source of exemptions was the so-called Second Schedule
consisting originally of a 'Group of 77' categories (and subsequently
increased in number) under which goods could be imported duty free and
which benefitted a number of public and private inastitutions and sectors.
Finally, imports of the enterprises in the free zone and firms
manufacturing under the assembly provisions of the US tariff code were duty
free. Although import licensing was abolished in principle in 1985, the
following continued to be subject to licensing requirements: 91 items for
security and health reasons; 128 for the protection of small farmerst and
34 representing goods for which the Jamaica Commodity Trading Corporation
had an import monopoly. Finally, reference prices, together with high
additional stamp duties, provided protection for major food and steel
products. The net result of the system was to afford high protection to
production for the domestic market and low incentives to produce for
export.
The Trade Policy Reform Proaram
27.      In light of the distortions and inefficiencies caused by this
trade policy system, the Government embarked on a trade reform program to
be implemented in several stages over four years beginning in 1987. The
reform involved a change in the instruments of protection from quantitative
restrictions, reference prices and a set of duty rates with a broad range
from OX to 70X with additicnal stamp duties, to a small number of duty
rates within a fairly narrow band. The reform included a simplification of
the duty system and its administration; substantial reduction of the
differentials in the duty rates aiming at a small number of rates varying
between 52 and 302; broadening of the product base which was subject to
duty payment by eliminating all major duty exemption schemes; and
introduction of a drawback system for export manufacturers to enable them
to obtain production inputs at world prices. In order to guide the
implementation of the reform, the Government established a Tariff Reform
Committee. They also created an Anti-dumping Committee to provide
assistance to Jamaican firms exposed to dumping. The reform program was
implemented in stages in order to ease economic disruption when the economy
was still fragile, permit the Government time to adjust to any unforeseen
reductions in duty collections and for negotiations with CARICOM partners
on the ultimate goals of Jamaica's trade reform program. However, the
initial phase of the reform could be put into effect under the existing
CARICOM agreement. Vhile the reform program reduced the overall level of
protection by a small amount, to an average effective protection of about
352 to 402, it rationalized the structure of protection and reduced the
widely dispersed rates which were estimated to range from negative rates
for footwear and leather to 2202 for plastic and rubber products.
The Trade Policy Component of TFSAL I
28.      TFSAL I, the first Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment Project
(Loan 2848-JM) supported the first two steps of the trade reform program.
Prior to second tranche release, and as shown in the attached Matrix of
Trade and Financial Sector Policy Reforms (Annex V), the Government had:



- 10 -
(a) reduced the stamp duty on raw material imports from 162 to 102;
(b) introduced a 52 duty on the imports of utility companiess
(c) reduced the maximum tariff and stamp duty rate from 2002 to 682
and then to 602;
(d) stopped the granting of tariff exemptions except for firms
exporting 1002 of production and a small number of items involving
national disasters, charitable programs, etc;
(e) removed 50 categories of duty-free imports from the Second
Schedule, representing 392 of the 1985 import value of those on
the list, followed by an additional 6 items representing a further
112 of import value;
(f) removed 100 items from the list of items requiring import
licenses;
(g) removed protective stamp duties from 56 agricultural products
(thereby reducing tariffs to the 602 agreed maximum) and removed
25 items from the list of reference prices;
(h) established a Tariff Reform Committee and Anti-dumping Committee;
and
(i) notified CARICOM formally of its intention to negotiate a revised
CET to make it consistent with Jamaica's trade reform program.
29.      The Government requested the Bank's agreement to defer three
conditions of second tranche release. The Bank agreed to this request on
the understanding that they would be implemented before Board presentation
of a proposed Second Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment Operation then
under consideration (March 1988). The first condthion waived was the
requirement to introduce a 52 minimum tariff for animal feed, fertilizer,
printed material and agricultural tools. Negotiators of the proposed new
common external. tariff in CARICOM had not agreed to introduce a minimum
tariff and the Government did not wish to introduce one in advance of its
adoption throughout CARICOK, particularly just before a national election.
30.      The second waived requirement was that the Government would
introduce a rebate scheme to reimburse exporters for import duties and
indirect taxes. The existing system had been introduced a year earlier in
response to the IMP's concern that the existing exchange rate for exporters
had deteriorated. The system consisted of a 7.52 rebate to exporters which
was somewhat arbitrarily chosen and only broadly related to taxes actually
paid. The Government wished to introduce multiple rates so the system
would provide more uniform incentives and be less susceptible to
countervailing duties. Moreover, the Government was planning to introduce
a general consumption tax which would allow the refund of indirect taxes to
exporters and make the rebate scheme less important.
31.      The third requirement which was waived was that the Tariff Reform
Committee would design a third phase of the reform program in a form
acceptable to the Bank and that the Government would publish it in Jamaica.



- 11 -
Although the Bank and the Government had agreed on the third phase, the
Government did not want to publish it before the national elections.
32.      Subsequent to the measures taken under TFSAL I, in December 1988,
in order to encourage the replacement and modernization of machinery and
equipment damaged by hurricane Gilbert, the Government reduced the
aggregate of customs and stamp duties on capital goods (except motor
vehicles) from between 25Z and 60? to a maximum of 202, except where the
CET exceeded 20X. Under the AGSAL, approved in February 1990, the
Government has undertaken to eliminate all quantitative import restrictions
for the protection of small farmers and the use of reference
prices/protective stamp duties for agricultural and agroindustrial products
(except for corn, soya beans, condensed milk and aluminum products).
The Current Trade Regime
33.      Prior to the recent introduction of the new Common External
Tariff, the trade regime in Jamaica was described in column three of the
attached Matrix of Trade and Financial Sector Policy Reforms (Annex V).
Basically it consisted of the following:
(a) Most goods were subject to combined CET and regular stamp duty
rates which were limited to 602, with the following exceptions:
eleven items with a CET rate of 70?; 120 items taxed on a specific
CET duty basis; and large motor cars.
(b) There were 32 items remaining on the Second Schedule or duty free
list (import duty exemptions are also granted to firms exporting
100? of their production, to enterprises in the duty free zone and
firms manufacturing under the assembly provisions of the US tariff
code).
tc) There were 35 items requiring import licenses for security and
health reasons, including narcotics, certain chemicals,
explosives, arms and munitions and used and retreaded tires.
(d) JCTC has an import monopoly for 34 items in the following
categoriess dried and canned fish, milk and milk products, wheat,
corn, rice, certain pharmaceuticals, bulk fertilizer, lumber and
vehicles.
(e) Excluding agricultural and agroindustrial products for which
protective stamp duties/reference prices are being phased out
under the AGSAL, the only protective stamp duties/reference prices
remaining are on corn, soya beans, condensed milk and some
aluminum products.
(f) In September, 1990 the 7.5? rebate to exporters to reimburse them
for customs duties on inputs and for indirect taxes was eliminated
and a duty drawback system was introduced.
It is estimated that non-tariff protection covered about 8.5? of total
goods production in Jamaica.

PART III - THE PINANCIAL SECTOR
Structure
34.      The financial sector of Jamaica consists of a relatively large
number of financial institutions (see Table 2 below). The eleven
commercial banks dominate the financial system and account for about 342 of
total financial assets (572 excluding assets of the Bank of Jamaica - BOJ).
Financial institutions are mostly privately owned, with the Government
owning 491 of the National Commercial Bank (the second largest comercial
bank), in the form of non-voting shares, and a number of development
finance institutions which were established to develop particular sectors.
These are: Agricultural Credit Bank (ACR), National Development Bank
(NDB), Jamaica Mortgage Bank (JMB), and the National Housing Trust (NHT).
There is considerable competition amongst institutions and none enjoys more
than a 402 market share. A number of the merchant banks and trust
companies, which are chartered to intermediate in medium and long term
financial instruments and to perform trust operations, are owned by
commercial banks.

35.      Life insurance ccmpanies are relatively developed in Jamaica and
invest mainly in government securities and mortgage loans. Building
societies and credit unions also play an important role in Jamaica's
financial sector. The small Jamaica stock exchange is incorporated as a
private company but has operated since its inception in the BOJ building
which accommodates the trading floor and administrative office in its
building. Eight brokers hold the voting shares, but there are plans to
increase this to eleven. The shares issued to BOJ for covering past
operating losses of the exchange are non-voting. Currently 51 companies
and seven corporate bonds are listed on the exchange.
36.      For some years the financial sector has maintained a steady growth
rate of resource (deposit) mobilization. M2 (currency, demand and time
deposits) reached 49X of GDP in 1987, one of the highest ratios among
countries with comparable income per capita. Several factors contributed
to the strength of the financial sector during a period of economic
recession and low growths (a) a growing network of financial institutions;
(b) considerable competition among financial institutions in resource
mobilization; (c) the traditionally high savings propensity of the Jamaican
population; and (d) the predominantly market-determined interest rates.
Role of BOJ
37.      Jamaica's monetary policy is managed by the BOJ in conjunction
with the Ministry of Finance. Until late 1985, the principal instruments
of monetary policy were the cash reserve and liquid asset requirements,
overall and selective credit ceilings, and the minimum savings deposit
rate. As described in more detail below, the liquid asset ratio (the total
of liquid assets and deposits in the BOJ to total assets) was gradually
reduced, ceilings on private sector credit were removed and the BOJ began
to issue its own certificates of deposit in order to increase the range of
monetary instruments available to it to control aggregate credit. In
addition, the BOJ manages the auctions of treasury bills and issuance of
long term government debt from time to time for the Ministry of Finance.
Credit Growth
38.      Heavy and protracted budget deficits in the 19708 and 1980s were
financed by money creation and through the liquid asset ratio of commercial
banks. The overall deficit expanded from 2.3? of GDP in 1972 to 12Z-192 of
GDP between 1976 and 1985, before declining to 5.62 and 5.42 in 1986 and
1987 respectively. However, the overall deficit rose again to 13.42 in
1988 due to the impact on public revenues and expenditures of Hurricane
Gilbert, before falling to an estimated 4.3Z in 1989. In 1983184 net
domestic credit grew at 43.62 (see Table 3) as credit to the public sector
grew at 46?. In 1984185 fiscal and monetary policies were substantially
tightened and credit grew by only 5.7Z. However, in 1985186 and 1986/87
credit grew by an average of 25 percent reflecting increased financing
needs of the public sector and credit demand of the private sector related
to recovery of economic activity. In 1987188 total credit expanded only
10, but private sector credit grew by 17.5? as the Central Government
increased its deposits with the banks. In 1988189 credit grew by some 252
due to financing needs related to Hurricane Gilbert.

Interest Rates
39.       The minim=m 8avings deposit rate which was set by the BOJ has been
used traditionally to indicate changes in interest rate policy. However,
in September 1990 the BOJ stopped regulating the savings deposit rate and
subsequently some financial institutions have increased their savings
deposits rates from 182 to 202 to attract such deposits. The short-term
refinancing rate and rediscount rate, applied respectively by the BOJ for
short-term liquidity support and up to 270-day project refinancing, also
affect the interest rate structure. Yields on both treasury bills and BOJ
certificates of deposit are determined in the auction market. A schedule
of selected market interest rates in the years 1984 through 1990 is shown
in Table 4. Interest rates are largely determined by market forces with

the principal exception of rates on directed credit through development
finance institutions and borrowing and lending rates of credit unions and
Peoples Co-operative banks which are limited by law to 62 and 122
respectively (para. 41). Market determined interest rates were largely
negative in real terms (ex-post) in 1984 and 1985, but became positive in
1986 and significantly positive in succeeding years.

40.      The Government's revised debt management strategy has required
greater use of concessionary external funding, improvements in exports and
greater private capital inflows. It has also required greater domestic
resource mobilization. To this end, the BOJ began to follow a cautious
monetary policy in 1986. As a result, real interest rates became highly
positive. Expectations in early 1988 were that short-term inflation would
amount to about 5 to 7X p.a. when the average interest rate was 15.6X p.a.
on commercial bank deposits and 25.4Z p. a. on commercial bank loans.
There were basically three factors which accounted for and continues to
account for the very high real interest rates and the high spread between
deposit and lending rates:
(a) high interest rates on government securities and BOJ certificates
of deposit to attract resources to finance the fiscal deficit.
Interest rates on these instruments averaged 18.41 p. a. in 1988
and the commercial banks invested about 332 of their assets in
such instruments at that time;
(b) high reserve requirements (202) to provide resources to the
Government to finance the fiscal deficit. This added about 3 to 4
percentage points to the effective cost of bank resources; and
(c) high administrative costs which averaged some 6.12 of total
average assets of one of the larger commercial banks in 1988
(compared with 3.4S for a typical US commercial bank).
Interest rates on loans will not fall until the government reduces its
fiscal deficit and its requirements for domestic finance and until
inflation is reduced. As the financial sector modernizes and expands, it
is expected that administrative costs will fall.
Directed Credit
41.      While an overwhelming majority of financial assets in Jamaica bear
market rates of interest, there is still a small amount of subsidized
credit in the financial system. The assets of the four institutions with
directed credit programs (NHT, JMB, NDB, and ACB) currently amount to about
72 of the assets of all financial institutions in Jamaica. NHT, which has
502 of the assets of these institutions, was created in 1976 to provide
low-income housing credit. It is largely financed by a payroll tax on
employers (non-refundable) and on employees who are expected to benefit
from the lending programs of NHT. JMB, set up in 1971, also lends for
housing. ACB and NDB were set up in 1981, ACB to finance agricultural
projects, and NDB to finance industrial, tourism and mining projects. Both
are financed by Government funding and financing from international
agencies. After a less than successful experience with direct lending they
now lend through commercial banks and other financial institutions
(merchant banks, peoples cooperative banks and credit unions). Table 5
below shows the main characteristics of directed credit in Jamaica.

42.      The estimate of credit subsidies was based on the amount of loans
outstanding and the difference between the current average lending rates
and the treasury bill rate. Total credit subsidies are estimated to be
between 1.5Z and 1.82 of GDP (between 4.12 and 4.91 of government
expenditures). If the estimate of credit subsidies were based on the
difference between the current lending rates and interest rates charged on
commercial bank loans, the total amount of credit subsidies would rise to
between 1.6S and 2.01 of CDP (between 4.5Z and 5.4Z of government
expenditures. The largest part of the subsidy is made up of credit
subsidies on housing loans. Subsidized housing loans are financed largely
from payroll taxes on employers and employees.  Beneficiaries, therefore,
expect low interest loans as they consider that they are receiving their
own resources in the form of a housing credit.
Supervision and Prudential Regulation
43.      The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the supervision of
financial sector institutions but delegates this responsibility to the
Governor of the BOJ who holds the post of Inspector of Banks.  The
Supervision Department of the BOJ has a total staff of 20, including two
teams of five bank examiners. One team is responsible for the annual
inspection of each of 11 commercial banks. The other is responsible for
the annual inspection of the 29 merchant banks, trust companies and finance
houses. Inspectors are universities graduates with training in economics,
finance and management. The unit has in-house training programs and has
sent staff abroad to attend training programs given by the U.S. Federal
Reserve Systems, etc. The supervisors use reporting and examination
procedures developed by U.S. regulators, but there is no procedural manual
tailored to Jamaica's regulatory requirements and objectives. The
principal constraints to effective bank supervision is the lack in current
banking law of (a) clear capital requirements, limits on credit exposure to
related parties, clear rules on loan classification, provisioning, etc.g
and (b) authority for the Inspector of Banks to issue cease and desist
orders, levy penalties, and take other necessary action to enforce sound
banking practice.



- 18 -
44.      There are a number of acts of parliament which govern the
operations of financial institutions in Jamaica, including the Bank of
Jamaica Act, the Money Lending Act, the Building Societies Act, the
Cooperative Societies Act, the Banking Act, the Protection of Depositors
Act and the National Housing Act. A number of revisions in these acts were
drafted in 1987 but were never passed. The new Government has been
reviewing and revising them as discussed in para. 70 and they will deal
with the constraints to effective bank supervision.
The Financial Sector Reform Component of TFSAL I
45.      During the preparation of TFSAL I, the Government concluded that a
series of measures needed to be taken to begin to reform the financial
sector in Jamaica. The Government concluded that past monetary and credit
policies had created distortions in financial markets and had imposed
constraints upon capital market development. The use of the liquid asset
ratio (which forced the banks to hold treasury bills) as the main monetary
tool had directed savings into the public sector, raised interest rates and
crowded the private sector out of the credit markets. The Government's
large overdraft facility with the BOJ had had the same effect. The holding
of interest-free reserves with the BOJ had increased the cost of financial
intermediation and contributed to high spreads and interest rates. It was
clear too that, as the liquid asset ratio was phased out, alternative
policy instruments would need to be developed. Moreover, it was concluded
that the BOJ needed to strengthen its information systems to provide it
with timely information for effective policy making. As the financial
sector moved toward less restricted markets, improved monitoring of
financial institutions would be needed and the regulatory framework would
need to be reviewed and possibly strengthened. In order to strengthen
capital markets, the bias against equity investments needed to be reduced
and further analysis was required to identify policy measures to strengthen
financial markets. Finally, interest subsidies in the agricultural,
industrial and housing sectors distorted credit allocation and interfered
with the development of capital markets and needed to be reduced.
46.      With the support of the Bank under TFSAL I, the Government
designed a series of measures aimed at removing distortions in the
financial markets. The main achievements of the measures weret (a) a
reduction in forced loans to Government from the commercial banks; (b)
improvement in the tax structure to reduce the anti-equity bias; and (c) a
strengthening of BOJ's monetary management and supervisory capabilities.
As shown in the attached Matrix of Trade and Financial Sector Policy
Reforms, the following measures were taken prior to second tranche release
of this loan:
(a) the liquid asset ratio of the commercial banks (the ratio of the
total of liquid assets and deposits in the BOJ to total assets),
which had been reduced from 48? to 38S in 1986 and to 35? in March
1987, was reduced to 202 in March, 1988 (i.e., the non-cash
portion of the liquid asset ratio was reduced to zero);
(b) the BOJ introduced payment of interest (equal to the minimum
savings deposit rate) on three percentage points of the commercial
banks' cash reserves in 1986, and increased this to six percentage
points (of the total 202 liquid asset ratio) in March 1988;



- 19 -
(c) the BOJ began to issue its own certificates of deposit in late
1985 in order to increase the range of monetary instruments
available to it and re-established in May, 1986 a rediscount
operation for Government paper;
(d) the overdraft ceiling of the Government account in BOJ was reduced
from 302 to 152 in March 1986 and was further restricted
subsequently in agreement with the DMF;
(e) the money demand/supply model and flow-of-funds model which were
designed to facilitate the management of monetary policy were made
fully operational;
(f) the Government introduced 180 and 360 day securities and a longer
term bond with variable interest rates in order to expand the
range of financial instruments in the capital market;
(g) in lieu of reducing taxation on dividends, the Government
equalized the taxation of interest income;
Ch) the stamp duty on new shares was abolished in January 1988, a
further measure to reduce the bias against equity investments;
(i) the stock market inspection unit was established in January 1988;
(j) three studies of securities market operations were completed and
their recommendations are being reflected in revised banking and
securities legislation; and
(k) the Government submitted draft financial sector legislation to the
Legislative Committee in December 1987.
47.      Draft financial sector legislation was submitted to the
Legislative Committee at the end of 1981 and, as a result of the financial
sector studies referred to above, changes were made in the drafts.
However, none of the legislation was approved prior to the election and the
new Government has been reviewing and revising the draft legislation. It
is expected to be presented to Parliament for consideration during this
year.
48.      After the measures implemented by the Government under TFSAL I
there remain a few areas where the financial sector in Jamaica needs
strengthening. The financial sector legislation drafted by the previous
Government and now being revised needs to be enacted to provide a sound
legal and regulatory framework for the sector. The liquid asset ratio
recently reinstituted needs to be phased out as does the discrepancy in the
reserve ratio between the commercial banks and merchants banks. Certain
steps need to be taken to improve the auctions for Government securities
and to develop a secondary market for such instruments. Further measures
must be taken to eliminate some credit subsidies, reduc%f others and
establish an accounting framework for making them transparent in order that
they can be reduced to an affordable level. Finally, the supervisory
capabilities of the BOJ must be strengthened to assure sound financial
sector institutions in Jamaica. These and related measures are discussed
in detail below.

PART IV - THE SECTORAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM SUPPORTED
BY THE PROPOSED LOAN
Rationale of the ProRosed Loan
49.      The proposed loan is to support the Government's trade and
financial sector reform program begun in 1987, which was supported by TFSAL
I. The trade reform would reduce protection and make it more uniform
across sectors and subsectors and increase competition and the efficiency
of enterprises. The financial sector reforms would strengthen the means
for managing monetary policy, improve the regulation of financial
institution and make the allocation of financial resources more efficient.
At the same time, the loan would provide needed balance of payments support
in the context of Jamaica's ongoing successful adjustment program as agreed
in the MTFP. Jamaica's financing requirements consistent with its
macroeconomic framework is being prepared and will be reflected in the loan
documentation after loan negotiations. The major sector issues and
proposed actions that t'e loan would support are described below. The
policy matrix with the loan conditionality is given in Annex V. The
Government's Letter on Economic Policy Adjustment is attached Le Annex VI.
TRADE POLICY COMPONENT
C-ommon External Tariff (CET)
50.      Status of New CET.   The previous Government notified CARICOM
formally that it wished to negotiate revisions in the CET in accordance
with Jamaica's reform program. Under the first Trade and Financial SAL
(TFSAL I), the goal was to achieve a final set of tariffs varying from 5 to
302. However, Jamaica has only been partially successful in achieving this
objective. Negotiations on the new CRT were completed in 1990 with the
following schedule of duty rates on imports.
Non-comoeting        Competing
Inputs
Raw materials                            52                 30S
Intermediate goods                      102                 302
Capital goods                           10o                 202
Basic final goods                          1O0                 302
Non-basic final goods                      302                 45S
Competing goods are defined as those for which 75t or more of regional
demand is covered by regional production. Basic final goods are those
which meet everyday needs such as food and other primary consumer products.
S1.      While the above rates will cover the majority of items, there are
some exceptions. First, in the agreed schedule some duties are zero.
Second, exceptions to the agreed rates are granted on a number of basic
food items, allowing selected countries to apply zero tariff rates on those
goods. Third, member countries will be able to grant duty exemptions on



- 21 -
imports of raw materials and capital goods for a broad range of industries.
Jamaica eliminated such exemptions in 1987 and has agreed not to re-
introduce the exemptions.
52.      The new CET clearly improves the structure of nominal protection
by reducing the number of tariff rates and lowering the maximum tariff from
70S to 45Z. However, it has major shortcomings in a number of respects.
Negative protection may result for the production of 'non-competing' goods
produced from goods in the category of 'competing" primary and intermediate
inputs. The new CET structure still provides for considerable dispersion
of nominal protection. In addition, effective protection will be higher
for products with high levels of regional production, thus minimizing
import competition. The new CET as designed also has administrative
shortcomings, primarily due to the difficulty of applying rules for
competing and non-competing products. Assigning products to various
categories requires estimating regional demand and production, as well as
taking into account quality and product differentiation. As a result, the
initial allocation of goods to various tariff categories may be difficult
to change.
53.      ProPosed Action.  Jamaica, in conjunction with other CARICOM
members, implemented the new CET (with a maximum tariff of 45Z) in
February, 1991 and combined stamp duties and tariffs were reduced from 60
to 45? calculated on an ad valorem basis. The only exceptions are: (a)
ammunition, precious and semi-precious stones which have ad valorem customs
tariffs above 45?; (b) motor vehicles, alcohol, and tobacco which have
stamp duties which increase combined protection to above 452. The stamp
duties would be eliminated when a General Consumption Tax is (or other
equivalent taxes) introduced during 1991. It would be a condition of
second tranche release that a General Consumption Tax, or other tax
measures with an equivalent revenue impact, be put into effect and the
remaining stamp duties be eliminated.
!4.      In addition to the shortcomings of the new CET's structure and
administration, the new tariff schedule does not meet the goal set by the
Government in its trade liberalization program announced in 1987, to reduce
CET rates to between 5 and 30 percent. In its Letter on Economic Policy
Adjustment (Annex VI), the GOJ has stated that its medium term objective is
to achieve the aforementioned tariff range and, toward this end, it will
propose and promote the lowering of the CET within CARICOM to at least
these levels progressively over time.
Other Tariff Issues: ProDosed Action
55.      Duty Free Goods.  Under the TFSAL I, a number of goods on the
Second Schedule were removed. (Goods on the Second Schedule are exempt
from import duties.) The rates specified in Attachment 1 to Annex VI were
recently introduced. The only remaining items on the Second Schedule are
now imports for charitable purposes, hospitals and items covered under
international agreements.
56.      Protective Stamp Duties and Reference Prices.  Under the AGSAL,
protective stamp duties and reference prices on agricultural and
agroindustrial products are being phased out. The only protective stamp
dutiesireference prices remaining are on corn, soy beans, condensed milk
and aluminum products. Agreement has been reached to eliminate reference



- 22 -
prices and on a schedule of reductions in protective stamp duties to
eliminate them over three years so that the remaining protection these
products would be that provided by the CET.
57.      Removal of Licensina Requirements on Used and Retreaded Tires.
Import licensing requirements on used and retreaded tires were ostensibly
maintained for safety reasons but were in fact used mainly to protect the
domestic tire industry. Licensing requirements on used and retreaded tires
were recently eliminated. Instead, only certification would be required
from a recognized authority in the country of origin that each imported
consignment conform to Jamaican standards (which are based on international
standards).
58.      Minimum Tariff on Animal Feed. Fertilizer. Printed Matter.
Agricultural Tools. Under the first Trade and Financial Sector Loan, one
of the conditions which was not achieved was the imposition of a 5X minimum
tariff on animal feed, fertilizer, printed matter and agricultural tools.
Under the new CET, the tariff on many of these products will be zero.
Consequently, a 52 tariff would have to be imposed through a stamp duty.
Since the Bank has recommended that stamp duties be removed as part of loan
conditionality, it would no longer be appropriate to impose a 52 minimum
tariff on these goods.
Anti-dumping Measures
59.      Status of Legislation.  Anti-dumping and countervailing duty
legislation was approved by the GOJ in November 1988. The new government
has appointed an Anti-dumping Committee to process dumping and
countervailing duty claims. However, the operational aspects of the
Committee are not yet resolved and no claims have been processed to date.
Following Bank discussions with the GOJ to review the legislation and
discuss a technical assistance program, several refinements to the existing
arrangements were recommended (see below). These changes were recently put
into effect.
60.      The Anti-Dumping Act and regulations were amended in March 1991 as
followss
(a) The Anti-Dumping Advisory Board will take into account consumer as
well as producer interests in evaluating anti-dumping cases.
(b) A minimum period of three months will be allowed for foreign firms
confronted with an anti-dumping action, to carry out their own
investigation and response.
(c) The countervailing duty will be eliminated when the situation
leading to the duty has ceased and in any event will be terminated
within twelve months. Continuation of the measure beyond twelve
months will require the initiation of a new request for such
measures.
(d) Consumer representation on the Anti-Dumping Committee has been
strengthened by including a representative representing (Ministry
of Industry, Production and Commerce) the Ministry for Consumer
Affairs.



- 23 -
61.      In addition to these changes, a program of technical assistance
has been initiated to acquaint representatives of the Ministry of Industry,
Prices Commission, Attorney General's and Customs Departments of anti-
dumping procedures in other countries draft guidelines for evaluating anti-
dumping and countervailing duty cases, and the training of Anti-dumping
official overseas. A program of technical assistance is contained in Annex
VII. The Government has agreed to carry out the program, and has requested
grant funds from IDB for this purpose.
DutY Drawback Scheme
62.      The 7.5  rebate to exporters was eliminated in September, 1990 in
accordance with the latest IMF agreement. The GOJ has designed a drawback
scheme for exporters which was introduced in September 1990 to replace the
rebate. Our recommendations on the proposed scheme include the following:
(a) The proposed system is a drawback scheme rather than a temporary
admission scheme. Under the former, duties are paid then rebated
to the exporter, while under the latter the exporter defers
payment on duties until goods are sold for export. Particularly
vith the high real rate of interest, the GOJ may want to consider
the viability of a temporary admission regime. The GO0 may want
to introduce both systems and let the exporter choose between
them.
(b) After the system is operational, provisions could be made for
indirect exporters. Indirect exporters are defined as local
manufacturers of goods used as inputs for exported products.
(c) In addition to the proposed duty drawback scheme, a number of
other provisions are available for exporters to recover duties.
The GOJ should rationalize these schemes and ensure there are no
duplications in the system.
(d) Streamlining of the proposed system and means of including
indirect exporters appears to be desirable. A number of different
systems designed to reach indirect exporters have been established
in Korea, Mexico, Colombia and Chile. Funds are available in the
Second Technical Assistance Loan (TAL II) to help the Government
design such a system.
63.      The Government's commitment to revise and streamline the scheme is
set forth in the Letter on Economic Policy Adjustment (Annex VI) and a
program of technical assistance was agreed upon.   Terms of reference for
the technical assistance are contained in Annex VII.
Trade Reform Program
64.      Jamaica Commodity Trading Cornoration (JCTC) Imoort MonoDoly.
JCTC has monopoly rights to import a range of items in the following
categories: fish, milk, corn, rice, pharmaceuticals, bulk fertilizer,
lumber and vehicles which account for over 82 of imports. JCTC was
established as the Government's procurement agent under bilateral
agreements or special credit lines such as PL480, CIDA food aid and



- 24 -
Canadian Wheat Board financed imports.  JCTC arranges for the procurement
and shipment of t..ese goods in accordance with rules established by CIDA,
the US Government, etc. Over the years, JCTC's import monopoly has been
extended beyond the items covered by bilateral agreements to
pharmaceuticals, lumber and vehicles. JCTC's monopoly on imports is not
consistent with the trade liberalization program and must be eliminated.
Also, JCTC's pricing and distribution policies cause distortions in
domestic relative prices and rents in the distributing and processing chain
of certain commodities. Finally, it has acquired interests in Jamaica
Grains Ltd. (JGL) and Jamaica Soya Products Industries (JSPL), processors
of rice and soya products respectively. In addition to the elimination of
JCTC's import monopoly, steps will need to be taken to remove price
distortions and promote transparency and competition in the distribution
and processing of specific commodities. A more detailed description of
JCTC's role in the importation, processing and distribution of the major
commodities for which it has an import monopoly is given in Annex III.
65.      The GOJ has decided to introduce private sector competition into
the importation and distribution of goods for which JCTC has a monopoly.
However, in order to identify appropriate mechanisms to allow the GO0 to
maintain income derived from preferential financing arrangements and to
assure effective procurement of goods provided by PL480 from the U.S., a
study of rice, corn, wheat and lumber products imports and their
distribution is being conducted and is expected to be completed early
1991. The GOJ also wants to assure that efficient procurement of
fertilizer, milk and fish imported under bilateral agreements with the
Canadian Government is maintained and that these products are priced in
accordance with the terms of the bilateral agreements. The study will make
recommendations on how to achieve effective procurement, pricing and
distribution of these items. In returning the importation of motor
vehicles to the private sector, the Government wants to avoid the creation
of private monopolies. It is therefore reviewing other country experience
(Australia, New Zealand, Colombia) in auctioning licenses to import motor
vehicles to replace JCTC's monopoly. The GOJ is now considering an import
license auctioning system on motor vehicles as an interim measure which
would limit the use of scarce foreign exchange and assure that the GO0
receives the economic rents on motor vehicle imports. It would also
provide important information to help establish a system of import tariff
and domestic taxes to achieve these objectives. Tariff and taxes would be
then introduced to replace the license auctioning system. Finally, the GOJ
also plans to allow private sector importation of pharmaceuticals. Price
controls on pharmaceuticals would be elimiuated and private importers would
also be allowed to compete with JCTC in the provision of pharmaceuticals
for government hospitals.
66.      The Deputy Prime Minister has announced in Parliament its decision
to eliminate JCTC's import monopolies and take the other measures spelled
out below. The Government has decided to reduce JCTC's role but wishes to
have adequate time to arrange for an orderly transfer of its functions to
the extent possible to the private sector. It wishes to take the results
of the JCTC study into account, resolve some of the outstanding financial
problems of JCTC and obtain parliamentary approval of amendments to the
Trade Act to eliminate JCTC's import monopolies. A letter from the
Minister of Finance of Jamaica has been received setting forth the
Government's decision to carry out the following program by September 30,
1991. Therefore, as conditions of second tranche the GOJ wouldt



- 25 -
(a) eliminate JCTC's import monopolies for all products;
(b) eliminate JCTC's procurement of imports financed under bilateral
agreements and replace it with procurement arrangements awarded
under competitive procedures open to the private sector, except
where the bilateral source requires that JCTC carry out the
procurement function. In that case, JCTC's function would be
strictly limited to the procurement role. The new arrangements
would be designed to assure that the GOJ obtains the income
derived from preferential financing arrangements;
(c) establish tariffs and other taxes designed to assure that the
Govern,ment obtains the economic rents from the importation of
motor vehicles;
(d) eliminate price controls on pharmaceuticals and introduce
competitive tendering for pharmaceuticals for public sector
hospitals;
(e) offer for sale JCTC's investments in JGL and JSPI.
JCTC would be converted into a public procurement agency which would earn
commissions for the procurement services it rendered, competing with
private sector importers to assure the supply of any particular item.
67.      Customs Reform.  The Customs and Excise Department suffers from a
number of organizational weaknesses and its staff lack incentives,
discipline and management skills. The Revenue Board, which has been the
supervisory authority to the Customs and Excise Department, has had little
success in improving Customs operational efficiency, partly because the
Revenue Board has no power over public officials in matters of discipline.
Customs lacks adequate systems of control with the result that there is
continued hindrance to trade, tourism, airlines and shippers due to the
high volume of non-productive examination of documents, people,
declarations and freight. The lack of controls and proper systems has led
to the evasion of customs duties and loss of revenue. The GOJ has
therefore decided to establish a special division (Revenue Protection
Division) in the Ministry of Finance with clear authority for carrying out
a program of reforms of Customs administration. The division will be
charged with the responsibility for implementing the recommendations to
improve the systems of control and efficiency of revenue collection.   A
program of customs reform has begun with the assistance of consultants.
The Bank has reviewed this program and given detailed comments on it to
focus attention on basic management, declaration, checking and control
systems. A number of system reforms is underway (Customs Import Entry
System, Valuation System, Harmonized Tariff, etc.). An analysis of the
problems of customs administration is given in Annex IV together with a
plan of action for customs reform. The information to be provided by the
Government has been received and reviewed and the plan of action agreed
upon. Conditions of second tranche release will be that satisfactory
progress be achieved in carrying out items (xvi) through (xxiv) of the plan
of action, which focuses on: the establishment of comprehensive management
inspection and control systems; valuation system; informal commercial
importers; import entry systems and post-importation controls; harmonized
tariff; training programs and computer based systems.



- 26 -
68.      General Consumption Tax (GCT).  The draft legislation for a
general consumption tax (GCT) was presented to a joint parliamentary
coimuittee in November 1990. The introduction of the GCT will replace and
rationalize an overly complex system of indirect taxes which has different
rates, licensing and return requirements. The proposed OCT will have a
single uniform rate (12.52) applicable (on a value-added basis) to all
domestically produced and imported goods and services with the exception of
certain product categories where the rate will be zero.   These include
basic food items which constitute a signifcant part of the consumption of
the poorest and most vulnerable groups, basic education, basic health
products, agriculture, exports and exemptions provided under other Acts.
Moreover, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages and petroleum products would be
subject to higher rates. If successfully implemented it is expected to
have a positive fiscal impact. It will also help the trade reform by
permitting exporters to recover indirect taxes paid on inputs. The Bank
reviewed the draft legislation and administrative arrangements for
collecting the GCT and gave the GOJ its comments, which were taken into
account in drafting the legislation. The staffing and training of the
staff which will administer the GCT has been largely completed, office
accommodations have been obtained and computer systems are in the final
stages of preparation. However, parliamentary approval of the GCT is still
pending. It would be a condition of second tranche that the GCT, or an
equivalent tax which would have a similar structure and produce the same
level of revenues and equivalent economic impact as the GCT, be put into
effect. Any alternative to the GCT would have to be satisfactory to the
Bank in form and substance; this means that it would have to take the form
of a value added tax system, with fully uniform rates across economic
sectors and activities, and with exceptions limited to those currently
under the GCT proposals discussed with the Bank.
Financial Sector Reform Program
69.      Liauid Asset Ratio (LAR).  As part of the financial sector reforms
the liquid asset ratio of the commercial banks (the total of treasury bills
and non-interest bearing deposits in the BOJ to total assets) was reduced
from 482 to 38X in 1986, to 352 in 1987 and to 202 in March 1988. The
remaining 202 was the cash portion of the reserve requirement so that the
liquid asset ratio was in effect eliminated. As part of its program to
reform the foreign exchange system, the BOJ decided to reinstate the liquid
asset ratio temporarily. The Bank was consulted on this proposal and
agreed that it could be reintroduced provided it was done as a temporary
measure and that the increase was moderate and set as part of the new INP
program and was therefore consistent with other targets in the program.
The BOJ increased the LAR for commercial banks from 202 to 252 in April,
1990 to 27.52 in May and to 32.52 in September. For merchant banks and
trust companies, the LAR was increased from 4.5Z to 7.52 in April 1990, and
will be further increased to 102. The present LAR differs fundamentally
from the earlier one which was eliminated gradually in 1987 and 1988. The
earlier ratio constituted an implicit tax on bank intermediation as
interest on liquid assets was paid at the administratively determined rate
on passbook savings which was substantially below the treasury bill rate.
Since interest controls on savings were eliminated and liquid assets now
earn market rates (determined in improved treasury bills and BOJ
certificate of deposit auctions), the present LAR is much less distorting
and does not constitute a tax on bank intermediation. The most recent



- 27 -
increases in the LAR were designed to ease the transfer to a market based
foreign exchange regime. However, as foreign exchange operations become
more stable and as current measures to reduce the budget deficit further
are implemented, the need for the LAR will disappear. Financial
institutions have therefore been advised that the liquid asset requirement
will be eliminated in stages between April 1 and September 30, 1991.
Another temporary measure with similar objectives in mind was the
imposition of credit ceilings. They were phased out on December 31, 1990
as part of the current IMF agreement with Jamaica.
70.      Reduction in the Differential in Reserve Recuirements between
Commercial Banks and Near Banks. Near banks (merchant banks and trust
companies) have grown much more rapidly than commercial banks in the last
decade, increasing their share of total deposits from 102 in 1981 to 20S in
1990. This has occurred for two main reasons. First, there has been a
substantial difference in reserve requirements (202 for commercial banks
compared with 4.52 for near banks).  Secondly, merchant banks (deposits of
which have increased most rapidly) were established often by commercial
banks themselves, to avoid strictures on commercial banks such as lending
limits, exposure limits and reserve requirements, as the rules governing
the operations of merchant banks are less onerous than those governing the
operations of commercial banks. The GOJ is now in the process of drafting
a Financial Institution Act, which will more clearly define the exposure
limits of near banks, limit loans to related parties and increase minimum
capital requirements and capital adequacy, etc. It will also considerably
increase the enforcement measures which the Superintendent of Banks can
bring to bear to enforce compliance with prudential regulations and the
observance of sound banking practices. Significantly increased minimum
capital requirements will reduce the number of merchant banks through
merger, sale, etc.   At the same time, in June the BOJ increased the
reserve requirement of the merchant banks from 4.52 to 62 thereby reducing
the disparity in reserve requirements between commercial banks and merchant
banks. Nevertheless, a non-interest bearing cash reserve ratio of 202 on
commercial banks and 61 on merchant banks gives the latter of 4.62 spread
advantage over the former and should be eliminated. Agreement was reached
on a program to eliminate this disparity between April 1991 and September
1993, a period sufficiently long to avoid serious financial problems for
the merchant banks. The BOJ's decision to eliminate the disparity during
this time frame has been formally announced together with the specific
program of adjustments for 1991, as outlined belowt
CBs          MBs
1991      April 1          20.0          6.5
May 1           20.0           7.0
June 1          20.0           7.5
July 1          20.0           8.0
Aug 1           20.0           8.5
Sept 1          20.0           9.0
Oct 1           20.0           9.5
Nov 1           19.0          10.0
A tentative program for 1992 and 1993 has also been agreed, which would
narrow the differential in cash reserve requirements between commercial
banks and merchant banks to four percentage parts by the end of 1992 and



- 28 -
equalize them at 172 by the end of 1993. The above program would be
adjusted, with the Bank's agreement, to reflect changes in the distribution
of deposits between the twvo categories of institutions. Implementation of
the relevant part of the 1991192 program and agreement on the detailed
schedule for implementing the remaining part of the program (FY92193),
would be a condition of second tranche release.
71.      Program for Strengthening Financial Markets.  In discussions with
the BOJ during project preparation it was agreed that the auction
mechanisms for treasury bills and certificates of deposit issued by the BOJ
should reflect market forces only. At present, BOJ makes bids for treasury
bills on behalf of other public entities and this could influence prices in
the auctions. It would be preferable for BOJ to make only 'non-
competitive" bids. i.e. receive the average yield determined by competitive
bids in the auction.  The BOJ should also permit small investors, who are
not normally familiar with the intricacies of treasury bill auction, to
also make 'non-competitive, bids and thereby participate in the original
issues market. These changes in treasury bill auction procedures have been
put into effect. At present there is no effective secondary market for
government securities in Jamaica. The BOJ repurchases such securities from
financial institutions, not at a market rate, but on the basis of
calculated penalties for early redemption. This basically shifts much of
the risk for holding government secueities from the comercial banks to the
government itself and makes the implementation of monetary policy
difficult. An effective secondary market would permit the effects of
changes in monetary policy to feed through the interest rate structure more
effectively. A program of technical assistance to strengthen the secondary
market for government securities has been prepared and agreed upon and
agreement has been reached on the list of consultants to be invited to
present proposals to carry out the technical assistance program. The
Government's commitment to carry out this technical assistance program and
to implement its recomendations are spelled out in the Letter on Economic
Policy Adjustment (Annex VI). The Government has requested grant funds
from IDB to finance the technical assistance.
72.      Program of Financial Sector Legislation.  The present government
has decided to review the draft financial sector legislation prepared by
the previous administration. The Banking Act (dealing with commercial
banks), the Financial Institutions Act (dealing with other financial
institutions), and the Bank of Jamaica Act are all under review and a
Securities Act is to be drafted. The first step has been to conduct
independent reviews of the draft legislation by the two agencies directly
responsible for permitting the establishment of such institutions and
supervising their operations and financial condition, the Ministry of
Finance and BOJ. Subsequently, the differences in view between the two
agencies will be resolved and outlines of the proposed legislation will be
discussed with the private sector. The Bank has reviewed the draft
legislation and proposals for revising it and given its comments to the
GOJ. The draft Banking Act was sent to the financial community for its
comments in October 1990 and sent back to the legislative drafting
committee in January, 1991. It has been presented to the legislature for
its approval.
73.      The Banking Act, which deals with commercial banks, will
strengthen the capital requirements of commercial banks. limit their



- 29 -
exposure on loans to related parties and limit unsecured loans. It will
increase capital requirements to 8S of assets (Bank of International
Settlements guidelines). It will also increase the supervisory authority
of the BOJ. Bank supervisors will be allowed to issue temporary and
permanent cease and desist orders in order to prevent unsound banking
practices. The Banking Act will provide for enforcement remedies including
fines and civil and criminal legal actions. It also provides for more
informal remedies normally agreed upon in memoranda of understanding
between the BOJ and commercial banks. The Financial Institutions Act will
deal with merchant banks and trust companies and covers the same areas
(capital adequacy, exposure limits, limits on loans to related parties) as
the Banking Act. It also provides the legal authority and instruments for
more effective supervision of other financial intermediaries by the BOJ.
The Financial Institutions bill of law is expected to be presented to the
legislature by September, 1991. The bill of law on securities, which is
being based upon the Ontario Securities Act, and will regulate company
registration. shareholders rights, stock trading rules, etc,-will be
drafted in early 1991 and submitted to the legislature immediately after
comments from the Stock Exchange have been taken into account. The
amendments to the Bank of Jamaica Act will strengthen the OJ's operations
and provide a more effective mechanism for implementing Government monetary
policy. It is to be presented for consideration to the legislature during
1991. It would be a condition of second tranche that the bills of law on
Financial Institutions and Securities and the amendments to the Bank of
Jamaica Act be sent to the legislature for its approval.
Supervisory Capacity of BOJ
74.      The staffing of the Supervision Department of the BOJ is discussed
and the procedures they follow is described in para. 43.   During 1991, the
financial sector legislation to be enacted will clarify and strengthen
prudential regulations and greatly increase the authority of the
Supervision Department to enforce compliance with the regulations and the
observance of sound banking practices. In order to respond to the
requirements of the new legislation and the greater authority given to the
Supervision Department, a plan of action would require the BOJ Supervision
Department to:
(a) Prepare and implement a recruitment program to enable it to carry
out the periodic inspections required by the new Banking and
Financial Institutions Acts on a timely basis and in accordance
with international best practice.
(b) Develop a manual to cover all banking areas tailored to Jamaica's
regulatoryisupervisory strategies and prudential requirements.
The manual would be followed by all supervisory staff of the BOJ
and a copy should be provided to all regulated financial
intermediaries.
tc) Prepare and implement a training program for the staff.
(d) Define the range of data to be provided by Fl's to include
analysis of earnings, capital adequacy and problem loans.
(e) Develop a methodology for dealing with parent company and
affiliates of FI's to assess the overall condition of the group
and the risks and impact of inter-company transactions.



- 30 -
The recruitment and training program have been agreed upon with the
Government. The Government's commitment to carry out this program is
spelled out in the Letter on Economic Policy Adjustment (Annex VI).
75.      Proaram to Reduce Credit Subsidies.  Although interest subsidies
for agriculture would be reduced under the AGSAL, other interest subsidies,
in housing and industry, ..emain. Reductions in industrial and agricultural
interest subsidies would be made under the proposed loan. However, as
stated above (para. 41), subsidized housing loans are financed largely from
payroll taxes on employers and employees. Beneficiaries therefore expect
low interest loans as they consider that they are receiving their own
resources in the form of a housing credit. The reduction of such subsidies
will require that a number of issues be resolved including: the use of
payroll taxes to finance housing credits, alternative sources of funding
housing loans, affordability criteria, etc. It is not proposed to try to
resolve these issues in this loan as they will require broad-based reform
in the housing sector.
76.      At present, none of the credit subsidies appear in the government
budget. It is necessary therefore to establish an accounting system which
would make interest rate subsidies for agriculture, industry and housing
transparent. It would then be possible for the government to decide on a
more objective basis what level of interest rate subsidies it could afford
and where such subsidies should be targeted. A condition of second tranche
would be that an accounting system had been established in the development
banks for the transfer of funds by the Government to the development banks
which makes interest subsidies measurable and transparent.
77.      Under the AGSAL it was agreed that, as a condition of second
tranche, interest rates on loans to large farmers would be increased to the
treasury bill rate and loans to small farmers would be increased to the
treasury bill rate less 7 percentage points. The GOJ subsequently agreed
with IDB, which is cofinancing the AGSAL that, as a condition of
effectiveness of its loan, interest rates on loans to small farmers would
be increased to the treasury bill rate less 7? and to large farmers to the
treasury bill rate, and the rates for small farmers would be further
increased to the treasury bill rate less 32 prior to the release of the
second tranche of the IDB loan. Conditions of second tranche under the
proposed loan would be that interest rates on loans to small farmers be
increased to the treasury bill rate and that loans to industry and large
farmers be at full commercial market rates.
Macroeconomic Conditionality
78.      Second tranche conditionality would be that Jamaica maintained an
acceptable overall macroeconomic policy in accordance with its Medium-Term
Economic Framework of February 27, 1990 (CGCED 90-13) for 1990/91-1992/93,
set out in its Letter on Economic Policy Adjustment (Annex VI). The
Medium-Term Economic Framework spells out Jamaica's macroeconomic and
sectoral policy agenda, growth and balance of payments prospects and
external financing requirements. The overall public sector deficit for
1991192 would be reduced, in line with the commitment to further reduce the
deficit in the medium term, to the equivalent of 2.2-2.8? of GDP, and the
external current account deficit to no more than 6Z of GDP. Further



- 31 -
reductions in the deficit would be effected as needed in the context of the
formulation of the final program for 1991/92, which is expected to be
supported by the IMF, and/or as needed to compensate for shortfalls in
external financing from projected levels. The exchange rate system vould
continue to be market determined and exchange rate policy would be flexible
to achieve the objectives of increasing foreign exchange reserves without
additional import or foreign exchange controls. Targets for 1992/93, which
include further reductions in the overall public sector and external
current account deficits, and objectives regarding the ratios of debt
service payments to exports and of external interest payments to GDP would
be as specified in para. 21.
PART V - OTHER FEATURES OF THE LOAN
Loan History
79.      The process of preparing the loan started in August 1988, soon
after the completion of disbursement under TFSAL T. However, the mission
was unable to reach sufficient agreement with the Government at that time
to proceed with the appraisal. The election then intervened and further
preparation of the project could only be resumed after the new
administration had reviewed the trade and financial sector reform programs
and begun to deal with a number of macroeconomic issues which needed to be
resolved. The general thrust of the reforms was discussed with tne GOJ in
May 1989 and a preparation mission in August/September reviewed the
proposed reform program in more detail. The appraisal took place in
February/March 1990, but a post-appraisal mission was required in October
1990 to resolve some difficult issues which could not be resolved earlier.
Loan negotiations took place in Washington, D.C. beginning January 31,
1991. The Jamaican negotiating team was led by Ms. Shirley Tyndall, the
Financial Secretary.
Loan Descrip?tion
80.      The proposed loan would be for an amount of US$30 million
equivalent, divided into two equal tranches of US$15 million. It would
finance the CIF cost of a general imports, subject only to a negative list
of prohibited items. The proposed operation forms an integral part of the
reform program included in the MTFP and, with the associated cofinancing,
of its overall financing program. The loan amount is also closely related
to the Bank's overall lending program in Jamaica and to Bank exposure
considerations.
81.      The matrix in Annex V summarizes the policy actions that were
taken prior to Board presentation and those that need to be taken prior to
the release of the second tranche. A discussion of these actions and other
related measures that will be implemented prior to second tranche is
included in Part IV above, and in the Government's Letter on Economic
Policy Adjustment, which is included as Annex VI.
Procurement and Disbursement
82.      Both private and public sector imports would be eligible for
financing under the proposed loan. All purchases exceeding US$1.5 million
equivalent would be made through simplified international competitive



- 32 -
bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines. Imports of luxury, military,
environmentally hazardous or other goods that are specifically prohibited
in a negative list would not be eligible for financing.
83.      A recently conducted Bank review of public and private sector
procurement practices in Jamaica determined that private sector procurement
practices were generally satisfactory and that limited bidding is the
procedure generally followed by most firms and Government
agencies/companies for the acquisition of goods, both locally and from
abroad. This procedure consists in conveying invitations directly to
several suppliers in approved lists. An exception is the Government's
Supply Division (Ministry of Finance), which as a rule must tender publicly
with advertisements in the local press for all purchases over J$15,000.
Another important exception has been the Petroleum Company of Jamaica,
which normally procures petroleum products in the framework of the San Jose
accord or through direct negotiated contracts. For the proposed loan for
all purchases under US$1.5 million equivalent, the following procurement
procedures would applyt
(a) For public sector agencies and companies, procurement would be
carried out following limited international bidding/international
shopping, unless otherwise agreed by the Bank.
(b) For private sector firms, established commercial practices of
these firms would be followed, provided that quotations from
eligible suppliers from at least two countries would be sought,
and the contract would be awarded to the lowest bidder, except
where direct contracting is permitted under paragraph 3.5 of the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
84.      Because of the modality of procurement of petroleum products that
has prevailed in the past (para. 81), such products would be in principle
not be eligible for financing under the loan. However, the Government is
in the process of establishing a high-level committee for the procurement
of petroleum products. If petroleum products were henceforth procured
following competitive procedures under the guidance of this committee, the
Bank would be prepared to consider waiving the provision excluding
petroleum products from financing under the loan, if the Government should
so request, in the context of specific withdrawal applications.
85.      Loan disbursements would be linked to satisfactory progress in the
implementation of the trade and finance adjustment program and maintenance
of macroeconomic performance consistent with the Economic Policy Adjustment
program. The proposed loan would consist of two equal tranches. It is
expected that IDB cofinancing would follow the same disbursement tranching
procedure. The first tranche of the loan is expected to be disbursed soon
after loan effectiveness. Retroactive financing would be permitted for an
amount not to exceed 20X of the loan (or US$6.0 million equivalent), to
cover payments made for eligible expenditures after November 20, 1992.
Retroactive financing would only cover goods the procurement of which has
met the requirements specified in paras. 82 to 84 above. The second
tranche would be available for disbursement when it has been determined
that the specified conditions precedent to its release have been fulfilled
(see Annex V). Such determination is expected to occur within about twelve
months after loan effectiveness. The Bank of Jamaica would be responsible



. 33 -
for the coordination and collection of relevant documentation and preparing
withdrawal applications under the loan, ensuring that only purchases that
meet the agreed procurement procedures are included in withdrawal
applications. To assist with this work, a qualified Procurement Specialist
would be appointed by the Bank of Jamaica for the duration of the loan.
Disbursements would be made against statements of expenditures (SOEs),
except for contracts valued at US$1.5 million equivalent or more, for which
disbursements would be made against full documentation. The minimum value
for each SOE submitted would be US$250,000 equivalent. Detailed
documentation evidencing expenditures under SOEs would be retained by the
Bank of Jamaica and made available for the required audit and also for
inspection by the Bank. Expenditures for goods procured under individual
contracts costing less than US$5,000 equivalent would not be eligible for
financing under the loan. The Closing Date of the loan is December 31,
1992.
Records and Auditing
86.      The Bank of Jamaica would maintain separate records and accounts
of all transactions under the loan. An audit by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank would be submitted to the Bank after disbursement of
each tranche of the loan and disbursement of the second tranche could not
be made until a satisfactory audit report covering the first tranche had
been received. The audit reports would give an opinion with respect to the
disbursement requests submitted to the Bank on the basis of SOEs and state
whether such requests were effected in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Agreement.
MonitorinR
87.      The progress of the Government's reforms in the trade and
financial sectors and of the measures supported by the proposed operation
would be closely monitored through regular Bank supervision. A specific
supervision mission would review compliance with the conditions for release
of the second tranche.
Cofinancing
88.      The loan would be cofinanced by the Inter-American Development in
the amount of US$50 million equivalent. The Government of Jamaica has also
requested Japan's Export-Import Bank for cofinancing in the amount of US$25
million. Cofinancing in each case would be on a parallel basis.
Benefits and Risks
89.      The proposed loan would support the completion of the trade reform
program of the Government begun in 1987 to rationalize and greatly simplify
the protection system, improve the incentive system and change to an open
and competitive environment. A gradual realignment of Jamaica's industrial
structure along the lines of comparative advantage will increase the
efficiency of the factors of production and the scope for production and
income growth. The increased competition from imported goods should
provide a strong incentive to increase the efficiency of domestic
production and a more rational use of the factors of production, and result
in cheaper and higher quality goods for consumers. These developments



- 34 -
should assist in reducing domestic inflation. The social welfare and
employment effects of the trade reform program are expected to be positive.
Employment has increased significantly in the duty free zones in recent
years. Further increases are expected from further development of the free
zones and a gradual shift to the production of goods in which Jamaica has a
comparative advantage which are relatively labor intensive. Moreover, the
trade liberalization is being implemented gradually over a four year
period, giving most firms adequate opportunity to adjust their production
processes, markets, etc.
90.      The financial sector reforms should help reduce credit subsidies,
improve the allocation of credit and strengthen capital markets. The
elimination of credit subsidies, in addition to improving resource
allocation, will help the Government reduce its fiscal deficit. The
gradual strengthening of secondary markets for government and other
securities will help the BOJ establish open market operations and a more
finely tuned monetary policy. The loan will also support the strengthening
of supervision and prudential regulation and the financial health of
comercial banks and other financial institutions.
91.      There is a risk that the fiscal impact of tax and trade reform
could exacerbate the public sector deficit which the Government is
endeavoring to reduce. Estimates of the fiscal impact of the trade reform,
which will result in lower average duty rates, indicate, however, that it
would be relatively small. Although duties are to be reduced for a broad
range of items, they are being raised on others and minimum rates are being
established for many items now exempt from duties. There is some concern
that administrative problems in introducing the new GCT (or its equivalent)
would cause shortfalls in revenues. The GCT, however. will replace a range
of indirect taxes and is in principle a very buoyant value added tax. The
revenues from it are expected to rise faster than the general price level.
The reforms supported by the loan in the administration of the Customs
Department and the implementation of the GCT should also limit these risks
and actually improve revenue collection. In addition, the reduction in
duty rates to a maximum of 45? may well reduce incentives for evasion and
facilitate duty collections.
92.      There is a risk that continued high real interest will depress
levels of private investment and constrain the economic recovery. The high
rates result largely from the level of the public sector deficit which,
despite the significant reduction in recent years, remains at an
unsustainable level. At the same time, high interest rates add to the
public sector deficit because of the high debt level of the public sector.
The heavy burden of debt service payments and the need to protect social
programs limit the scope for a quick reduction in the deficit.
Nevertheless, the Government is covditted to further reduce the deficit
over the medium term. Improved tax administration, supported in part by
the proposed loan, as well as the Government's commitment to further
accelerate divestiture ane privatization, should facilitate a reduction in
interest rates and provide an improved framework for private sector
activity.

PART VI - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS AND ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
93.      The status of Bank Loans and IFC operations as of September 30,
1990 is given in Annex II. As of that data, the Bank had approved 50 loans
for Jamaica totalling about US$876 million, after cancellations; of that
amount, the volume of undisbursed loans was about US$100 million. Further
information on Bank lending, IFC investments and net disbursements as of

94.      Throughout the 19808, the Bank Group provided strong support for
Jamaica's adjustment efforts as it sought to reverse the deterioration In
economic performance and living standards and overcome massive balance of
payments and budget imbalances. There were three structural adjustment
loans, amounting to US$191 million, in FY82-85, followed by sector
adjustment loans for public enterprise reform and trade and finance (FY87)
and agriculture (FY90). The most recent recent of these loans is
supporting a reform program in agriculture that would improve the sector's
incentive framework by rationalizing the agricultural import regime,
phasing out general food subsidies, reducing credit subsidies and otherwise
pursuing deregulation and divestment in the agriculture sector. A first
tranche of US$12.5 million was released in March 1990 and second tranche
release could take place this month. Adjustment lending represents nearly
302 of total Bank lending to Jamaica to date and 361 of DOD owed by Jamaica
to the Bank.
95.      A recent OED Program Performance Audit Report (No. 8018) on the
first three SALs in FY82-85 listed a number of important lessons for the
Bank. It concluded that the lack of a policy-oriented analytical framework
did not permit the Bank to quantify the appropriate balance between
domestic adjustment and foreign borrowing. Massive capital inflows led to
the maintenance of large and unsustainable fiscal and current account
deficits. Despite the reforms made between 1981 and 1985, by the time the
SALs were fully disbursed, most of the tasks which the Government had set
for itself remained to be carried out. In several important ways, the
country was worse off and was burdened by a massive foreign debt. An
appropriate economic analysis should have shown the desirability of
disbursing the adjustment loans more slowly, Dari passu with the adoption
of economic reforms and more in line with the country's absorptive
capacity. A slower pace of disbursements would have helped to slow down
the build-up of the debt burden, and to delay the eventual emergence of a
negative net transfer from the Bank to Jamaica. Moreover, the heavy debt
service has limited Jamaica's flexibility in dealing with macroeconomic
policy issues including management of the balance of payments, the fiscal
deficit and the exchange rate. Among other things, the OED report
concluded that the major structural reforms in the trade regime, the tax
system, and the divestiture of public enterprises should have been carried
out in the early years of the program.
96.      In 1985, a tripartite economic mission (Bank, IMF, and USAID)
visited Jamaica to review progress of the structural adjustment program.
Its main conclusions were that Jamaica could achieve a sustainable growth
path ifs (a) it sustained the structural reforms already in place and added
some new ones; and (b) it received significant concessional capital inflows
for several years. More specifically, the tripartite mission concluded
that the structural transformations had to go in two directionss (a) to
continue decreasing the size of the public sector; and (b) to increase
production of tradable goods and services vie a vis nontradables. The
tripartite mission also considered that even under the best conceivable
circumstances, only modest growth in Jamaica's output, employment and
consumption could be expected in the medium term and that the economic
situation would deteriorate further in the absence of additional policy
reforms. Between June and December 1986, an intense policy dialogue was
carried out between the GOJ and the IMF and the Bank seeking an agreement
on the policy reform framework. Agreement was finally reached culminating
in a new IMF Stand-By arrangement approved in March 1987.



- 37 -
97.      In 1987, the Bank assisted the Government in the preparation of a
Medium Term Economic Framework, which set out the policy reform agenda for
the next three years, and an associated Public Sector Investment Program,
and strengthened its efforts to mobilize other external financing for the
program. Lending in direct support of the policy reform program took into
account the findings of the tripartite review and included a Trade and
Financial Sector Adjustment loan designed to help support the initiation of
a comprehensive reform of the trade regime and measures to strengthen the
financial sector, and a Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment loan to support
the reform and initiation of divestiture of public enterprises and thereby
contribute to improved fiscal performance.
98.      Bank investment lending was increasingly designed to complement
the adjustment program by supporting efforts to strengthen the productive
sector response to the improviag incentive framework and by helping to
alleviate poverty and to reverse the relative decline in attention to
social sector conditions during the period of economic decline and early
years of stabilization and adjustment. Loans were made: (a) to assist
exports (through the Kingston Free Zone, sugar rehabilitation and export
crops projects); (b) to address key infrastructure rehabilitation,
maintenance and development needs (in the power, transport and water supply
and sewerage sectors); (c) to support more effective management and
administration of Government programs through lending for administrative
reform and technical assistance; and (d) to assist in rehabilitation and
development of the social sectors and poverty alleviation, through projects
for education, population, health and nutrition. In the wake of Hurricane
Gilbert, the Bank approved an Emergency Import Reconstruction Loan in FY89
to support a comprehensive reconstruction effort.
99.      The execution of Bank financed projects has been reasonably
satisfactory in recent years. Fiscal constraints and cumbersome budgetary
procedures have, however, continued to affect somewhat the pace of project
implementation, particularly for infrastructure investments. The single
most serious obstacles to timely project execution are weaknesses in
project management and administration arising primarily from the lack of
skilled personnel in the public sector; this is being addressed through
provision of technical assistance in investment loans and more broadly, in
lending for administrative reform.
100.     The Bank Group's current assistance strategy, drawing on this
experience and responding to the changed situation in Jamaica, concentrates
on support of the objectives and policies expressed in the Medium Term
Economic Framework for 1990/91-1992/93 and the associated Public Sector
Investment Program. Further support for the adjustment program is
expressed in the loan proposal now being made, which in emphasizing
completion of important aspects of the adjustment program (e.g.,
elimination of the JCTC import monopolies) within a well-defined, coherent
macroeconomic framework, takes into account important findings of the
recent OED report cited above (para. 95). Beyond this operation, Bank
lending will consist largely of sector investment loans designed to
strengthen systems and produce tangible results in specific areas of
development. As such, Bank lending, as well as economic and sector work,
will support the current Administration's intensification of efforts to
liberalize the economy, privatize public enterprises and activities,



- 38 -
improve competitiveness and remove infrastructure constraints, to allow the
private sector to play its full part in development. For segments of the
private sector facing limited access to technological information on
supporting services, such as small farmers, the Bank would support
strengthening of Government capabilities to provide appropriate assistance.
We would support continuation, and deepening where possible, the
Government's Human Resources Development (HRD) program, which addresses the
issues and investment needs in education, health and nutrition. The HRD
emphasis is important for a number of reasons. It will help the Government
address the immediate social costs of adjustment as well more deep-seated
problems of poverty through more effective and better targeted programs for
the most vulnerable groups of the population, and it will strengthen long
term growth prospects which are likely to depend increasingly on the
availability of better educated, well-trained manpower. The Government's
increasing awareness of the importance of environmental protection to the
sustainability of its development efforts will be encouraged through
support for natural resource management programs.
101.     In our efforts to provide continued support to Jamaica, however,
we now have to monitor closely the Bank's exposure and level of net
disbursements. At the end of 1989, the IBRD share in Jamaica MLT public
debt was 18? and the share in total debt (including DMF and short-term) was
15X. Debt service payments to the Bank were 29.52 of public debt service
(excluding the IMP), and 18Z of total debt service. This level of exposure
means that a major element of Bank strategy must be to limit the number and
relative size of Bank loans and to assist the Government to secure a larger
share of its external aid directly, through cofinancing of Bank projects
and indirectly through the established mechanisms of the Caribbean Group
for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED). Given Jamaica's heavy
debt service burden, it will also mean that such other external aid should
be in the form of grants and concessional loans whenever possible and, that
special importance must be attached to using all forms of aid effectively.
102.     In line with the above strategy, individual operations that are
planned include a Public Enterprise Reform and Private Sector Development
project which would help speed the process of divestment of medium-sized
enterprises still under Government ownership, and provide additional credit
resources for expected growth in private investment as conditions for it to
improve under the macroeconomic reforms now being pursued. Another
possible project would be for the establishment of an Energy Fund to be
financed by the Bank and co-financiers to support private sector
participation in electric power generation, and possibly other energy
investments. Such efforts are complementary to ongoing activities of IFC
and MIGA. IFC's program is expected to include a contribution from its new
facility for assistance with privatization and corporate restructuring, as
suitable opportunities arise in Jamaica. Last month, MIGA held in Kingston
the third in its series of national investment promotion conferences, and
the first in the Latin American and Caribbean region. The conference
provided a useful opportunity for dialogue between the Government
represented by the Prime Minister and other senior officials, and foreign
and domestic private entrepreneurs. It is hoped that through business
discussions at the conference and planned follow up a number of specific
investment agreements will be concluded.



- 39 -
103.     Additional projects to strengthen economic infrastructure include
a transport sector loan for rationalization and privatization of ports,
railroads and airlines and a sector investment loan for water supply and
sewerage. The approach in each of these operations would be to establish a
framework for addressing policies, programs and implementation capacity in
these sectors, as well as for catalyzing and coordinating external
assistance for agreed sector programs.
104.     In the area of poverty alleviation and social development, we plan
to continue to exercise a lead role in coordinating donor support for the
implementation and further development of the Human Resources Development
Program.   Through nelping to maintain the focus on addressing in a
comprehensive way the policy and institutional issues involved in the
health, nutrition and education sectors, it is hoped that progress can be
made on a sustained basis in reversing the deterioration in these areas in
the past two decades. The component of the program that is expected to be
the subject of the next loan operation is secondary education improvement
which, if carried out successfully, should improve substantially the
employability of Jamaican youth.
105.     Finally, in the rural sector, where some of the country's most
important environmental issues arise, we are giving priority to a
watershed protection and small farm project with both environmental and
development components; it is being designed both to support Government
programs of natural resource management in major watershed areas and
strengthen agricultural support services, and earning opportunities, for
small farmers living in the watersheds.
106.     While Jamaica's external debt, and the Bank's exposure in that
debt, are both high, Jamaica is considered creditworthy for planned future
Bank lending, based upon continued support from the IM and the donor
community and the Government's adherence to the adjustment process in the
context of a viable medium term economic framework and financing program.
PART VII - COLLABORATION WITH THE IW
107.     Jamaica has maintained programs with the IMF during most of the
past ten years. These have included an Extended Fund Facility and five
Stand-by arrangements. As of end-1990 total net credit outstanding was SDR
250.7 million, or 172.3X of Jamaica's quota. Jamaica entered into its
current stand-by arrangement with the M  in March 1990.  The arrangement,
modified in November 1990, covers the period through May 1991. Performance
under the current arrangement is satisfactory; Jamaica has met performance
criteria for December 31, 1990 and is expected to meet the criteria for
March 31, 1991. In February 1991, the IW Board approved Jamaica's access
to the oil element of the IW's CCFF to help finance the higher oil import
cost. Negotiations for a new arrangement with the IMF are expected to
start during March 1991 and it is expected that the new arrangement would
at least cover the 1991/92 fiscal year, i.e., that it would be in place at
the time of review of the second tranche of the proposed loan. The macro-
economic targets for 1990/91-1992/93 have been discussed with the IMF and



- 40 -
the deficit targets are consistent with those envisaged under the Stand-by
arrangement. The IMF and Bank have been closely collaborating in the
preparation of the medium term macroeconomic framework and the design of
the annual economic programs. It is expected that such effective
collaboration will be maintained in the future.
PART VIII - RECONMMNDATION
108.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

JAMAICA
SECOND TRADE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Jamaica Commodity Tradina Corporation
1.       The Jamaica Commodity Trading Corporation (JCTC) has monopoly
rights to import 34 items in the following categories: fish, milk, corn,
rice, bulk fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, lumber and vehicles. It was
established to be the Government's procurement agent under bilateral
agreements or special credit lines such as PL480, CIDA food aid and
Canadian Wheat Board financed imports. As such it arranges for the
procurement and shipment of these goods in accordance with rules
established by CIDA, the US Government, etc. Over the years, JCTC's import
monopoly has been extended beyond the items covered by bilateral agreements
to pharmaceuticals, lumber and vehicles. JCTC's monopoly on imports is not
consistent with the trade liberalization program and must be eliminated.
Also, JCTC9s pricing and distribution policies cause distortions in
domestic relative prices and rents in the distribution and processing chain
of certain commodities. In addition to the elimination of JCTC's import
monopoly before second tranche release, the Government plans to take steps
to remove price distortions and promote transparency and competition in the
distribution and processing of specific commodities. The situation with
respect to each major commodity group is spelled out below.
(a) Food. As mentioned above, JCTC arranges for the procurement and
shipment of commodities financed under bilatoral arrangements.
It does not retail the commodities itself but sells them to
distributors. in the case of wheat, rice and soya it sells to
processors: Jamaica Flour Mills (Jm), Jamaica Grains Ltd.
(JGL), and Jamaica Soya Products Industries (JSPL), respectively.
JCTC owns a 20Z and 6OX interest in the latter two companies
respectively. A number of pricing issues arise. In recent
years, JCTC has imported and sold corn, wheat, skimmed milk
powder and other minor food items at subsidized prices some 202
to 40% lower than the corresponding full-cost prices. The
subsidies have been financed by implicit taxes on other
commodities handled by JCTC (e.g. automobiles) and by a transfer
from the Jamaica Public Services Company (JPSCo) out of the
proceeds of a tax on electricity consumption. The transfer to
JCTC from JPSCo is being phased out under the Social Sectors
Development Project and the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan
(AGSAL) and elimination of JCTC's import monopoly on automobiles
would remove the remaining source of food subsidy finance. In
order to assure that the food subsidies are passed on to
consumers, wholesale and retail prices have been set by the GOJ.
As the food subsidies are eliminated the price controls will be
removed. Distribution has also been distorted as JCTC allocates
a number of products to specific distributors on the basis of
their shares in the market a number of years ago. This freezes
market shares, reduces competition and is a serious barrier to
entry to the distribution trade.

The removal of JCTC's import monopoly could also have important
effects on the trade in certain food commodities. In the case of
soya products for example, soya beans are imported and processed
by JSPI into soya meal and soya oil. No soya oil is imported
because of the high import duty of 1OO, which is being phased
down to 30X over 5 years under the AGSAL. JSPI therefore has
.sufficient time to improve its level of operating efficiency to
withstand foreign competition. JCTC also has an import monopoly
on unpolished and milled rice. The unpolished rice is milled and
bagged by JGL and milled rice is imported only when local
polishing operations cannot satisfy demand. It appears likely
that if rice was freely imported, the domestic processor would
have difficulty competing. A similar issue applies in the case
of imported wheat which is sold to JFM. Flour imports are
allowed, with a combined tariff and stamp duty totalling 402.
Apparently the domstic flour mill can compete with imported
flour with a lower level of protection which will occur when
stamp duties are eliminated at the time the new CET is introduced
in January 1991. At that time the tariff will fall to 30X.
Protection on rice will be 15X and flour 302 and the respective
milling companies will have to survive with these levels of
protection. Removal of JCTC's monopoly on corn will not
immediately affect imports of animal feed as JCTC claims, because
of the high level of protection (currently 150X but being phased
down to 30X over 3 years under the AGSAL). Finally, skimmed milk
powder imports are still subsidized and for that converted to
boxed milk, the selling price is set so as not to create an
advantage over locally produced fresh milk. The proposed reform
program would consist of the following measures for foods
Mi) JCTC should immediately stop allocating imported food items
to distributors on the basis of past market shares and should
expand the number of participating distribution companies and
encourage the establishment of new distribution companies.
This should be done as soon as possible, even prior to the
elimination of the import monopoly, to allow entry by new
distributors;
(ii) The GOJ should eliminate JCTC's import monopoly on all food
items. Where procurement by a government agency is a
requirement of a bilateral agreement, JCTC could continue to
carry out the procurement function. For other such bilateral
arrangements the procurement function should be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding, contracts for which should
be awarded as a condition of second tranche. Private
procurement companies would compete, on an equal basis, for
the contracts which would be on a fee basis;
(iii) JCTC should begin the process of divesting its interest in
the Jamaica Grains Ltd. and Jamaica Soya Products Industries.
Its investments in these companies would be offered for sale
as a condition of second tranche of the proposed loan.

(b) Lumber. JCTC imports 30 million to 40 million board feet of
lumber annually for use in the construction industry. mostly under
bilateral programs. Some 202 to 302 is procured through
commercial channels. When lumber imports were open to the private
sector, in 1985 and 1986, prices fell as private importers bought
less expensive lumber. It would be a condition of Board
presentation that JCTC's monopoly on lumber imports was
eliminated. Procurement of lumber acquired under bilateral
arrangements would be carried out by a firm selected to carry out
such procurement services through a competitive bidding process.
(c) Fertilizer. Bulk fertilizer is imported under a bilateral
agreement with Canada. The bulk fertilizer is mixed and bagged by
one firm under a service contract. JCTC then sells the fertilizer
to distributors at about 80Z of international prices. The
Canadian Government is requiring the price to be adjusted
gradually to international levels. Evidence suggests that the
mixing plant benefits from its monopoly position by selling a
lower quality product and that purchasers would be willing to pay
more for a higher quality product. JCTC's monopoly would be
eliminated as a condition of the release of the second tranche.
Other imports of bagged fertilizer would assure that higher
quality fertilizer was available at fair prices.
(d) Pharmaceuticals. JCTC imports 10OZ of public sector requirements
of pharmaceuticals and between 172 and 202 of private sector
requirements of *essential, items. Pharmaceuticals for the public
sector enter duty free and those imported for the private sector
are subject to a 152 customs duty. Markups by the distribution
trade and the pharmacies are controlled. JCTC imports two kinds
of drugs produced locally (anti-diabetic and anti-infection drugs)
but the importation of a number of other locally produced drugs is
banned. JCTC imports no over the counter drugs which are imported
entirely by the private sector. It would be a condition of the
release of the second tranche that imports of all pharmaceuticals
be opened up to the private sector. JCTC could continue to import
potentially scarce generic drugs. The price of pharmaceuticals
would need to be monitored and it may be necessary, until adequate
competition in the distributive trades emerges, to control
distribution margins so as to assure adequate supply and prices.
(e) Automobiles. JCTC is the GOJ's agent for executing its import
program for vehicles. The breakdown between different motor
vehicle categories is determined by the Ministry of Transport.
The vehicles are subject to customs duties, JCTC's markup, sales
taxes and dealer markups. However, because of price controls and
the shortage of vehicles relative to demand, an active secondary
market exists for new vehicles where, especially larger more
expensive vehicles, are marked up again considerably above dealer
retail prices. As a result, a considerable share of the economic
rents from vehicles which should accrue to the GOJ are lost, and
the distribution of such rents is arbitrary and seen as unfair.
To address these problems the GOJ plans to replace the current



ANNEX IT
Page 4 of 4
- 47 -
system by a rationalized system of tariffs and other taxes on
imported motor vehicles to capture additional revenues and rents
before the release of the second tranche. As an interim measure,
before the introduction of such taxes, the GOJ will auction import
licenses for motor vehicles to determine the appropriate levels of
taxes for motor vehicles.
2.       During the discussion on JCTC, government representatives
expressed concern that the elimination of JCTC's import monopoly on certain
items might be replaced by a private sector monopoly (or oligopolistic
behavior by a small group). To address this possibility, the Government
has established a Technical Committee on Monopolies and Restrictive
Practices which has received some assistance from the U.S. Department of
Justice and will draft anti-trust legislation for Jamaica. The legislation
should deal with obstacles to entry of new firms, collusive behavior
amongst firms, etc.   The regulatory framework for the admittance of new
firms should be reviewed to reduce obstacles to entry. Finally, the Prices
Commission should monitor price movements as JCTC's monopoly is eliminated
for specific products to enable it to gauge the extent of anti-competitive
behavior and identify the focus and scope of remedial action.

SECOND TRADE AND INANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Customs Denartment Reforn - Plan of Action
Introduction
1.       The Customs and Excise Department is clearly suffering from the
effects of years of neglect. Organization, discipline, incentives,
management skills, efficiency, effectiveness and in some cases, integrity
are lacking. There are a number of causes (apart from historic neglect),
which affect the ability of the Customs Department to progress with some
speed to a state of greater efficiency. Neither the Revenue Board nor the
Customs Department iu required to publish a periodic account of the
transaction of business, or the comparative performance of their revenue
and control systems. This relative freedom from informed public criticism
reinforces indifference to the seriousness of the problems in the Customs
Department. The accountability of the Revenue Board and Customs for major
shortcomings in the management and operations areas is very slight by
modern standards.
2.       A striking aspect of the Customs Department is the extent to which
labor-intensive and grossly excessive levels of checking and control are
applied. Every import entry, invoice and supporting document is checked
completely. Every consignment of import freight, and every container
delivered in Jamaica is subject to physical examination.  Every arriving
and departing passenger is subjected to questioning and to a written
declaration. In the majority of cases, this colossal scale of checking is
carried out by relatively unskilled staff. The baggage hall challenges at
the airports, produce duty yields (e.g., J$28.2 m at N. Manley Airport),
but this is no more than to be expected given the scale of imports by
returning residents. In most other areas of high volume checking there is
no indication that the operations have contributed anything in terms of
additlonal revenue. There are no records to show what has been gained and
it is apparently very rare to raise an additional duty charge. This is
extraordinary. Most entry branches raise a fair proportion of additional
duty charges, with considerably less checking. This is an example of the
lack of concern by line managers at all levels to remedy a cumbersome,
expensive and ineffective system once it has become established. Similar
examples may be found in the control of import and export cargo, in
warehouse control, control of duty free shops and to a greater or lesser
extent in most other important areas (except as regards the main excise
duty commodities: alcohol, tobacco, etc.). Cash accounting arrangements
are generally good, and based on NCR terminal operations.
3.       Effective performance at the crucial operational level requires a
number of contributory factors.
(a)    Systems need to be based on a sound analysis of the activity or
traffic to be controlled and the risks associated with



- 49 -
ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 8
particular comaodities and circumstances. This means
discrimination in checking, challenging and clearing in customs,
and discrimination in the controls applied to the relative risk
associated with the variety of traders dealt with in the
internal tax systems.
(b)   Discrimination requires a higher level of positive line
management of staff and work loads. Fewer checks means that
they should be well chosen for positive reasons and carried out
in depth and with adequate skill.
(c)   Operational staff need the essential aids to efficient working
practice (i.e., Tariff, Law, Notes, I instructions, equipment.
etc).
(d) Staff should be conscious that their skill and performance is
being fairly and competently assessed and that their future
prospects are related to satisfactory reports.
4.       The position of many staff in the Customs and Excise Department is
the antithesis of this. There is no risk-evaluation system which
encourages initiative at work. There is no incentive to sustain and
improve personal performance to develop a career. Management support, in
the sense of skill, experience and decisiveness is not often in evidence
(although there are some marked exceptions to this, in particular
locations, which show that it can be done). Aids to efficient working are
virtually non-existent. The Tariff is a scarce commodity in the Customs
Department, which is at the very least an eccentric circumstance. If a
Tariff can be obtained, it will be the 1978 edition. Baggage officers can
adopt reasonable expedients for duty assessment of coumonly imported items.
It is extraordinary that invoice inspectors, entry documentation and
physical examinations to determine liabilizy can be conducted without
access to and considerable experience and fandliarity with potential
alternative tariff liability headings.
5.       In other areas similar sbortcomings prevailed.  It is evident that
there is inadequate enforcement of controls on other duties and taxes. It
is fairly generally accepted that the standards of control and enforcement
of consumption tax is inadequate. Long delays in payment of travel tax are
tolerated, especially by Air Jamaica. The control of the large number of
duty free shops is inadequate. Some have not been visited or subject to
audit or inventory check for years. Arrears of Excise taxes are estimated
to amount to 3J40.0 million in the past year. There is a low level of
additional assessment, and offense action in the control and management of
internal taxes.
l *Notes* means the tariff and nomenclature notes dealing with the
interpretation of tariff headings and classification of goods.

Customs Reforms Plan of Action
Sack-ground.
1.    Changes in the allocation of responsibilities in Jamaica for initiating
and managing reforms were made in mid-1990.   In particular,  the role and
responsibilities of the Revenue Board was reduced, and a Revenue Protection
Division of the Ministry of Finance was established, with primary responsibility
for accomplishing planned changes.
2.    allocation of Resoonsibilities and Institutional Chances.   The Revenue
Protection Division (RPD) will focus on: the development and implementation of
reforming changes in Customs and Excise; the quality of management; operational
standards; revenue performance, and compliance with Government and Revenue
Protection Division policy and directions.
3.    The RPD will establish a management  inspection unit to monitor the
effective implementation of reforms to enable the Division to fulfil the
responsibilities defined.   The unit will be staffed by active and resolute
officers experienced in revenue systems, performance assessment, management and
operational planning. They should also have considerable knowledge of Jamaican
customs and traditions. Inspection arrangements should provide for periodic and
comprehensive inspection of the effectiveness of each fiscal system and sub-
system, and the efficiency of management in each major location. Reports should
be made directly to the head of RPD.
4.    In order to ensure that RPD can acquire and retain the considerable
technical expertise required the Division should have the right to seek out and
recruit for its specific needs the most able and suitable staff, regardless of
where they are presently employed, and will be given precedence within the
operational staffing of the revenue service.
5.    When the process of reform is completed Customs and Excise would be
managed on an autonomous basis by the Commissioner. When this stage is reached,
it will be imperative to ensure that inspection and management audit skills
developed by RPD are not allowed to lapse or decline.   Early consideration
should be given to this question (as inspection and audit programmes are
developed) to determine how they will be sustained in future.
6.   Manaaement  of the  Customs Reform--Operational Planning.    Under the
direction of RPD, Customs will institute a structured system of management and
operational planning. The objective will be to focus management's attention on
key concerns and revenue risks. Planning should be primarily directed to the
achievement of trader compliance and revenue protection. It should also cover
organization, resource, development and similar factors .iich influence the
effectiveness of individual management units.   Planning systems should be



- 51 -                        ANNEX IV
Page 4 of8
mandatory for every management unit which has the discretion to decide and
organize its work priorities. This will require the development of supporting
information systems covering targets; achievement; performance management;
manpower availability and disposition.
7.    The development and implementation of functional systems of revenue and
import control will depend on the effectiveness of the inspection, audit,
management and operational systems suggested above. If these are not
developed as a matter of priority, it will be difficult to ensure that systems
of improved revenue control will be adequately implemented or effectively
maintained. Priority will be given to these developments.
8.    Trainina Proaram.  A training needs survey has been taken, followed by a
statement of policy on training issued in November 1990. It was agreed with RPD
that a training program would begin early 1991.
9.    Reform of the Imoort-Entrv Function.  The reform of import control from
arrival of ship/aircraft to final clearance and post-importation checking may
take some time. However, to arrest some immediate inefficiencies, the import
entry function will be reorganized as much as possible and as quickly as
possible. In the long run, the system will be selective in checking and risk-
responsive, with attention proportionate to discriminating assessment of risk,
complexity, and revenue significance. As well as an interim efficiency review
of entry branches, a concurrent pilot exercise adopting more advanced techniques
for documentary and physical examination should be conducted by a small team of
specially selected officers. This would provide a comparison of the effLcLency
of work and the level of discovered error, misdeclaration, duty underpayment,
etc., between a selectively focused system and the present arrangements.   It
would also provide the data and experlence on which the design of the final
system might be more soundly based.
10.   Import Valuation Svstem.  In current valuation practlce, ln cases of doubt
or dispute, the procedures for determination of values under Brussels or GATT
arrangements were not generally applied.   In all cases where a satisfactorily
evidenced basis of value has not been determined by application of the most
relevant rule, a deposit of cash sufficient to cover the maximum possible duty
(etc.)  liability will be required.   Upon a written request for release or
deposlt, the importer will be advisod in writlng of the time allowed for the
production of satisfactory evidence. If such evidence is not forthcoming, the
deposit will be appropriated, and subsequent simllar importatlons will be
subjected to increased deposit requlrements. RPD should conslder ln detail how
the reformed import entry system is to apply the valuatlon rules prescribed by
GATT. This will call for speciflc expertise and information bases relevant to
the clrcumstances envisaged by each valuatlon rule. The Bank has asked to be
informed as to progress in the promulgation of revised valuatlon procedures to
importers, and the development of Departmental practice in this area.
11.   HarmoniLpd Sariff  Avstem.    Jamalca  adopted  the  Harmonized  Tariff
Claseification with the lntroduction of the new CST. The adoption of a tarlff
system which lntegrates non-tarlff constralnts, prohlbitlons or requLrements to
each commodity heading or transaction code would be of conslderable assistance



- 52 -                            ANNEXIV
Page 5 of 6
to entry and examination staff, and to importers. The customs reform will focus
on the steps needed to incorporate the Harmonized Tariff system into Customs
practice.
12*  Cash Remittance System.   To counter the risks associated  with the
acceptance of cash payments of duty by individual officers at outstations, etc.,
a  reformed  Cash  Remittance  System  is  essential.    fPD  has  started  the
implementation of such a system details of which have been communicated to the
Bank during negotiations.
13. QmM&terisation. The Steering and Implementation Committees has defined
the strategy for computerization of import control, in consultation with Fiscal
Services Ltd.
14.   Customs Systems Traffic.  In the majority of customs systems traffic is
dealt with on the principles of cognizance, canalization and concentration of
control. Cognizance means that customs should be aware as early as possible of
the nature of imported items, canalization means that traffic should be confined
from as early a point as possible to a channel of control and custody
appropriate to the particular traffic. Concentration of control follows from
imposition of the principles of cognizance and canalization.   It permits
appropriately designed controls to be applied with the degree of specialization
and rigor suited to the particular circumstances.
15.  The control of informal commercial importers is in conflict with each of
these principles. The traffic consists essentially of merchandise, but is mixed
with the arriving baggage flow. This lack of early cognizance and appropriate
treatment is the initial factor which leads to difficulty in baggage halls
because it is ineffectively canalized for effective concentration of appropriate
control procedures.
16.  RPD should be authorized to consider the most appropriate means of
resolving the difficulties associated with the control of ICI-. The following
is an example of what might be done to effect the improvement discussed above.
i)  ggnzance:  Importations of ICIs would be regarded as merchandise
and not as baggage. To identify the packages imported by ICIs as
merchandise, the passports of ICIs should be stamped with the
legend "Commercial Importer". A legal obligation to apply for this
endorsement should be enacted. Airlines bringing ICs to Jamaica
would be required to label the packages loaded by a "Commercial
Importer" passport holder with labels of a prescribed and
conspicuous color pattern for ease of identification.
i$)   Canalization: On arrival in Jamaica packages labelled in
"Commercial Importer" colors would be segregated on unloading
from all other baggage. These packages would not be delivered to
the baggage hall carousels, but directly to an examination area
which is segregated from the baggage hall.   At the immigration
point, ICls would be directed to the segregated examinatLon area.
There they would identify and claim their packages.



- 53 -                            ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 8
lii)   Concetnration of Controlt At the inception of the new system, the
examination area would be strongly staffed by the best officers and
revenue agents available.   In addition, management's presence
should be considerably strengthened. The examination area and its
associated facilities should be sufficient to accommodate an entry
unit to process a simplified form of import entry. Valuation rules
should be applied in the sam way as for normal freight, including
deposit requirements if value evldence is unsatisfactory. Over a
period of time, the segregation and canalization of this traffic
would enable a highly specialized control to be developed and
minimize (by rotation of staff, strong managerial supervision and
direction of ICIs by supervisors to particular benches) the
opportunities for collusion between staff and importers.
RPD will give urgent consideration to this implementing problem.
It is likely that, If import freight reforms result in more
effective control of the non-ICI sector, ICa will have a greater
incentive to expand the volume of their operation unless early
action is taken. This will make it even more essential to develop
an effective system of control to ensure fair treatment between
competing modes of merchandise imports.
17.  Inteoration of Svgtems with Airoortg and Ports.   The effectiveness of
import control and the development of secure, efficient and speody delivery of
imports does not rest entirely on the success of Customs reforms.  It also
depends on the security, reliability and efficiency of port and airport
authorities and their handling and management system.   In this light, the
procedures, practices and management of airport and port authorities will be
examined with a view to strengthen them and improve the compatibility between
traffic operations and Customs procedures.

observations during the October 1990 Post-appraisal mission.

Lndication of the expected lead time to implementation.

inspect, monitor and assess the quality of performance in Custom
during the period of reform, eg., by the establishment of an
Laspection and audit unit as suggested or by equivalent means.

19.         During negotiations  (January 31,  1991)  the above actions were
reviewed and achievements in different areas of reform were discussed in detail.
The Bank negotiating team was satisfied with the progress in the implementation

comprehensive management inspection and control systems to
monitor all areas of Customs performance.
xvii) Management, operational planning and systems of
work measurement and achievement will be substantially completed
in the Customs Department.
xviii) A satisfactory valuation system for all merchandise
and commodity imports will be implemented.
xix) The system of controlling informal commercial
importers will have been redesigned to ensure maximum compliance
with the Customs Law.
xx) A comprehensive user specification for the
implementation of a reformed system of control of import entry
processing, examination clearance and post-importation controls
will be completed and ready for full scale testing.
xxi) Training arrangements in Customs will be fully
established.
xxii) The construction of a Harmonized Tariff will be
substantially completed.
xxiii) Decisions on the design and implementation of
computer based systems will have been finalized, and the strategy
and time scale for completion will have been determined (e.g.
Export System, Goods Control System, Instruction Manual System,
Guarantee System, Customs Broker Licensing System, Incentive
Scheme, Library System).
xxiv) The Revenue Protection Division will have discussed
with port and airport authorities the means by which commercial
and customs controls can be effectively integrated.

JAMAICA
February 15, 1991
Deir Mr. Conable:
1.       The Government of Jamaica wishes to request a World Bank
loan to support its trade and financial sector reform programme.
2.        The main objective of this programme is to revitalize
growth and employment generation over the medium-term, to
strengthen the incentive system, to help solidify the country's
export oriented development strategy, to redre3s the balance of
payments deterioration and to finalize the deregulation of
financial markets and make the allocation of financial resources
more efficient.
3.   Before going into the specific action programs through which
the policy changes will be instituted let me refer to several other
interrelated matters encompassed in the medium-term macroeconomic
policy framework which guides the country's quest for sustained
long-term growth and improvement in incomes for the population,
particularly those who have been less fortunate and have been more
vulnerable to the adjustment process.
A. Macroeconomic Policy Framework
4.       A sound macroeconomic framework,  emphasizing viable
fiscal balances and the maintenance of a competitive exchange
rate, will constitute an important element of overall Government
policy within which the policy and institutional reform measures
will be implemented. A stand-by Agreement with the International
Monetary fund for financial year 1990/91, is in effect. In the
context of the Stand-by arrangement, the Government has concluded
that new initiatives, involving further deregulation of the economy
must be implemented if growth is to be resumed. To this end, the
Government has moved to a foreign exchange system that ensures a
market-determine rate. The Government has also made arrangements
for an orderly settlement of existing arreard.  The Government
considers that the successful operation of the new foreign exchange
regime requires continued tight demand management through



- 69-                       ANNEX VI
Page 2 of 11
appropriate  fiscal,  monetary and  incomes policies.    In this
connection, for 1990/91, the overall public sector deficit
(including grants and the proceeds of divestment as revenues) is
to be limited to 3.3% of GDP.   This has involved measures to
increase revenue collection, and increase utility rates.   The
Government has also increased the prices of petroleum products in
response to the increase in the international price of oil and has
deregulated the domestic market for petroleum products and plans
to deregulate other prices of public goods and services. changes
have been made to ensure that the effect of changes in oil prices
on the costs of electricity generation are passed on automatically
to consumers. On the monetary side, the Government has introduced
a global ceiling on Bank of Jamaica net credit to the public sector
and, consistent with the change in exchange rate policy,  the
Government will, through appropriate monetary policies, limit the
growth in bank credit.
5.   For the medium term, the government will continue to maintain
the market determined exchange rate system and further reduce the
overall public sector deficit (including Bank of Jamaica losses).
The policy and institutional reforms will be implemented within the
Medium-Term Economic Framework for 1990/91-1992/93 dated February
27, 1990. The main objectives underlying the government's medium-
term economic programme are to:
(a) set the economy on a long-term growth path consistently
above that of population growth;
(b)  accelerate the rate of growth of exports, underpinned by
a commitment to maintain a competitive exchange rate;
(c) as a minimum, enable employment growth to keep pace with
the growth of the labour force;
(d) promote economic diversification;
(e) limit the growth of Jamaica's external debt and pursue
viable options for easing the burden of the existing
stock of debt;
(f) strengthen the capacity and management of public economic
infrastructure; and
(g) improve the provision of basic social services.
6.   In carrying out the above objectives, the Government plans to
achieve further improvement in fiscal and external balances as set
out below. However, specific targets for 1991/92 would be reviewed
again in mid-1991 and further improvements in those balances would
be effected, if necessary, in light of the final formulation of the
Government's economic programme for 1991/92, which we expect to be
supported by the IMF.

Page 3 of 11
7.   In the area of public finance, Government policy will focus
on deficit reduction and on continued enhancement of the efficiency
and the equity of public revenue and expenditure systems.   As
noted, the government is committed in the context of the current
standby arrangement with the IMF to efforts to limit the overall
public sector deficit to 3.3% of GDP in 1990/91.   The objectives
in 1991/92.   The objectives in 1991/92 will be to reduce this
deficit a stage further, to within a range of 2.2-2.8% of GDP and,
in 1992/93, to 1.6-2.2% of GDP.
8.   On the revenue side, the principal measures will be the
introduction of the General Consumption Tax to replace the plethora
of complex indirect taxes, and the strengthening of Customs and
other revenue collection. On the expenditure side, public sector
employment will be contained to permit adequate allocations of
scarce funds for non-wage current expenses, for counterpart
contributions to Capital expenditures, and for attracting the
motivating skilled personnel. The Government will proceed with an
administrative reform programme to further improve the incentives
and  efficiency  of  the  civil  service  and  selected    public
enterprises. Major public enterprises have been restructured in
recent years. The pace and scope of reforming public enterprises
are to be maintained and, whenever possible hastened and expanded.
Substantial steps have been taken since 1989 in the divestment
programme to further divest the telecommunications sector, hotels,
government lands and certain public hospital services.   In the
coming years, more enterprises and activities are to be devolved
to the private sector. The Government will insist on operational
efficiency, including, as necessary, periodic tariff adjustments
for enterprises still remaining, for justifiable reasons such as
natural monopolies, in the public sector. At the same time the
Government  will  make  strong  efforts  to  correct  managerial
deficiencies in such firms.
9.   Within  the  severe  constraints  imposed by  external  debt
obligations, and more recent international developments affecting
the national efforts to increase the gains from trade, the
government is determined to improve its external trade and payments
position during the period covered by the Medium Term economic
Framework. In quantitative terms, the key objective is to reduce
the external current account deficit from the equivalent of 10.5%
of GDP in 1989/90 to a level of under 7% of GDP in 1990/91, under
6% in 1990/91, and under 5% in 1992/93.   To the extent that
external financing would not be available to Jamaica in the amounts
envisaged in the projections, the government would be committed to
reducing the external current account deficit below the above-
mentioned levels in line with the financing shortfall. Further
specified objectives are to hold the ratio of debt service-to-
exports of goods and services to no more than 35% in 1990-91, not
including new debt rescheduling arrangements, 29% in 1991/92 and
27% in 1992/93; and the ratio of external interest payments to GDP
to 7.8% in 1990/91, 7.3% in 1991/92 and 7.2% in 1992/93.   In
addition, it will be an objective to improve the Bank of Jamaica



-71                       AMEX VI
Page 4 of 11
foreign exchange reserves position over the same period.  In order
to achieve this objective, the government would maintain a flexible
exchange rate policy and not rely on additional import and/or
foreign exchange controls.
10. In the area of financial sector reform the Government intends
to continue to develop the legal and operational frameworks
necessary for the separation of monetary and fiscal policy. This
means the Bank of Jamaica will continue the shift towards base
money management in the context of medium-term financial reforms.
The financial reform measures will include those measures spelled
out in paragraphs 24 and 25 below which will be. supported by the
proposed Second Trade and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan.
il. Trade promotion will constitute a major policy priority and
the Government will deploy the relevant policy instruments-- for
example, the exchange rate, tariffs, tax provisions-- in close
harmony to induce efficient growth of production and trade.   The
Government will also seek to streamline and resolve unnecessary
institutional or administrative impediments to the growth of
Jamaica's external trade, and it will channel necessary investment
resources towards infrastructure required to support production and
export activities. Jamaica's trade reform programme, initiated in
1987, was designed to alter, over a period of four years, the
instruments of protection from quantitative restrictions, reference
prices and high as well as widely dispersed customs and stamp
duties to a small number of duty rates within a narrow band.
specific measures already taken and planned are spelled out in
paragraphs 14 to 20 below.
12.       The Government's external debt management strategy will
pursue two broad objectives. First, improved monitoring of the
existing debt; favourable rescheduling of current maturities of
bilateral and commercial debt; and an active programme of
debt/equity conversions for commerical banks' sovereign debt. The
local institutional framework for implementing this objective is
already in place. The government's second objective will be to
minimize future borrowing requirements through sustained reduction
of external current account deficits; attraction of. private capital
and direct foreign investments; and enhanced recourse to
concessional external loans. This objective is underpinned by the
Government's clear commitment to strong export growth, attractive
business environment and mobilization of donor support for the
public investment programme.
13.       The emphasis given to the requirements for structural
economic adjustment should not be construed as undermining our
degree of commitment to social progress. The government's Human
Resources Development Programme will continue to be accorded the
highest of priorities.   This programme encompasses projects in
public health, in education, and in poverty alleviation schemes
which emphasize improvements in nutrition and employment assistance
together accounting for one half of the resources allocated for
human resource development. Improved targeting of nutritional aid
(including the phase-out of general non-targeted food subsidies



- 72 -                      ANNEX VI
Page 5 of 11
and the expansion of other programmes) and new employment
.initiatives including those rural works and related training for
women and youths, will be especially emphajized.
B. Trade Policy Reform
14.       From the outset of the structural adjustment programme
the government has given high priority to improving the incentive
framework for the industrial sector. The sector suffered severely
in the 1970's and early 1980's from a number of external events:
the two oil shocks, the decline in international demand for and the
price of bauxite and alumina, and the increasing difficulties
experience by CARICOM.   These external factors, however, were
magnified by an incentive system biased against exports. Incentive
policies which, at the time, included extensive quantitative
restrictions, encouraged production for the protected domestic and
regional markets and discourage exports to markets outside the
CARICOM area. These shortcomings impeded the recovery process and
hindered  the  Government's  export-led  growth  strategy.    The
Government, therefore, set out to create a climate conducive to
private  initiative  and  enterprise  by  introducing  programmes
strengthening the market system through the reductions of controls
on prices, import licensing and stage marketing.
15.       A  programme  for  the  elimination  of  quantitative
restrictions on imports was initiated in 1982 and by 1985 the
majority of such restrictions had been eliminated. These measures
were complemented by the introduction of a more flexible foreign
exchange policy and a number of incentives to exporters. In 1987,
the government enbarked on a four-year programme to simplify and
reduce the wide dispersion in the tariff system, broaden the tariff
base, and minimize QR's. This was to involve adjustments in the
aggregate of customs and stamp duties to a range between 5% and 30%
by the end of the reform period, the elimination of most exemptions
and ministerial remissions, and the removal of all items from the
restricted import list and from the system of reference prices and
protective stamp duties, except for a few items produced by small
farmers   who would require protection beyond the end of the
programme period and items requiring government import control for
security , and health reasons.   IBRD Trade and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan in the amount of US$40 million (Loan 2848-JA) was
made to support the first two phases of the trade reform programme
and some financial sector reform measures covered below (paragraph
19).
16.       The first two phases of the reform programme were carried
out during 1987 and 1988. In early 1987, the government formally
notified CARICOM of its intention to negotiate a revision of the
Common External Tariff (CET) which would make it consistent with
the Government of Jamaica's Reform Programme.  In January 1987, the
Government stopped granting tariff exemptions under Ministerial
remissions, except for firms exporting 100% of their production,
and for a small number of items involving national disasters,
charitable programmes, etc.  In the same month, stamp duties on raw



ANNEX VI
- 73                        Page 6of 11
material imports were reduced from 16% to 10%.  In February a
number of measures were taken: the maximum CET and stamp of 5% on
items imported by the utility companies came into effect; 50 of the
88 items on the duty free list (Second Schedule), representing some
30% of imports in this category were removed from the list (and,
in March 1988, 6 items, representing a further 11% of 1985 imports
of goods on this list were removed); some 100 items were removed
from the list of goods requiring licenses; the Government removed
protective stamp duties from 56 Agricultural items and removed
eight items from the list of reference prices, (and in March 1988,
reference prices were removed from an additional 17 items). In May
1987, a Tariff Reform Committee and Anti-dumping Committee were
established and the Government initiated training schemes for
Customs Agents and began to establish a number of new systems to
improve revenue collection by the Customs Department. Subsequent
to the implementation of the above measures, in December 1988,
duties on capital goods other than vehicles were reduced from
between 25% and 60% to a maximum of 20%.
17.       In addition to the above measure, additional reforms have
been agreed to be taken under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment
Loan approved by IBRD in 1989. The government has eliminated all
QRs for the protection of small farmers and replaced them with
equivalent stamp duties which are being phased down to the CET
levels in most cases within five years, but in some cases in three
or seven years. It has also agreed to replace all reference prices
and QRs for agricultural and agro industrial products with
equivalent tariffs and stamp duties and reduce them over five years
(and in some cases three or seven years) to the CET level.
18.       The Government has now embarked on the third and fourth
phases of the Trade Reform Programme which consist of the actions
spelled out below. The revision in the CET, negotiated in CARICOM
and introduced on February 15,,1991, provides for a range of tariffs
on imported goods between 0% and 45%. This falls short of the
Government's objective announced in 1987 to achieve a range of
tariff between 5% and 30%. This continues to be the Government's
medium term objective and it plans to propose and promote the
lowering of the CET within CARICOM to at least these levels
progressively over time.
Initial Actions
19.       The third phase of the trade reform programme is underway
and consists of the following main actions:
(i)      Tariff rates have been revised for all items to the
0% to 45% levels under the new CET except for
precious and semi precious stones and ammunition;
(ii)     Ad valorem tariffs have been introduced for all
items;



- 74 -ANNX VI
Page 7 of 11
(iii)     Stamp duties have been retained for revenue purposes
until the General Consumption Tax comes into effect,
but none which would raise total protection above
the maximum CET of 45% except for alcohol and
tobacco;
(iv)      Duties  have  been  introduced  at  the  rates  on
attachment I for items on the duty free list (Second
Schedule);
(v)       Licensing requirements have been eliminated for used
and retreaded tires and replaced by a requirement
that each imported consignment be certified as to

C. Financial Sector Reform
21.       The  government  announced  a  broad  financial  reform
programme in April 1986. The Government had concluded that the
lack of clear delineation between monetary and fiscal policies had
limited the ability of the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) to pursue its
principal role of managing money and credit in line with the
requirements of the adjustment programme.   This had adversely
affected credit allocation and the interest rate structure by
pushing up rates on loans to the private sector. This had delayed
the development of an active and broad based capital market and
imposed a quantitative restraint on private sector credit
availability.   The financial reform programme was designed to
address these issues.
22.       The following financial sector reform measures were
carried out; the liquid asset ratio of the commercial banks, was
reduced from 48% to 38% in 1986, to 35% in march 1987 and to 20%
in march 1988 (i.e., the non-cash portion of the liquid assets
ratio was reduced to zero); the BOJ introduced payment of interest
on three percentage points of the commercial banks' cash reserves
in 1986, and increased this to six percentage points (of the 20%
liquid assets ratio) in March 1988; the BOJ began to issue its own
certificates of deposit in order to increase the range of monetary
instruments available to it and re-established in May, 1986 a
rediscount operation for Government paper; the overdraft ceiling
of the Government account in BOJ was reduced from 30% to 15% of
expected fiscal revenues in March 1986; the BOJ established an Open
Market Committee which developed a money demand/supply projection
model and flow-of-funds model to facilitate the management of
monetary policy; the Government introduced a 180-360 day security
and a longer term bond with variable interest rates so as to
provide alternative instruments to the Government to meet its
borrowing needs and to the BOJ for managing liquidity; the banking
inspection department of the BOJ undertook a staff strengthening
programme and improved its processes and procedures; the Government
reduced the bias against equity financing by reducing the high
corporate rate of taxation, equalized the taxation of dividend and
interest income and abolished the stamp duty on. new shares; the
Government also established a stock market inspection unit to
strengthen disclosure, and investor protection and to prevent
insider trading.
23.       The Government considers that further measures are needed
to further strengthen the means for managing monetary policy,
improve the regulation of financial institutions and make the
allocation of financial resources more efficient. The Government
now plans to implement the financial sector reform measures set
forth below.
Initial Actions
24.       A number of important measures have already been taken,
including the following:



- 77-                       ANNEX VI
Page 10 of 11
(i)      The Banking Act which will strengthen the legal
authority of the BOJ to supervise the banking
system, has been submitted to Parliament for its
approval;
(ii)    A programme of technical assistance to strengthen
the secondary market for government securities has
been agreed;
(iii)    A  programme  for  strengthening  the  supervisory
capacity of the BO0 has begun (see Attachment II);
(iv)     Procedures for auctioning treasury bills have been
amended to permit investors to enter bids at the
average yield determined by the auction to encourage
small investors to invest in this market, and the
BOJ now makes bids on treasury bills that it submits
for Government agencies at the average yield
determined by the auction;
(v)      Interest rates on industrial credits channelled
through the National Development Bank have been
increased to the treasury bill rate;
(vi)     The Liquid Asset Ratio is being eli"iinated between
April 1991 and September, 1991;
(vii)    A programme of adjustments has been announced which
will equalize the cash reserve requirements of
commercial banks on the one hand and merchant banks
and trust companies on the other, between April 1991
and September 1993; and
(viii)    Credit controls have been phased out.
MzseMunt Actions
25.       The subsequent phase of the financial sector reform will
consist of the following measures to be implemented between April
to December, 1991:
(i)      The Government will submit the revised Financial
Institutions Act, Bank of Jamaica Act and Securities
Act to Parliament for its approval;
(ii)     The 1991 programme of adjustments to equalize cash
reserves requirements between commercial banks and
merchant banks (and trust companies) will be carried
out and the programme of adjustments for 1992 will
be announced;
(iii)    Measures recommended by the study to strengthen
becondary markets for government securities will be
taken;



- 78-                       ANEX VI
Page 11 of 11
(iv)     The programme to strengthen the BOJ's supervisoty
capacity will be carried out;
(v)       Interest rates on industrial credits channelled
through the National Development Bank and on
agricultural credits to large farmers channelled
through the Agricultural Credit Bank will be
increased to market rates;
(vi)      Interest rates on loans to small farmers channelled
through the Agricultural Credit Bank will be
increased to the treasury bill rate;
(vii)    A system of accounting in the development banks will
be introduced which will make interest rate
subsidies transparent.
26.       The Government has put together an ambitious programme
of policy reforms designed to have a lasting impact on the economic
and social structure of Jamaica. The Government believes that its
development oriented adjustment strategy is yielding and will
continue to yield positive results.
27.       I should like to stress that while this statement has
mostly focused upon economic adjustment, trade policy and financial
sector reform, continued emphasis will be placed on a socio-
economic programme to sustain growth, employment generation and
policy alleviation. Such development with the adjustment described
in this letter remains our medium-term goal and objective.
28.       In view of the measures being taken, the Government of
Jamaica would appreciate your favorable consideration of its
request for a Second Trade and Financial Adjustment Loan. We look
forward to a continuing exchange of view with the Bank and to the
opportunity to discuss from time to time the progress made in
implementing these reforms.
Yours faithfully,
P. J. Patterson, Q.C., M.P.
Minister of Finance, Development
& Production.

Plan of Action to Strengthen
Supervisory Capability of Bank of Jamaica
1.       During 1991, the financial sector legislation to be enacted, will
clarify and strengthen prudential regulations and greatly increase the
authority cf the Supervision Department of the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) to
enforce compliance with the regulations and the observance of sound banking
practices. In order to respond to the requirements of the new legislation
and the greater authority given to the Supervision Department, a plan of
action, will be carried out by the BOJ Supervision Department to:
(i) Prepare and implement a recruitment program to enable it to
carry out the periodic inspections required by the new Banking and
Financial Institutions Acts on a tir4ly basis and in accordance
with International best practice;
(ii) Develop a manual to cover all banking areas tailored to
Jamaica's regulatory/supervisory strategies and prudential
requirements. The manual would be followed by all supervisory
staff of the BOJ and a copy should be provided to all regulated
financial intermediaries;
(iii) Prepare and implement a training program for the staff;
(iv) Define the range of data to be provided by Fl's to include
analysis of earnings, capital adequacy and problem loans; and
*v) Develop a methodology for dealing with parent company and
affiliates of FI's to assess the overall condition of the group
and the risks and impact of inter-company transactions.
2.       The recruitment and training program have been presented to the
Bank. The Government's commitment to implement the program is set forth in
the Government's Letter on Economic Policy Adjustment.

Duty Drawback System Reogrm
Technical Assistance
Terms of Reference For Consulting Services
In September 1990, the GovernMent of Jamaica (GO0) introduced
a duty drawback system for exporters to enable them to recover
customs duties and other charges on imports which are used to
produce goods for export. In addition to the duty drawback scheme
a number of other provisions are available in the customs regime
for exporters to recover duties on imported inputs. Exporters have
experienced some difficulties in using the new drawback system and
the GOJ wishes to review it and the procedures the Customs
Department follows in administerLag it and streamline it and extend
it to indirect exporters.  The GO0  therefore wishes to retain
consultants with knowledge of and experience in the design and
implementation of duty drawback/temporary admission schemes to:
(a) Review the existing duty drawback scheme and its legislative
and regulatory framework;
(b) Examine problems with the existing duty drawback's
administration arrangements both for customs agents and exporters;
(c) Review the feasibility and practicability of including indirect
exporters in a review duty drawback/temporary admission scheme;
(d) Review the feasibility and practicability of introducing a
temporary admission scheme alongside or as a substitute for the
duty drawback scheme;
(e) M-ake recommendations on a revised duty drawback/temporary
admission scheme which effectively exempts or rebates import duties
and indirect taxes on imported inputs of exports and the
administrative arrangements to apply it.
The consultants will work closely with GOJ officials and
representatives  of  the  private  sector  as  necessary.    The
consultants will work with a counterpart team (consisting of
representatives of the Customs Department, the Revenue Board, the
Revenue Protection Division of the Kinistry of Finance and private
sector representatives, as the 003 may designate), which will mseet
as necessary to provide information of the existing systems and the
problems with them and to comment on the consultants preliminary
recommendation. The Consultants draft report will be provided to
the GOJ for its comments before being put into final form.

responsible for Industry provide office accommodation, secretarial
services, ground transportation and ancilliary services necessary for the
technical assistance.
