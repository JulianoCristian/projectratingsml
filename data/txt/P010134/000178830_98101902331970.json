develop\n            the three Hill districts of Dandeldhura, Baitadi, and\n            Darchula and aims to raise agricultural production to levels\n            whereby farmers could meet full family subsistence. The\n            proposed project would provide for increased agricultural\n            and livestock production through minor irrigation\n            development, strengthening of agricultural extension and\n            animal health services, training, and improved availability\n            of farm inputs. These directly productive investments would\n            be complemented by investments in erosion control, health\n            care, village water supplies, lower and upper secondary\n            education, postal services, panchayat facilities, and trails\n            and foot-bridges. The project also provides for a study of\n            cottage industry potential and prospects."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
