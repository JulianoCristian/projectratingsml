The confidence of the\n            Bank in the ability of line agencies to recruit and post the\n            required number of staff appears to have been excessive. The\n            Bank fielded a total of twelve supervised)on missions over\n            the eight-year period of implementation, which was somewhat\n            below requirements, particularly when considering that nine\n            of them were one-man missions. More emphasis should have\n            been placed on engineering and agronomic inputs into\n            missions. The project achieved its objectives in\n            establishing infrastructure and institutional bases for\n            sustaining project activities. Building maintenance however\n            remains a problem, especially in service centers outside\n            district headquarters. The following are the main lessons\n            that could be drawn from the experience of this project : As\n            demonstrated during the last project extension, it is\n            possible to achieve substantial targets in infrastructure\n            development in remote areas, once communication links are\n            functioning. the flow of funds is secured, a reasonable\n            staff strength is maintained without excessive turnover and\n            if a strong leadership is exercised from the PC's\n            office. Overall, the project achieved the main objective of\n            increasing production as well as improving the welfare,\n            social and environmental conditions of rural hill people."}, "docdt": "1990-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
