The objective of the Plan and the project,\n            is the modernization of facilities to improve the efficiency\n            and competitive position of the railways. The principal\n            components of the Investment Plan are the overhaul of about\n            2,000 km of track, the electrification of about 700 km,\n            station and track reconstruction, modernization of signaling\n            and telecommunication and the purchase of traction and\n            rolling stock; about two-thirds of the investments are\n            replacements. These investments are required to enable the\n            railways to play their assigned role in the economic\n            objectives of Yugoslavia's 1976-80 Development Plan.\n            This Plan emphasizes the development of industries using\n            domestic raw and semiprocessed materials, particularly in\n            the less developed regions (LDRs), which depend to a\n            considerable extent on rail transport."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
