For all\n            three projects, inception was fast and preparation\n            problematic. Differences of opinion between the Bank and the\n            Borrower regarding objectives complicated both the\n            preparation and implementation phases, and led to\n            non-achievement of financial targets.  None of the three\n            projects benefitted from the experience of  preceding ones\n            partly because haste to proceed with the next lending\n            operation did not allow time for reflection, and partly\n            because neither the Bank nor the Borrower were convinced\n            that study of the past is useful in planning the future.\n            Little importance was attached to in-house review and,\n            indeed, it was the Bank who advised CYR, and CYR took the\n            advice that preparation of Project Completion report (PCRs)\n            ought to be done by outside consultants. The fact remains\n            that PCR preparation is an educational experience for those\n            who prepare them and this experience was lost to CYR and to\n            the Railway Transport Enterprise (RTEs). By the same token,\n            the leisurely, and somewhat too generous, editing in EMENA\n            of the Borrower's draft PCRs, demonstrates the limited\n            significance attached to lesson-learned from past mistakes."}, "docdt": "1990-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
