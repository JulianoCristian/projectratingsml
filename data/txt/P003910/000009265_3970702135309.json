Preconstruction impacts include\n            investigative surveys, as well as the processes of land\n            acquisition and resettlement.  The main impacts to be\n            expected during the construction stage are: land clearing\n            and preparation, movement and operation of heavy\n            construction equipment, the extraction or borrow of local\n            materials for construction, the disposal of spoil, and the\n            concentration of a fairly large construction labor force,\n            many of whom may come from outside the local region.  The\n            expected environmental impacts from the power plant will be\n            caused by: gaseous emissions from the chimney liquid\n            effluent and solid wastes from the power plant, housing\n            colony and office facilities.  This study includes both an\n            environmental management plan and an environmental\n            monitoring plan outlining short term and long term objectives."}, "docdt": "1994-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
