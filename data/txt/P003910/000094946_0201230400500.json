Despite unfavorable\n            outcomes, the project flexibility demonstrated by the quick\n            responsiveness to the financial crises, as well as the\n            active stakeholder participation during preparation, and\n            implementation, did however contribute to the success of the\n            project's physical components. But lessons drawn from\n            the project are outlined as follows. To avoid discrepancies\n            between the status of project works, and actual\n            disbursements, contractors' invoicing should be\n            streamlined to avoid unnecessary payments delays. Regarding\n            resettlement issues - where indeed the livelihoods of\n            affected populations are at risk - nongovernmental\n            organizations need to maintain strong community relations,\n            through an active role during implementation, enhanced by\n            strong funding capacity to ensure land acquisition, and\n            relocation issues are rightfully implemented. While the\n            centralized project management did effectively correct\n            actions as needed, demonstrating an effective monitoring,\n            and coordination approach, it was however ineffective in\n            directing the required changes. It is suggested that a\n            programmatic approach to lending, i.e., Adaptable Program\n            Lending, in Indonesia's energy sector, is seemingly\n            more suitable to support long-term policy objectives, and\n            institution building, demonstrated by the unsuccessful\n            project outcomes of this operation's traditional\n            approach to investment lending. Finally, the State\n            Electricity Corporation - with a large investment program -\n            was certainly not the company suitable for the use of\n            \"rate of return on revalued assets\" covenant, to\n            measure financial performance."}, "docdt": "2001-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
