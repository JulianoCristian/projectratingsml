The policy component of the project entails: a)\n            establishing a policy framework for private sector\n            participation; b) restructuring the State Electricity\n            Corporation (PLN) and establishing commercial operations as\n            a limited liability company; c) implementing framework for\n            regulatory oversight of the power sector; and d) introducing\n            formula-based power tariffs, as well as bulk power purchase\n            and supply tariffs. The physical component of the project\n            will finance economical and environmentally sustainable\n            expansion of PLN's generation capacity, with associated\n            transmission lines, in the islands of Sumatera and\n            Kalimantan and improve service reliability. The physical\n            components are: a) construction of a hydoelectric power\n            plant with related transmission facilities; b) construction\n            of a mine-mouth lignite fired thermal power plant with\n            related transmission facilities; c) procurement of two\n            barge-mounted power plants; and d) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1994-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
