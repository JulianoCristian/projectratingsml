                              RESTRUCTURINGPAPER



SUMMARY
1. The Land Bank of the Philippines has proposed changes to the project to make the
necessary adjustments to account for implementation delays. The key changes in the
project include: (a) deletion of three subcomponents (Ilaya, Manggahan and Tapayan
sewage treatment plants (STPs) under the Sewage Management Component; (b) the
addition of Fort Bonifacio (Taguig Northeast STP) as replacement for those dropped; (c)
revision of targets of outcome and results indicators affected by the deletion of STPs; and
(d) reallocation of loan proceeds among expenditure categories.


PROJECT STATUS
2. The loan agreement was signed on July 22, 2005 and the project became effective on
March 06, 2006. The project has been under implementation over five years and due to
implementation delays, the closing date has been extended by two years to June 2012.
As of January 17, 2011, about 49% of the loan has been disbursed.

3. The supervision mission conducted in September-November 2010 concluded that
overall project implementation remains Satisfactory. The Septage component has been
completed as early as 2008while the Institutional Strengthening(IS) component is
progressing as scheduled. The few activities left in the IS component are the ongoing
information campaign, Marikina Riverbasin Masterplan and feasibility study and third
party environment audit. The delays in the Sewage Management component were
resolved and construction is moving ahead. Five(Pineda, Poblacion, Olandes, East Ave.
and Road 5) out of the original nine STPs have beenphysically completed and are
undergoing process proving.

4. As mentioned above, three STPs were dropped due to land issues and greater technical
difficulties. The corresponding results indicators that will be affected by the deletion will
also have to be revised. A replacement STP ­ the Fort Bonifacio STP (Taguig Northeast)
was endorsed by the Department of Finance as replacement for those deleted.

5. The Taguig STP (part of the Taguig Central Sewer Project) encountered delays due to
land acquisition issues and a natural calamity. After resolving the land issues in Taguig,
typhoon Ondoy occurred in September 2009, when the project was about to be awarded.
Project redesign was needed to mitigate the impact of recurrent flooding increasing the
cost of the STP. Hence, the need to reallocate more funds to the civil works category.
The Taguig STP contract was signed in December 2010 and construction will commence
soon.

                                             6
6. Manila Water has committed to closely monitor the progress of remaining project
activities, particularly the two Taguig STPs, witha combined project costUSD30.19
million (Bank portion only), representing forty-seven percent of total loan funds.

7. LBP requested for several amendments to the loan agreement as early as December of
2009. It sent a follow-up request letter to NEDA on February 16, 2010. However, the
Government's endorsement for the loan extension was only received by the Bank on June
16, 2010. The Bank approved the Government's request for a two-year extension of the
closing date of the project on June 30, 2010. The endorsement for the reallocation and
inclusion of a replacement STP was received by the Bank on October 20 and 27, 2010.
However, the Bank could only start processing the restructuring of the project when it
received LBP's 2009 audited financial statements in the first week of January 2011. The
submission of the financial statements is part of the legal covenant under the loan.



PROPOSED CHANGES

   · Results/indicators
   While the PDO remains unchanged, some targets of the outcome and results
   indicators need to be revised as a result of implementation delays and due to deletion
   of subcomponents in Part 1. See Annex 1.

   · Components
   Under Part 1, Sewage Component, three STPs (Ilaya, Mangaahan and Tapayan) were
   dropped due to land issues and greater technical difficulties. The Department of
   Finance has endorsed the replacement STP ­ Fort Bonifacio (Taguig Northeast).

   ·   Financing
          o Reallocations
          There was a substantial increase in cost for the Taguig STP (part of Taguig
          Central Sewer System project) due to structural changes in the design to
          withstand the impact of flooding. A total of JPY318 million is requested to be
          reallocated for the civil works component. The total loan amount remains
          unchanged. See Annex 2.

   · Implementation schedule
   MWCI has submitted a revised implementation plan, which includes a procurement
   and disbursement schedule for the remaining activities of the projectto the
   September-November 2010 mission. The revised schedules are acceptable to the
   Bank. See Annexes 3 and 4.




                                            7
APPRAISAL SUMMARY
  There are no changes in the economic and financial analyses, technical, social,
  environment, or exceptions to Bank policy form the original Appraisal Summary of
  the PAD.

  Risks
   · The only risk identified is if the two Taguig STPs encounter delays in
      construction and will not be completed by the revised loan closing date. LBP and
      MWCI have agreed to update the Bank on a quarterly basis on the status of the
      STP and immediately alert the Bank of any potential delays that may occur.
