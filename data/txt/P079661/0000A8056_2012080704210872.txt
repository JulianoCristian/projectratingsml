                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives of the Manila Third Sewerage Project are to: (a) increase the coverage and effectiveness of sewerage service delivery in participating areas
                         of Metro Manila through an integrated approach involving septage management, sewage management,and heightened consumer awareness of water pollution problems
                         and their solutions; and, (b) establish the financial and technical viability of new approaches for sewage management in MM.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project implementation continued to make progress as it nears closing on June 30, 2012. The Septage Component was completed in 2009 while activities under the
                         Institutional Strengthening Component are expected to be completed by loan closing. Under the Sewage Management Component, eight sewage treatment plants (STPs) were
                         planned to be constructed as a result of the project restructuring in February 2011. However in the course of implementation, due to unavailability of land, technical and other issues,
                         it was decided to construct a bigger STP that will serve the sewer systems of Taguig Central. The number of STPs was reduced to seven and a sewer network subproject. To-date,

                         six STPs have been physically completed.

                         The project development objectives (PDO) will not be fully achieved by loan closing. The first PDO of increasing the coverage and effectiveness of sewerage service delivery in
                         participating MWCI concession areas has been partially met through the operation of the septage treatment plants and the STPs. Under the Septage Component, the vacuum trucks

                         purchased desludged more septic tanks and the operation of the two septage treatment plants built increased the volume of septage treated before disposal. However, under the
                         Sewage Management, since only six out of the eight STPs will be operational due to the cancellation of the Taguig subprojects, the outcome indicator - the number of STPs treating
                         combined flows that comply with relevant discharge standards- will not achieve its target at project close.

                         The second project development objective of establishing the financial and technical viability of new approaches in sewage management was achieved through the construction and
                         design of the STPs. An example would be is the innovative design of the Olandes STP in Marikina, with the STP facility built underground and a park on top for community use and
                         the Pineda STP facility was built under a basketball court due to unavailability of land in a densely populated area.

                         Cancellation of the Taguig subprojects (an STP and sewer network) will lead to partial cancellation of the loan. This has been discussed with the client and all parties have agreed
                         that no further extension of the loan will be requested.
