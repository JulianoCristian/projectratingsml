                         participating areas of Metro Manila through an integrated approach involving septage management, sewage management, and heightened consumer awareness
                         of water pollution problems and their solutions; and, (b) establish the financial and technical viability of new approaches for sewage management in MM.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make progress in achieving its project development objective of increasing coverage and effectiveness of sewerage service delivery and establishing the
                         financial and technical viability of new approaches in sewage management through the following activities: 1) completion of septage treatment plants in 2008 and 2) completion of
                         three Sewage Treatment plants (STPs) with two more by the end of the year. Three indicators remain underachieved due to the delays encountered in the land acquisition and post
                         typhoon Ondoy retrofitting, although, one of this indicators is catching up as more STPs will be completed within the year. The retrofitting increased the sub-project costs which

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The government, through the Department of Finance, endorsed the requests of Manila Water and Land Bank for the replacement of the three STPs to one STP to use the remaining
                         balance of the loan, and the corresponding reallocation of loan proceeds on October 27 and October 20, respectively. The restructuring is being reviewed by the Bank and approval is
                         subject to the submission of the 2009 audited financial statement, which is a financial covenant of the loan agreement. Likewise, affected results indicators will be revised to reflect
                         the changes.
