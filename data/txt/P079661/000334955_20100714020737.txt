                          Extension of Closing Date
             PHILIPPINES: MANILA THIRD SEWERAGE PROJECT
                                  P079661

                                   Restructuring Paper


1.    The closing date for the Philippines: Manila Third Sewerage Project (Loan No.
7311-PH, Project ID No. P079661) will be extended from June 30, 2010 until June 30,
2012.

2.      The supervision mission conducted in April-May 2010 concluded that the overall
project implementation performance is Satisfactory. Two components (Components 2,
Septage Management and Component 3, Institutional Strengthening) are proceeding
ahead of schedule. Despite of the delays in Component1, Sewage Management,
implementation has progressed significantly in the past few months and project
objectives continue to be achievable. Four sub-projects will be completed within the
calendar year 2010. Disbursement improved to forty-two percent of total loan funds from
twenty-seven percent in about the same period last year. The construction of the Taguig
STP, which comprises thirty-four percent of total amount of the loan, is scheduled to be
awarded by September 2010 and expected to be completed in June 2012.

3. The proposed extension of the closing date is necessary to allow completion of the
sub-projects under Component 1, Sewage Management.

4. This will be the first extension of the Loan.
