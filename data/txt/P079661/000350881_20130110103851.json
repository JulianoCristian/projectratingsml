were as follows: overall\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, and both the Bank and the borrower\n            performance were moderately satisfactory. Some important\n            project lessons learned were: (1) On Use of Private Land vs.\n            Public Land. MTSP experience is that purchase acquisition of\n            private land, if available, for the project is more\n            transparent, easier and less troublesome, in the long run.\n            (2) On Technology Choice. The MTSP experience indicates that\n            an assessment of the optimization of the design of the\n            facilities and choice of technology is recommended.\n            Conventional Activated Sludge process might not be the best\n            technology option if the utilization rate remains low for an\n            extended period of time (5-10 years after construction).\n            Other technology options that may be phased or that are\n            modular in design may be more energy efficient in the long run."}, "docdt": "2012-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
