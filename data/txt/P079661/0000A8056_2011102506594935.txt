                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives of the Manila Third Sewerage Project are to: (a) increase the coverage and effectiveness of sewerage service delivery in
                         participating areas of Metro Manila through an integrated approach involving septage management, sewage management, and heightened consumer awareness
                         of water pollution problems and their solutions; and, (b) establish the financial and technical viability of new approaches for sewage management in MM.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation of the project is progressing well. The project is likely to achieve its project development objectives by loan closing. It has improved the coverage and
                         effectiveness of sewerage delivery service in the MWCI concession areas. It has also established the financial and technical viability of new approaches in sewage management.
                         This is evident in the number of septic tanks desludged and the volume of sewage treated before disposal, which exceeded their targets for the year 2010. The volume of biochemical
                         oxygen demand removed by septage and sewage treatment plants also exceeded their targets for year 2010. The volume of BOD removed has reached 126,420 tons in year 2010

                         vs. the target of 20,400 tons per year. One indicator - the number of sewage treatment plants treating combined flows that comply with relevant discharge standards - is catching up
                         with two fully operational, three under testing and process proving and one expected to be completed by project close in June 2012. Even if the Taguig subprojects (which are
                         encountering delays) are dropped, the project development objectives can still be be achieved.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As we are delayed in the Taguig subprojects, we intend to continuously monitor the progress of discussions between the city, homeowners' association so that we could come up with
                         concrete decisions before the year ends. In view of this, the next supervision mission will be in the first week of December 2011.
