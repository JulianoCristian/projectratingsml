Morocco was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            indicate that the demand-responsive and community-based\n            approach to service provision introduced by the project;\n            ensures the sustainability of water schemes in rural areas\n            provided that : (i) the system is simple to operate and\n            maintain (simple technology covering a limited number of\n            people and villages), (ii) the social fabric is cohesive\n            among beneficiaries; and (iii) the WUA/local organizations\n            receive sufficient training and support during the\n            operational phase until they are capable of managing the\n            scheme both technically and financially. Different water\n            supply technologies and management models need to be\n            considered according to local conditions. The approach\n            successfully adopted under the project - based on a local\n            source of groundwater and a simple Rural Water Supply (RWS)\n            system serving and managed by a Water Users Association\n            (WUA) - is reaching its limits. To reap the full health\n            benefits of RWS schemes, future RWS projects in Morocco\n            should ensure that the MOH has the means to fulfill its\n            responsibilities vis-\ufffdis water quality (chemical and\n            bacteriological test of drinking water, sanitary conditions\n            of water points) and hygiene education. Good donor\n            coordination from project design to completion, (i) ensured\n            that the approach followed to improve the access to safe\n            water in rural areas was the same throughout the country;\n            (ii) allowed to allocate considerable resources to the\n            sector; and (iii) help refined project design and\n            implementation by sharing views and experiences. Project\n            benefits for women and girls were high (i.e. time savings\n            and less physical burden fetching water, increase school\n            attendance of rural girls). But, they could have been even\n            higher if more rigorous attempts to achieve direct\n            participation of women in project implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
