More than two-thirds of girls in\n            this area did not attend school. Today, however, Houda\u0092s\n            generation of rural Moroccans are benefiting from new\n            water-supply facilities constructed throughout the\n            countryside. In a bustling schoolhouse, she and her\n            classmates exemplify a sweeping transformation: during the\n            past four years, rural primary school attendance for girls\n            has skyrocketed from 30 to 51 percent. What made the\n            difference? In 1998, the Moroccan government launched the\n            National Program for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation\n            (PAGER), constructing and rehabilitating water supply and\n            sanitation facilities in 27 rural provinces. Initially\n            funded with a $10 million loan from the World Bank, PAGER\n            proved such a resounding success that bilateral donors\n            offered an additional $300 million to replicate it\n            throughout the country."}, "docdt": "2003-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
