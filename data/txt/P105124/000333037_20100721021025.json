      were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the operation has shown that significant\n            progress towards strengthening institutions and giving voice\n            to environmental sustainability is possible under difficult\n            conditions. As with other operations, the success of this\n            major pillar of the HPDPL relied to a large extent on the\n            commitment and ownership shown not only by the political\n            authorities at the highest level but also by executing\n            agencies. A wide consensus regarding the importance of the\n            reforms existed, as attested by the steadfast implementation\n            of the operation soon after the change in government\n            following the elections. The authorities acknowledge that\n            the framework set by the operation enabled them to overcome\n            inertia and obstacles and press forward in a timely manner.\n            On the other hand, the continuing fiscal difficulties\n            experienced in HP show that the operation could not fully\n            eliminate the structural deficit, which is the legacy of a\n            low revenue base, and a high burden of debt, salaries, and\n            pensions in the state. However, intensive supervision by the\n            Bank team and pressure exerted by the operation's\n            deadlines supported implementation of mitigating actions,\n            without which slippages will have been larger."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
