needed to achieve sustainable and\n            rapid economic growth and inclusive development over the\n            medium term, while sustaining the environmental heritage of\n            the state. The priority areas for the operation will be\n            fiscal adjustment and promotion of environmentally\n            sustainable development-with particular reference to the\n            development of hydropower. The overall program will also\n            support reforms to enhance growth and employment, and\n            improve governance and public administration. The operation,\n            consistent with CAS objectives, supports measures to\n            institutionalize fiscal stabilization and to sustain rapid\n            economic growth in one of India's major \"special\n            category\" states. Fiscal reforms and measures to\n            strengthen financial accountability should reduce the\n            state's dependence on debt financing, while increasing\n            fiscal space for development expenditures along with their efficiency."}, "docdt": "2007-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
