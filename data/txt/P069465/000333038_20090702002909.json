Financial Services\n            Project for Ghana were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: improving financial services to the poor\n            requires substantial effort to strengthen rural Microfinance\n            Institutions (MFIs) including Rural and Community Banks\n            (RCBs) in order to expand their outreach. A comprehensive\n            competency profile is required to understand their capacity\n            building needs, and to tailor training appropriately. There\n            is a tension in the appropriate role of the Apex Bank. It\n            has an important role to play in monitoring the performance\n            of its member RCBs, and in promoting deepening of links\n            between the RCBs with other MFIs to expand access of the\n            poor to financial services. At the same time, it needs to\n            enhance commercial viability and move away from its reliance\n            on government and donor funding. The quality of training\n            providers and business development services for rural MFIs\n            cannot be assumed. Development of curricula and the constant\n            screening of capable training providers are required and\n            must be constantly updated to reflect evolving best practice\n            and the dynamic needs of the sector. Robust and efficient\n            project management is more likely with strong state\n            institutions that have an existing compliance ethos. This\n            can be further supported by ensuring internal control\n            systems for the project are based on those prevailing in the\n            implementing institution, thereby being familiar to project staff."}, "docdt": "2009-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
