  Project for Ghana were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: innovations should be vetted through pilot\n            and stakeholder consultations to ensure suitability for the\n            local context. A pilot for the formal and informal linkage\n            program will have highlighted implementation challenges,\n            which can then have been addressed before scaling up.\n            Widening financial intermediation by reaching new markets or\n            sectors requires appropriate strategies or innovative\n            products that address these markets. The design of an\n            effective training program requires clear identification of\n            the content of the training to be imparted, the capacity of\n            trainers, and who and how many will be trained. Despite\n            regular policy dialogue, the project team on its own was not\n            successful in reducing subsidies even though directed credit\n            and subsidies had a direct bearing on the project's\n            intermediate objective of financial widening and deepening.\n            The shortage of measurable indicators and an appropriate\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) system can reduce a\n            project's ability to make timely corrections as well as\n            to track its impact. Project teams should be careful to\n            avoid project development objectives that are too general to\n            be effectively monitored."}, "docdt": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
