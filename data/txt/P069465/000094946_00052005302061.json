"The Rural Finance Services Project seeks\n            to promote growth, and reduce poverty in Ghana, broadening\n            financial inter-mediation in rural areas, by strengthening\n            operational linkages between micro-finance institutions, and\n            rural and community banks, and building their capacities.\n            The components will: 1) focus on strengthening\n            micro-finance, by developing, organizing, and training\n            communities, and, supporting capacity building for\n            micro-finance institutions, within the existing initiatives,\n            such as the Ghana Micro-finance Network, Susu groups,\n            women's banking initiatives, and cooperatives, and\n            credit unions; 2) focus on restructuring weak rural banks,\n            strengthening their operational effectiveness, and the\n            internal controls of all rural banks, providing information\n            technology, logistics, and staff training. Banking\n            rationalization will be improved through a defined criteria,\n            linked to the individual rural bank capacity; 3) finance\n            technical assistance needed to implement, operate, and train\n            an apex bank for the rural, and community banks, and,\n            support its initial capacity building activities; 4) provide\n            support to the Bank of Ghana, namely, the Banking\n            Supervision, and Rural Finance Inspection Departments,\n            upgrading staff skills, and improving technologies, enabling\n            effective project activities."}, "docdt": "2000-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
