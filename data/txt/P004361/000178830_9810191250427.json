           will finance over a period of three years a share of\n            PNGDB's planned agricultural lending and also support\n            the expansion of related agricultural services. The project\n            has two principal components: (a) field development of\n            coffee, cocoa, oil palms and rubber, and piggery and poultry\n            enterprises through sub-loans made by PNGDB; and (b)\n            expansion of hybrid coconut planting materials supplies, and\n            of other support services to agriculture, such as crop\n            development teams, consultants and studies. Planned field\n            development is made on the most promising investments based\n            on current investor familiarity and interest, available\n            management, and favorable marketing prospects. To encourage\n            new development the Government will contribute up to K 3,000\n            / subproject towards the development costs. During\n            implementation, it is proposed that lending for other crops\n            also be included if it is established to the satisfaction of\n            PNGDB and Government that such lending is justified. The\n            proposed project is expected to bring about technological,\n            managerial and institution building benefits to the country.\n            It should also improve the standard of living of beneficiary\n            farmers, raise productivity, increase production and exports\n            and promote import substitution."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
