      Credit Project for Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the\n            Government's reform program to improve the investment\n            climate and further develop economic space to promote\n            domestic and foreign investment and private sector growth.\n            Objectives of the reform program are to reduce those\n            administrative and regulatory barriers that will have the\n            most critical near-term impact on the three phases of\n            business development: 1) improving business entry through\n            streamlined and transparent countrywide approach to business\n            registration and licensing and strengthened legal framework\n            and capacity for attracting foreign investment; 2)\n            streamlining the environment for business operation by\n            reducing companies' administrative and regulatory\n            compliance costs through rationalization of inspections and\n            regulations, strengthening of judicial and extra-judicial\n            capacity to resolve commercial disputes; improving\n            enforcement of secured transactions; and leveling the\n            playing field for private sector participation in public\n            procurement; and 3) facilitating business exit through\n            improved bankruptcy and liquidation systems. Underlying\n            these objectives is the need to strengthen the consultative\n            capacity between the public and private sectors to promote\n            policies and legislation that are business-friendly. The\n            Credit will be released in two tranches for budgetary and\n            balance of payments support to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n            Tranche releases will be linked to policy conditionality."}, "docdt": "2002-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
