F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Credit supports the Government's reform program to improve the investment
climate and further development of a single economic space to promote domestic and
foreign investment and private sector growth.

  Objectives of the reform program supported by the BAC are to reduce those
administrative and regulatory barriers that would have the most critical near-term impact



                                              ii

on the three phases of business development: (i) improving "business entry" through
streamlined and transparent countrywide approach to business registration and licensing
and strengthened legal framework and capacity for attracting foreign investment; (ii)
streamlining the environment for "business operations" by reducing companies'
administrative and regulatory compliance costs through rationalization of inspections and
regulations, strengthening of judicial and extra-judicial capacity to resolve commercial
disputes; improving enforcement of secured transactions; and leveling the playing field
for private sector participation in public procurement, and (iii) facilitating "business exit"
through improved bankruptcy and liquidation systems. Underlying these objectives is the
need to strengthen the consultative capacity between the public and private sectors to
promote policies and legislation that are business-friendly.

  While the Credit is expected to have significant short-term results in improving the
business enabling environment and promoting increased private sector activity, sustained
efforts to ensure the effective implementation of the reforms will be required to build up
long-term investor confidence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The key is to initiate critical
changes that lead to strong momentum toward a self-sustaining process of improving the
investment climate.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

In 2000-2001, at the time when Business Environment Adjustment Credit (BAC) was
conceptualized and developed, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was emerging from the
post-war reconstruction period, characterized by strong growth and underpinned by
sound macroeconomic performance, but the country needed to focus on generating
sustainable growth momentum. Despite an overall increase in incomes, many Bosnians
remained worse off than before the war and unemployment was painfully high (37
percent). A fragmented postwar governance setup made decision-making difficult and
hampered reform efforts. Projected reduction in donor support required significant fiscal
and other adjustments in the period beyond 2000, and the emerging opportunity for closer
ties with the EU offered incentives, but also imposed the need for accelerated structural
and institutional reforms to include the country in European integration processes.

The two key challenges for Bosnia and Herzegovina were to take ownership of its
economic future by assuming increased responsibility for economic policies and
outcomes; and to promote sustainable growth and employment in an inclusive way that
provided increasing incomes and opportunities for all citizens. These goals were
embodied in the first Bosnian Economic Development Strategy (EDS) for 2000-2004
and a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The key medium-term challenges
included (i) strengthening governance and public sector management and (ii) fostering
private sector-led growth. Progress on structural reforms aimed at building a market-
oriented economy had been slower than hoped, and privatization in particular had been
delayed. Deeper and more consistent structural reforms were needed to permit sustainable
growth and substantial employment, and key reforms required a transparent and

                                                        1

predictable enabling environment, accelerated privatization, continuation of banking
sector reform and a flexible labor market.

Economic situation at Start of Operation to the Present. The prevailing
macroeconomic situation at the time of preparation of BAC was satisfactory. An IMF
Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) had been successfully concluded in May 2001, and a letter
of intent for a new IMF program was signed by the authorities on March 27, 2002. While
annual economic growth averaged over 29 percent in real terms during the post-war
period 1996 to 2000, the rate of growth declined from 10 percent in 1999 to 5.5 percent
for 2000 and about 4.5 percent in 2001. In recent years, BH economic expansion remains
robust, in large part driven by a jump in international metal prices, earlier reforms, new
metal-processing capacity and significant remittance inflows. Real GDP growth, which
averaged five percent a year since 2000 and reached six percent in 2007, helps return the
level of GDP to near its pre-war level. But much more remains to be done to ensure
sustained growth and to reduce risks to hard-won fiscal stability.

Formal employment was low, but finally rising. According to official statistics at this
period, unemployment had already been cut in half from its high of nearly 80 percent at
the end of the war. After several years of labor shedding, hiring has begun to increase and
overall employment was reported to have risen five percent in 2006. Unemployment has
eased to 29 percent in early 2007 from 31 percent in 2006 and continues to improve. Still,
sustained improvements in employment will require stronger structural changes in the
pattern of productive activity.

Owing to the stabilizing effect of the currency board, inflation was at an annual rate of 3
percent at the start of the BAC and remained generally low throughout the intervening
years (under 2 percent in 2007), with the exception of one-off surge to 6.1 percent in
2006 as a consequence of the introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT).

The current account deficit systematically remained the greatest macroeconomic
challenge, although the shortfall may be smaller than officially estimated. The
officially estimated current account deficit hovered near 20 percent in GDP in 2002 ­
2005, but dropped to 13.1 percent of GDP in 2007 due to an across-the-board export
growth and improved statistical reporting. Moreover, the current account deficit may be
much smaller than is officially estimated due to the underestimation of remittance inflows
and other current transfers.

Net capital inflows have consistently exceeded the current account deficit, boosting
foreign exchange reserves. Reserves rose to $4.7 billion at the end of 2007 (or 6.6
months' worth of import cover). During the life of the BAC, FDI increased respectively
from 4.3 percent in 2002 to 5.8 percent in 2006, and jumped to 13.7 percent in 2007,
reflecting substantial progress on privatization, particularly in the RS..

BH's gross external debt fell from 60.3 percent of GDP in 2003 to about 50 percent
of GDP in late 2007, thanks to a rapid reduction in public external indebtedness.
Public external debt amounted to just below one-half of total external debt and is
dominated by obligations to multilateral and bilateral creditors. The World Bank is the
country's largest single creditor with outstanding debt balance of $1.4 billion as of the
end of June 2007 - equivalent to 10.3 percent of GDP. BH's World Bank debt accounted
for about 20.5 percent of the country's overall external debt. More than one-half of BH's

                                              2

external debt is denominated in Euros and about one-half of external debt is contracted at
floating interest rates, resulting in substantial exposure to changing global market
conditions.

Progress in fiscal consolidation has been substantial since the fiscal deficit peaked in
1999 but Government spending is still high. The general government deficit was
reduced from about six percent in 1999 to 1.4 percent in 2004, before shifting to a surplus
of about three percent in 2006. In most of 2007, the general government surplus
amounted to about four percent of GDP, but budget revisions in both Entities reduced the
surplus towards the end of the year. Fiscal consolidation since 1999 has been
accompanied by a reduction in the size of government, with general government
spending down from about 51 percent in 2003 to about 44 percent of GDP in 2006.
Nonetheless, the government burden on the economy expressed as a percentage of GDP
is 4-5 percent higher in other countries with similar levels of per capita income.
Government debt is now low, amounting to 18.6 percent of GDP in the end of 2007,
from above 25 percent in 2004/2005.

Progress on Reform. As determined by a FIAS study, the major weaknesses of the
business environment were:
· absence of a seamless, transparent and predictable legal and regulatory framework
    that was a major impediment to setting up and operating businesses in BH's relatively
    small market;
· lack of consistent and transparent business and administrative regulations and
    procedures that opened the door to abuse of power at various levels of government -
    compounded by the absence of effective and independent appeals mechanisms,
    significantly raised the cost of doing business;
· lack of effective, efficient and adequately resourced judicial systems increased the
    cost of doing business.

Annex 7 further elaborates on the regulatory business barriers that were present before
the start of the program, and the initial reform actions that the government took.

Rationale for Bank Involvement. Within the reform context, business environment
issues represented a set of primary regulatory and institutional interventions to motivate
increased private sector activity and attract entrepreneurship. The Business Environment
Adjustment Credit (BAC) was proposed as part of a series of adjustment operations
extended to Bosnia and Herzegovina following the Dayton Accord. Previously approved
adjustment operations included the Enterprise and Bank Privatization Adjustment Credit
(EBPAC), Public Finance Structural Adjustment Credits I and 1I (PFSAC), and a Social
Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC). A second Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC
II) was under preparation and subsequently was approved. An IMF Stand-by
Arrangement (SBA) was successfully concluded in May 2001; a letter of intent for a new
Stand-by Arrangement was signed by the BH authorities on March 27, 2002.

Within the overarching theme of `increasing economic opportunity and improving the
quality of life for all Bosnians' of the CAS 2000-2002, BAC was designed to `help foster
sustainable and inclusive private sector-led growth and employment'. Its influence on
`strengthening weak and fragmented governance arrangements' within its scope were
also to be significant. The proposed Credit was an integral part of the Government's
Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper submitted to the Bank and the IMF in

                                                3

December 2001, to be followed by a full PRSP in 2002. The I-PRSP envisioned
acceleration of privatization, strengthening of the financial sector, and establishment of
an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment. The I-PRSP further
recognized that a key element of a good enabling environment for business was
strengthening of a single economic space in BH, following the EU example. The BAC
was also consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated May 18, 2000 and
the CAS Progress Report, dated September 24, 2001, which laid out a graduated
assistance strategy aimed at helping BH to formulate and implement a comprehensive
reform program that would accelerate the country's transition away from dependency on
aid toward self-sustaining growth.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The analytical basis for BAC was provided by the FIAS's study `Commercial Legal
Framework and Administrative Barriers to Investment', dated October 2001.

The Credit supported the Government's reform program to improve the investment
climate and further development of a single economic space to promote domestic and
foreign investment and private sector growth. Objectives of the reform program
supported by the BAC were to reduce those administrative and regulatory barriers that
would have the most critical near-term impact on the three phases of business
development:
    (i)      improving business entry through a streamlined and transparent countrywide
             approach to business registration and licensing and strengthened legal
             framework and capacity for attracting foreign investment;
    (ii)     streamlining the environment for business operations by reducing companies'
             administrative and regulatory compliance costs through rationalization of
             inspections and regulations, strengthening of judicial and extra-judicial
             capacity to resolve commercial disputes; improving enforcement of secured
             transactions; and leveling the playing field for private sector participation in
             public procurement, and
    (iii)    facilitating business exit through improved bankruptcy and liquidation
             systems.1

Underlying these objectives was the need to strengthen the consultative capacity between
the public and private sectors to promote policies and legislation that were business-
friendly. While the Credit was expected to have significant short-term results in
improving the business enabling environment and promoting increased private sector
activity, it was recognized that sustained efforts to ensure effective implementation of the
reforms would be required to build up long-term investor confidence in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The Credit focused on the following policy areas (as stated in the Report and
Recommendation of the President):

Board Conditions

The first-tranche policy conditions (listed at section 2.1) that had been met at the time of
Board presentation served to illustrate Government ongoing activities to improve
business environment, including the adoption of a single time-bound action plan for
implementation of business environment reforms by the Council of Ministers (CoM) and
Entity Governments (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina ­ FBiH, and Republika
Srpska ­ RS).

Second-tranche conditions (met during implementation of the Credit) are also listed in
section 2.1 following. Annex 8 provides a non-tabular text listing of the second tranche
conditions that were completed.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

There was no revision of approved policy areas

1.6 Other significant changes

There were no changes to the design, scope, scale, implementation arrangements and
funding allocations. The only significant change involved the 48-month delay in the time
schedule of fulfillment of BAC conditions from originally envisaged December 31st,
2003 till December 15th, 2007, effected through 11 extensions, some as short as 1 month,
in order both to put pressure on the governments and to support legislative action in
parliaments within specified period deadlines (please see section 2.2 for more detailed
discussion of circumstances surrounding extensions).

The BAC program supported the Government's reforms of its investment climate and the
creation of a single economic space, in order to promote domestic and foreign
investment, and private sector growth. The program achieved considerable results in the
course of its implementation, in some cases even beyond the required tranche release
conditions, such as in the case of adoption of the state level laws on Pledge Registration
and on Business Registration. The most significant reforms implemented with BAC
support included the unified business registration laws and inspection laws, vital
amendments to the bankruptcy laws in both Entities, as well as reducing burdens to
business, most notably through shortening the duration of court registration of new
businesses and creation of a single inspectorate in each entity that enabled introduction of
coordinated, shorter team joint visits by multiple inspections. The Register for Movable
Pledges was the first system functioning across Entity boundaries and as such opened the
door for other reforms to promote strengthening of a single economic space in BH. The
policy actions and institutional developments achieved are a powerful indication that the
Governments in the country remain strongly aware of the need to improve the business
environment in the country and coordinate such initiatives across both Entities in
conjunction with the State/National Government.

The package of legislative reforms that has been adopted to date by the Federation and
RS Governments and supported by the Credit was very difficult to implement. Nine
second tranche release conditions per Entity (i.e.: 18 conditions) necessitated adoption of
six laws ­ on Inspections, Business Registration, Foreign Investment Promotion, on
Pledges, Chamber of Commerce, and Bankruptcy; in each Entity. These laws now
promote and facilitate harmonization of the economic space in the two Entities ­ a

process that faced tremendous resistance within some political structures and interest
groups opposed to the new transparent and market-friendly rules of the game.

Business registration. In July 2004, the BH CoM succeeded in adopting a framework
State-level (national) law on business registration, which required prescribed acceptance
of business registrations from one Entity in the other and mandated conformity of the
registration requirements. Subsequently adopted Entity business registration laws went
further than BAC conditions: they specified a maximum period of 5 days for completion
of the court segment of the registration process, which was tighter than the second
tranche requirements, and restricted the number of registration steps to no more than 7.
Field surveys and system data showed that the number of steps required to register
businesses and number of days to register a business were reduced from the baseline.2

In the fall of 2007 the five major courts in FBiH started fully utilizing the new
computerized business registration system and completing court registrations within 8.5
days, compared to 23.7 days reported in the May 2007 survey.                            Since no other
legal/regulatory changes occurred since the May 2007 survey,3 this improvement reduced
the overall time to commence operations to 27 days on average in FBiH, which
represented evidence of the condition having been met. Other courts in FBiH also began
to apply the new business registration system in the fall, and as of January 1, 2008, nine
out of ten courts were fully utilizing the system. The Bank team continues to work with
the Ministry of Justice and the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) to assist
in resolving the organizational and capacity difficulties that had so far prevented the
implementation of the computer-based business registration in the City of Mostar. As
predicted and confirmed by the regular monthly reports from the FBiH Business Register,
after the initial period of adaptation, the performance of the courts continued to improve.
The sustainability of the system is ensured by the legal requirement included in the
Business Registration Law, which mandates FBiH Ministry of Justice and FBiH
government to maintain and keep the system operational.

In the RS, the system did not start functioning as quickly as in FBiH, but began catching
up. The biggest court in RS (Banja Luka), covering some 50 percent of new business
entrants in the RS, has used the system successfully. In November 2007, the Banja Luka
court registered companies on average in three days, compared to 17 days reported in the

    registration in RS by a net 14 days, bringing the total for commencing operations to 18
    days4 (using same assumptions as for FBiH above), thus meeting the condition.
    Subsequently, the RS courts halted using the system while waiting for implementation of
    identified changes to the software and establishment of legally required reporting IT links
    with RS Statistical Office and BH Indirect Taxation Administration. These late-stage
    activities, which became needed after the completion of the DFID-funded systems
    project, were timely and very flexibly supported with funding extended by the UK
    Embassy in Sarajevo. The Law mandates the RS Ministry of Justice and RS government
    to maintain and keep the system operational, thus assuring sustainability of the system.

Operations


    Inspections. After completing the inventory and review of inspection systems in both
    entities, Entity governments adopted the Action Plans for inspection reform, and
    proceeded with drafting and adoption of the relevant laws, which were passed by the
    Federation Parliament on June 1, 2005, and by the RS Parliament on July 28, 2005. Both
    laws incorporated advances in the manner of operation of inspections, bringing together
    some 26 different inspections from 8 Federal and 9 RS ministries into 10 inspections
    under the auspices of a single Inspections Directorate in each Entity. These laws provide
    for streamlined inspection services on entity and sub-entity levels; clarify and define the
    public mandate of the inspectorates and inspectors; and institute rational, planned
    inspection schedules and guidelines. The increased efficiency of inspections operations
    helped reduce average annual number of on-site inspection days. The adoption and
    implementation of these laws, as well as creation of the unified Entity inspectorates
    represents positive progress in the process of improvement of the business environment.

    Bankruptcy. To simplify business exit or restructuring and regulate the difficult process
    of labor release during enterprise closure and restructuring processes, both Entity
    parliaments amended bankruptcy laws (RS National Assembly in December 2003 and the
    FBiH Parliament in March 2004). These amendments restricted workers' priority
    compensation packages from previously unlimited periods, to 6-9 months of minimum
    salary and contributions and mandated a maximum of two months for laying off of
    workers in the bankruptcy process.


    4  BAC targeted the court-based registration as the single longest component of the business registration
    process. As late as May 2007, court-based registration still took 24 days in FBiH and 17 days in RS (out of
    the total duration of process to commence operations of 44 and 32 days, respectively). Please see the
    Business Adjustment Environment Credit Field Survey, prepared by PULS Sarajevo, 29 May 2007, p. 8.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Although with four years of delay, the BAC was ultimately completed with success
because private sector and market issues, gradually but inevitably, increased in visibility
and importance, and the attention was increasingly received by all governments.

Government commitment. These delays were caused by the greater than perceived
complexity of conditions in relation to the government capacity and commitment, and by
the necessity to deal with a number of ministries and agencies of two Entity governments,
where the normal political sensitivity to reform, particularly in election years, was
considerably aggravated by different political views of Entity governments and varying
level of capacity of the agencies involved. A peculiarity of BAC implementation was that
the 48-month delay in reaching a successful conclusion, was effected through various
extensions, some of them as short as 1 month, which were meant both to put pressure on
the governments and to support legislative action in parliaments within specified period
deadlines.

Government capacity. Delays were caused more often by bureaucratic incompetence
and lack of interest, as well as incentives and even comprehension on the part of both
civil servants and elected officials, than by principled opposition of a political or interest
group. Both the existing and specially installed leadership and coordination channels,
such as the Coordination Board for Economic Development and Economic Integrations,
as well as the BAC working groups and the designated BAC entity coordinators, in
combination with the efforts of a number of other champions, allowed sufficient options
to find adequate combinations of pressure and persuasion to overcome particular
obstacles and keep the processes moving.

Complexity of the operation's design, with nine conditions for each Entity (under the
second tranche) was the main reason for the years of delay. The credit required
involvement of different Entity ministries, in some cases for several conditions at the
same time (particularly in the case of Entity Ministries of Justice), while the inspections
reform affected 9 ministries in RS and 8 in FBiH and resulted in the creation of new
Entity Inspections Directorates. The BAC also created a completely new state-level
Registry of Movable Pledges and impacted one state level agency (FIPA), 16 large
municipal courts in charge of business registration, and the Entities' chambers of
commerce.

Risks. Main risks associated with the proposed Credit were: (i) complex and fragmented
governance arrangements in Bosnia and Herzegovina-Entities, Cantons, municipalities
and cities-that proved challenging for implementation of reforms at lower levels of
Government; (ii) momentum or commitment that could be lost in the lead-up to and
aftermath of the fall 2002 elections; and (iii) rooted mindsets of the system of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as well as in vested interests in the current
system that could result in resistance to change and delays, as many continued to view the
private sector with suspicion and others stood to lose opportunities for rent-seeking.

Annex 9 elaborates on some of the risk factors, how these were mitigated, and the
strengthened project supervision which resulted in a highly satisfactory QAG rating.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Design. Since previous experience in BH had shown that changes to laws and regulations
alone were not always effective in achieving results on the ground, the Credit
incorporated performance-based results indicators as second tranche conditions. These
outcome-based conditions were intended to ensure effective implementation of key
reforms and achievement of tangible improvements in the business environment. In
particular, as discussed earlier, the authorities agreed to decrease the duration and number
of steps to register a business and to reduce the compliance burden on businesses as
measured by the on-site inspector time spent by those inspectorates common to all
businesses. Annex 10 provides more detail on the M&E measurement instruments and
impacts that were quantified.

It was expected that the result of full adoption of the reform package would be verified by
the Governments through enterprise surveys. The main purpose of conducting surveys
was to provide the authorities a tool to monitor progress in the quality of the business
environment. Moreover, it was expected that the process would facilitate building
capacity in the Governments to continue monitoring the environment and regularly use
surveys as a potent enterprise policy and public awareness instrument.

Implementation. As the majority of the nine BAC conditions for each Entity involved
legislative actions, the Bank Team worked closely with government and where necessary,
parliamentary counterparts, to support adoption and ensure that the new acts or
amendments met the Credit conditions. An independent system for monitoring results and
determining compliance for tranche release was established. Under oversight by the
Association and FIAS, a baseline survey of administrative and regulatory costs of doing
business in BH was conducted by a local NGO among 302 randomly selected majority
privately-owned companies that were representative of the country's economic activity
and sectors. The survey instrument, sample size and methodology for the baseline survey
was established in cooperation with FIAS to allow comparison with other countries that
had undertaken similar surveys. The resulting baseline indicators set the starting point for
each Entity. Although abbreviated surveys for assessment of progress against the baseline
indicators were planned every six months throughout the term of the reform program,
these were not implemented at these intervals because the improvements had not moved
with such speed, and there was insufficient funding for this purpose in the BB budget. In
addition to the semi-annual surveys, a full survey was carried out with donor assistance
every 18 months for at least three years. In addition to results of the surveys, regular
monitoring of the program was carried out by field-based Task Team members, including
a TTL, and supported by periodic supervision missions. The team coordinated very
closely with other donors, particularly those providing critical technical assistance
necessary for the implementation of the reform program. Two subsequent full surveys
were conducted, in 2004 and 2006, following the described methodology.

Utilization. The 2004 survey showed minor progress, because the major institutional
interventions, inspections and business registration reforms, were not in place due to
extended delays over the adoption of the inspection laws and implementation of the
business registration system in the courts. In May 2007, the second full survey showed
that the outcome targets of the inspections reform were attained, because the
establishment of the two Entity inspections directorates had produced intended efficiency
improvements. However, the delay with the establishment and operationalization of the

                                               11

court-based registration system prevented the attainment of targets for the condition,
which led to the last 6-month extension in June 2007. For verification of the actual
fulfillment of this last condition, the Bank team relied on the computer-generated reports
on the average duration of court-based registration to demonstrate the fulfillment of the
last conditions (see Table 2 above).

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

The Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2008-2010 recognizes the need to
support the development of the private sector as one of two main pillars for BH's
development. Following the cancellation of PTAC, droppage of the PDPC and the
conclusion and subsequent closing of the BAC, the next stage of activities in the sector
currently envisaged for FY 2010, will be carefully prepared and introduced. The ongoing
subnational Doing Business survey by the IFC/FIAS and the ongoing ICA study will
prepare the groundwork for any next project. Smaller current efforts, such as the project
for Accelerating Enterprise Restructuring through Privatization Investment Funds,
supported by an EC Trust Fund Grant, and a FIRST initiative to create a unified Bosnian
stock exchange index will permit the Bank to maintain an active policy dialogue in the
sector. The Annual Doing Business survey will permit a partial monitoring of further
progress in business enabling environment (BEE) areas, although the design of BAC
preceded the launch of Doing Business reports and therefore does not fully correspond to
its categories and methodology.

Additional areas to build on the results of the BAC, in line with private sector
development in BH, should include further analysis of SME development, investment
and credit access, subsequent stages of state enterprise restructuring and privatization,
further restructuring and ownership change of previously privatized socially-owned
enterprises, and continued examination of how to reduce remaining regulatory barriers to
business.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

With the focus on improving the conditions for private business initiatives, the objectives
of BAC were fully aligned with the private sector objectives of CAS 2000-2002, as well
as the BH Action Plan and the Letter on Development Policy. The CAS recognized both
the high potential and the high risk of BAC, and the operation was rated as a high priority
both for the country and for the Bank.

BAC objectives also incorporated the Bank's focus on freeing private business initiative
and creating conditions for growth of the private sector's contribution to GDP. In the
Bosnian conditions of an underdeveloped private sector and limited natural resources, the
fast improvements in the business environment were central to ensuring long-term
sustainability and competitiveness of the country's economy. Most BAC conditions also
increased transparency and reduced the scope for corruption in the policy areas that were
addressed.

BEE is a continuing priority. The continuing relevance of the BAC objectives and
design is evident in the need for second generation reforms in institutional and legal

                                              12

barriers for investment, and the priority given to PSD and BEE in the Bank's new CPS,
where private sector development is one of the key strategic areas of focus. The Doing
Business rankings, in which BH has generally lagged the region, confirmed the
continuing need for support in the private sector policy area. The country's governments
recognized this in a joint Statement published in October 2007, in which commitment to
improvements of business environment was prominently featured as part of a new Policy
Action Plan that was made public.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The Macroeconomic framework has been satisfactory. Real GDP growth averaged 5
percent a year since 2000 and reached 6 percent in 2007. With the exception of a spike
related to VAT introduction, thanks to the currency board arrangement, inflation remains
generally low, and averaged 1.5 percent in 2007. The general government deficit was
reduced from 6 percent of GDP in 1999 to under 2 percent in 2004, then switching to
surplus of 2.4 percent in 2005 and 3 percent in 2006. The current account deficit remains
large, but it has narrowed from nearly 20 percent in 2004/2005 to 13.1 percent of GDP in
2007, though it may be much smaller because of underestimation of remittances and
other current transfers.

The business registration system in courts is exceeding expectations. The uniform
business registration laws5 were adopted by both Entities, on the basis of the state-level
framework Business Registration Law, and provided for a unified approach to the
registration process, including recognition of registration of one Entity by another, a
shared registration database, and conformity of requirements. Exceeding the requirements
of the credit (30 and 23 days in FBiH and RS, respectively), the new entity laws
mandated a maximum of 5 days for court business registration after all required
documents were submitted, and limited the number of required steps to seven. The new
laws also introduced some simplifications of the verification process, valid throughout
BH, thereby reducing costs to businesses. The surveys done in 2005 (FIAS ARCS
Survey) and 2007 (BAC Survey), showed that the average number of mandatory steps to
commence operations was eight in 2005 and between six and seven in 2007. The Doing
Business 2007 survey found that 5 steps or fewer were needed to register a business.
Annex 10 elaborates on the various mechanisms used for measuring reform results and
the instruments supporting that purpose.

The Pledge Registry. The CoM adopted a state-level Law on the Pledge Registry,6 and
the registry itself became operational in November 2004. The registry permits a
centralized view of all collateral posted, allowing for a transparent system to support
collateralized and secured transactions. With support of the USAID Pledge Registry
Project (PRP), a unified state-wide system of pledge registries was established, which
also was an improvement on the original BAC condition. A total of 670 clients are now

The new business inspection system: Both Entity Governments adopted the inspections
laws in 20057 after extended drafting and consultation processes and considerable delays.
The laws established unified Entity Inspections Directorates, which proceeded with
preparation of accompanying by-laws mandated by the adopted legislation in order to
specify internal processes and detailed procedures to be followed by the inspectorates.
Manuals for inspectors and codes of conducts, operationalizing the requirements of the
laws were adopted, and training of inspectors was conducted in 2005 (with support of a
SIDA Trust Fund). The new inspection system, in accordance with the adopted Laws,
became fully functional and operational in March 2006 in RS and in January 2007 in
FBiH. This new system is already yielding results in terms of reduction of burdens to
businesses, greater revenue collection, more transparent organization, and greater
effectiveness and efficiency (fewer days on enterprise premises per annum) of the
inspections.

Table 5 clearly shows a significant reduction in days after the 2005 reform. Estimating
the economic benefits through monetizing such results shows significant gains for
businesses. Assuming that one employee is designated to deal with inspections during
the on site visit, on average companies in BH (averaging days in RS and FBiH) saved
some 28 days per annum compared to baseline and that the average daily gross salary in
BH in 2006 was 43.7 KM,8 the savings of the reform per individual inspected firm is
1,224 KM per annum.

Improving effectiveness of inspections. While both inspectorates find it difficult to
compare their achievements with the activities of their predecessor organizations due to
lack of indicators and comparable historical data, their results nonetheless illustrate the
level of effort and the shift in the approach. Considerably increasing its efforts, the RS
General Inspectorate conducted a total of 186,449 inspections in the first year of
operations, 15,539 inspection measures were taken and 2,710 infringement reports filed.
Nearly KM 11 million in fines was paid into the budget. A particularly apt example is

December 14, 2005, Gazette No. 69/XII.

the results of labor inspections. In the RS, the inspectorate discovered 7,437 illegal
workers out of 97,085 working in the 10,196 firms visited. Subsequently, 4,633 workers
were registered (which should yield additional KM 8 million in taxes and contributions
annually).

During the recent campaign of the FBiH General Inspectorate against unreported workers
from June to December 2007, the FBiH Pension fund reported additional 60,000 workers
who were previously undetected as officially employed by their employers, and KM 70
million was already paid to the FBiH Pension Fund by companies to meet the past due
commitments9. These workers formed a significant part of the grey economy as they were
not registered with the unemployment bureaus or anywhere else. This number
technically represents some 12 percent of total official unemployment in FBiH. Among
these workers there were some 25,000 that are now officially de-listed from the
unemployment bureaus, where they had been collecting social benefits but made their
living also by working off-the-books in companies. The process is on-going to de-list
more workers from unemployment bureaus as the data is being cross-checked.10 Such
actions were not possible prior to the reform, and the newly established Inspectorate
quickly proved an adequate tool for the government and legal business to tackle the grey
economy.

Increases in tax receipts in recent years also confirm the effects of the inspections reform.
According to the statement from the FBiH Government, total revenues in the first seven
months of 2007 amounted to KM 758.4 million. Compared to the same period in the
prior year, total revenues were up KM 172 million or 29.3 percent, as a result of
improved enforcement."

Bankruptcy and liquidation system. Taking into consideration the powers of trade
unions and complexity of governance, adoption of the bankruptcy and liquidation laws
was a significant achievement. The new Entity laws on bankruptcy and liquidation11 and
subsequent amendments, which aimed to support reduction of unproductive loss-making
enterprises and free assets for use by new entrepreneurs, are already yielding results,
evident in the increase in number of enterprises entering bankruptcy. Interestingly
enough, bankruptcy is also becoming increasingly acceptable for concerned workers as
well. The USAID FILE project provided follow-on assistance with training of judges and
bankruptcy receivers. There remains a need for stronger capacity to speed up the
bankruptcy process.

10According to Mr. Jago Lasic, Deputy President of the Federation BH Chamber of Commerce, the effect
of this action will imply the payment of gross wages of about 193 million KM, out of which 76.5 million
KM will be paid to Federation BH budget in the form of social and pension contributions in the coming
months.

FIPA was strengthened. The law on the Foreign Investment Promotion Agency (FIPA)12
was adopted in late 2004, establishing FIPA as a State-level (national) agency and
providing the legal basis for independent and successful FIPA operations in the future.
To date, FIPA offices have been operating with full staffing in both the FBiH and RS.
Future monitoring will be useful to assess if the results of its policies and incentives for
attracting new foreign direct are having measurable economic impacts.

Obligatory membership in the chambers of commerce system was abolished. The
legal changes to the Entity laws on chambers of commerce were adopted in mid-200313
following an extended debate in the Entity Parliaments. The new provisions became
effective in January 2004. The Chambers of Commerce actively lobbied against adoption
of these Laws as they would break the chambers' monopoly and halt mandatory
membership. These changes forced the Chambers to reorganize and assume a more
client-oriented and pro-market attitude. This was the first time in the Balkans region that
membership in the Chambers is voluntary. The chambers, although dissatisfied with these
changes, noted that they now provide more and better services, bringing in more revenue.
Before the abolition of the obligatory membership, the ratio of the revenues of the RS
Chamber of Commerce was about even between membership fees and service fees. After
the law was passed, the chamber had some difficulties, but it also invested efforts to
improve its services and nowadays the split is 67:33 in favor of service-based revenues,
and the total revenues increased by 25 percent. The RS Chamber managed to avoid lay-
offs, and by 2008 managed to add 20 percent new, younger employees.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The achievements of BAC, though having been substantially delayed in some specific
areas, are nevertheless considered very satisfactory in terms of measurable results in the
context of the political and institutional/capacity problems encountered and targets
achieved. The policy areas selected for intervention were identified by sound ESW
(FIAS) and the interventions themselves were intended to bring about a combination of
short- and longer-term results. Outcomes such as two state-level laws (Business
Registration and Pledge Registry), and continuing efficient Inspections Directorates, and



12BH Law dated December 15, 2004, Gazette No. 56/04.
13For the FBiH this was dated July 8, 2003, Gazette No. 34/X/03, and for the RS law was dated June 3,
2003, under Gazette No. 39/03. The laws provided for a lead-in grace period of 6 months prior to
becoming fully effective.
                                                  16

better-than-expected reductions in the duration of business registration processes, were to
a considerable degree made possible by the extended exposure of the relevant institutions
and stakeholders to the policy issues and dialogue (also see Annex 10). This was,
unexpectedly achieved via the longer program implementation period, which, in
retrospect was necessary to build-up complementary institutional capacities and allow in-
process dissemination of the policy issues across various jurisdictions and agencies. If
there had been fewer delays, the rating would have been left at Satisfactory and if there
had been no delay at all, would even justify a Highly Satisfactory rating. However, given
the long delay in implementation, and despite meeting (and exceeding) all the program
targets in the end, the project is conservatively given a moderately satisfactory rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

In light of high unemployment, which is one of the most pressing problems in Bosnia and
Herzegovina in the public perception, the BAC orientation towards strengthening the
private sector was the most sustainable and long-term solution to reducing poverty. The
grey economy, another prominent ill in the society, became easier to combat with the
progress of inspections reform. And even bankruptcies, which were originally resented
and rejected by the workers and avoided by policy makers, have gradually become
accepted as a way to end long agonies of hopeless SoEs and free-up useful resources.
This was helped by governments' providing limited funds to cover at least several
months of overdue wages prior to liquidation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional component of the Credit took the form of creating new institutions and
strengthening existing ones, through training (including with coordinated donor funding ­
SIDA for inspections), as well as advice and consultations in the preparation of various
by-laws (such as inspectors' codes of conduct and manuals). The Entity Inspection
Directorates were created by merging 12 and 10 offices in FBiH and RS, respectively, to
allow for synergies and to separate the regulatory and inspection functions. The new
State-level Pledge Registry now helps expand access to finance to small businesses by
making public the availability of collateral under a single unified system. The 15 major
courts in RS and FBiH were recipients of both hardware and software for the new
business registration system, as well as of considerable training, which is now
encouraging further cooperation between the courts, and efficiency improvements in the
enterprise registration process. Courts and bankruptcy trustees also received significant
support in developing the capacity for effective management of bankruptcy and
liquidation processes.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

The work on BAC exposed a wider group of Entity government officials to modern BEE
concepts and laid the groundwork for other initiatives that were subsequently undertaken,
such as the Regulatory Guillotine14, implemented by FIAS in RS and currently underway


14 The regulatory guillotine is a flexible method of regulatory reform which entails a rapid review of a
large number of regulations against clear criteria to identify those no longer needed through an orderly and
                                                       17

within several levels of government. The dissemination of knowledge and relationships
established under BAC, both between the Bank and the authorities, and between different
governments/jurisdictions themselves, will facilitate implementation of further BEE
initiatives.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

   Rating: Moderate

The risks to the Development Outcome are rated as moderate for a number of reasons.
Because of the demonstrated relevance of the BAC objectives, the prospects of a
significant change in policy direction in the sector are judged to be limited. Although
certain political and interest groups delayed and attempted to weaken the BAC reforms,
this opposition was generally not based on differing policy views, but rather, bureaucratic
inertia. The increasing prominence of private sector-related issues, such as investment,
employment creation, growth, competitiveness and exports, as well as potential EU
candidacy, will ensure that the policy orientation remains on course as adopted in the
BAC. At the same time, the fractious nature of ruling coalitions and limited capacity will
make it necessary for external partners to continue to advise and support the government
in the reform process and to maintain policy dialogue to avoid short-term opportunistic
policy reversals.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

The BAC had been designed at a time when the post-war left-of-center government came
to power in BH and in both Entities. There was considerable pressure to take ambitious
action for results and the design team likely yielded to optimism and sought to
accommodate both the governments' needs and newly found enthusiasm, as well as to
make the project conform to the expectations of Management and the Board. With
reliance on its previous experience and available analytical work, the Bank correctly
identified the needs and main policy areas for intervention. The policy matrix
demonstrates that previous reforms and earlier client commitment were taken into
account in BAC's design. The main risks were correctly identified both in the CAS and
the Credit, but they were judged manageable so the operation was allowed to proceed.



transparent process. The regulations typically pass three levels of review ­ by ministries themselves, by
stakeholders and by the central unit, which makes the final recommendations. At each level, unnecessary,
outdated, complex, and illegal rules are identified. In the guillotine process, the burden of proof is on the
regulator to defend why the regulation should be kept.
                                                      18

The four-year delay in implementation clearly demonstrates, however, that the designers
of the project were overly enthusiastic in the face of likely prospects of changing
governments and limited client capacity. Nine conditions per Entity, involving almost all
entity ministries and a number of other agencies, including parliaments and even courts,
were recognizably a heavy task for relatively inexperienced governments in a young post-
conflict nation, particularly when it is recalled that the start of BAC was delayed by one
year. From this vantage point it appears likely that the boldness in the project design was
encouraged by broader political imperatives of the international community in BH at the
time, and internal Bank pressures to conform to expected standards for implementation of
policy operations.

In such a context, the BAC was designed well, but with considerable responsibility left to
the implementation/supervision stage. The counterfactual question is whether the
operation would have been permitted to proceed if the implementation period had been
estimated from the outset as being much longer than typical policy (now DPL) operations.
In this context, and given the resultant (albeit delayed) success of the program, the Bank
should consider such flexibility, particularly given the new emphasis on the
"development" aspect of DPLs.

(b) Quality of Supervision

    Rating: Highly Satisfactory (HS)

The Bosnia PSD team consistently followed the BAC reforms progress and pushed for
faster implementation, in contacts with ministries, parliament members and other
international organizations. Particularly in the early stages, the Bank team was
overextended while seeking to ensure that work in all policy areas continued, but these
difficulties were alleviated through good cooperation with Entity BAC coordinators and
selected other reform champions as well as collaborative dialogue with other donors.
Although delays often proved unavoidable, the supervision efforts regularly identified
obstacles and found solutions to keep the process moving, including the somewhat
innovative but non-replicable use of short closing date extensions to exert pressures for
meeting reform deadlines in particular areas.

After the 2004 elections, it was necessary to rebuild the support among the new
nationalist governments for each policy area separately, in a more fractious political and
parliamentary environment. Owing to the generally recognized necessity to improve the
business environment, and ensure well-established links with senior staff at the relevant
ministries and agencies, the Bank team and the Country Office (CO) succeeded in
maintaining the momentum for the remaining conditions. In many cases throughout the
implementation of the project, the Bank interventions greatly assisted, and sometimes
even enabled reform champions to continue and complete the required actions.

In September 2006, a QAG panel assessed overall supervision of BAC as Highly
Satisfactory, mainly because of timely identification of problems as they surfaced and a
proactive problem solving approach adopted in the operation. In view of the complex set
of obstacles encountered during supervision, the Highly Satisfactory ranking is warranted
in retrospectively assessing the Bank's supervision performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

    Rating: Satisfactory

On the basis of the above discussion, the overall Bank performance in the politically
complex and unstable environment was satisfactory. The government counterparts
expressed compliments and even positive surprise at the ultimate achievements of BAC
after grueling and protracted efforts at implementation efforts. The Bank itself also
ensured proper transitions and transfer of knowledge between staff involved in the
supervision of this nearly 6-year long program including the beginning phases.

5.2 Borrower Performance

a) Government Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

Granted that there were two general elections and two changes of governments during the
BAC's lifetime, the commitment of Entity governments to BAC's goals was insufficient
and uneven. While the governments typically did not refuse to implement necessary legal
changes, in some cases the laws took a very long time for adoption in the parliaments,
which generally can be attributed to the near-inevitability of broad and weak coalitions
both at State BH, and at the Entity level. And with regard to institutional changes and
capacity building, such actions very often happened at a `glacial' pace, admittedly, not
atypical in Bosnia, with respect to institutional changes.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Since the BAC was a multi-component policy operation, there was no central
implementing agency. Coordination at entity and inter-entity levels was achieved through
periodic meetings of representatives of all stakeholder institutions convened by
government-appointed coordinators

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

6. Lessons Learned

(a) The use of methods for assessing measurable results of policy and project reforms
    should be made best practice (including the use of surveys or other means of
    assessing outcomes and outputs). This aspect of the BAC permitted the benchmarking
    of standards to track tangible achievements as well as quantifiable cost savings, and
    which could continually be tracked over periods of time.
(b) Collectively, Bank staff and management should be realistic and conservative in
    project design when the overall political environment is unstable and coalitions are
    weak and easily divided. Management should be candidly informed of special
    considerations to take account of, and permit design flexibility even if at variance
    with conventional implementation expectations and norms.
(c) The Bank's operational policies should be flexible and permit the use of DPLs of
    longer time and duration, when justified, to adjust to local conditions and allow
    sufficient implementation time to build up institutional capacity and sustainability.

                                              20

    This can be more effective than one-off reforms made in short periods, but which at
    times do not catch on in the long run.
(d) Reform programs and projects should identify champion individuals and institutions,
    but also continue to seek/develop them during the course of the project (HJPC
    emerged instrumental in completing the business registration reform towards the end
    of the project even though they were not an initial primary defined stakeholder).
(e) The Bank should continue to have a unifying role, both with domestic counterparts
    and international donors. This should include provisions for parallel training and
    implementation of technology equipment if the Bank has no corresponding
    supporting technical assistance project.
(f) Although the coordination of reforms in the business environment sector was
    reasonably efficient, the density of the reform efforts in other areas, such as public
    service or judiciary, put added strain on limited government capacity and resources,
    in some cases pulling them in different directions. One example is the creation of the
    pledge registry which was not adequately coordinated with a massive parallel
   judiciary reform, causing divergence of efforts and conflicting directions of
   legislative and institutional development between different reform projects. The
   government ultimately needs stronger capacity to develop and implement a
   coordinated agenda with full local ownership, and the fastest way to achieve this will
   be through further development of the mechanisms for strategic planning and
   strengthening the institutions such as the Department for Economic Planning.
(g) Under complex reform programs, the Bank should envisage a stronger and longer
    `tailing-off' period of support and monitoring to avoid leaving new institutions on
    their own just when they are most vulnerable This might be done even in the form of
    a separate, conditional technical assistance component which is `turned on' only
    when a reform is deemed complete.

Please find attached our comment on the Implementation Completion Report of the
Business Environment Adjustment Credit (BAC), IDA Credit 36450 and SIDA Grant
52216 (submitted by the World Bank)

As the above mentioned project was implemented under the responsibility of the Entity
governments, the entity governments were in position to provide comments on the above.

In their letter, the Federation Ministry of Finance concluded that satisfactory results were
achieved in implementation of all segments of the BAC Project, with a special emphasis
of gratitude to the World Bank for assistance in the implementation of the project, and
with hope that other cooperation in the field of the business environment, will take place
in the 2007-2010 period.

The Ministry of Economic Relations and Coordination of Republika Srpska did not
provide their comments on the submitted report as of May 26, 2008.

On this occasion, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury expresses its gratitude to the
World Bank for assistance extended in implementation and successful completion of the
BAC Project.

                   Comment on implementation of the BAC Credit


        We are pleased to conclude that satisfactory results were achieved in all segments
of the BAC Project despite the implementation delay of four years.

        The experience and results achieved in the implementation of the BAC Project
were valuable for all levels of government in BiH and for experts who implemented the
project. The acquired experience was successfully used in implementation of tasks related
to preparation and signing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement of BiH with
the European Union.

        With gratitude to the World Bank for assistance successfully implemented
through the BAC Project, we want to implement even closer cooperation in the field of
business environment in accordance with the goals from the Strategy of the FBiH
Government for 2007-2010.

Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

SIDA:

SIDA appreciates WB sharing the BAC implementation report. We are pleased to see the
effort made in measuring the impact of improvements in the inspection process,
particularly inspection of businesses.

The progress is also visible from various media reports on how inspection system is more
efficient and is contributing to more discipline.

While we realize that it is sometimes difficult in negotiation with the governments in
Bosnia to decide what to do next, it would be good for the donors to at least have a
general updated framework from the WB on most important reforms that need to be
addressed in the short term. It would also be beneficial to us to know what not to focus
on. Basically some coordination on the economic sectors would be appreciated. As you
may know Sida together with DFID and Holland is planning the ESRF project
(presentation attached below) and we expect the Secretariat to be open for business by
August.

DFID:

It was a pleasure to read a completion report on BAC, which was extended for almost
four years. I have commented only on the parts related to business registration reform.

Major risks. I suggest adding couple of sentences related to difficulty in coordination as a
result of the ongoing extensions requests, with multiple donors leading on specific
projects, as a result of the overoptimistic timeline planned for BAC
implementation.

We have previously discussed the methodology and relevant impact of the surveys
conducted.

Brcko District should be included in the report as well.

The registration courts have successfully integrated (through the legislation and the IT
system) with the database on fines.

Annex 7. Additional Diagnostics and Reforms BH's Initial Business Environment

Initial Diagnosis. The lack of effective laws, regulations and mechanisms for securing
and enforcing collateral in BH before the start of the program, was found to severely
restrict access to working capital from banks. The courts were weak, deficient and, in
many instances, subject to political discretion and corruption causing long delays in the
resolution of commercial disputes. The 14-step business registration process was
overloaded with unnecessary but mandatory approvals resulting in a process that took
months to complete, yet another reason for the perpetuation of the grey economy. Even
post-registration, businesses faced a multitude of inspections from numerous
inspectorates with unclear and often overlapping mandates, leading to excessive
administrative costs for compliance.

The prospect for entering a phase of self-sustained growth at the start of the BAC was
contingent on the successful and accelerated implementation of economic and
institutional reforms. With donor support, the Government was undertaking significant
efforts, including: accelerating privatization, strengthening the banking sector, reducing
a burdensome tax regime to motivate companies to return from the informal to the formal
sector, liberalizing trade, modernizing customs administration and strengthening
competition policy, improving property rights and access to land, reducing corruption,
increasing the independence and capacity of the judiciary. Many other basic political and
economic institutions required for the country's effective functioning had been created at
the time leading to the inception of BAC, including the BH Central Bank, State and
Entity treasuries and the national currency. Significant progress was achieved in
removing barriers to the movements of goods and people within the country, and a
common, countrywide customs tariff regime and trade policy were introduced.

Public finance system reform had also continued, with both Entities making significant
progress in reforming and harmonizing tax policies, establishing intra-Entity revenue and
expenditure mechanisms, and in introducing external audit functions. In public finance,
key accomplishments included successful harmonization of indirect taxation, culminating
in the establishment of the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) in 2004 and the introduction of a
state-wide single-rate VAT in 2006. Modernized and harmonized corporate income tax
(CIT) and personal income tax (PIT) laws were enacted later in 2006 in the RS and in late
2007 in the Federation, setting the respective CIT rate at 10 percent and the PIT rates at
10 percent and 15 percent. However, the National Fiscal Council, formally established in
2005 and intended to coordinate the country's fiscal policy, is not yet functioning.

A New Public Procurement Law (PPL) was published in the BH Official Gazette on
November 11, 2004 and amended since. The Law is harmonized with the EU directives,
and among other things, provides for establishment of the Public Procurement Agency
(PPA) as an independent administrative organization, reporting to the Council of
Ministers of BH. The PPA's functions include: overall monitoring of the implementation
of the PPL, developing public procurement manuals and guidelines, publishing standard
tender documents and standard forms, proposing amendments to the PPL and its
implementing regulations; providing technical assistance and advice both to contracting
authorities and suppliers, publishing, collecting and analyzing information on
procurement procedures and awarded public contracts, publishing training information
and manuals, submitting annual report to Council of Ministers of BH. In FBiH in

particular, progress on privatization and corporate restructuring in general also remained
slow and uneven.

Annex 8. List of BAC's Second Tranche Conditions as Met

(1) FIPA representative offices staffed and operating in both Entities.
(2) Pilot of the business registry system embodying common procedures, common forms,
    and single database tested in selected courts across both Entities, and a plan for full
    implementation adopted.
(3) The Entities reduced the average number of days to register a business from 80 to 30
    days or less in the Federation (FBiH) and from 31 to 23 days or less in the Republika
    Srpska (RS), as measured by independent surveys on a semi-annual basis.
(4) The Entities reduced the number of steps required to register an enterprise to seven or
    less.
(5) A pilot of the collateral registry system embodying common procedures, common
    forms, single database and trained participants (judges, clerks, banks) was tested in
    selected courts across both Entities, and a plan for full implementation, was has been
    adopted.
(6) The Entities established a business inspection system, satisfactory to the Association,
    that provided for: the review and rationalization of the mandates of inspectorates
    operating at Entity and sub-Entity levels; clarification and publication of the
    mandates of the inspectorates and the inspectors; rational, planned inspection
    schedules, standard forms and guidelines; amendments to legislation as necessary to
    implement rationalization of the inspectorates, and regulatory assessment with the
    goal of repealing obsolete or unnecessary regulations.
(7) The average number of aggregate on-site inspector days per inspected business per
    annum for the Market, Labor, Financial Police and Revenue Administration
    combined was reduced from 28 days to 15 days or less in the RS and from 18 days to
    12 days or less in the FBiH.
(8) The Entities adopted amendments to the Laws on Chambers of Commerce, to
    eliminate mandatory membership.
(9) The Entities adopted strengthened and harmonized Laws on Bankruptcy and
    Liquidation.

Annex 9. Project Risk Factors and Strengthened Supervision Effort

Risks. The major risks were identified at the onset of the project, and could not be fully
mitigated. The time allotted for implementation of BAC had been too short and overly
optimistic. Still, within the broader context of Bosnia in 2000-2002, with the first
moderate set of governments in place but 2-year government mandates (mandated by
OHR to promote faster democratic changes, until the 2002 elections) this meant much
shorter horizons for governments' planning. It appears that the design of the BAC, and
particularly its timeline, incorporated both the eager optimism of the moderate
governments in 2000 and their need to show change and success. However, rather
typically for the local conditions, the governments of the time had not fully taken into
account their own lack of capacity.

The support of the bilateral donor agencies was invaluable in the completion of the BAC.
Involvement of DFID on business registration reform, USAID on movable pledges, key
for the support of secured transactions (Pledge Registry Project ­ PRP), and inspections
(SIDA) with a trust fund for the inspections reform, added another level of complexity of
communication and coordination, but cooperation with these co-financing organizations
was close and successful. Support of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) was
crucial, particularly in the preparation and adoption of the business registration,
bankruptcy and pledge registry laws.

QAG supervision review. In September 2006, however, a QAG panel assessed
supervision of BAC as Highly Satisfactory overall. The focus on Development
Effectiveness and Supervision Inputs and Processes were assessed Highly Satisfactory,
while Supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguard Aspects and Candor and Quality of ISR
dimensions were rated Satisfactory. The main reason for the positive rating was the high
quality of supervision with timely identification of problems as they surfaced, and a
proactive problem solving approach adopted in the operation. The field-based,
experienced Task Team Leader (TTL) was closely and actively supported by all levels of
Sector and Country management. The QAG panel identified a lack of client commitment,
and inability to reach consensus between Government entities and stakeholders as
underlying causes of persistent delays in implementation of Second Tranche measures.
This, however, was somewhat predictable given the multiple government jurisdictions to
tackle in the context of the BH political structure and the cross-section of agencies
involved.

Annex 10. Modalities for Supporting the Monitoring System and Measuring
Results

Oversight Bodies. The CoM and Entity Governments adopted a country-wide action
plan to implement recommendations of the FIAS study on the Commercial Legal
Framework and Administrative Barriers to Investment. A working group, comprised of
State and Entity technical experts across relevant ministries, were appointed by Entity
Prime Ministers and the State Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations
(MFTER) to draft the time-bound action plan based on the FIAS study and in
consultation with the private sector, and continue to act as the technical monitoring group
for implementation of reforms. The action plan was the Government's key instrument for
monitoring progress against the business environment reforms.

The high-level cross-Governmental Coordination Board for Economic Transition and
European Integration, set up to provide leadership to the country's economic reform
agenda, had overall responsibility for ensuring progress under the BAC. More specific
responsibility for implementation matters was delegated to MFTER in coordination with
the Entity Prime Ministers. Each Entity and the State had appointed a "champion" in the
Prime Minister's cabinet (in MFTER at the State level) to oversee implementation of the
business environment reforms at the Entity level, and serve as the Association's primary
counterpart for the BAC. The BAC task team worked effectively with each "champion".
Donor financial and technical assistance was made available to State and Entities to
ensure access to local and international experts as needed to move the agenda forward,
and to fund activities of FIAS in supporting the Government's implementation of surveys
and self-assessment tools to monitor progress against results and to help build capacity
for public-private sector dialogue.

Technical Assistance Support. With DFID support, the business registration system had
been installed and tested in all courts and necessary training of court staff was conducted
in the weeks prior to final disbursement. In the summer of 2007 the business registration
system was officially inaugurated and transferred to FBIH and RS authorities for
maintenance and operation. This actually exceeded original conditionality, which
required the governments only to adopt an action plan by this stage, and did not envisage
full implementation of the system. The new system also introduced common procedures
across both Entity governments, thus increasing predictability of the registration process
and providing for a more efficient and level playing field for new firms wishing to
register expeditiously and where applicable participate in public procurement contracts
within time periods allowed.

Results Indicators on Starting a Business. A May 2007 BAC survey found that to
commence operations for FBiH and RS there was an improvement from the baseline data,
but did not yet constitute the fulfillment of that particular condition. As this was the only
remaining outcome to be verified, instead of a full survey, it was decided to use the
business registration system's statistics to evaluate the fulfillment of the condition. Data
from the central electronic register for FBiH confirmed that since the fall 2007 until the
present, major courts in FBiH began to operate the system and in December 2007, court
registrations were completed within an average of 8.5 days, compared to 23.7 days
reported in the May 2007 survey. This data confirmed that the overall time to commence



                                              36

operations was 27 days on average in FBiH,15 which meant that the indicator target
specified under this condition (30 days) had been met.

In the RS, the biggest court, in Banja Luka, representing some 50% of new business
entrants in the RS, used the system and the data from RS central electronic register
showed that, in November 2007 the Banja Luka court, registered new companies on
average in three days, compared to 17 days reported in the May 2007 survey. This
effectively reduced the overall time for court registration in RS by 14 days, bringing the
total for commencing operations, including all other steps required, to 18 days (vs. 23
days as the target value for this condition). Applying the same assumptions as for FBiH
this condition is also met.

Inspection Indicators. Inspection reform in BH managed to reduce burdens to business
based on many factors, not only the introduction of risk-based inspections systems. Risk-
based inspections were only a small component of the reform. Since 2001, World Bank
Group financed several independent surveys16, and the latest was done in May 2007 on
some 250 companies in BH to detect the burden imposed upon them by inspections. The
survey gathered businesses' opinions on market, tax, labor and financial inspections ­
four of the most important and difficult ones. The survey followed the protocol used
twice before since 2001. FIAS provided the methodology, which basically consisted in
calculating the cumulative inspection days per year per business (calculated by
multiplying the number of inspections, days and inspectors). Part of the Barriers study on
the first indicator can be considered the baseline. The second indicator was reported by
the World Bank in 2004. And the third and last was reported by FIAS again (under the
ARCS) in 2005.

Economic Effects of Inspection Reform. In 2006 some 34,000 companies were
registered and active17 and 70,00018 entrepreneurs and sole-traders were reported in BH,
in 2005 some 65 percent of companies (based on ARCS survey) were inspected by three
major inspections, while the BAC survey (done by the World Bank) in 2007 showed that
only 25 percent of companies got inspected by these three inspections annually. This
translates into KM 10.4 million19 in direct savings per annum for BH companies that get
inspected, and does not take into account any savings for sole traders and entrepreneurs.
In addition, there is also the one-off cost saving to the economy overall, due to reduced
frequency of inspections and number of companies inspected, that was estimated at some
KM 15.79 million20. This impact was accentuated due to the risk-based approach to
inspections introduced through the reform, which further reduced the number of
companies inspected.
