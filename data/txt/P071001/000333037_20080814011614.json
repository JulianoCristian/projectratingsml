Project for Bosnia and Herzegovina were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: collectively,\n            Bank staff and management should be realistic and\n            conservative in project design when the overall political\n            environment is unstable and coalitions are weak and easily\n            divided. Management should be candidly informed of special\n            considerations to take account of, and permit design\n            flexibility even if at variance with conventional\n            implementation expectations and norms. The Bank's\n            operational policies should be flexible and permit the use\n            of Development Policy Lending (DPL) of longer time and\n            duration, when justified, to adjust to local conditions and\n            allow sufficient implementation time to build up\n            institutional capacity and sustainability. This can be more\n            effective than one-off reforms made in short periods, but\n            which at times do not catch on in the long run. The Bank\n            should continue to have a unifying role, both with domestic\n            counterparts and international donors. This should include\n            provisions for parallel training and implementation of\n            technology equipment if the Bank has no corresponding\n            supporting technical assistance project."}, "docdt": "2008-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
