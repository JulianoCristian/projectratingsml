outcome was moderately unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was significant, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in high risk\n            environments (post crisis, fragmented governance, etc.) an\n            early wins strategy may be required, but should be\n            accompanied by flexibility, early and structured review, and\n            an exit strategy in the event that reforms come off track.\n            Formulation of laws in adjustment operations needs to be\n            accompanied by careful attention to addressing\n            implementation constraints, particularly in post-crisis or\n            transition environments, where capacity is particularly weak\n            and the institutional framework is fragmented. Operations\n            that require intensive on-the-ground capacity building are\n            not suitable for pure adjustment-type lending because the\n            adjustment timetable is usually inconsistent with the\n            capacity building timetable. In situations with multiple\n            development partners and significant capacity constraints,\n            effective leadership and coordination, both in government\n            and development partners, is essential."}, "docdt": "2014-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
