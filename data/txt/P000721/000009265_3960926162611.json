In addition, it\n            supports redressing quality and equity shortcomings of the\n            education system; and improving the management and\n            administration of the system.  Consistent with the PDRE\n            strategy, the proposed project will improve middle and\n            higher level manpower training in agriculture, forestry,\n            engineering, accounting and teacher training; and improve\n            the quality of general education through provision of\n            improved instructional practices and educational materials\n            to secondary schools.  Finally, it will improve equity by\n            providing basic education facilities to particularly needy\n            locations; and strengthen planning and managerial\n            capabilities of the system."}, "docdt": "1987-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
