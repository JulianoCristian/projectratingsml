F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (PDO) - from Project Appraisal Document
“To improve the efficiency and transparency of government and selected public services in Madagascar
in line with the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP)”.
Revised Project Development Objectives - as approved by original approving authority
“To strengthen the Recipient’s public financial management and social accountability at the central
government and at the Municipal levels”.
The Results Framework presented in the data sheet below combines indicators and expected results agreed
during the project appraisal and the project restructuring in August 2012. At restructuring the four original
PDO indicators were replaced by four new PDO indicators. Concerning the intermediate outcome
indicators, 15 of the original indicators were dropped, two indicators were revised and 11 new indicators
were added.
Proportion of expenditures paid prior to and after the restructuring:
• 43 percent prior to the restructuring
• 57 percent after the restructuring

                      November 15, 2014, the report was not published.

                      15, 2014, the draft report was not issued.


                The formulation of the indicator is not explicit as to whether only national PEFA reports,
                or both national and sub-national PEFA reports, would be considered in achieving the
                target. However, the achievement rate was not affected as none of the sub-national PEFA

achievement)    of the indicator were not sufficiently clear. The reported value consequently included
                procurement activities carried out through quotation (a procurement method with limited
                competition).
                In the computation of the values, the contracts below the threshold for competitive
                procurement as well as the contracts at decentralized level were excluded. An
                increasingly common approach is to split contracts to avoid full competitive
                procurement.

                  In 2013, 10.69% of the total value of contracts was undertaken through open competition.
                  The figure was 32% in 2011 and 26% in 2012 showing deterioration with time. In fact,
                  a recent procurement post review has confirmed the practice of splitting contracts to
                  avoid competition.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
   1.1 Context at Appraisal
      Country Context
1.    With the end of the 2002 political crisis and a new President, Madagascar experienced
a period of growth and poverty reduction from 2002 to 2006. The implementation of the
government’s strategy resulted in an average annual growth of five percent and poverty declined
to 67.5% in 2006 from its peak of 80% in 2002. Governance and social indicators also improved.
The President was reelected in December 2006 and subsequently developed a new government
strategy, the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP 2007-12).
2.    The MAP, launched in 2006, was a bold poverty reduction strategy developed under
strong leadership of the president and underpinned by broad stakeholder consultations.
Organized around eight commitments, the MAP was an ambitious development strategy, targeting
the reduction of the poverty level to 50% between 2007 and 2012, supported by the promotion of
strong growth, high levels of investments, improved governance, and significant improvements in
social and economic indicators. The MAP adopted a leadership-centered approach to development
to achieve its ambitious targets, but also emphasized the need to strengthen institutional capacity.
National and regional stakeholder consultations were also organized.
3.    In March 2009, an unconstitutional change of government led to a protracted crisis.
The change in power led to sanctions by the international community. Crisis mediation was
undertaken by international institutions and, after several unsuccessful attempts, a roadmap to exit
the crisis was agreed upon in May 2011. After several postponements, which added to the
uncertainty, elections were finally held in December 2013. The newly elected President took office
in January 2014 and appointed a new government in March 2014. From the onset of the crisis until
the election of the new President, the country was under the World Bank OP/BP 7.30. Over this
period of time, the government de-facto abandoned the MAP as a strategy to orient its policies.
       Sector Context
4.    Between 2002 and 2007, governance gains were fragile, although some improvements
were made. In 2007, the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) had an overall score
of 3.7, with the quality of public administration, accountability and transparency in the public
sector rated 3.5. The index of perception of corruption of Transparency International improved
from 2.6 in 2003 to 3.2 in 2007. However, these improvements were considered as insufficient and
governance challenges were deemed substantial and included: i) low transparency of government
operations; ii) weak public expenditure management; low state revenues; iii) under-performing
public administration; iv) poorly functioning, difficult to access, and costly legal and judicial
system; (v) insufficient (decentralized) service delivery; vi) low level of executive and social
accountability; and vii) institutions and ministries with insufficient capacity to design, implement,
coordinate, monitor and evaluate policies and reforms.
5.     The reform process launched in 2002 had created some reform momentum but efforts
were sometimes undermined by vested interests. The reform process launched with the
preparation of the MAP built some reform space, including through stakeholder consultations,
leadership and building capacity. Furthermore, there was popular demand for more accountability
as “it (the population) supports institutional reforms that ensure government accountability and
that extend political and civic space for personal freedoms.” (See Project appraisal document –


                                                 1
PAD, The World Bank, (a-iv), May 2008, page 3). However, high levels of rents, especially in the
area of natural resources, limited political competition, and close ties between the political and
economic elite limited the feasibility of reforms. Furthermore, government institutions remained
subservient to their leaders and rule of law was limited and personalized. Madagascar’s civil
society was described as nascent, at best, and accountability mechanisms remained weak. There
were also concerns that concentrating power in the presidential administration had led to
weakening of line Ministries, and that rebalancing the power between the Office of the President
and the Ministries was a priority.
6.     Addressing the governance challenges was considered necessary for a successful MAP
implementation. Thus, the MAP had governance - including Public Financial Management
(PFM), judicial reforms, anti-corruption, decentralization and the provisions of public service - as
the first of its eight commitments. Social accountability was part of the eight commitment of the
MAP.
7.    All governance indicators deteriorated during the crisis. In retrospect, it can be observed
that while some indicators, such as on perception of corruption, improved, governance indicators
overall stagnated between 2003 and 2007 and started to decline afterwards. Hence the World-Wide
Governance Indicator average stood at the 46-47th percentile between 2003 and 2007 before
dropping to the 38th percentile in 2008. Following the 2009 change in power, the indicator further
slipped to the 30th percentile in 2009 and the 24th percentile in 2012.
8.    Previously identified governance challenges, seen as a cause of the latest political crisis,
have further aggravated during the transition. The political economy dynamics and poor
governance are identified as underlying causes of the political crisis that started in 2009 (cf. The
World Bank (a.iii), July 2007 and The World Bank (a.ix), December 2010). During the transition,
mechanisms to ensure accountability, such as oversight institutions were further weakened.
Corruption, illegal logging and other traffics increased and the judicial system worsened.
Transparency and participation remained low. Service delivery including at the decentralized level
significantly deteriorated. In general, PFM did not decline sharply, as the system in place before
the crisis continued to operate. Yet, by 2010, it was considered that without reforms and
investments including in the IFMIS, it was likely that PFM would rapidly deteriorate.
9.     The reform space was very limited and volatile during the transition. With no elected
Parliament and no international recognition, the transition government, despite its expressed
commitment to improve governance, had no mandate to lead deep, long lasting reforms.
Furthermore, support for reforms was difficult to gather from an elite that was at the center of the
crisis, enjoying very high levels of unchecked rents. Nevertheless, during the crisis, the space for
dialogue on transparency, accountability and participation was enhanced in the absence of a strong
power structure. At the municipal level, most elected mayors stayed in power although some of
them were replaced by non-elected officials. This, combined with the need to improve service
delivery, created some space for decentralization reforms. Still, there was an ambivalent
commitment to decentralization. At the policy level, the transition government expressed
commitment to decentralization, but budgetary transfers to municipalities did not match these
commitments. In the area of PFM, by 2010, the transition authorities expressed some commitment
to reforms to avoid a further decline in the system. However, this commitment was also ambivalent
as exemplified by the absence of an updated PFM strategy/action plan and an IFMIS blueprint.

       Rationale for Bank involvement
10. The Country Assistance Strategy 2007-2011 (CAS) emphasized the importance of
responsible governance and accountability. Endorsed by the Board in April 2007, it was
designed to help achieve the MAP objectives and took into account the lessons learned from the
implementation of the previous CAS. It was organized around two main pillars: i) remove key
bottlenecks to investment and growth in rural and urban areas; and ii) improving access to, and
quality of, services. Improving governance and accountability was seen as key to create an
enabling environment for growth and investment, as well as to improve services to the people.
Furthermore, it stressed the need to improve the monitoring & evaluation (M&E) system of the
Government.
11. The Bank had a longstanding record of supporting governance reforms in Madagascar
and was seen as an important partner by the Government. The World Bank provided support
to governance and institutional reforms through various instruments, including the PRSC series
(2004 to 2008) and the first Governance and Institutional Development Project (PGDI-I)
(P074448) approved by the Board in October 2003 and closed in June 2009. Through the PGDI-I,
the Bank adopted the approach of a close collaboration with the government. The project was
designed to accommodate the priorities of the Government. Furthermore, the Bank produced
extensive analytical work in the area of governance including PFM, public expenditure, local
development/decentralization, leadership, political economy, statistics and investment climate
which was used to inform policy dialogue and the PGDI-II preparation.
12. Following the experience with the first PGDI, the Government requested the Bank’s
support for a second governance and institutional development project. At the time of
appraisal, the PGDI-I was still being implemented. According to the PGDI-II PAD (The World
Bank (a.xvi), page 7) the PGDI-I was rated “satisfactory” both with regard to implementation
progress and to achieving the development objectives. Furthermore, the “2007 QEA review of the
additional financing for the project emphasized that strong political backing and government
ownership of the reform process, combined with Bank responsiveness, was the strongest
contextual aspect of the additional financing and the project itself” (PAD page 7). The
achievements of the PGDI-I were also presented in detail (PGDI-II PAD page 7 and Annex 1).
According to the PGDI-II PAD (page 8), “the new PGDI should enhance and further deepen the
first generation of reforms under the first project; it should also assist the Government to address
some additional cross-cutting issues which are considered critical for the MAP implementation, in
particular the proposed complementary support for decentralization, for the development of a
public sector pay and incentive system and for the population census. The Implementation
Completion Report (ICR), prepared in 2010, rated the project as moderately unsatisfactory. The
ICR lessons were used to inform the restructuring of the PGDI-II.
   1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
13. The original PDO was “to improve the efficiency and transparency of government and
selected public services in Madagascar in line with the MAP”. The PDO indicators were: i)
Number of indicators under the public expenditure and financial accountability assessment (PEFA)
rated ‘B’ and above; ii) percentage increase in tax/GDP ratio; iii) percentage of population satisfied
with the quality of services provided by selected prioritized public institutions (a) land titling
agencies in Antananarivo; b) customs office in Toamasina; and c) lower court in Antananarivo;




                                                  3
and iv) number of corruption cases effectively adjudicated by the judiciary or through
administrative procedures.
   1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
14. The formally revised PDO was “to strengthen the recipient’s public financial management
and social accountability at the central government and at the municipal levels.” Following a level
1 project restructuring in August 2012, two indicators were revised and a set of 15 new
intermediate indicators was introduced (cf. ICR section F and The World Bank (a.xvi), August
2012), to reflect the changes in the project. The revised PDO indicators were: i) Number of selected
(PEFA) indicators in the self-evaluation (see Section F and World Bank 2012); ii) Number of
Ministries publishing quarterly budget execution reports through media or internet; ii) The Local
Governance Index (IGL) average in targeted local governments; iv) Number of Direct Project
Beneficiaries (number of people trained, number of civil society organizations (CSO) and
municipalities benefiting from the grants).
   1.4 Main Beneficiaries
15. The PAD indicated broadly the target beneficiaries. These included: the Presidency, the
Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB), sector Ministries and Departments, the National Statistics
Office (INSTAT), the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), the Land Administration,
the Local Development Fund (FDL), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Decentralization, anti-
corruption institutions (BIANCO, Observatory of Integrity), local organizations and institutions
(CSOs– and municipalities).
16. At restructuring, the Presidency, the Ministry of Justice and BIANCO were no longer direct
beneficiaries. Still, BIANCO continued to be involved in the restructured project on anti-
corruption activities at the local level. The ombudsman was added as direct beneficiary.
   1.5 Original Components (as approved)
17. At approval in 2008, the project was a four year Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) of XDR
24.3 million (US$ 40 million equivalent) with five components plus an additional component to
support overall project coordination, monitoring and evaluation (see Annex 10 for a detailed
presentation of the original project components and PAD).
• Component 1 - Improvement of public expenditure management (IDA US$ 14.0 million)
  - aimed at supporting the reform of the public expenditure management system, and comprising
  four sub-components: (i) improving budget preparation and execution processes (including an
  IFMIS element); (ii) strengthening internal control mechanisms; (iii) institutionalizing public
  procurement reforms; and (iv) increasing performance of revenue agencies.
• Component 2 - Strengthening the efficiency of government operations (IDA US$8.0
  million) - targeted support to change management and institutional development processes in
  the context of the implementation of the MAP. It covered leadership training for senior officials,
  support to the GDLN, and reforms of the public sector pay and incentive system.
• Component 3 - Rule of Law and Fight against Corruption (IDA US$ 2.5 million) – intended
  to assist Government in promoting transparency, accountability and good governance; and in
  particular, by tackling corruption. The focus was on: (i) improving the quality of legal and



                                                 4
  judicial services, (ii) strengthening the regulatory and institutional framework to fight
  corruption, (iii) and strengthening external oversight institutions.
• Component 4 - Transparency and Social Accountability - (IDA US$ 4.0 million) - designed
  to foster increased involvement of civil society in State affairs and to improve “social
  accountability”. Activities included pilot social accountability interventions and support aimed
  at creating an enabling environment for social accountability practices.
• Component 5 - Monitoring and evaluation - (IDA US$ 7.0 million) - supported Government
  efforts to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system that underpinned the MAP. The key
  activities included: (i) strengthening capacity of INSTAT; (ii) modernizing the procedural and
  institutional framework for monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) supporting a partial census.
• Component 6 - Program Coordination - (IDA US$ 2.5 million) - supported the management
  and implementation of the Project. It included assistance to the GoM to effectively manage
  donor and government funds committed to financing public expenditure management reforms.
Part of the loan, (US$2 million), was unallocated in anticipation of contingencies and to respond
flexibly to additional demands emerging during the implementation of the project (see PAD, page
12).
1.6 Revised Components (see annex 10 for a detailed presentation)
18. Following the unconstitutional change in power in March 2009, the Bank applied
Operational Directive OP/BP 7.30 (Dealings with De Facto Governments), suspended
disbursements, and limited its dialogue with the GoM to technical discussions. In May 2011,
following the adoption of a roadmap that was expected to lead to the end of the crisis, the Bank
authorized the resumption of disbursements for all projects approved prior to March 2009.
19. In February 2012, the Board endorsed the FY12-FY13 Interim Strategy Note (ISN),
which was based on the findings in the 2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security
and Development (cf. page 16 of the ISN, The World Bank (a.xv)). As recommended by the ISN
(cf. page 24 of the ISN), it was decided to use the existing portfolio strategically to achieve greater
impact, through restructurings and analytical efforts. This was also expected to raise awareness,
and prepare for reengagement. Emphasis was put on staying engaged, supporting bottom-up state-
society relations, PFM, accountability and improve service delivery. To mitigate the risks of
political interference, the Bank’s approach was to “work at arm’s length” with the GoM. The ISN
paved the way for the project restructuring.
20. At restructuring, in 2012, there was a high level of uncertainty. The MAP and
accompanying sector programs were no longer officially guiding the government policies and
program, and no updated strategy had been developed. Leadership at the political and technical
level was lacking, while priorities in beneficiary institutions were continuously changing. There
were significant uncertainties as to when the political and institutional situation would be
normalized.
21. In June 2012, the Bank and the government agreed on the restructuring principles. The
decision to keep or drop components and activities took into account the political context and what
the project could achieve in that context. In August 2012, the World Bank Board of Directors
approved the project restructuring (Level 1 restructuring).The revised project components were:




                                                  5
• Revised Component 1: Improvement of Public Financial Management - (US$ 13.33
  million). Key activities under the original Component 1 were kept but re-focused to allow the
  implementation of priority PFM reforms activities, including increasing performance of
  revenue agencies. New activities to enhance budget transparency were introduced to support
  citizen’s access to budget data and inform debate on public policy.
• Revised Component 2: Improvement of Local Governance - (US$ 8.38 million). Emphasis
  was put on supporting selected cross-cutting reforms, such as decentralization and land
  management reforms, with a view of improving, through an integrated approach, municipal
  taxation, land tenure rights, local government management and social accountability.
• New Component 3: Institutional Strengthening & Knowledge Management - (US$ 4.90
  million). This new component focused on: (i) strengthening the capacity of selected State and
  non-State actors to enhance social accountability, access to information and knowledge sharing;
  and (ii) supporting the GDLN to ensure sustainability of the Network by the end of the project.
• New Component 4: Project Coordination - (US$ 2.26 million). This new component hosted
  activities implemented under the original component 6. The original component ‘Transparency
  and Social Accountability’ was dropped and funds were transferred to the revised components
  2 and 3.
  1.7 Other significant changes
22. Significant changes included: i) a change of the institutional anchoring of the project from
the Presidency to the Prime Minister’s office; ii) the competitive recruitment of the project
coordinator; and iii) the extension of the closing date from August 31, 2012 to August 31, 2014.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
  2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
23. The project incorporated the following lessons learned from other projects including
the experience of the PGDI-I: i) significant capacity building and institutional development
support is necessary to ensure design and institutionalization of key reforms; ii) harmonization of
the reform agenda with other development partners is critical to ensure implementation progress;
iii) government ownership is critical to ensure that reforms are sustainable; iv) capacity building
projects must have clear linkages with policy-based operations and other projects in order to
achieve synergies.
24. The PAD states that the “proposed lending instrument should therefore continue to
support the implementation of the policy agenda outlined by the PRSCs”. However, the PAD
does not clearly establish how the project links with the PRSCs. It does, nonetheless, present the
linkages between the PGDI-II and other Bank funded projects as well as to other donor activities.
25. The project preparation was informed by extensive analytical work including political
economy analysis (see Annex 9 (b) for a list of the supporting documents used in the preparation
for the PGDI-II). The PAD comprehensively presented key country and sector issues in all the
areas covered by the project, including issues related to weak PFM, low revenue levels,
concentration of power in the presidential administration, weak line Ministries, and dysfunctional
mechanisms of accountability, low capacity, resistance to change and poor service delivery.




                                                6
26. The PGDI-II was aligned with the priorities of the MAP and the accompanying sector
programs. The objectives and activities of the PGDI-II reflected the MAP priorities. The MAP
spelled out high-level strategic directions. It had been declined in medium-term sector
programs/action plans though, of variable quality. Certain sector policies including the 2005 land
tenure policy, the 2006 good governance policy and the 2006 national decentralization and de-
concentration program were also in place. Nevertheless, an annual action plan prepared by the
MFB - rather than the medium-term action plan in the MAP sector program or a long term strategy
- guided PFM reform implementation. The preparation of the annual action plan involved few
stakeholders, including the technical levels in the MFB and sector Ministries (see AfdB and MFB,
June 2013). Furthermore, there had been no assessment of the quality of the existing system and
there was no updated blueprint/IFMIS strategy.
27. The PGDI-II institutional set-up was based on that of the PGDI-I but included
important changes. The project continued to be implemented by the Programme des réformes
pour l’efficacité de l’administration (PREA), anchored at the Presidency, with the project
coordination unit responsible for coordination, administrative and fiduciary management and
M&E; and the Oversight Committee (chaired by the General Secretary of the Prime Minister’s
office and included General Secretaries of beneficiary ministries, representatives from other line
beneficiaries including the FDL and CSOs representatives). Changes were also introduced to
improve stakeholder participation in the project implementation, including a reform coordination
unit in the MFB made responsible for the implementation of the PFM component though not for
the fiduciary management of the component.
28. Except for the component on social accountability, the PAD does not mention
stakeholder consultations to promote government ownership of the reforms supported by
the project activities. The PAD indicates that the activities under the component transparency
and social accountability (initial component 4) were developed following a comprehensive
consultation process including a nation-wide social accountability workshop. The PFM component
was based on the Annual Reform Plan of the MFB but the PAD does not specify whether or not
prior consultations were conducted.
29. A Quality at Entry Review (QER) highlighted the following concerns: the broad scope
of the project; the need to better justify certain components and reduce the complexity of the
project; the need to improve linkages between the components; and the need to be more specific
about activities and risk management of the transparency and social accountability component,
including establishing an independent management mechanism for the proposed social
accountability grants.
  2.2. Implementation
30. The project has had a difficult implementation history. The project’s implementation
period had originally been estimated at four years but finally took six years, including a 2-year
suspension period (March 2009 to May 2011) when all Bank projects were suspended due to
unconstitutional change of government. The implementation of the project had four different
phases, as outlined below (see also Annex 11 for an overview of the implementation history):
• First phase (June 2008 – Mars 2009) began with the project approval and ended with the
  unconstitutional change of power. This phase was an intensive period of project
  implementation and rapid disbursement after the project became effective in October 2008
  (US$5 million spent during the five months following the effectiveness. This came in addition


                                                7
  to reimbursement of expenditures pre-financed by the government). Project implementation
  dialogue was sustained, the leadership of the Presidency was strong and all parties were
  committed to the implementation of the project. The departure of the President in 2009,
  contributed de facto in weakening the leadership of the reforms supported by the PGDI-II.
• Second phase (March 2009 – August 2012) started with the unconstitutional change of
  Government and ended with the project restructuring. The change of power in March 2009
  resulted in the application of the directive OP/BP 7.30 (dealing with de facto government), the
  suspension of all disbursements to the project account and the restriction of dialogue with GoM
  to technical discussions. The crisis significantly restricted reform implementation. The
  suspension of disbursements reduced the project’s ability to implement activities (although US$
  8.9 million representing 22% of the total credit had been released in the project designated
  account at project effectiveness, 64% of this amount had already been spent prior to the
  suspension of disbursements on March 17, 2009.). In May 2011, the Bank resumed
  disbursements. However, no new activities took place because the focus was on the
  restructuring, including negotiations on the proposed components/activities and the revision of
  the institutional anchoring. In August 2012, the project was restructured to better reflect the
  country and sector context and to align it with the ISN.
• Third phase (August 2012 – December 2013), marked by the difficulties in implementing
  the project activities and getting the project back on track. The third phase started with a
  long delay to fully re-staff the project coordination unit. The protracted crisis also resulted in
  little space for reforms, changes in priorities, and resistance to change from the project
  stakeholders. Consequently, the implementation of the activities agreed upon at project
  restructuring became so challenging that the Bank and the GoM agreed to reprogram the
  activities. In late 2013, following extensive stakeholder consultations, the Oversight Committee
  approved a new set of activities, but this came only nine months before project completion.
• Fourth phase (January 2014 to August 2014) was an intensive period of project execution
  with the view of achieving the project objectives as measured by the PDO indicators. It
  was a significant challenge to implement the considerable volume of complex activities within
  a nine-month period and in a difficult political context. Delays in procurement procedures
  amplified the challenge. The mid-term review (MTR) carried out in February 2014 highlighted
  that the difficult context and the delay in implementing activities could undermine project
  performance. It noted that the rushed implementation due to insufficient time to implement key
  activities could result in the lack of ownership, and reduced appropriation of the process by the
  beneficiaries.
The factors that affected the project implementation and performance were the following:
(i) The political turmoil greatly affected the project. The political turmoil began in March 2009
    and ended in March 2014, representing five of the six years of project implementation. This
    resulted in a very limited and volatile reform space which significantly affected the project
    implementation. The recurring uncertainty on when elections would take place also had an
    adverse impact on project design (at restructuring) and implementation.
(ii) Time constraints. A new work plan resulting from the reprogramming of activities following
     the project restructuring was approved, barely nine months before the project closing. Hence,
     the implementation of many key activities was rushed, leading to poor quality and lack of
     sustainability of some interventions including the following:


                                                 8
   •   Institutional and system reforms in PFM such as: the integration of the public financial
       management system and the organizational reform of the customs administration were not
       achieved.
   •   Over 500,000 land parcels were recorded for local taxation (target of 8,000) but very little
       or no secured ownership rights registered were issued. In addition, and due to the lack of
       dialogue between the key players many Local Land Occupation Plans (known under the
       acronym PLOFs: Plan Local d’Occupation Fonciere) were of poor quality.
   •   Many municipality officials were trained to mitigate corruption risks in compliance with
       the independent Anti-Corruption Bureau standards. However accompanying material,
       equipment and tools required to communicate on corruption were not delivered to the
       municipalities prior to the closing of the project.
   •   Some sub-projects that had been submitted by the municipalities after having gone through
       a participatory approach were rejected for not meeting the selection criteria because the
       required training prior to the submission of sub-projects had not been provided.
   •   Roles and responsibilities between service providers funded by the project, municipalities
       and technical Ministries, and agencies, were not clearly defined. As a result, the
       municipalities, technical Ministries and agencies were not sufficiently involved in the
       process to ensure appropriation, ownership and sustainability.
   •   A knowledge management website was set up and managed directly by the PCU.
       Following project closing, arrangements for the management and maintenance of the
       website were not defined. Consequently, while the platform currently exists, it is not
       updated anymore.
(iii)Insufficient commitment to reforms in the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB):
     Through the first component, the MFB was the largest beneficiary of the project in terms of
     financial volume. Most of the original allocation to the MFB was preserved during the project
     restructuring despite the cancellation of 21% of the credit. However, this component had the
     poorest performance with respect to achieving results. During post-restructuring project
     implementation, the MFB showed limited interest and even resistance to engage in an open
     dialogue on several important areas such as PEFA and IFMIS. Regarding the IFMIS, the
     MFB’s focus was more on technical solutions and investments in hardware, rather than on
     required policy and behavioral changes. The reform process was also hampered by the absence
     of both an initial PFM reform plan, and an IFMIS master plan. A supervision mission in
     October 2010 stressed the absence of technical dialogue with the MFB, which made it
     impossible to evaluate the achievement of the component outcomes. Furthermore, the PFM
     reform coordination committee never met during the course of project implementation, which
     seriously hampered the dialogue among PFM reform stakeholders.
   (iv)     Change in the Bank approach of overseeing the client requests submitted for no
   objection: The Bank’s management of the project changed with the application of OP/BP 7.30.
   Under the PGDI-I as well as the first phase of the PGDI-II, focus was on the achievement of
   project objectives and much flexibility was given to the client on the transactions. In the OP/BP
   7.30 context, and given some procurement issues mentioned in several mission aide-memoires,
   the Bank increased its level of scrutiny. Many beneficiaries reported that this change in the



                                                9
   Bank’s approach affected the relations with the client, and undermined the implementation of
   the project activities.
2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Original project
31. Initially, the PGDI-II was intended to enhance and use the national Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) system for its own M&E arrangements. At project approval, the GoM M&E
system of the MAP was not operational. The project was to support its operationalization and
improvement while using it as its M&E system. However, due to the crisis, this did not materialize
and the M&E system remained ineffective to track project results. The PAD had also stressed the
complexity and challenges related to the coordination and M&E of reforms due to the lack of
clarity of the role of the Presidency, the Prime Minister’s Office, and the sector ministries. In the
absence of clarity of role among key players, it would be difficult to gather inputs and relevant
information to monitor the project.
32. The results framework in the original PAD articulated connections between intermediate
outcome and PDO indicators. All the indicators were clearly formulated and had ambitious time
bound targets. However, some of the intermediate outcome and PDO indicators were the same
(PDO indicator 1 and intermediate outcome indicator 1.1 and 1,2) and two outcome indicators
lacked baseline data.
Restructured project
33. Following the restructuring, a project specific M&E system was developed but was not
fully used to generate timely and reliable information as well as to inform decisions. The
February 2014 midterm review established that partners and entities in charge of collecting data
did not provide their inputs in a timely manner, which led to delays on M&E reports and updates.
The M&E system was used for the monitoring of the implementation of the project and was
focused on data collection. There were issues concerning the quality of the data. Evaluations of
the project activities were not undertaken. Consequently, the M&E system was not used to inform
decisions related to the implementation of the project. The implementation support mission carried
out in July 2014 concluded that the M&E performance was unsatisfactory.
34. The revised results framework articulated connections between intermediate outcomes
and PDO indicators. The indicators had ambitious and time bound targets. However, some of the
indicators were output indicators (#4 and #3.1) and others lacked a clear measurement
methodology. Indicator #1.3 did not mention whether the sub-national PEFA should be considered
and indicator #1.5 was not consistent with the PEFA procurement indicator, making it difficult to
collect data and measure performance.
2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Financial Management.
35. The financial management of the project was rated as moderately satisfactory at the
project closing date. Overall, the project had appropriately qualified and experienced personnel
directly contracted by the PCU. The project had adequate financial management arrangements
over the course of the implementation period. The quarterly financial reports and annual audit
reports with clean opinion were submitted to the Bank on a timely basis and recommendations
made subsequent to implementation support missions were appropriately implemented. However,
prior to the project restructuring, the project had failed to properly monitor and communicate on


                                                 10
the impact of the depreciation of XDR, the loan currency, against USD. The loss of resources
resulting from this depreciation was US$ 3.3 million, representing 8 percent of the credit. The
intense project activities during the last months toward project closure posed significant challenges
to the quality of the expenditures. The final audit report due at the end of February 2015 was
submitted on time.
Procurement.
36. Procurement implementation was challenging during the 12 months preceding project
closure. There were intense procurement activities during this period. Many ToRs and technical
specifications of poor quality were submitted to the Bank and needed significant revisions, thereby
delaying project implementation. At project closing, more than 600 requests had been handled
through the Procys Procurement System against an average of 150 per project in Madagascar.
37. Procurement performance was moderately satisfactory (MS) during project
implementation. No complaint was filed during the project implementation. Post procurement
reviews were conducted for the project in 2012 and 2014. The overall risk rating in both cases was
moderate. No major weaknesses in procurement were identified.
Disbursement.
38. The overall disbursement rate at the closing of the PGDI-II was 84.10%. The amount
approved under the original IDA Credit was XDR24.3 million of which XDR5.2 million was
cancelled. The cancellation was related to the National Population and Habitat Census, the main
activity of the M&E component (XDR4.25 million). Part of funds allocated to the initial
Component 3 (US$0.95 million) were also cancelled. The overall disbursement rate as of
December 31st, 2014 was 87.3%
39. The original counterpart fund amounted to US$ 4 million. This contribution was
reviewed at project restructuring. The actual counterpart fund amounted to US$ 50,000. The PCU
tried without success to obtain from the GoM an additional Ar140 million (US$ 56,000 equivalent)
to cover for the project operating costs, up to December 2014.
Environmental management.
Not applicable; the project is environmental category C.
   2.5. Post-completion Operation / Next Phase
40. The proposed next steps aim at building on the achievements of the PGDI-II. The Bank
is preparing a public sector performance program where PFM reforms will be one of the focus
areas. In the National Development Plan, the GoM has expressed its commitment to tackle
governance issues such as fraud and corruption, weak judicial system, control and oversight.
41. The integration of the Financial Management Information System is far from being
completed, as the system is currently composed of 11 non-integrated sub-systems. The 2013
PEFA self-assessment and the in-depth study on PFM completed in 2014 (See: the Government
of Madagascar, Ambre Consortium (a.i), October 2014) have paved the way for the development
of a strategy and an action plan for PFM reforms. The recommendations of these studies provide
for a roadmap for future system integration and PFM at large. Future engagement in the PFM
sector, funded by the Bank and other partners will benefit from the lessons learned under the PGDI-
II and the analytical work completed under the project.



                                                 11
42. PFM engagements have so far focused at the MFB level without including reforms in
line Ministries and on improved service delivery. Reforms have been focused on improving
PFM systems rather than on improving quality and quantity of public goods and services delivered
by the PFM system. The MFB centered approach to PFM reforms can partially be explained by
the initial need to build a functioning core PFM system and partially by the relatively strong
position of the MFB compared to other institutions, which led to a focus on reforms and
accompanying resources oriented towards the MFB rather than weaker line ministries. The original
PAD did plan to support reforms in line ministries but, with the crisis the reforms and the support
did not materialize. The Bank’s decision to “work at arm’s length” with the GoM limited the
possibility for policy dialogue that could have resulted in increased support to line ministries and
reforms promoting improved service delivery. Consequently the MFB-centered approach to PFM
reforms was continued following project restructuring. Going forward, it will be necessary to
ensure that reforms go beyond the MFB and include the line ministries, as they are the main users
of the public funds and providers of public services and goods. Moreover reforms and
accompanying support will have to focus beyond results in the form of improved, and be oriented
to improve quality and quantity in service delivery.
43. Other Bank and development partners’ projects will continue some of the innovative
approaches piloted under the PDGI-II. Given the limited space for reforms at the central level
during the crisis, the project initiated and tested some innovative PFM approaches with local
governments. Some of these approaches such as the Operation for Integrated Municipal Support
(Opération Communale d’Appui Intégré – OCAI) will be pursued by other Bank-financed projects
such as the PIC 2 (Pôle Intégré de Croissance), PURSAPS (Projet d’urgence sur la Securité
Alimentaire et la Protection Sociale), as well as AFD (Agence Francaise de Développement)
funded projects. The analytical work and the reforms undertaken under the PGDI-II have informed
the new land tenure policy.
44. PGDI-II has increased interest in continuing support to CSOs and contributed to
improve access to information. CSOs in Madagascar have contributed to the strengthening of
demand for good governance and will need further support to enhance transparency and
accountability. The GoM’s decision to join the Global Partnership for Social Accountability
(GPSA) in late 2014 is a promising sign of interest for continued support to civil society. The
project also improved access to legal information through the Legis platform and improvement of
data access on the INSTAT website. Access to information and transparency remains nevertheless
limited, and will need to be further strengthened, given its importance for improving the
governance environment.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
45.   The overall rating is based on the findings in the following paragraphs.
   3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Initial PDO
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory (MU)
46. The relevance of initial objectives, design and implementation is moderately
unsatisfactory. The initial objectives were relevant and aligned with the MAP and were also in
line with the FY07-11 CAS for Madagascar. Both strategies stressed the importance of improved


                                                12
governance. Yet, the design of the operation was complex and the objectives were broad in scope,
resulting in a lack of clarity and difficulties to measure results. The design of the operation was
weakened by the vast quantity of activities supported by the project and the number of
beneficiaries. The implementation arrangements were relevant given the country context but could
have been more ambitious in terms of delegating full implementation responsibility of project
components, including fiduciary management, to the relevant line ministries and agencies.
Relevant risks were identified but, rated overall as moderate, were underestimated.
Revised PDO
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory (MU)
47. Relevance of revised objectives, design and implementation is moderately
unsatisfactory. The revised objectives were relevant and in line with the ISN with governance
(PFM, social accountability, land tenure and transparency) as its main pillar, and thus called for
the promotion of transparency, access to information and the strengthening of accountability
mechanisms. The PDO continues to be relevant given Madagascar’s current governance situation.
At restructuring, the results framework involved many time-bound targets, most of them
ambitious. The objectives, despite their revision, remained too ambitious after restructuring given
the difficult country and sector context. The design of the operation was relevant but was weakened
by the vast quantity of activities supported by the project and the number of beneficiaries. The
causal chain between funding, outputs and outcomes lacked clarity. While overall risk was rated
high at restructuring and some relevant risks were identified, several important risks - such as
resistance to change, insufficient commitment to reforms and delays in reform and project
implementation - were not included. The revised implementation arrangements were relevant
given the country context, but still showed weakness, as exemplified by the fact that the PFM
steering committee only met after the end of the project. While the reprogramming exercise
between January 2013 and December 2013 put the project on track by improving the relevance of
project activities and planning, it also resulted in a significantly reduced project implementation
period.
  3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDO)
Initial PDO
Rating: Unsatisfactory (U)
48. The achievement of the initial PDO is unsatisfactory as at the time of the restructuring,
none of the initial PDO results indicators were achieved. The achievement of the PDO was
undermined by several factors discussed above, most notably the unconstitutional change of the
Government in March 2009, the subsequent protracted political turmoil, and the application of the
OP/BP 7.30. Thus, reform implementation stopped and project implementation was significantly
impacted. At restructuring, none of the indicators had been achieved and most were either dropped
or revised. The M&E framework was weak as the PCU did not collect any data to measure the
indicators.
49. The application of OP/BP 7.30 six months after project effectiveness affected
considerably the project’s ability to achieve results. Very few activities were implemented.
Under Component 1 on the reform of public expenditure management, the project carried out a set
of activities, including setting the basis for the roll-out of an integrated public financial



                                                13
management system, but these activities achieved no results. The decentralization process and land
management reforms were initiated, but not achieved prior to the project restructuring.
Revised PDO
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
50. The achievement of the revised PDO has been rated moderately unsatisfactory
although three out of four PDO indicators were achieved. One of the PDO indicators -the
number of project beneficiaries - is more an output indicator than an outcome indicator. Hence,
even if the number of beneficiaries is marginally above the target, the indicator has a limited value
in measuring the achievement of the PDO. The indicator measuring PFM strengthening was not
achieved, as only one instead of three of the targeted indicators increased its rating in the PEFA
self-assessment. This is a significant shortcoming given that improving PFM was a significant
aspect of the PDO. Several key technical activities and analytical work in the area of PFM were
undertaken, which most likely limited the deterioration of the PFM system and established the
basis for future reforms. The indicator measuring transparency was achieved. Technical problems
that were only solved in December 2014 resulted in limiting the publication of new quarterly
budget reports on MFB website. The indicator measuring local governance was achieved.
However, the ICR team was informed by several stakeholders that the improvement in local
governance as measured by the indicator is not likely to be sustainable given that the support
provided by the PGDI-II was insufficient in quantity and duration.
51. At the component level mixed results can be observed (see Annex 12 for an overview of
the achievement of the project objectives by components and Annex 2 for a presentation of the
outputs by components). For the first component on Public Financial Management, none of the
intermediate indicator results were achieved. The country’s political context, the resistance to
change in the MFB, the absence of a PFM strategy and of an IFMIS blueprint of quality prevented
the component from achieving its objectives. The component, however, contributed to limiting the
deterioration of the PFM system in a context of general governance decline. This was achieved
through investments in the IFMIS hardware, capacity building activities and technical assistance.
The investment in IFMIS hardware was important to limit deterioration of the system as no
investments in IT equipment had been made between 2009 and 2012. The equipment was
consequently aging and the system was experiencing an increasing number of system failures.
52. The second component achieved slightly better results. Out of six results indicators, three
have partially achieved their targets while three others have fully achieved their targets. At the
local level, the implementation of innovative solutions such as the Operation for Integrated
Municipal Support contributed to strengthening the managerial capacity, service delivery capacity
and accountability of local governments. However, the support was limited to a short period (less
than one year) and the process was managed through external contractors with limited
collaboration of the existing government institutions, thus raising concerns regarding the
sustainability of the results after the project closure.
53. The third component achieved many of its intermediate indicator targets. Access to,
and dissemination of, information was strengthened through an improved INSTAT webpage and
the establishment of a legislation platform (Legis). The project also provided grants to CSOs to
promote transparency and participation at the local level. The knowledge platform was developed
but not operational prior to the closing of the project.



                                                 14
   3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
The rating is based on the following factors:
At appraisal
54. Economic and financial analyses carried out during appraisal concluded that the
project would significantly improve economic management in Madagascar through better
allocation and use of resources. The total benefits generated by the activities supported by the
project would reach a net value of US$446 million over 10 years (PAD Annex 9, Table 2).
At restructuring
55. The economic and financial analysis was updated at restructuring. The revised total
benefits generated by the activities supported by the project would reach a net value of
US$420 million over 10 years. This represented a diminution of $US26 million compared with
the benefits that were expected prior the crisis. The diminution of the expected benefits was
explained by the decline in fiscal revenues between 2008 and 2011. Additional project investment
to support the roll-out of the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) was expected to
generate substantial savings in operating cost.
56. A cost-benefit analysis was not undertaken at project closure. The ICR team did not get
the necessary data to undertake a cost-benefit analysis during the preparation of the ICR as this
data was not collected by the PCU.
57. With a moderately unsatisfactory achievement of the PDO and total cost of US$25.20
million, the efficiency of the project has significant shortcomings. The largest component of
the project, component 1, Improvement of Public Financial Management with financing of
US$10.0 million did not achieve its PDO despite numerous outputs, The two other components,
with a total financing of US$ 12.1 million only partially achieved their objectives. Total project
management cost were 38 percent higher than estimated at restructuring and represented 12.4
percent of total cost. The ICR team is therefore of the view that overall value for money was low.
Preparation and supervision cost
58. The project preparation and supervision actual cost increased by 25% compared to
the initial estimate and totaled US$1 million. Given the time needed for preparation, the
extension of the project execution period with 50% (2 years) and the need for significant
supervision efforts including the restructuring, the costs are reasonable.
   3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
59. The overall rating takes into account the project performance before and after
restructuring. Before restructuring, the rating of the project was unsatisfactory. It had disbursed
43% of the funds, yet few results had been achieved. The only exception was the component
Transparency and Accountability which had a moderately satisfactory performance. Following the
restructuring, the overall performance of the project improved to moderately unsatisfactory. The
project achieved three out of four PDO indicators and 7 out of 13 intermediate indicators. Based
on available information, the ICR team considers that two of the achieved PDO indicators had
shortcomings (cf. Para 50). Some intermediary indicators, such as improvement in tax collection
and reducing the rate of single source contracting, were reported achieved but based on available


                                                15
information, the ICR team was not able to confirm this assessment. Finally, time constraints led to
the rushed implementation of many key activities leading to poor quality and lack of sustainability
of some interventions (cf. Para. 30.ii) and, consequently of some of the outcomes.
60. Combining results before and after restructuring weighted according to the disbursement
level (in percentage) results in an overall rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory (see table 1).

   3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Not Applicable.
      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
61. The institutional anchoring of the project had a significant impact on its
implementation. Initially, the project benefited from strong leadership given its anchoring at the
PREA and President’s office. But the centralization of the project implementation, including its
fiduciary management, in a PCU reduced ownership and increased resistance to reforms and
project activities among the intended beneficiaries of the project (including the line ministries). It
also exposed the project implementation to a risk: with the crisis, the legitimacy of the Presidency
to lead and implement reforms was significantly weakened and this significantly reduced the
feasibility of the project to continue its implementation during the crisis. Moving the institutional
anchoring to the Prime Minister’s office, perceived as more neutral and legitimate for project
coordination, during the restructuring was appropriate given the country’s context. However, given
the institutional position of the Prime Minister’s office in Madagascar this also significantly
reduced the leadership of the reforms and the project. Maintaining the PCU, although re-staffed,
and hence maintaining a centralized project implementation, including its fiduciary management,
probably contributed to minimize the fiduciary risk. However, as in the initial design, this reduced
ownership and increased resistance to reforms and the project activities which contributed to limit
the achievements of the expected results. In January 2015, the government issued a decree to move
back the PREA to the Presidency and it is probably a sign of willingness to lead the implementation
of reforms. Based on the experience of the implementation of the PGDI-II, the PREA should be
given a leadership and coordination role. Reforms, to favor ownership, should be implemented by
the relevant line ministries and agencies.




                                                 16
62. Some of the municipalities that benefited from the project have continued to improve
their governance without external support. Certain municipalities supported by the project have
to a certain extent appropriated themselves the tools and methodologies that the project promoted
such as the indicators of local governance. This has allowed them to independently take actions to
improve their governance.
63. In a difficult political context, the project promoted several innovative approaches in
the area of social accountability, local governance and land management. Key achievements
include the use of the PEFA methodology to undertake self-assessments of PFM performance at
both central and local levels, the increased usage of participatory budgeting and the open budget
methodology, the improved access to information, the strengthening of selected CSOs and
municipalities and land management reforms. It is likely that the use of these approaches will be
continued following the closure of the PGDI-II which will contribute to further improve social
accountability, local governance and land management in Madagascar.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
64. The project was valuable for the Bank to maintain dialogue with the Government during the
crisis, even though the dialogue remained limited. Although contacts at ministerial level were not
allowed during much of the crisis, the Bank team maintained relationships with staff at the Ministry
and PREA, particularly following the restructuring. This benefited the Bank and also other
development partners that had little vehicle for dialogue with authorities. This explained the
CMU's reluctance to close the project down despite its poor performance, although one can wonder
if other types of engagement could have been developed to maintain dialogue without anchoring
it in a project.
65. Furthermore, the project contributed to facilitate the Bank’s reengagement following the
crisis and the studies in PFM, local governance and land tenure funded by the project have
contributed favorably to the Bank’s policy dialogue in those areas. They have been important
contributions to shape Government policies after the crisis.
   3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
66. Stakeholder workshops held in the context of the preparation of the ICR emphasized that the
shortened implementation time (most activities were de-facto implemented during the 9 months
prior to project closing) significantly affected the ability of the beneficiaries and implementation
partners to achieve quality results. Complaints were also formulated against the Bank’s
procurement processes. Many of the beneficiaries attributed the delays in project implementation
to the systematic prior review undertaken by the Bank.
67. The project did not meet the expectations of some the beneficiaries. More specifically,
the beneficiaries (directorate and department level) of the PFM component noted that even though
the project contributed to preparing further reforms in PFM, it did not met the expectations since
many of the initially agreed upon activities were not completed.
68. For the second component (Improvement of Local Governance) the stakeholders
welcomed the support provided by the PGDI-II. The stronger focus on local governance
following the restructuring was considered positive according to the stakeholders who also
expressed demand for further engagement at the local level. The adoption of innovative approaches
such as participatory budgeting has been appreciated by local communities. It was noted that the
municipalities are very heterogeneous in terms of size, capacity and commitment to reforms. To


                                                17
be efficient, the stakeholders advocated that the support to the municipalities should be better
tailored to the situation of each municipality. The one size fits all approach (all the municipalities
were provided the same capacity building activities and amount of financial resources) adopted by
the project was therefore deemed to have limited the impact of the project.
69. Insufficient involvement of government agencies limited the sustainability of the
project’s support. The support to CSOs, local governments and to land management reforms was
mainly provided by third party service providers (private firms). Stakeholders reported that
government agencies such as the FDL and the agencies in charge of land management reforms
were not sufficiently involved during the implementation of the activities. This resulted in limited
ownership of the reforms, knowledge transfer and improvement in capacity of the agencies. Hence,
the stakeholders believed it would be difficult for the agencies to pursue activities initiated by the
project following project closure.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
       Rating: High
70. Overall, the risk to development outcome is rated as high, as the following issues could limit
the sustainability of the project and could even lead to a rollback of results:
 (i) Low level of ownership, transfer of knowledge, increase in capacity, institutional and
     policy change: As discussed in previous paragraphs, the project has been implemented with
     a low level of ownership and several activities encountered quality issues and were of
     insufficient scale. This has resulted in a limited transfer of knowledge and capacity building.
     Furthermore, implementation of activities has not been accompanied with necessary policy
     and institutional change.
 (ii) A challenging country context: The country emerges from a five year-long political crisis
      which significantly deteriorated the general governance situation, limited reform
      implementation and weakened the institutions. The country context had a significant adverse
      impact on the project implementation and the achievement of results. While the crisis has
      ended, there is still a high degree of uncertainties and a challenging political situation. The
      post-crisis transition has not yet been fully completed and could be protracted as well as
      experience new periods of instability.
(iii) Uncertainties if the commitment and leadership for reform implementation will be
      sufficiently strong given the complex political economy situation: Governance is one of
      the government priorities highlighted in the National Development Program adopted in 2015.
      GoM’s decision to move the PREA back to the Presidency and changes of the senior
      management of the MFB can be interpreted as signals of the intention of the GoM to
      implement reforms and improve governance. However, the political economy in Madagascar
      is still very complex and strong vested interests remain that will most likely continue to resist
      reforms. As past experience has showed, implementing reforms in Madagascar is very
      challenging and requires the investment of a significant political capital in overcoming vested
      interests and bureaucratic resistance. It remains to be seen if the commitment and leadership
      of the GoM are sufficiently strong to ensure actual reform implementation and improved
      governance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
   5.1 Bank Performance
      (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
Initial project:
71. The design of the project was informed by the lessons learned from the PGDI-I and the
priorities of the government outlined in the MAP. The design of the project was sensitive to the
client demand and underpinned by analytical work, including political economy analyses. The
project was also in line with the CAS and had linkages with other Bank operations in Madagascar.
A Quality at Entry Review was undertaken. The design of the project was however informed by
limited stakeholders’ consultations and this, combined with the absence of sector strategies,
probably resulted in limited ownership. The objective and the scope of the project were broad; the
project had multiple components with limited connections and a complex implementation
mechanism in an environment with limited capacity, weak institutions and a challenging sector
context. The M&E framework was insufficiently developed.
Restructured project:
72. The restructuring was informed by the country context, the ISN and analytical work
(See Annex 9 (b) and (c) for a list of reference documents). However, the design flaws of the
restructured project affected the implementation of the project. For instance, the planned activities
at entry were not realistic given the limited and volatile reform space. Insufficient stakeholder
consultations also constrained ownership of the new activities. Implementation of activities was
consequently delayed and accelerated only after a re-planning exercise was completed at the end
of 2013. This affected the performance of the project and the achievement of its objectives as the
activities had to be carried out within a short time period and with significant bunching towards
the end of the project.
      (b) Quality of Supervision
      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
Initial project:
73. Overall, the initial project was well supervised. Prior to the application of the OP/BP 7.30
in March 2009, Bank provided sound assistance and advice to concerned institutions including
implementing agency and the Presidency as part of the regular project implementation support.
One supervision mission was undertaken during the six month-period from effectiveness to the
triggering of OP/BP 7.30.
74. From March 2009 to August 2012, despite the political context, regular supervisions were
undertaken and supervision documents were produced. However, supervision at beneficiary level
remained limited due to the OP/BP 7.30.
Restructured project
75. The Bank provided supervision and monitoring throughout the implementation of the
project, but there was limited space for policy dialogue, as the Bank adopted an approach to
work at “arm’s length” in line with the 2012 ISN. This approach caused frustration among



                                                 19
beneficiaries at the technical level, due to back-and-forth document exchanges between the PCU,
the beneficiaries and the Bank, which created delays in the implementation of activities. The ICR
team is of the view that the Bank missed two opportunities for restructuring the project. The first
opportunity came following the approval by the authorities of a new program of activities
(following a more than a yearlong reprogramming exercise), only nine months prior to project
closure. A second opportunity for a project restructuring was missed by the Bank following the
mid-term review which highlighted that the delay in project implementation put at risk the
achievements of results and the sustainability of the results.
       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
       Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
76.     In light of the above, Overall Bank Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
   5.2 Borrower Performance
       (a) Government Performance
       Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
77. 1st phase: June 2008 – March 2009: During the first phase of the initial project,
Government showed strong commitment to implement the project. The project was anchored at
the Presidency and was an important element of the realization of the Government program
(Madagascar Action Plan).
78. 2nd phase: March 2009 – August 2012: During this phase Government commitment to the
implementation of the project was very limited. Government was not very proactive during the
restructuring phase. Conflicts between the PCU and beneficiaries slowed down implementation
and restructuring. The Oversight Committee had a very limited role during this phase.
79. 3rd and 4th phases (Restructured project): August 2012-August 2014: During these
phases, Government commitment to achieving results and implementing the project was mixed.
The Project Oversight Committee (POC) and the PREA were engaged and held regular meetings
to discuss project implementation issues. However, focus was more on technical issues and less
on implementing reforms and achieving project results. The POC did not manage to solve the
many conflicts and issues between the PCU and project beneficiaries. While local governments
and institutions involved in the decentralization process showed appetite for the reforms, central
institutions such as the Ministry of Finance and Budget lacked commitment. When the project
encountered implementation delays the GoM showed little proactivity in obtaining a closing date
extension (the MFB even addressed a letter to the Bank stating that it was not interested in
prolonging the closing date). It was only in late July 2014, following a decision in the Council of
Ministry, that a request to extend the closing date was sent to the Bank.
      (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
       Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
Initial project:
80. Following the crisis in March 2009, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) continued to
operate with a reduced team. Procurement and financial management systems were in place but
the management of the project was of insufficient quality. During the crisis the role of the PCU
was unclear. The PCU tried to play a role in determining the strategic directions of reforms and


                                                 20
accompanying project activities. This was contested by several beneficiaries claiming that the PCU
had no legitimate role in this process. The tensions between the PCU and the beneficiaries which
arose from this situation combined with low capacity of both beneficiaries and the PCU, led to
delays in the execution of project activities and in the preparation of the restructuring.
Restructured project:
81. The PCU was pivotal in ensuring the implementation of the project. The last component,
project management, was difficult to rate, as it did not have results indicators. However, the last
ISR indicated that overall performance of the project management was adequate, although it had
been negatively affected by the considerable difference between the commitment and
disbursement rates, as well as delays in procurement. In spite of initial difficulties, the PCU took
the initiative and coordinated the process that led to the reprogramming of the activities. Many
stakeholders informed the ICR team that the role of the PCU was unclear. For example, its role in
determining project activities was challenged by some stakeholders who claimed that reforms and
associated project activities should be determined by the civil servants in charge of the reform,
rather than by the PCU, composed of consultants and consequently not representative of the
administration. Many stakeholders also had the impression that the PCU was part of the Bank,
rather than being the executing agency of the GoM. Lack of clarity in communication between the
PCU and project stakeholders was also reported to the ICR team.
      (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
82. In light of the above reasons, the overall Borrower Performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.
   6. Lessons Learned
83.     Key lessons learned from public sector reform efforts in Madagascar include:
84. Project design - including restructuring - must better reflect prior analytical work,
country and institutional context, existing capacity and the time necessary to implement
reforms. The original design and restructuring of the PGDI-II was informed by extensive
analytical work, including political economy analyses, but the findings of these analyses were not
sufficiently taken into consideration. The project, comprising six components in its original design
and four components following the restructuring, numerous beneficiaries and stakeholders,
unrealistic results targets and timeframe (initially four years and extended with two years at
restructuring) was too complex and ambitious. The design was also overly optimistic with regard
to the actual capacity of stakeholders and the feasibility of rapidly strengthening institutional
capacity. Furthermore, the design seems to have underestimated the level of change in behaviors
necessary to achieve the objectives of the project. Also, as noted in the WDR 2015, biases in
decision making are frequent and need to be better taken into account when designing policy
reforms. With only one formal restructuring over the life of the project, its design was not
sufficiently adapted to the changing country and institutional context. All these factors undermined
project performance. Consequently, given the experience of PGDI-II, when designing and
restructuring a public sector reform project the following aspects should be taken into account: i)
designing simpler and focused projects with fewer beneficiaries and components with results
achievable within the given timeframe; ii) understanding the project context and political economy
and how it evolves over the life time of a project and flexibly adapt the project design and the


                                                    21
results framework accordingly; iii) understanding incentives for government and stakeholder buy-
in, adapt the project design accordingly and ensure adequate provision for change management;
and iv) undertake a comprehensive assessment of actual capacity of stakeholders to avoid over-
optimism and an unrealistic design at entry and at restructuring.
85. Implementation arrangements adapted to the country context over the life of a project
and extensive communication are necessary for a smooth implementation of a project. The
implementation arrangements of the PGDI-II caused numerous challenges. The following aspects
should be considered when designing implementation arrangements: i) clearly define and
communicate extensively to all project stakeholders the role of the Bank, the PCU, the
beneficiaries, the project steering committee and the stakeholders; ii) use government structures
with a leading and legitimate position in the design and implementation of reforms to execute
operations supporting the reform program. If necessary, strengthen the fiduciary capacity of the
structure by embedding a PCU rather than by creating a stand-alone PCU; iii). when executing
complex and multi-sector operations and reforms, anchor the coordination, oversight (including
fiduciary oversight) and M&E of the implementation in a government structure with a leading and
legitimate role in the reforms of all the concerned sectors. Minimize the role of this unit in day-to-
day implementation of activities (including fiduciary management) and reforms by delegating this
responsibility to the concerned line ministries, agencies or institutions and strengthen their
fiduciary capacity as necessary ; iv) ensure the existence of effective communication channels
during project implementation and communicate extensively on the project including its fiduciary
rules and procedures to all stakeholders; and iv) when establishing a stand-alone PCU, weigh the
advantage of reduced fiduciary risk against the risk of reduced ownership and increased resistance
to reforms, detrimental to achieving expected project results. The use of external service providers
in the framework of the PGDI-II implementation was useful to rapidly provide capacity building
in a large scale. However, the quality of some of the service providers was poor. The limited
involvement of government institutions led to resistance from the government agencies and raises
the issue of appropriation and sustainability of reforms following project closing. Consequently,
this approach should only be used in exceptional circumstance.
86. The Bank needs more flexible policies and procedures to adapt project design when the
initial project context is changing drastically and the project design proves to be too complex
and/or ambitious. The Bank and the project team could not foresee the major political crisis that
took place only a few months after the project effectiveness. The subsequent suspension of
disbursements and the application of the OP/BP 7.30 dealing with de facto government
significantly reduced the project’s ability to implement activities. When the situation evolved
positively, the ISN adopted the “work at arm’s length” with the GoM approach to mitigate political
risk. However, this approach also significantly reduced the possibility of the Bank to engage in the
necessary policy dialogue and stakeholder consultations which could have better informed the
restructured project design and which could have allowed for a more effective project supervision.
Ultimately, the Bank needs more flexible instruments and procedures for countries that are or
become fragile.
87. Leadership and commitment are necessary to implement reforms. The lack of leadership
and commitment due to the political crisis was detrimental to achieving the project’s objectives.
As highlighted in the 2012 World Bank PFM reforms in post-conflict countries, without political
commitment at the highest level it is very difficult to move the reform agenda forward.
Furthermore, in a context such as in Madagascar, the leadership of reforms needs to go beyond


                                                 22
individual leaders and needs to be accompanied by effective support to strengthen checks and
balances mechanisms including central and local level institutions and civil society.
88. Projects supporting PFM reforms will have limited or no impact if the following aspects
are not taken into account: i) A PFM strategy/action plan/IFMIS blueprint should be developed
based on recent analysis and updated periodically. As noted in the 2012 PFM reforms in post-
conflict countries, such plans will help ensure that approaches to PFM reforms and the provision
of support are strategic and focused. To build buy-in for reforms the strategy/plan should be
prepared involving all concerned stakeholders. Furthermore, (cf. Diamond, 2013) the reform plan,
including scope and sequencing should be tailored to the country-specific context; ii) PFM reforms
are embedded in a challenging political economy environment that needs to be better understood
to manage change and resistance to reform; iii) PFM reforms cannot be achieved focusing only on
technical solutions but need to be accompanied by behavioral and policy change; iv) IFMIS
reforms are particularly challenging and should go beyond purchasing IT equipment. Also, as
noted by Dorintsky and all, 2011, international experience indicates that there is only a limited
chance that IMFIS efforts will succeed on time and on budget. Finally, given rapidly changing
technology, regular stocktaking and rethinking of the use of technology is needed to ensure that
the most adapted and cost efficient technology is utilized; v) PFM reforms need to focus both on
building capacity at the center of government such as the Ministry of Finance and in line ministries,
agencies and institutions at both central and local level.
89. Support to CSOs and municipalities during the crisis period yielded better results than
support at the central level although its impact was limited by design flaws. While the political
crisis at the central level diverted attention away from public sector reforms, working through local
governments as well as non-government entities, showing more appetite for reforms and actions
has proven to yield better results than the engagement at the central level. When designing
operations to support CSOs and municipalities the following lessons should be taken into account:
i) CSOs and municipalities are heterogeneous in terms of absorption capacity and support needs
which should be adapted accordingly; ii) specific political economy factors of CSOs and
municipalities must be taken into account; iii) CSOs also need capacity building in fiduciary
management, transparency and accountability; and iv) transfer of knowledge and capacity building
takes time (according to beneficiaries continuous and regular support is necessary for a minimum
of three budget cycles to achieve lasting results).
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
90. The Borrower adopted its ICR on April 3rd 2015. Only 9 of 17 indicators have been fully
achieved and the results are fragile (see Annex 7 for a summary of the Borrower’s ICR). Key
lessons learnt include: i) need to strengthen leadership and commitment to reforms; ii) need to
improve donor coordination; iii) need to minimize overseas trainings and favor local trainings; iv)
need to be more selective in the use of third party service providers; and v) need to pursue reforms
in the area of PFM, land tenure, local governance, social accountability, justice, transparency and
access to information to consolidate the achievements of the project.
(b) Cofinanciers
91. A financing, of a total amount of EUR 1,000,000 was made available by the European Union
and administered by the IDA under a trust-fund. The funds were supposed to co-finance certain
activities supported by PGDI II and to conduct the Phase I Poverty and Social Impact Analysis


                                                 23
(PSIA) in selected mining municipalities. The trust fund was cancelled in August 2011. No activity
was financed by the trust-fund.

          Adopted by the Steering Committee of the PREA on April 3rd 2015

Strategic positioning of the project
• The project has helped prepare the reengagement of development partners following the
    crisis as an “output”: contributing to the Government’s strategic thinking on major
    reforms to be implemented through core diagnostics and blueprints of the reforms:
     o Coherent concept of the future system of public financial management;
     o Land tenure.
• Implement pilot actions and develop innovative tools which can be scaled-up following
    the crisis:
     o Operation for integrated municipal support;
     o Access to information charter and knowledge sharing;
     o Knowledge management platform;
     o Civil society fund for transparency and social accountability.
Performance
• 12 of 17 indicators achieved but the achievement of three of the 12 indicators are
   questionable (Number of PEFA self-assessments, number of bids of the central
   Government awarded under open competition and number of land parcels with secured
   ownership rights registered);
• Two of the indicators are in an uncertain situation (Percentage of FDL municipalities
   with an improved GMP (Gestion et Management de Projet) and the percentage of
   municipalities publishing information on public services in compliance with BIANCO
   recommendations);
• Three of the indicators have not been achieved (Number of PEFA indicators that
   increase their rating in the self-assessment, number of IFMIS centralization/integration
   indicators rated satisfactory and percentage of the GDLN budget that is covered by own
   resources);
• The sustainability of the results is uncertain;
• A significant number of outputs realized including several studies, methodologies and
   tools that will inform policies and reforms in the area of PFM, land tenure, local
   governance, accountability, civil society, transparency and justice.

Key lessons learnt:
• Need to strengthen leadership and commitment to reforms;
• Need to improve donor coordination;
• Need to minimize trainings abroad and favor local trainings;
• Need to be more selective in the use of third party service providers;
• Need to pursue reforms in the area of PFM, land tenure, local governance, social
   accountability; justice, transparency and access to information to consolidate the
   achievements of the project.

Annex 12: Achievement of project Objectives by components:
Initial Component 1
Rating: Unsatisfactory (U)
1.     The objective of the initial component 1 was to continue to support in a holistic
manner the reform of the public expenditure management system in Madagascar.
None of the results indicators of this component have been achieved. The PCU did
not collect any data to measure the indicators. At restructuring, two indicators were
dropped and one indicator was revised. The project achieved different sets of activities
putting in place the basis for the roll-out of an integrated system: (i) completion of the
roll-out of the WIMAX Antennas in 12 selected cities; (ii) purchase of a central server;
(iii) purchase of the ORACLE license; and (iv) establishment of an electrical back-up
system at the MFB. However, none of the system integration targets has actually been
completed due to the country context which affected the project’s normal course of
implementation. On the revenue side, the project contributed to setting up mechanisms
for revenue securing, especially within the customs administration.
Restructured Component 1
Rating: Unsatisfactory (U)
2.    The objective of the restructured component was to improve public financial
management. This component aimed at improving budget preparation and execution,
including the deployment of the IFMIS and activities aiming at: (i) strengthening
internal and external control and oversight mechanisms; (ii) institutionalizing public
procurement reforms; (iii) increasing performance of revenue agencies by
strengthening the capacity of the Customs Agency and the Fiscal Administration; and
(iv) enhancing budget transparency and financial accountability. The component
included support to Madagascar’s participation in global fora, such as the Open
Budget Initiative.
3.     Very few activities have been successfully completed. The lack of a PFM
strategy and of an IFMIS master development plan, of adequate quality, has hampered
the implementation of the key project activities. Conditions were not met for the
consolidation of the PFM reforms and the integration of the IFMIS has not improved.
This also makes a point for the argument that the project design remained too
ambitious even after its restructuring. The project intended to reach a total of eight
IFMIS integration indicators rated satisfactory compared to a baseline value of one.
However, at project closing, this was not achieved as only one IFMIS integration
indicator was rated satisfactory. The difficulty inherent to this type of reform,
especially under the challenging and volatile political context of the country prevented
the project from reaching its goals. In general, and taking into account the degradation
of the governance context of the country, the PFM system deteriorated throughout the
crisis as noted in the 2013 PEFA carried out under the PGDI-II, as compared to the
2008 results. However, even though the project did not reach its main goals, it
contributed in limiting further degradation of the system while setting the ground for
future reforms.




                                           50
4.    On the other intermediate results, one of the three results indicators was partially
achieved. One PEFA was completed at the national level. At the sub-national level,
two PEFAs were launched but none has been officially completed yet. Hence, the
indicator on the number of PEFA self-evaluation reports published and discussed with
a target value of 2 has only been partially achieved. Finally, there has been a decline
in the use of competitive procurement methods. The bids of the central government
awarded under open competition represented 10.69% of the total value of contracts in
2013, compared to 32% and 26% respectively in 2011 and 2012. This is below the
target value of 75% and even below the baseline value (Actually, the baseline value
was 26% in 2012 rather than 58% as stated in the results framework which took into
account only contracts above the threshold).
Initial Component 2: Strengthening the efficiency of government operations
Rating: Unsatisfactory (U)
5.     The objective of the initial component 2 was to support change management
and institutional development processes in the context of the Government’s
development strategy, the MAP. At restructuring, activities under this component had
supported the following areas: (i) decentralization– GoM’s Local Development Fund
- and the roll-out of participatory budgeting on 50 selected local governments
(municipalities); (ii) land management reforms with the establishment of technical
dialogue on reforms; and (iii) the GDLN. This contributed in establishing the
institutional framework supporting the decentralization process. Nevertheless, the
PCU did not collect data on the results indicators and none of the results indicators
achieved their targets at restructuring. This component was dropped during
restructuring but some of the main sub-components were kept in the new project
structure.
Restructured Component 2: Improvement of Local Governance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
6.    The objective of this component was to improve the efficiency of service
delivery at the local level. Of the six results indicators, three achieved their targets
while three others partially achieved the targets.
7.     Through the integrated OCAI approach, the project contributed in strengthening
the management capacity and service delivery capacity of local governments. The
OCAI approach is still applied in the beneficiary municipalities. However, under the
project, it was managed through external contractors and not through existing
institutions, raising the question of the ownership of the overall approach.
Consequently, even though indicators target values may have been reached by project
closure, the quality and the sustainability of these results are uncertain.
8.    The integrated approach comprised capacity building to municipalities. The
implementation of these capacity building initiatives through the FDL also improved
the capacity of this institution as a supporting entity to the municipalities.
Improvements were achieved in public financial management at the local level due to
the use of social accountability mechanisms and of formal procurement mechanisms.
However, this is to be taken cautiously as mechanisms such as participatory budget


                                           51
were, for many municipalities, used only for the allocation of municipal grants and
not for their overall budget. Formal procurement mechanisms were also used only for
procurement made under the grants transferred to the municipalities. Social
accountability mechanisms such as Participatory Budget implemented in the
municipalities in mining regions, substantially contributed to improving the use and
management of mining royalties for the benefits of the municipalities.
9.    Local governance indicators developed by the FDL were used by the project as
results indicators. . Through the implementation of Rapid Results Initiatives, some of
the municipalities where the project intervened were able to improve their score on
these indexes, showing an increased capacity and commitment to improving local
governance. These indicators include the Local Governance Index (IGL), the index of
Accounting and Financial Management (CGF), and the index of Management and
Project Implementation (GMP). 91% of the municipalities improved their score on the
CGF, against a target value of 50%. However, only 45% of the municipalities
improved their score on the GMP against a target value of 65%.
10. The local governance initiative also contributed to reinforcing land security. The
reform of the land management system of the country allowed for the identification
of 537,514 land parcels (against a target value of 8000) creating fiscal opportunity for
municipalities. However, the identification of these land parcels happened at the end
of the project, making it difficult to evaluate the impact in terms of revenue increase
for the beneficiary municipalities. Furthermore, the issuance of land certificates was
put on hold by the government in July 2014. In August 2014, the ban was lifted for
collective certification initiatives such as those under the project. While a small
number of land certificates were issued, at project closure 15.837 land certificates
were still awaiting the final signature before issuance. The indicator pertaining to the
number of delivered land certificates, with a target value of 7500 delivered
certificates, has thus not been achieved.
Initial Component 3: Rule of law and fight against corruption
Rating: Unsatisfactory (U)
11. The initial objective of component 3 was to assist Government in promoting
transparency, accountability and good governance, and in particular, in reducing
corruption. No results indicators are available as the PCU did not collect data for
M&E. While some activities were implemented at restructuring, their results were
limited and none of the results indicators achieved their targets at restructuring. Due
to little reform space on anti-corruption during the political crisis, the component was
dropped at restructuring, and some of the resources allocated were cancelled. Anti-
corruption activities were nonetheless continued at the local level under component 2,
improvement of local governance of the restructured project.
Revised Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Knowledge Management
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
12. The objective of the revised component 3 was to strengthen the capacity of
selected State and non-State actors to enhance social accountability, access to
information and knowledge sharing. The implementation of activities under this


                                          52
component contributed to improve access to information. The Access to Information
Charter was launched at the end of 2013 and registered a higher than expected level
of signatories. At the end of the project, 239 institutions had signed the Charter
compared to the target value of 60. While the Access to Information Charter is an
important step to improved public access to information, the Charter does not imply a
legal obligation to give access to information.
13. Access to and dissemination of information was strengthened through an
improved INSTAT webpage and the establishment of a knowledge management
platform. The number of visitors of the INSTAT webpage reached 58,446 visitors
between January and June 2014 against a target value of 90,000/year. Hence the
expected number of visitors per year is 116,892 which exceed the target value. The
first listening to Madagascar survey was given support under this component and the
MDG report was finalized. Statistical capacity building activities and support to
produce the national accounts were also provided under this component. Incidentally,
the project contributed in promoting open-data access resulting in a continued effort
of the INSTAT to making data available to the public. However, the theft of a
significant amount of IT equipment from INSTAT in May 2014, limited project
impact as the intranet and extranet networks of the institution could not be
implemented as a result of this theft. The expenditures related to the lost material have
been declared ineligible and the Bank requested reimbursement from the GoM.
However, as of February 2015 the reimbursement has not been done yet limiting all
Bank engagements with the INSTAT.
14. The knowledge management platform was operational at the end of the project
and hence, this performance target was reached. However, given the delays in
establishing and operationalizing the platform it is uncertain to what degree the
platform has been appropriated by the beneficiaries. Furthermore, the platform was
directly managed by the PCU and at project closing, no alternative management
settings have been put in place. The project also provided support to improve online;
real-time access to legal texts (Centre national Legis) and almost 90% of the legal
documents published in the journal official are now available online.
15. The GDLN was established with the support from the PGDI-I and II and is now
operational. A key challenge has been to ensure its financial viability. The results
indicator at the end of the project, the percentage of the GDLN budget that is covered
by own resources, reached 29% against a target value of 60% and a baseline of 40%.
The financial sustainability might, however, be better than reported by the results
indicator. The recent transformation into an EPIC (Etablissement Public à Caractère
Industriel et Commercial) attached to the Prime Minister’s office will strengthen the
structure as it will benefit from government subvention and guarantee. Furthermore,
the GDLN has been able to develop a strategic plan which is currently being
implemented and has established several strategic partnerships with national and
international learning institutions. This is expected to improve the revenue base of the
GDLN.
16. The component also supported a significant number of initiatives to improve
transparency, social accountability and civil society. A total of 72 civil society
organizations (CSOs) received a grant against a target (PDO level) value of 45.


                                           53
Training was also provided. The disbursement of the grants was delayed to minimize
the risk of political diversion of the funds as the country’s election process was
ongoing. This reduced considerably the time left for the implementation of the
activities. The grants and trainings, nonetheless contributed in improving the capacity
of the beneficiary CSOs. However, the one size fits all approach, which did not take
into account the variety in capacity of the different CSOs, was mentioned by CSOs as
a factor that reduced the impact of the grants. The activities also revealed a great
demand for additional support to the CSOs, in particular with regard to financial
management. The project also contributed to the adherence of Madagascar to the
Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA). Finally, the project supported
the pilot of the Open Budget Index that was completed at the national level. The
evaluation at the national level yielded a score of 14 out of 100 for the country, 100
being the maximum and 0 the minimum score. An Open Budget assessment at the
municipal level was also initiated.
Initial Component 4: Transparency and Social Accountability
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
17. Social accountability tools such as participatory budgeting and community
scorecards continue to be used in municipalities that received support through the
PGDI-II. Several conventions have also been signed with other World Bank’s projects
(Regional Integrated Growth Pole & Rural Development Projects) to promote social
accountability more widely (i.e. rural project). New pilot mechanisms (participatory
monitoring of publics funds in 40 municipalities with the rural development project,
and public debates at the regional level) are also being implemented. Moreover,
several public sensitization campaigns on the role of civil society in promoting social
accountability were organized in four regions (Analamanga, Alaotra Mangoro,
Atsinanana, Anosy). Support included activities to strengthen local governments PFM
and procurement capacity. Anti-corruption training at the municipal level
implemented by BIANCO was also implemented.
18. The project facilitated the coordination of NGOs by the establishment of a
regional consultative committee and by establishing regional social accountability
coaches responsible for the monitoring of the project’s social accountability activities
at the regional level. Health Community Scorecards, including the training of 206
community facilitators, were financed. The results indicators were not monitored by
the PCU and for one of the indicators no base-line data and targets were available.
However, the indicator on the number of social accountability activities (Community
Scorecards, Participatory Budgeting) completed is likely to have exceeded the initial
target value of 20 in 2012.
Revised Component 4: Project Coordination
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
19.   The absence of results indicators for this component makes the rating of the
component difficult. However, the last ISR indicated that overall performance of the
project management was adequate although it had been negatively affected by the
considerable difference between the commitment and disbursement rates as well as



                                          54
delays in procurement. Financial Management was found moderately satisfactory and
the fiduciary arrangements were in place to ensure an acceptable risk management.
With respect to procurement, the last ISR noted that recommendations have overall
been followed. A complaint grievance mechanism including the use of community
score cards has been implemented. However, Monitoring and Evaluation was found
to be unsatisfactory.
20.   Initial Component 5: Monitoring and evaluation
Rating: Unsatisfactory (U)
21. No results were achieved under this component. The key activity under the
component, the population census, was cancelled.
Initial Component 6: Project Coordination
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
22. Following the crisis in March 2009, the PCU continued to operate with a
reduced team. Procurement and financial management systems were in place. While
the project played a coordination role with respect to component 4 (Social
Accountability), the absence of clarity with respect to governance reforms in
Madagascar undermined the ability of the PCU to fulfill its coordination mandate.
Capacity was very weak, leading to delays in the execution of activities and in the
preparation of the restructuring. Furthermore, tensions between the PCU and the MFB
also contributed to delays in the implementation of the interim work plans and the
restructuring process.
