                         Throughout the life of the PGDI 2, a difficult environment affected the implementation of the project and the achievement of the results, largely as a consequence of an unstable
                         political situation and a long delayed election that created uncertainty and lack of leadership for key reforms such as Public Financial Management. However, in 2014 project
                         implementation and performance have increased considerably and more than 95% of activities have been launched and total disbursements exceed 83% by the end of August 2014.
                         Likewise, tangible results emerging in the area of public financial management with the completion of the PEFA Self-Assessment late December 2013 and the publication of quarterly

                         budget execution reports, with three out of four PDO indicators and seven out of thirteen intermediate indicators having exceeded their expected final targets; as a result of a very
                         successful land registration operation.

                         The project has remained a key tool in the dialogue with the government as it addresses key reforms for the country, including PFM, land management, and access to information.
                         The project managed to launch a series of key analytical works that will shape the dialogue with the Government of Madagascar on public sector reforms for the next 10 years. To
                         that end, a PFM reform strategy is currently under discussion, a prospective study of the land sector institutional framework is ongoing, and the draft access to information act is
                         under preparation. At the same time, the government managed to undertake an innovative, integrated project that showed promising results in local governance and a pilot grant
                         program to civil society to support demand side governance. The Access to Information Charter was adopted in December 2013 and a new Knowledge Platform for social
                         accountability has been implemented with the project’s support.
