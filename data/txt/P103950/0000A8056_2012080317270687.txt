                         The development objective of the project is to improve the efficiency and transparency of government and selected public services in Madagascar in line with the Madagascar Action
                         Plan (MAP). The progress towards the achievement of the PDO is unsatisfactory. The project institutional anchoring at the Presidency is not in compliance with the Bank's
                         operational guidelines OP/BP 7.30 – Dealing with de facto Governments. Expected results are no longer in line with the current country political, economic and social context. The

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since March 2009, Bank operations in Madagascar are guided by OP/BP 7.30 – Dealing with de facto Governments. Project implementation and achievements of project objectives
                         have been undermined by the political situation and the lack of funding over a period of 26 months (March 2009 – May 2011). On May 7, 2011, the Country Management Unit (CMU)
                         received the authorization from the Managing Director's Office (MDO) to extend the OP/BP 7.30 exception regime to encompass additional operations, including the Second
                         Governance and Institutional Development Project. Since May 2011, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has prepared 3 interim work plans to facilitate the transition towards the
                         restructuring and implement the activities under selected relevant components (Improvement of Public Expenditure Management, Strengthening the Efficiency of Government
                         Operations; and Social Accountability).

                         The restructuring process is on-going and the project restructuring paper will be presented to the World Bank's Board of Directors in August 2012. GoM recently agreed the
                         institutional anchoring of the project will be transferred from the President's Office to the Prime Minister's Office. Government also confirmed some elements of important public
                         sector reforms to be sustained during the political transition. The revised project components will include: i) Public Financial Management (PFM) Reforms; (ii) Local Governance
                         (including Land Management Reforms); (iii) Capacity Building & Knowledge Management (Social Accountability, Statistics & Global Distance Learning Network - GDLN); and (iv)
                         Project Management. Government also agreed on a revised project results framework and ensured selected indicators are relevant and monitorable. The project is scheduled to

                         close on August 31st, 2012, but will be extended for 24 months. The restructured project supports the governance and public sector capacity pillar of the World Bank Madagascar
                         Interim Strategy Note (ISN) adopted by the Board of Directors in February 2012.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
