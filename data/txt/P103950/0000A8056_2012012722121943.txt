                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since March 2009, Bank operations in Madagascar are guided by OP/BP 7.30 – Dealing with de facto Governments. The achievement of the results of the projects are undermined
                         by the difficulty to engage with government, activities which are no longer relevant in the current political context, an outdated results framework and the lack of funding over a period
                         of 26 months (March 2009 – May 2011). Recent authorization to resume disbursements and to restructure the project has yet to impact positively on the achievement of project

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         On May 7, 2011, the Country Management Unit (CMU) received the authorization from the Managing Director’s Office (MDO) to extend the OP/BP 7.30 exception regime to
                         encompass additional operations, including the Governance and Institutional Development Project II. As a result of this decision, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) prepared an
                         interim work plan approved by the Bank in August 2011. The interim work plan confirmed the resumption of activities under components 1 (Improvement of Public Expenditure

                         Management), 2 (Strengthening the Efficiency of Government Operations) with the support to decentralization, land management and the Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN);
                         and 4 (Social Accountability). In parallel to the implementation of the interim work plan, the project team started the project restructuring process. Preparatory work, including
                         dialogue with the authorities and the development of concept notes for each of the of the restructured project components is on-going. The project restructuring paper is scheduled to
                         be presented to the Board of Directors in April 2012.
