                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The progress towards the achievement of the project's development objectives of strengthening the efficiency and transparency of Government at the central and communal level is
                         unsatisfactory. As only one of the four project development objective (PDO) level indicators progressed during the period covered by the report, it is unlikely that the project will
                         achieve its objectives by August 2014. Over the period, progress was made essentially in the area of budget transparency with the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB) publishing

                         regularly quarterly budget execution reports. However, the Government has yet to launch the Public Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA), which is essential in informing
                         current as well as future public financial management reforms. As a result of the political crisis, the Local Governance Index (IGL), which measures transparency, accountability, and
                         participation at the communal level have regressed, and the number of project beneficiaries stagnated. The recruited agencies should accelerate the implementation of the activities
                         supporting local governance to achieve results before project closing in August 2014.

                         self-assessment (November 2013); Recruit firms responsible for consolidating the IFMIS integration and proposing priorities for future PFM reforms (November 2013); Revise the
                         PFM stakeholders training plan (November 2013); Recruit a consultant responsible to set-up the knowledge platform (December 2013); Recruit a firm responsible for conducting a
                         custom institutional assessment/HR study aimed at increasing revenue collection (January 2014); Launch the “Listening to Madagascar” Survey (January 2014); and Accelerate the
                         roll-out of two Integrated Communal Development Operations (ICDO) (On-going), including the training of local government officials in the area of public financial management and
                         anti-corruption, the launch of participatory budgeting activities in selected communes before the end of December 2013 and cash transfers (communal grants) to local government in
                         January 2014. The detailed action plan was discussed at length during the June and October missions and reflected in the revised Project Implementation Plan (PIP) cleared by the
                         Bank on October 15, 2013.

                         Underpinning these activities, the project team also reached an agreement with the World Bank Institute (WBI) Governance and Leadership Team to use the Rapid Results Approach
                         (RRA) to speed-up project implementation and accelerate disbursements before the project’s closure in August 2014.
