                         In the area of public financial management, the completion of the Public Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA) in December 2013 now provides a robust analytical basis to
                         monitor the implementation of public financial management (PFM) systems’ improvements. Unfortunately, there are no evidence investments made by the project impacted positively
                         on improving transparency and budget management; as most PEFA indicators declined or stagnated since the 2008 PEFA Assessment. After experiencing substantial delays,
                         activities pertaining to the Integrated Communal Development Operation (ICDO) are also progressing well with the issuance of numerous land certificates and the introduction of

                         participatory budgeting activities despite of the lack of clarity on the national land management policy. The signature of the Access to Information Charter in December 2013 and the
                         partial disbursement of the civil society grant are also steps in the right direction. However, the short period left for project implementation, combined with the need for the new
                         government elected in December 2013 to define a clear policy orientation, is undermining the achievement of the PDO. Hence, it is unlikely that the PDO will be fully achieved before
                         the closing of the project in August 2014.
