objective of the Second Governance\n            and Institutional Development Project is to improve the\n            efficiency and transparency of Government and selected\n            public services in Madagascar in line with the Madagascar\n            Action Plan (MAP). The level one restructuring includes: (i)\n            extending the closing date from August 31st, 2012 to August\n            31st, 2014; (ii) a revision of the project development\n            objective (PDO) and the results framework; (iii)\n            modification of the components and activities; (iv) revision\n            of the implementation arrangements; and (v) reallocation of\n            proceeds. The proposed restructuring aims at taking into\n            account significant changes in the project environment and\n            addressing both weak results and delays during the first\n            three years of project implementation. The project does not\n            have any audit reports or Interim Financial Reports overdue.\n            The recipient's action plan regarding the activities to\n            be carried out during the extended period of time was\n            reviewed and found to be satisfactory to International\n            Development Association (IDA). The changes proposed are\n            consistent with the Government's formal request to\n            revise the institutional anchoring and to restructure the\n            project. The financing agreement will be amended. The\n            revised updated indicators will be integrated in the project manual."}, "docdt": "2012-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
