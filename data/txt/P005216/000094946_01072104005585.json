The first objective to\n            provide storm water drainage to divert flood waters away\n            from flood-prone areas was achieved. The second objective to\n            transfer appropriate technology for the construction of\n            tunnels has also been achieved with the second tunnel\n            constructed using a tunnel boring machine. The third\n            objective to strengthen the institutional capacity of the\n            Tehran Municipality through technical assistance for project\n            planning and implementation and for sound municipal finance\n            management was partly achieved. The main lessons drawn from\n            the project is that institutional improvements are more\n            difficult to achieve than physical components. They require\n            careful diagnosis of the bottlenecks and a good\n            understanding of the institutions involved. Furthermore,\n            agreed upon measures for change should be reasonable and\n            consistent with the institutional capacity of client\n            organizations. Their implementation and expected results\n            take longer than the time horizon of a single project."}, "docdt": "2001-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
