The project includes two major subprojects, namely\n            a trunk tunnel and lateral drains and appurtenances, which\n            are required to intercept rainwater runoff collected in the\n            central part of Tehran; and a main interceptor and outfall\n            system consisting of a tunnel, an open channel, a retention\n            reservoir, and a pipe outfall to the Kan River. The system\n            will protect the central part of Tehran and the low-lying\n            areas to the south of the city from frequent floods."}, "docdt": "1992-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
