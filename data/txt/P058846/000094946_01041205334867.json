The RAP will\n            ensure that the livelihoods of project affected people (PAP)\n            improves, or at least that their standard of living is\n            restored following the project impact, and, stipulates the\n            following compensation for PAPs: The village commission will\n            provide temporary site, and housing allocation to PAPs in\n            rural areas, or on sites along the rail-line, until\n            resettlement is final, while land/housing compensation will\n            be paid in installments, before completion of new housing,\n            with public infrastructure being financed by the project.\n            Sub-urban housing demolition will take the form of, either\n            compensation of residential relocation units at\n            pre-determined sites downtown, or, compensation at\n            reconstruction prices, which should be paid prior to\n            construction. The government will select resettlement sites\n            for urban displacements, and enterprises, where PAPs will\n            resettle directly into the new housing, or commercial\n            buildings; however, depreciation of demolished housing will\n            not be considered in the reconstruction price, but moving\n            expenses shall be paid for by the project. The RAP\n            encouraged consultation, and socioeconomic surveys, as well\n            as the provision of grievance mechanisms during displacement."}, "docdt": "2001-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
