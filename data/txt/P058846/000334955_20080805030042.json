the National Railway Project\n            for China are as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to\n            the development outcome was low, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also rated\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the efficient\n            implementation of the project again demonstrated the value\n            of clear and thorough project planning, and that\n            well-designed incentives for the contractors such as\n            completion targets can generate substantial benefits in\n            performance. The use of an environmental supervision\n            engineer was a success and is now being considered for other\n            major projects with potential environmental sensitivity,\n            ensuring that proper attention is paid to environmental\n            safeguards while freeing the supervising engineer to\n            concentrate on technical issues. The experience of\n            establishing indicators for the second project development\n            objective of support to railway reform demonstrates the\n            difficulty in tying specific actions which can only be taken\n            at very high government and political levels to what is just\n            one of a multitude of infrastructure projects being\n            undertaken by Ministry of Railways (MOR). As has been found\n            in other projects in China, it is misguided to imagine that\n            short-term central government decision-making can be\n            significantly influenced by indicators embedded within a\n            project that primarily delivers infrastructure. This is\n            especially so in such a sensitive area as railway reform,\n            which in most European railways has taken well over a decade\n            (and in some cases closer to twenty years) for railways\n            which have a fraction of the national importance and\n            operational complexity of China Railways."}, "docdt": "2008-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
