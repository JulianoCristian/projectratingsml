         improve access to transport, strengthen economic growth, and\n            reduce poverty in the northwest of China, while supporting\n            as well efforts to reform China's railways. There are\n            two main components, described as follows. The first\n            component will finance the expansion of a key east-west\n            railway corridor between Baoji, and Lanzhou (Bao-Lan line).\n            This will be achieved by double-tracking, and upgrading the\n            existing line, which includes land acquisition and\n            resettlement, engineering and construction works - bridges,\n            tunnels and culverts - and track installation. Although the\n            Bank will not finance civil works for the Bao-Lan line, it\n            will finance the procurement of rails, turnouts, bridge\n            beams, and goods. Further detailed procurement includes\n            survey and design, equipment for telecommunications,\n            signaling, electrification and power supply, environment,\n            maintenance and operation, and, track maintenance. The\n            accrued interest during construction will be capitalized, to\n            be financed by local funds. The second component will\n            finance studies to support railway reforms, which includes\n            studies on the cost model research of the passenger\n            transportation enterprise, in establishing a wagon-ownership\n            enterprise, and, on tools integration work. Finally, the\n            loan will finance the front-end fee."}, "docdt": "2001-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
