RE:
Japanese Grant TF 029623 (National Railway Project)
Recipient-executed Part
Amendment to Grant Agreement
Dear Sir:
I refer to the Grant Agreement for the National Railway Project 
(Recipient-executed Part) between People’s Republic of China and the Bank, dated April 
18, 1997 as amended by a letter agreement dated December 6, 1999 (the Grant 
Agreement).  I further refer to the communication dated June 1, 2000, from the 
Ministry of Railways requesting that the Kunming Administration be substituted for the 
Nanchang Administration in connection with the technical assistance for the 
establishment of a passenger transport enterprise.
I am pleased to inform you that the Bank concurs with your request.  To give 
effect thereto, Schedule 2 to the Grant Agreement, Description of Technical 
Assistance, is hereby amended by replacing the words "Nanchang Administration" 
wherever they appear therein with the words "Kunming Administration."
In addition, the Bank establishes May 31, 2001 as the later date for purpose of 
Section 2.03 of the Grant Agreement.
Except as hereby amended, all provisions of the Grant Agreement otherwise remain 
in full force and effect.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing on behalf of the Recipient, by 
signing, dating and returning to us the enclosed copy of this Letter Agreement.  Upon 
our receipt of a countersigned copy of (i) this Letter Agreement and (ii) and the 
letter agreement amending the grant agreement for the Bank-executed Part for the 
National Railway Project, this Letter Agreement will become effective as of the date 
hereof.
Sincerely,
