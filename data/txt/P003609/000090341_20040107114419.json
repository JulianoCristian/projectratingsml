for China were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was highly likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned show that the\n            opportunities to promote and further the reform agenda\n            should be followed upon quickly if they arise during project\n            implementation. The dual track approach followed during\n            project implementation, intensive policy dialog at the\n            national level and implementation strategies designed at the\n            project level, facilitated and furthered achievement of the\n            objectives of the project. The comprehensive studies carried\n            out under the project allowed the Bank's timely\n            response to government queries about policies and actions\n            that would deepen and further the reforms. Government\n            ownership of and commitment to the reform process are more\n            important to the success of reforms than unrealistic and\n            dictated covenants. Appropriate technology transfer can\n            significantly step-up sector performance and availability of\n            resources. Under the project, it led to a 267 billion cubic\n            meter increase in the proven reserves of gas compared with\n            70 billion cubic meters estimated at appraisal, a production\n            capability of 10 billion cubic meters per year versus the\n            appraisal target of 8 billion cubic meters and a\n            transportation capability of 10 billion cubic meters per\n            year as against 8 billion projected at appraisal. The\n            long-term technical collaboration with an experienced\n            organization in the rehabilitation and capacity expansion of\n            gas processing and transportation infrastructure was highly\n            successful as it provided on-site managerial and technical\n            expertise, advice and training to SPA/PCL Southwest staff\n            and simultaneously facilitated decision making and state of\n            the art knowledge transfer. Procurement processing could be\n            streamlined in China to avoid delays in project\n            implementation. A delay of about 2 years was encountered on\n            this account in the implementation of this project. The main\n            constraints to efficient procurement processing were the\n            system of multi-layered approvals and processing through\n            intermediaries i.e., government approved agents."}, "docdt": "2003-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
