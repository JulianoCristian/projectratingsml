  restructuring component, an investment component, and an\n            institution building component. The restructuring component\n            includes implementation of the first phase of restructuring\n            the upstream oil and gas sector, based on the\n            recommendations of an ongoing restructuring study, including\n            commercialization and corporatization of China National\n            Petroleum Corporation/Sichuan Petroleum Administration\n            (CNPC/SPA) through their transformation into joint-stock\n            companies, introduction of a commercial accounting system\n            and implementation of productivity enhancement and related\n            human resources development programs. The investment\n            component includes gas field development in Eastern Sichuan\n            through the drilling of about 100 wells, seismic survey and\n            interpretation, and construction of related surface\n            facilities; gas field stimulation and rehabilitation of\n            about 90 wells in Eastern Sichuan and 100 wells in Central\n            Sichuan; and expansion as well as rehabilitation and\n            environmental upgrade of SPA's gas transmission and\n            distribution system. The institution building component\n            includes technical assistance and training for the\n            implementation of the above two components as well as for\n            national petroleum education to upgrade the teaching and\n            research capabilities of the local petroleum institutes and\n            development of exchange programs between the local and\n            foreign institutes. The project aims to: (a) support the\n            implementation of the upstre and gas sector restructuring;\n            (b) rationalize both the levels and stru gas pricing; (c)\n            promote rational gas allocation; (d) reduce acute gas\n            shortages and environmental degradation in Sichuan through\n            increased g production (and avoidance of coal consumption)\n            and energy conservation improve the efficiency of gas\n            production and optimize ultimate recover reserves through\n            sound reservoir management and state-of-the-art enhan\n            recovery technology; (f) enhance the safety, reliability,\n            operational efficiency and environmental management of the\n            gas transmission and distribution (T&D) system,\n            including the reduction of gas leakage whic in turn, reduce\n            methane emissions and the greenhouse gas effect; and (\n            strengthen the institutional capabilities of China National\n            Petroleum Corporation and the Sichuan Petroleum Administration."}, "docdt": "1994-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
