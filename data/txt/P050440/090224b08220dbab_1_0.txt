                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, implementation progress has improved on selected activities with the Ministry now disbursing 61% of project funding and 100% of the basket funds under Component 1.
                         Disbursement is set to pick up with implementation of two key high value contracts. During this review period, the Ministry of Public Service (MoPS) accomplished at least 75% of the
                         agreed key actions including completion of procurement, signing and commencement of contracts for the construction of the for the national records center and archives (NRCA), and
                         the Civil Service college (CSC) refurbishment. The Government has achieved 90% payroll data migration on to the integrated payroll and personnel system (IPPS). However delays
                         have been noted in the roll out and implementation of all modules under the IPPS leading to ineffective use of the IPPS for both payroll and wage bill management. This will have to

                         lines have been agreed upon with Government and a new project manager has been hired. Review of progress will be through monthly meetings led by permanent secretary's of
                         Ministry of Public Service and that of Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development.

                         Not withstanding the above challenges, the Bank notes enhanced efforts at project implementation and attributes this to the new leadership in the Ministry of Public Service (the
                         implementing agency) and inclusion of the IPPS as one of the key result areas under the Government's high level matrix on restoring good governance and fighting corruption.

                         There is progresses on the roll out of the results oriented management and output based budgeting (ROM/OOB) framework. Implementation of performance contracts across the
                         entire Government and development and dissemination of client charters to ensure enhanced citizen voices in monitoring service delivery was accomplished in 15 local governments,
                         3 regional referral hospitals and 4 Ministries. Another 33 Local Governments and 2 Ministries have completed the client charters and are in the dissemination stage. Selected actions
                         from the review and restructuring of Government Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) were approved by cabinet and implemented.

                         Implementation of activities under Component Two continues to be stepped up. Contract for Civil Service College premises was finalized and site handed over. Training under the
                         targeted capacity building and learning and applied change management commenced and over 1121 civil servants have been trained and the Masters in Business Administration
                         program is ongoing, with participating permanent secretaries expected to carry out research related to current Government policy reforms. Under the innovations and policy research
                         12 senior officers have participated in a study tour to Talin City Authority in Estonia and are developing concepts notes on implementation of one Stop Tourism Centers in the
                         municipalities of Mukono, Entebbe and Jinja

                         Risk factors:

                         1. The slow and ineffective implementation of the IPPS continues to pose challenges on achieving the objectives of installing this system. This is one of the key activities under the
                         project supporting the Government's pay reform agenda (effective management of the payroll and wage bill) and the Government high level matrix on improving management of
                         public resources. A no cost extension of the closing date to June 2014 was granted to provide time for completion of the roll out and implementation of the IPPS, construction of the
                         national records center and archives and refurbishment of the premises for the Civil Service College. Further, the Government has sought extra project management support f or the
                         IPPS.
