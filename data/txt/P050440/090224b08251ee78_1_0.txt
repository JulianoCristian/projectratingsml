                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of May 30, 2014—with project closing just one month away— the project has achieved the intended PDO outcomes to the following extent: (i) 75% of all MDAs are meeting their
                         annual performance targets within the budgeted resources as measured by the Government's annual performance reports against a target of 100% and (ii) improvement of policy
                         environment achieved through development and implementation of the of the ROM/OOB framework in more than the expected five sectors, setting up the Civil Service College,
                         review and restructuring of MDAs and implementation of recommendations to achieve time releasing efficiencies, and training at least 2679 civil servants against a target of 600. A
                         tracer study is being carried out and impact of the targeted capacity building will be assessed following project closure.

                         Overall, implementation progress has improved on selected activities with the Ministry now disbursing 84.35% of project funding and 100% of the co-financing basket funds provided
                         by DFID, Irish Aid and DANIDA under Component 1. In preparation for project closing, the Government has provided a road map for operationalization of the seven remaining
                         modules under IPPS by June 30, 2014, and will need to closely monitor and finance the roll out of the IPPS to another 65 votes. Provision has also been made to cater for

                         outstanding resources for completion of the NRCA building and its operationalization; and funds for sustain the CSC operations will need to be closely monitored.

                         Despite this progress, it is expected that Government will not be able to fully achieve the PDO because of delays in implementation of the Civil Works on the NRCA and failure to
                         achieve full implementation of the IPPS. The project experienced delays of approval at the start, was formerly restructured, and a new component (Component 2 – Strategic capacity
                         development) introduced prior to effectiveness, and continued with procurement and financial management challenges until the last year. These delays have had a ripple effect on
                         completion of all activities and as such full achievement of the PDO. Specifically, the Government has only been able to fully implement and operationalize one module (the payroll
                         module) out of the eight human resources management modules of the IPPS poses challenges on achieving the objectives of installing this system. This is one of the key activities
                         under the project supporting the Government's pay reform agenda (effective management of the payroll and wage bill) and the Government's efforts to improve accountability in the
                         management of public resources. In addition there are at least 5 weeks delays in the construction of the NRCA and the refurbishment of the CSC premises These challenges have
                         been exacerbated by ineffective financial management processes that have led to delayed audits and it is highly probable that all Bank resources will not be exhausted at the time of
                         project closure. Although a no cost extension of the closing date to June 2014 was granted to provide time for completion of the roll out and implementation of the IPPS, construction
                         of the national records center, and archives and refurbishment of the premises for the Civil Service College, this has not helped. Accordingly the Government has sought support from
                         the Bank to help with IPPS implementation.
                         With respect to relevance, as the project prepares to close, the project development objective focusing on (i) the transformation of the public service so that it is affordable, efficient
                         and accountable for the use of public resources and service delivery; and (ii) the improvement of the policy, institutional and regulatory environment in targeted areas for sustainable
                         growth and service delivery is still relevant. This is in line with the World Bank Country Strategy’s progress report’s recommendation to continue supporting supply side interventions
                         to improve governance and efficient use of public resources.

                         With respect to efficiency, Component 1 was designed to transform the public service so that it is affordable, efficient, and accountable in the use of public resources and delivery of
                         services through the (i) the review and restructuring of Ministries, department, and agencies which to date has provided for the new structure of to achieve time releasing efficiency
                         gains in land administration, creation of the directorate of petroleum to manage the policy environment around oil revenues, and setting up the petroleum institute; (ii) using the IPPS
                         to manage civil service payroll data and reduce opportunities for payroll corruption; (iii) improving accountability for results through the introduction of performance contracts for all
                         accounting officers and client charters for citizen engagement. To a large extent these have been achieved as shown below within the project resources and Government has now
                         committed to further implementation using its own resources. With time –given that public sector reforms take time to show impact – the Government should be building on immediate
                         changes like the reduction in payroll losses due to ghosts.

                         With respect to efficiency gains under Component 2, the project has been able to train a total of 2679 civil servants against a target of 600 using the innovative caravan approach to
                         implement the targeted capacity building, and supported implementation of the one stop shop tourism and business information centers in Jinja and Entebbe Municipalities. Given the
                         right environment, it is assumed that increased leadership and change management skills will improve on the implementation of public policies and delivery of services, and the
                         information centers in the municipalities will serve the dual roles of being learning points for other municipalities and improving business opportunities marketing in the two
                         municipalities.
