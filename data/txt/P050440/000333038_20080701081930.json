Center will be\n            built to provide a safe repository for government records as\n            one of the components of the Uganda Public Service\n            Performance Enhancement Program (UPSPEP). This environmental\n            impact assessment addresses negative environmental impacts\n            associated with this component. Negative impacts include\n            conversion of a residential site for public use; improper\n            management of excavated or filled soil leading to dust\n            plumes that affect air quality; loose soil in storm water\n            clogging adjacent drains; traffic congestion; generation of\n            demolition waste; stripped vegetation and land overburdened\n            from site leveling operations; loss of trees; improper waste\n            disposal; incineration of office waste leading to air\n            pollution if it is not operated according to\n            manufacturer's specifications or improperly maintained;\n            dust; and noise from electricity generators. Impact\n            abatement measures that are recommended include on-site\n            waste management practices like document incineration;\n            having workers protect against occupational safety risks\n            such as exposure to noise, dust, and body injuries by using\n            safety latches, for example; having professional engineers\n            and architects supervise construction; replanting with low\n            maintenance native species and marking uncut trees for\n            protection; suppressing dust with water spraying and issuing\n            dust masks to workers; restricting construction activities\n            during the daytime; providing silencers for equipment to\n            control noise; transporting lubricants and fuels in\n            appropriate containers such as sealed drums; transporting\n            materials during off-peak hours; limiting stockpiling to\n            areas away from drains; placing low beams around piles and\n            covering open piles; properly storing hazardous chemicals;\n            preparing a site waste management plan; and disposing of\n            un-reusable construction waste at an approved landfill."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
