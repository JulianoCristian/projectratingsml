                         and personnel system (IPPS). Disbursement now stands at 37% of IDA funds and 48% from the total basket fund contributed to bu DANIDA, Irish Aid and DFID. Key activities to
                         support strategic capacity building in the public service have commenced and the site for the proposed civil service college has been identified. A number of important contracts have
                         been signed and training activities using a caravan approach have commenced. Procurement capacity in the Ministry of Public Service continues to improve. The Ministry has

                         continues to improve. This needs to be sustained to maintain implementation momentum on the results oriented management agenda, performance management and implementation
                         of the IPPS.
                         Risk factors:
                         The Ministry faces a funding gap of close to US $ 35 million to complete the implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Management System [IPPS] and construction
                         and operationalization of the the National Records Center and Archives. Implementation of the IPPS is a key element in managing the public service wage bill and payroll. The
                         Ministry has submitted a formal request for the US $ 35 million to the MoFPED and this is to cover IPPS roll out phases III-V, the second phase of construction of the records and
                         archives building and some critical aspects of the Public Service Reform agenda.
