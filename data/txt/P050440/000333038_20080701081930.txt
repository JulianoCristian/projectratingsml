EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1
Ministry of Public Service of the Republic Of Uganda intends 
to construct 
a
Records and Archives Center at Plots 8-10 Lourdel Road in Kampala. The 
project is one of the components of the Uganda Public Service Performance 
Enhancement Program (UPSPEP). The facility will provide a safe repository for 
government records for the next 25 years.  
 
2
The proposed site lies on a triangular tract of land measuring 1.348 acres in 
area and bounded by Ministry of Health to the west, Yusuf Lule Road (former 
Kitante Road) along the northern boundary, and Lourdel Road along the 
southern periphery. Based on its proposed functional requirements, the facility 
has four distinct zones, namely, repositories (stores), technical facilities, 
public and educational facilities and administrative offices. The facility will 
have 4500 square meters of car parking in conformity to KCC’s requirement of 
one parking unit for every 40 m
2
of office space (occupancy). Functional 
components of the proposed facility as presented in the Final Design Report are 
summarized in the table below.

The site has a good cover of native tree species. The hedge along Yusuf Lule 
Road (former Kitante Road) and Lourdel roads is predominantly composed of 
mature trees. Construction operations will give priority to conservation of 
existing trees and hedges on site. The objective of proposed landscaping will

-
be to compliment existing faunal environment with a selection of aesthetic 
indigenous and exotic plants. 
 
4
The proposed facility was designed to support a population of up to 300 people 
including employees and visitors during its operation. Construction of the 
facility will avail a significant number of jobs and revenue to suppliers of 
construction materials. 
 
5
Location of the proposed facility has access to a public sewer, stormwater 
drainage, electricity grid, telephone lines and public roads. 
 
Significant potential environmental impacts are summarized below.  
 
6
Negative construction phase impacts 
 
i) 
Facility construction implies an irreversible commitment of the plot from a 
residential site to public use site. Specifically this will affect the families 
currently residing at the site. 
ii) 
This project will impact the short public road cutting across the 
southeastern part of the site, if it were closed during construction.  
iii) 
Improper management of excavated or filled soil during site preparation has 
potential impair air quality in the neighborhood due to dust plumes. 
Entrainment of loose soil on site in stormwater could clog adjacent drains. 
iv) 
Traffic flow impairment if no safety signs were located on roads adjoining 
the site. 
v) 
Construction will generate considerable quantities of demolition waste, 
stripped vegetation and overburden from site leveling operations, improper 
disposal of which poses negative environmental and aesthetic impacts. 
 
7
Positive construction phase impacts 
 
i) 
Employment during facility construction. 
ii) 
Income to suppliers of construction materials.

8
Negative operation phase impacts
 
i) 
Incineration of office waste poses a risk of onsite and offsite air pollution if 
incinerator was not operated according to manufacturer’s specifications or 
improper maintained. 
ii) 
Noise associated with standby electricity generators. 
iii) 
Permanent traffic flow obstruction if access roads to site were inadequately 
designed and improperly aligned. 
vi) 
Adverse impact on traffic if the short public road cutting across the 
southeastern part of the site was permanently closed.  
 
9
Positive operation phase 
 
i) 
The facility will provide a safe repository for cultural, historical, legal, 
economic and scientific records for the next 25 years. Records provide a 
retrospective basis for consistency and reliability in planning and decision-
making.  
ii) 
The facility will provide centralized location and access to records by 
educational institutions, business community, general public and 
government agencies. 
iii) 
Improved aesthetics and socio-economic value of the site. 
 
10
 
Impact mitigation recommendations  
 
Apart from change of landuse at the site, all other negative impacts can readily 
be mitigated with good design, due diligence and continued monitoring. Impact 
abatement measures recommended in this study are summarized below; 
 
i) 
Access to the site should not disrupt traffic flow on existing roads. 
ii) 
Onsite waste management practices including document incineration, 
should conform to NEMA guidelines and KCC solid waste ordinance. 
iii) 
Project development should seek guidance from utility firms in locating 
sewers, water mains, underground communication and electricity 
infrastructure that could be severed during site preparation.

iv
-
iv) 
Construction workers should be adequately protected against occupational 
safety risks such as excessive exposure to noise, dust and body injuries. 
Builders working at elevated levels above 2 meters should use safety 
latches to avoid fatal falls. 
v) 
To avoid defects that have been rampant in high-rise construction in 
Uganda, construction should be managed and supervised by professional 
(registered) engineers and architects. 
vi) 
Ministry of Public Service is preparing Resettlement Action Plan to cater for 
the compensation and relocation requirements for the households currents 
on the proposed site. 
 
11
 
Biological assessment  
 
A
section of this report (see Appendix 2) was dedicated to biological assessment, its 
findings and impact mitigation recommendations. No significant impacts on fauna and 
flora would result from construction of the proposed facility.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
 
Ministry of Public Service of the Republic Of Uganda plans 
to construct a Records And 
Archives Center on Plots 8-10 Lourdel Road, in Kampala as one of the components in its 
Uganda Public Service Performance Enhancement Program (UPSPEP). The facility will provide 
a
safe repository for government records for the next 25 years.  
 
The proposed site lies on a triangular tract of land measuring 1.348 acres in area and bounded 
by Ministry of Health to the west, Yusuf Lule Road (former Kitante Road) along the northern 
boundary, and Lourdel Road along the southern periphery.  
 
Based on its proposed functional requirements, the facility has four distinct zones, namely; 
repositories (stores), technical facilities, public and educational facilities and administrative 
offices. The facility will have 4500 square meters of car parking in conformity to KCC’s 
requirement of one parking unit for every 40 m
2
of office space (occupancy). Functional 
components of the proposed facility are presented in table below.

The site has access to a 7-inch public sewer crossing the site from Lourdel Road to Yusuf Lule 
Road (former Kitante Road), stormwater drainage, electricity grid, telephone lines and public 
roads. It has a good cover of native tree species. The hedge along Yusuf Lule Road (former 
Kitante Road) and Lourdel roads is predominantly composed of mature trees.  
 
The proposed facility was designed to support a population of up to 300 people including 
employees and visitors during its operation.  
 
1.1 
Justification of Proposed Development and its Location  
The facility will provide a safe repository for government records for the next 25 years. The 
facility will provide improved, more efficient and easy access to records by educational 
institutions, business community, general public and government agencies in a centralized 
location. The proposed facility is conveniently located on the flanges of Kampala city in an 
area with a quiescent scholarly atmosphere. It is near to Makerere University, Mulago 
Hospital, Medical School, Law Development Center and yet close to government ministries 
and business community located in the city center. 
 
1.2 
Facility Development  
To the greatest extent possible, building footprints will be laid out and oriented so as to 
minimize the removal and loss of existing trees. The area of removal will also take into 
account the need for clear space around each construction area for the passage of 
construction equipment. Site preparations (access roads, temporary office buildings, 
Page  14

materials stockpiles, equipment and material stores, etc.) will entail some loss of trees and 
vegetation. Construction operations and site works will require supply of water, thus provision 
of water to the site from nearby NWSC mains will also be an initial construction activity.  
 
1.2.1  Building Construction Methodology 
Engineering and architectural designs defined the construction methodology to be employed, 
specifying type of foundations, phased construction and nature of external and internal 
finishings. This is relevant insofar as different foundation types affect subsurface drainage 
differently. Modular construction on the other hand, allows for shorter construction time. The 
proposed site is largely flat and large-scale excavation is not expected.  
 
1.2.1.1 Foundations 
 
In the design, a raft foundation was adopted in all heavily loaded repository areas while 
singular foundations were recommended in all other areas. 
 
1.2.1.2 
Columns, Beams and Slabs  
Circular and rectangular columns were used as structural supports in the structural design of 
the facility while all beams would be rectangular. In some cases, column cross-sections were 
varied with height depending on the load to be supported and to enhance aesthetics. 
Aesthetic considerations are particularly important for columns because they are commonly 
external structures compared to either beams or slabs. Solid and ribbed slabs with Maxpan 
infill were recommended in the design. 
 
1.2.1.3 
Roofing System  
The roof will be made of waterproofed reinforced concrete slabs to allow for vertical 
expansion in the future.  
 
1.2.1.4 Windows 
 
A
significant environmental characteristic of proposed windows is their having a coffee tray 
and mesh to avoid ingress of vermin into the facility. This is critical considering the value of 
records and duration for which they should be maintained in good condition. All windows will

-
be powder-coated aluminum sliding profiles, which aesthetic and easy to clean. Also, 
aluminum, more than iron, is resistant to deterioration by weather conditions.  
 
1.2.1.5 Floors 
and 
Ceilings 
 
Public areas around major circulation area will be finished in granite tiles for durability and 
aesthetics. Washrooms will have granite tiles for beauty and ease of cleaning. Repository 
floors, lift lobbies and escape staircases will be finished in terrazzo which is resistant to wear 
yet easy to clean. Public areas will have acoustic ceilings for reduction of noise and echoes. 
 
1.2.1.6 
Geometry of Proposed Facility 
The facility will comprise of three blocks: an administrative block, exhibition block and a 
records block. While the rest will be rectangular storied structures, the exhibition block will 
be circular. The longest side of the triangular shaped of site provides opportunity for a long 
building (records block) with big potential for horizontal expansion. The administration block 
has an east-west orientation perfectly shielding the interior from direct rising and setting sun.  
The circular block defies all sun angles to provide a unique and functional exhibition space 
while being appropriately joined to the two rectangular buildings.  
 
1.2.1.7 
Landscaping   
Landscaping operations will give priority to conservation of existing trees and hedges on site. 
The objective of proposed landscaping will be to compliment existing faunal environment 
with a selection of aesthetic indigenous and exotic plants. 
 
Landscaping is also intended to provide convenient access all buildings on site and perimeter 
fence for site security. Apart from the paved parking lots, pedestrian paths, the rest of 
unbuilt areas on site will have grass and flower gardens. The main entrance to the facility will 
have a fountain in the forecourt to reinforce scenic impression of the facility. 
 
Lighting will be provided on the exterior of the buildings, along pedestrian pathways, and in 
the entire project area. Lighting will also be provided as part of the project’s landscape 
features. The exterior walls of the proposed buildings will use low glare producing materials.

1.2.2 Materials Transportation 
Site clearance and construction of the facility will require transportation of materials to and 
from the site and this will generate a significant volume of traffic, especially trucks, on both 
Lourdel and Yusuf Lule roads. This could exacerbate traffic congestion at Mulago roundabout 
north of the site and potentially cause a deterioration of air quality due to dust plumes. 
These are impacts that can be mitigated as discussed in mitigation recommendations. 
 
1.2.3  Site Alteration and Aesthetics  
During construction, careful site development will be undertaken to ensure that only areas to 
be built are stripped of existing mature trees. Particularly, the developer intends to preserve 
trees in the hedge around the site.  
 
Seven old residential houses, homes to employees of the Ministry, currently occupy the site. It 
is evident that site aesthetics would be improved when the project is completed.  
 
Construction will permanently alter the site’s stormwater hydraulics, the overall effect being 
more runoff flowing from the area. However, adequate stormwater drainage was provided for 
in the facility architectural and engineering designs.

With expected maximum occupancy of 300 people and per capita water use of 80 liters per 
person per day, maximum daily water demand at the facility is expected to be at least 24,000 
liters per day. Water would be obtained from existing mains and this presents NWSC with a 
long-term, irreversible source of revenue. 
 
1.3.2  Expected Refuse Generation   
For a solid waste generation rate of 0.5 kilogram per capita per day, maximum quantity of 
refuse generated at the facility is at least 150 kg or 1.75 tonnes per week.  Solid waste 
generated at the facility will primarily be domestic in nature, mainly composed of paper and 
food waste from the staff kitchen. This will be collected on a regular basis from the facility 
by KCC or its licensed contractors and dumped at Kiteezi Landfill. Waste disposal will be 
based on the KCC’s solid waste management system for Kampala City and in conformity with 
regulations in its Solid Waste Ordinance (2000).  
 
1.3.4  Expected Wastewater Generation and Management  
Wastewater will be generated from toilets, ablution rooms and kitchen.  Table 2 gives 
estimates of daily quantities of wastewater generated when occupancy is maximum.

1.3.5 Vehicular Traffic 
Operation of the facility will generate considerable volume of traffic moving into and out of 
the facility. This traffic volume will include facility staff, suppliers, and visitors. On advice of 
KCC and Ministry of Works Housing & Communications (MoWHC), access routes should be 
aligned so as to avoid traffic disruption on Yusuf Lule and Lourdel Roads. Roadside parking 
around the facility should be designed so as to avoid traffic flow disruption on adjacent roads. 
 
1.4 
Project Categorisation According to the Environment Act (CAP 153) 
The proposed project is included in Category 2- “Urban Development” of the Third Schedule 
of the Environment Act as one of the projects that should be considered for Environment 
Impact Assessment (EIA).

STUDY METHODOLOGY 
 
The methodology used consisted of review of literature and World Bank Guidelines on 
environmental impact assessments for large-scale building construction. Field measurements 
were undertaken to establish baseline environmental noise levels.  
 
2.1 
Methodology for Environmental Impacts 
2.1.1  Identification of OHS Risks during Project Construction 
The possible sources of occupational hazards to the workforce were identified. The proposed 
plans and measures to overcome them were then developed. OHS impacts of development 
and operational phases were identified basing on nature of construction activities and 
occupational safety risks involved. 
 
2.1.2  Assessment of Traffic Flow Obstruction  
Traffic flow on Yusuf Lule and Lourdel Roads was observed to establish likely disruption if 
accesses to the site were constructed off these road.  
 
2.1.3  Assessment of Impact of Haulage of Construction Materials 
Major issues associated with material transport which were assessed included air quality 
impairment, road safety and traffic flow disruption associated with heavy trucks ferrying 
construction materials to the site. 
 
2.1.4  Assessment of Construction Waste Management 
An inventory of likely construction waste was developed and used to identify potential 
impacts and effective mitigation measures.  
 
2.1.5  Environmental Noise  
Noise measurement was done on the site using an EXTECH
TM
 Digital Sound Level Meter.

POLICY, LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
 
Sections below provide a review of policies and regulations relevant to the proposed project. 
 
3.1 Policy 
Framework 
3.1.1  The National Environment Management Policy, 1994 
The overall goal of the National Environment Management Policy
,
1994
 is to promote 
intergenerational equity and sustainable development that maintains and enhances 
environmental quality and resources periodicity to meet human needs of the present 
generation without compromising ability of future generations meeting their own. 
 
This policy aims at enhancing the health and quality of life of the people of Uganda; and the 
integration of good environmental practice and behavior into development policies, plans and 
activities. The policy is also intended to assist decision makers and resource users in 
determining priorities in the national context and also at the sectoral, private sector and 
individual levels.   
 
3.1.2  Kampala Structure Plan - 1994 
Since independence in 1962, urban planning and development has continued to be regulated 
by the Uganda Town and Country Planning Act. In 1994, KCC developed the Kampala Structure 
Plan with the following objectives for the city:- 
 
Demographic: 
 
a)  Accommodate anticipated future growth based on realistic, achievable growth rates. 
b) Ensure that planning proposals and policies address the full range of socio-economic 
groups currently resident in Kampala, including in particular, lower income residents, 
women and members of the informal sector. 
c)  Ensure that affordable land, housing and services are provided in proportion to actual 
urban demand.

-
Environmental aspects: 
 
a) Protect and enhance the natural environment of Kampala including the quality and 
integrity of air, water and land resources. 
b)  Pursue energy and water conservation policies and waste reduction, reuse and recycling. 
c)  Promote tourism within Kampala district. 
 
Urban development: 
 
a)  Encourage urban growth, which makes full use of existing infrastructures as opposed to 
urban sprawls. 
b)  Encourage orderly patterns of land subdivision that ensures direct access to existing or 
future roads, and allows for upgrading of infrastructure. 
 
Within this structure plan it was proposed that land is designated into 5 basic zones i.e 
residential, commercial, industrial, institutional and environmental. The proposed site area is 
zoned as institutional and the neighborhood predominantly is composed of corporate offices 
and government ministries (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Public Service, Chieftaincy of 
Military Intelligence among others). 
 
3.2 Legal 
Framework 
3.2.1  Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 
The Constitution under Article 245 empowers parliament to provide for measures intended to 
protect and preserve the environment from abuse, pollution and degradation among others in 
order to promote sustainable development for the present and future generations.  It also 
vests all land in the country in the citizens of Uganda and protects property and other 
individual rights.  Under Article 26, all persons are given a right to own property and it is 
stipulated that the land/property cannot be compulsorily acquired unless there is prompt 
payment of fair and adequate compensation prior to the taking or acquisition of the property. 
 
Article XXVII (The Environment) further recognizes the need for sustainable management of 
air, water and land resources, and utilization of natural resources to meet development and 
environment needs and conservation of natural resources.

-
3.2.2  The National Environment Act (Cap 153 of the Laws of Uganda) 
The Act provides for the sustainable management of the environment in the country.  Under 
this law, it is a requirement that an environmental impact assessment be undertaken by the 
developer where the lead agency, in consultation with NEMA, is of the view that the project 
may have an impact on the environment, is likely to have a significant impact on the 
environment, or will have a significant impact on the environment. 
 
Development of urban infrastructure is in the category of projects that are likely to have 
significant impact on the environment and hence the need for the EIA. 
 
3.2.3  National Environment (Noise Standards & Control Regulations), 2003 
(Under sections 23 and 107 of the Environment Act) these regulations are aimed at ensuring 
the maintenance of a healthy environment for all people in Uganda, the tranquility of their 
surroundings and their psychological well-being by regulating noise levels. This is done 
through prescribing the maximum permissible noise levels from a facility or activity to which 
a
person may be exposed and the provision for control of noise and for mitigating measures 
for the reduction of noise.  Under regulation 8, it is the duty of the owner of a facility or 
premises to use the best practicable means to ensure that the emission of noise from his/her 
premises does not exceed the permissible noise levels.

-
Section 6(1) of these regulations requires that the maximum noise levels from a facility in the 
general environment specified in Part 1 of the First Schedule as “mixed residential (with some 
commercial and entertainment)”, shall not exceed 55 dBA and 45 dbA during day and 
nighttime respectively. This regulation will have a direct influence on daytime or nighttime 
noise levels generated at the proposed facility both during construction and operation phases. 
 
3.2.4  The Kampala City Council (Solid Waste Management) Ordinance, 2000 
The ordinance places responsibility on every waste generator Sections 4 (1) to properly store 
solid waste generated on premises until collected by a licensed waste disposal firm. 
Conversely, for construction waste, Sections 16(1) and (2) require that a contractor shall be 
responsible for removal of this waste from site and its disposal at an authorized site. Sections 
19 (1) and (2) entrust KCC with legal authority to license waste disposal facilities including 
incineration units. Since the proposed facility plans to operate a small onsite incineration unit 
to dispose of office waste, a license from KCC would be necessary.   
 
3.2.5  The Land Act, Cap 227 
As the principal law relating to land tenure in Uganda, this Act provides for ownership and 
management of land.  It requires any proponent executing public works on land to promptly 
compensate any person having an interest in the land for any damage caused to crops or 
buildings 
inter alia.
 Section 45 of the Act further provides that any use of land shall conform 
to provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act and any other law. There is need 
therefore to acquire the necessary permits before project works can commence. 
 
3.2.6  The Water Act Cap 152 
Under Regulation 7 of the Sewerage Regulations it is prohibited to erect a building in a NWSC 
area unless the appropriate sewerage connections are installed as required and the necessary 
permission has been sought from NWSC to construct a building sewer or connect/disconnect it 
to NWSC infrastructure. Further, the regulations require that one may not erect a building in 
a
NWSC area unless the appropriate water connections are installed as required and the 
necessary permits sought from the corporation and plans approved.

3.2.7  Local Governments Act Cap 243 
The Act allocates responsibility for service delivery of a number of functions to local 
government councils.  The district councils provided for in the Act have both legislative and 
executive powers, rendering them the highest political authorities in the districts.  With 
regard to natural resource management, the district councils are responsible for land 
surveying, land administration, physical planning and environment and sanitation services 
that are not the responsibility of central government.  Kampala district will thus play a vital 
role during the establishment of the proposed development project. 
 
3.3 Institutional 
Framework 
Following the enactment of the National Environment Act, the National Environment 
Management Authority (NEMA) was created and charged with the responsibility to oversee, 
coordinate and supervise environmental management in Uganda.  NEMA also enforces 
regulatory compliance during and after construction of projects.

DESCRIPTION OF BASELINE ENVIRONMENT 
 
4.1 Meteorology 
 
 
Microclimate of the site affects onsite conditions, activities and operations hence influencing 
extent and intensity of socio-economic and environmental impacts of the project. More soil 
erosion would for example be experienced during rain seasons than in drier months. Dry 
seasons will be characterised by higher water demand for cleaning dusty areas and watering 
lawns and flower gardens. Sections below provide a quantitative situation of the microclimate 
of Kampala area, which are relevant to the proposed site.  
 
4.1.1 Rainfall  
Kampala experiences two distinct rain seasons. The shorter and lighter rains fall from March 
to May while heavier and longer rains are experienced from August to November.  
 
4.2 
Topography and Hydrogeology   
The project site is relatively flat, well drained and topographically located on a mild slope 
ending in Kitante Golf Course.  Stormwater from higher western neighborhoods is intercepted 
by drainage channels running Lourdel Road. Therefore there is minimal risk of flooding on site 
during heavy storms or prolonged rain seasons. 
 
4.3 Vegetation 
 
 
All trees on site are native, not threatened species and have low ecological significance. 
However, preservation of existing mature trees is aesthetic and environmentally responsible.

4.4 Socio-Economic 
Environment 
 
The plot slopes gently towards Yusuf Lule Road (formerly Kitante Road) to the east.  It is 
bounded by Lourdel Road to the south and Ministry of Health headquarters to the west. The 
southwestern portion of the site is used by nursery growers selling flower and tree seedlings. 
 
Immediate neighborhood of the proposed site consists of the Heifer Project International 
office, Tamoil Oil Company office, MSL Computer Services, the Chieftaincy of Military 
Intelligence offices (formerly Ministry of Health staff courts) and several office premises on 
Lourdel Road.    
 
The project area lies in the central division of Kampala district. The project site is in a 
planned area and the surrounding land was originally designated for residential purposes. 
However, basing on the 1994 Kampala Structure Plan, most of the land around the project 
area has been rezoned for commercial purposes.   
 
Currently, the proposed site has seven dwellings occupied by employees of Ministry Of Public 
Service.  Families living at the site grow crops such as bananas, maize, cassava, beans, sweet 
potatoes and a variety of vegetables in their backyards.  Flower nurseries selling seedlings 
exists along Yusuf Lule roadside and at its junction with Lourdel.  Families living at the 
proposed site have all been informed of the proposed project the compensation, and 
displacement when project development starts.

4.4.1 Economic Activity near Site 
The neighborhood of the site comprises corporate offices and government ministries. Ministry 
of Health headquarters are located to the site’s immediate west. Further west is located the 
Office of Government Chemist, Agriculture organization (FAO) and Ministry Of Public Service. 
Food Lourdel road is lined by corporate offices and foreign missions/embassies. Southeast, 
the site is bordered by corporate office of The Heifer Project. 
 
4.4.2 Physical Infrastructure 
4.4.2.1 Electricity 
Grid 
The site has access to an 11 kV hydroelectricity powerline, which could easily be stepped 
down to either single- phase (240 volts) of three- phase (415 volts) to suit onsite energy 
demand of the facility. 
 
4.4.2.2 Telecommunications 
This area is within the city and well serviced by landline telephone infrastructure and by all 
wireless phone networks. 
 
4.4.2.3 Water 
Supply 
 
The facility will obtain water by connection to the NWSC trunk mains. 
 
4.4.2.4 Sewage 
Disposal 
Disposal of sewage from the proposed project will be by connection to a NWSC foul sewer 
leading to Bugolobi sewage treatment works. There is an existing main sewer running across 
the plot from Lourdel Road to Yusuf Lule road. Another combined sewer runs along Yusuf Lule 
road adjacent to the proposed site. 
 
At the time of the assessment, onsite buildings were in very poor condition, piped water 
supply had broken down and solid waste dumped in backyards.  Sewer manholes next to the 
houses were fouled and malodor was emanating from them.

-
4.4.2.5 Solid 
Waste 
Disposal 
Area comprising the proposed site is within Kampala City Council and disposal of solid waste 
must be in compliance with the Solid Waste Management Ordinance (2000). 
 
4.4.2.6 
Healthcare Infrastructure   
Existing healthcare infrastructure are adequate to handle medical emergencies at the 
proposed facility project. In addition to numerous clinics in Wandegeya and Buganda Road, 
the proposed facility would easily access medical services provided at major hospitals such as 
Kololo Hospital and Mulago Referral Hospital.  
 
4.4.2.7 
Other Land Use in the Area 
Not far away are Makerere University and several schools and corporate agencies, which will 
be among the major users of the proposed Records and Archives Center. 
 
4.4.3 Services 
4.4.3.1 Firefighting 
Services 
In case of an emergency, the proposed facility has easy access to firefighting services from 
M/s Fire Masters and Uganda Police Fire Fighting Department all located within a 5 kilometers 
radius from the site. 
 
4.4.3.2 
Public Safety and Security 
Safety and security are critical in deciding the location of a national records and archives 
facility. Opportunely, the site is located in prime area with adequate security. Nearby 
security agencies include Uganda Police (Wandegeya) and the Chieftaincy of Military 
Intelligence on Yusuf Lule Road.   
 
4.5 
Environmental Noise  
Due to the site’s proximity to Yususf Lule and Lourdel roads both of which are relatively busy 
carriageways, onsite measurements showed a site with relatively high background noise 
levels. At points closer to the roads (P1 and P2 along Lourdel Road; P9 and P10 along Yusuf 
Lule Road), noise levels were higher than WHO guideline of 55 dBA for serious annoyance and 
NEMA’s daytime maximum permissible level for general environment (mixed residential with

some commercial and entertainment) of 55 dBA. Hence baseline noise levels presented below 
were mainly contributed by vehicular traffic on Lourdel and Yusuf Lule roads that border the 
site on southern and northern boundaries respectively.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION 
 
An impact is any change to the existing condition of the environment caused by human 
activity or an external influence. Impacts therefore may be positive (beneficial) or negative 
(adverse). They may also be direct or indirect, long-term or short-term, and extensive or 
local in effect. Impacts are termed cumulative when they add incrementally to existing 
impacts. Both positive and adverse environmental impacts could arise during the site 
preparation, construction and the operation phases of the facility development project. 
These are discussed below. 
 
5.1 Construction Phase Impacts 
Consideration of construction phase impacts in the following section includes those effects 
related to site clearing and preparation works.  
 
5.1.1 Displacement of Existing Residents, Flower Seedling Vendors 
Construction of the facility will involve compensation and displacement of families currently 
living on site. Even when adequately compensated, permanent relocation to new living area 
with different socio-economic benefits the current site presented (such as proximity to urban 
infrastructure and services) is considered to be a negative impact. 
 
Along Yusuf Lule Road and at its junction with Lourdel Road, people who for over 8 years have 
operated small-scale nurseries selling flower seedlings will be displaced once construction 
starts. Although their operations could easily be shifted to new locations, displacing them will 
result into loss of clientele and income before their businesses reestablish. 
 
Mitigation
:
MPS should develop an effective Resettlement Action Plan, to ensure fair 
and adequate compensation to affected people.  
Page  31
AWE Engineers 
www.awe-engineers.com
 
Records & Archives Center EIS, 2005 
-
20
-
5.1.2 Loss of Trees during Site Clearing  
If the contractor does not follow wishes of the developer to preserve mature trees on site to 
the greatest extent possible, site preparation before construction could result in the loss of 
many existing trees and the hedge along Yusuf Lule and Lourdel roads.  
Mitigation:  
Impact mitigation here seeks to retain and restore as much of the original tree cover on site. 
a) 
Site clearance should be carried out in a manner that retains the large trees 
when  
building footprints are pegged out.  
b) 
The landscape plan should seek to utilize low-maintenance native species 
rather than invasive species. 
c) 
Trees to be protected and left in place should be clearly marked, individually numbered, 
identified on the site plan and encircled by a sturdy fence prior to the commencement of 
construction
.
d) 
A
landscape plan prepared prior to commencement of site clearing activities 
should be strictly followed. 
e) 
All construction workers should be aware of the environmental management 
plan in this report and sensitized on its contents.

-
5.1.3 Soil Erosion 
Vegetation clearance, road construction and excavation works related to construction of the 
facility will expose soils in the affected areas leaving them vulnerable to erosion by surface 
run-off, a negative consequence. The flat topography of the site would tend to reduce erosive 
surface flows and the threat of turbidity should exist only for the duration of construction 
works before landscaping and drainage works are put in place.  
 
Mitigation: 
a) 
To the greatest extent possible, phase site clearance so as to minimize the 
area of exposed 
soil at any given time. 
b) 
Re-plant exposed soils with grass and other appropriate species as soon as 
possible. 
c) 
Temporarily bund exposed soil and redirect flows from heavy runoff areas that 
threaten to 
erode or result in substantial surface runoff to adjacent channel waters. 
d) 
Monitor areas of exposed soil during periods of heavy rainfall throughout the 
construction 
period of the project.
 
5.1.4 Nuisance Conditions during Construction  
During construction, there are several activities which if not controlled may inconvenience 
people in the site neighborhood.  Anticipated impacts in this case include interference on 
traffic, limited access to some roads in the vicinity when installing pipelines. Also there would 
be dust and noise generated from operation and circulation of heavy vehicles and equipment.  
Temporary disruption to water supply and sewage services may also occur if water mains and 
sewers are severed during site preparation. 
 
Mitigation: 
Page  33
AWE Engineers 
www.awe-engineers.com
 
Records & Archives Center EIS, 2005 
-
22
-
a) 
Access roads and exposed ground should be regularly sprayed with water in a 
manner and at frequencies that effectively suppress dust. 
b) 
Stockpiles of fine materials should be wetted or covered with tarpaulin during 
windy conditions. 
c) 
Workers on the site should be issued with dust masks where necessary. 
d)  
Construction activities should always be undertaken during daytime. 
e) 
Traffic guides and signs should be provided by the contractor through out the 
construction period. 
5.1.5 Construction Noise 
The use of heavy equipment during site clearing and construction works will inevitably 
generate noise. Although annoying, this negative impact will be short-term (limited to 
construction phase) and will not pose a threat to health or well being of humans. 
 
Mitigation: 
a) 
Construction activities that will generate disturbing sounds should be restricted 
to normal daytime working hours. 
b) 
Immediate neighbouring buildings should be given notice of intended noisy 
activities so as to reduce degree of any annoyance that would have arisen. 
c) 
Workers operating equipment that generate noise should be equipped with 
noise protection gear. Workers operating equipment generating noise levels 
greater than 80 dBA continuously for 8 hours or more should use earmuffs. 
Workers exposed to prolonged noise of 70 – 80 dBA should wear earplugs. 
d) 
Silencers for equipment should be monitored to ensure they are operational.  
5.1.6 Sourcing of Earth Materials 
Earth materials needed for construction (e.g. murram, sand) are normally obtained 
from quarry and mining operations. Conscious or unwitting purchase of these 
materials from unlicensed quarries indirectly promotes environmental degradation 
and causes medium to long-term negative impacts. Obtaining materials from legally 
Page  34
AWE Engineers 
www.awe-engineers.com
 
Records & Archives Center EIS, 2005 
-
23
-
operating quarries would provide income to operators of sand and stone quarries, 
which is a positive but short-term impact.  
 
Mitigation:  
Earth materials must be obtained from licensed and approved quarries. 
5.1.7 Transportation of Materials  
Various materials required for construction and building (e.g. steel, blocks, lumber, gravel, 
asphalt) will be obtained from distant sources and transported to site. Transporting these 
materials, typically in over-laden and sometimes uncovered trucks, usually results in undue 
road wear-and-tear and negative environmental or socio-economic impacts. In the case of 
fine earth materials and crushed stones (aggregate), dusting and spillages occur on roadways 
between source and site. Dusting degrades local air quality and material spills, especially of 
aggregate, worsen driving conditions or increase the risk of road accidents. These represent 
indirect, short-term, reversible, negative impacts on public health and safety. 
 
Mitigation
:
a) All fine earth materials must be covered during transportation to prevent spillage 
and dusting. Trucks used for that purpose should be fitted with tailgates that close 
properly and with tarpaulins to cover materials. The cleanup of spilled earth and 
construction material on the main roads should be the responsibility of the Contractor 
and should be done in a timely manner (say within 2 hours) so as not to inconvenience 
or endanger other road users. These requirements should be included as clauses in 
contracts made with contractor and sub-contractors. 
b) If construction machinery is fuelled on site, transportation of lubricants and fuel to 
the construction site should only be done in appropriate containers such as sealed 
drums.  
Page  35
AWE Engineers 
www.awe-engineers.com
 
Records & Archives Center EIS, 2005 
-
24
-
c) As far as possible, transport of construction materials should be scheduled for off-
peak traffic hours. This will reduce risk of traffic congestion and of road accidents on 
roads adjacent to the site. 
d) Appropriate warning signs, informing traffic of entrances and exists to the 
construction and instructing drivers to reduce speed, should be placed along both 
Lourdel Road and Yusuf Lule Road. 
e) Flagmen should be employed to control traffic and guide construction vehicles as 
they enter and exit the project site. 
5.1.8 Material Storage 
The improper siting of stockpiles and storage of sand, gravel or cement at the construction 
site could lead to fine materials being washed away during heavy rains, into the drainage 
system. This would not only represent a waste of materials but also contribute to turbidity 
and sedimentation of stormwater. Hazardous and flammable materials (e.g. paints, thinner, 
solvents, etc.) improperly stored and handled on site are potential health hazards for 
construction workers. Spilled chemicals would have potential to contaminate soil and inhibit 
plant growth during landscaping.  
 
Mitigation: 
a) Stockpiling of construction materials should be properly controlled and managed. 
Fine-grained materials (sand, murram, etc.) should be stockpiled away from surface 
drainage channels. 
b) Low berms should be placed around the piles and/or tarpaulin used to cover open 
piles of stored materials to prevent them from being washed away during rainfall.

-
c) Safe storage areas should be identified and retaining structures put in place prior 
to the arrival and placement of granular construction materials. 
d) Hazardous chemicals (e.g. fuels, oil paints) should be properly stored in 
appropriate containers and safely locked away. Conspicuous warning signs (e.g. ‘NO 
SMOKING’ or “DANDER”) should also be posted around storage areas of any hazardous 
or flammable materials. 
5.1.9 Modification of Surface Drainage 
The impervious surface created by the covered building area will be about 20% of the site 
area. To this add the paved surfaces and it becomes apparent that the site will generate 
considerable volumes of runoff during periods of prolonged rainfall.  
 
Mitigation:    
Appropriate design and construction of an adequate stormwater drainage system for 
the facility. 
5.1.10 Construction Waste Disposal 
Solid waste generated during site preparation and construction work would include cut 
vegetation and typical construction waste (e.g. wasted concrete, steel, wooden scaffolding 
and forms, cement bags and demolition waste). This waste would negatively impact the site 
and surrounding environment if not properly managed and disposed of. 
 
Cleared vegetation or trees when burnt on site would generate smoke, negatively impacting 
ambient air quality. Vegetation and solid waste, if allowed to accumulate in drains could 
cause localised pooling and flooding. Pooling of water, in turn, would create conditions 
conducive to the breeding of mosquitoes. Poor construction waste management constitutes a 
short-term but reversible negative impact. 
 
Mitigation: 
Page  37

Records & Archives Center EIS, 2005 
-
26
-
a) A site waste management plan should be prepared by the contractor prior to 
commencement of construction. This should include designation of appropriate waste 
storage areas, collection and removal schedules, identification of approved disposal 
site and a system for supervision and monitoring. Preparation and implementation of 
the plan must be a responsibility of the building contractor who can be independently 
monitored by the client’s site agent. 
b) Special attention should be given to minimizing and reducing quantities of solid 
waste produced. 
c) Vegetation and combustible construction waste must not be burnt on site. 
d) Un-reusable construction waste, such as damaged pipes, formwork and other 
construction material, must be disposed of at KCC’s approved landfill. 
5.1.11 Night Soil and Litter Management 
Inadequate provision of toilets for use by workers can lead to ad hoc urination or in extreme 
cases defecation on the site, creating of unsanitary conditions and sources of fly infestation. 
 
Mitigation: 
a) Provide mobile or chemical toilets for use by construction workers. 
b) Disposal of waste in Kitante Channel should be discouraged. 
c) Proper solid waste collection and storage containers should be provided in 
sufficient numbers, to prevent littering on site. 
d) Arrangements should be made for regular collection of litter and its disposal at a 
designated landfill.

5.1.12 Replanting Trees and Landscaping 
Landscaping and replanting of trees should be carried out to enhance ecology and site 
aesthetics. In addition to enhancing aesthetics of the project site, landscaping provides the 
means for partially restoring the site's natural elements and ecological habitats. It is 
therefore a significant mitigation activity with a positive, long-term impact. 
 
Mitigation:  
A
good landscaping plan should seek to avoid the use of non-native and 
potentially invasive species. It should include low-maintenance, local 
species and the types of trees and shrubs used for feeding by local bird 
species. Landscaping should seek to encourage bird life, maximize shade 
and windbreak effect, as well as to lessen intrusiveness of the facility’s 
buildings. 
5.1.13 Employment  
At this stage it is not possible to accurately determine the number of construction workers to 
be employed on the site but it is estimated that this number would be up to 150 persons. This 
temporary employment opportunity would have a positive impact on incomes of hired 
construction workers.  
 
Mitigation:  
None 
5.1.14 Inadequate OHS for Construction Workers 
Construction operations have potential to inflict body injuries and accidents to workers. An 
example of a potential accident is when construction workers fall off scaffoldings or roof of a 
building. This impact is reversible if caution and personal protection gear is provided to 
workers exposed to construction risks. 
 
Mitigation:  
Provide adequate protection gear to workers such as hard hats, boots, 
gloves, welding goggles to welders and safety latches to workers working 
higher than 2 meters off ground level.

5.1.15 Construction Over Existing NWSC Infrastructure 
There is an existing main sewer running across the plot from Lourdel Road to Yusuf Lule road. 
Another combined sewer runs along Yusuf Lule road adjacent to the proposed site. Infringing 
on the mandatory way of four meters from this infrastructure during construction would make 
it impossible for NWSC to undertake repairs or inspection when necessary. This would be a 
negative, long-term impact.  
 
Mitigation:
 
Seek advice of utility companies on exact location of infrastructure on or 
near the site.
 
5.2 Operation Phase Impacts 
5.2.1 Improved Efficiency in Records Storage and Access  
The facility will enhance efficiency in storage and management of records and archives, 
ensuring their preservation, longevity and safety. This would represent a positive and long-
term impact. The facility will provide a safe repository for cultural, historical, legal, 
economic and scientific records for the next 25 years. Records provide a retrospective basis 
for consistency and reliability in planning and decision-making. Its convenient location will 
enables centralized access to records by educational institutions, business community, 
general public and government agencies. 
 
Mitigation:
 
None
 
5.2.2 Water Supply 
The facility intends to obtain water form existing NWSC mains. This would generate additional 
revenue for NWSC, a positive, long-term and irreversible impact. 
 
Mitigation:
 
None

-
5.2.3 Sewage Disposal 
Sewage generated by facility would be discharged into NWSC Bugolobi Sewage Treatment 
Plant through an existing sewer. This would generate additional revenue, which is a long-
term, positive economic benefit to NWSC. 
 
Mitigation:
 
None 
5.2.5 Solid Waste Disposal 
Poor garbage management at the facility would lead to unsanitary conditions especially 
vermin infestation. Rat infestation would be a major threat to longevity of stored records. 
Onsite incineration of office waste such as paper poses an air pollution impact when 
improperly done. 
 
Mitigation: 
a) Ensure regular collection of garbage by a licensed solid waste disposing firm. 
b) Ensure waste is properly stored on site before collection and final disposal. 
c) Operate onsite incinerator according to manufacturer’s specifications and 
guidelines. 
d) Regularly service the incinerator to ensure high performance efficiency. 
5.2.6 Consumption of Electricity 
Umeme
 will supply power for the development site from the existing mains running along 
Yusuf Lule Road or Lourdel Road.  It is expected that power demand of the facility can be 
adequately handled by the supply. The project would therefore not cause any supply 
shortages to the power supply system. Readily available power could mean inefficient 
electricity consumption at the facility and Umeme would realize higher revenues from this

-
situation.  On the other hand, inefficient consumption would not only be a negative financial 
impact for the facility but also for the utility company (Umeme).  
 
Mitigation:  
Mitigation measures relate to incorporating and improving energy 
management and conservation practices at the facility, such as;- 
a) Sub-meters and real-time energy monitoring equipment, light timer, thermostats, 
etc. should be installed throughout the facility to ensure efficient power 
consumption. 
b) Install translucent shades and fluorescent lighting. 
5.2.7 Standby Electricity Generator 
The facility will maintain a stand-by generator to supply electricity in case of power outages. 
This implies the generation of noise, vibrations as well as the risk of hydrocarbon spills. 
 
Mitigation:  
Generator house should be located where the effect of noise on the 
facility is minimal.  In addition, the generator needs to be soundproofed 
to reduce offsite noise pollution for the nearest receptors (neighboring 
buildings).  
Generator servicing should be contracted out to professional firms. 
5.2.8 Impact on Public Road through the Site  
There is a short public road cutting across the southeastern part of the site connecting 
Lourdel Road and Yusuf Lule road. This road becomes critically important during off peak 
house when motorists from Nakasero, Buganda Road and Wandegeya use it to connect to 
Yusuf Lule Road. Closing this road during operation of the facility would pose a permanent 
inconvenience to traffic flow in the area.  
Page  42

In addition to the foregoing, the Ministry should agree with KCC on where and how to 
construct access roads leading to the site so as to avoid adverse negative impact on traffic 
plying Yusuf Lule Road, Lourdel Road and this (nameless) road.  
 
Mitigation:
 
a) Seek guidance from KCC on how the facility can to coexist with the road cutting across the  
southeastern part of the site. 
b) Constructing a pedestrian air bridge across the road is recommended rather than closing it  
off to the general public. 
5.2.9 Resource Consumption 
Without adequate investment in conservation practices, the facility will consume excessive 
quantities of electricity and water. For instance the simple mistakes of running air

conditioning (A/C) units when windows are open can lead to immense waste of electricity. 
This is environmentally undesirable and also financially burdensome to the facility. 
 
Mitigation:  
Take advantage of resource conservation technologies in the design and construction of the facility. 
Some of these are: 
INSIDE BUILDING 
Conservation measures 
1
A/C will switch off automatically once a window is opened. 
2
A/C self-adjusts to the minimum when no person is detected in 
the room. 
3
Widespread use of fluorescent bulbs. 
4
Lights that switch off automatically when there are no people 
inside a room. 
5
Water tank in toilet to use water saving device (3/6 liters) per 
flush. 
6
Low water discharge, “press down” faucets (taps) that cannot be 
left running. 
7
Use of biodegradable soaps in ablution rooms. 
FACILITY-WIDE  
MEASURES 
1
Use of environmental friendly (phosphate free) detergents in 
washrooms. 
2
All outdoor areas be provided with electronic switching devices to 
ensure that lights are turned off during daylight hours. 
3
Widespread use of low consumption (6/9 watts) fluorescent bulbs 
to save electricity. 
4
Ensure ozone friendly A/Cs and cooling machines are used. 
5.2.10  
Onsite Security 
Inadequate security at the facility would risk malicious damage to valuable or sensitive 
records.  
 
Mitigation: 
Employ full-time security services at the facility.

ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES 
 
The objective of analysis of alternatives presented here is aimed at identification of practical 
options that would eliminate adverse impacts of the proposed project. The analysis is based 
on two scenarios: the “no-action” option and undertaking the project as proposed in the EIS. 
 
6.1 “No- 
Action” 
Scenario 
 
The “no-action” option would eliminate opportunities and second order socio-economic 
benefits, which the proposed development would have created (see section 5.2), the major 
being efficient records storage and management and improved access to archives by users. 
Undeveloped, the site would remain a hideous spot in the midst of a prime urban area.  
 
6.2 “Action” 
Scenario  
The main benefit of the project lies in enabling efficient records storage, management and 
improved access to archives by users. The facility will provide a safe repository for cultural, 
historical, legal, economic and scientific records for the next 25 years. Records provide a 
retrospective basis for consistency and reliability in planning and decision-making. Its 
convenient location enables centralized access to records by educational institutions, 
business community, general public and government agencies. In addition, project 
development would improve aesthetics and socio-economic value of the site.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN 
 
Monitoring is necessary to avoid negative effects during construction and operation of the 
proposed facility and achieve sustained environmental compliance. Table 5 details the 
recommended environmental monitoring plan (EMP). 
 
In Table 5, the proposed timeframe for monitoring every environmental issue or impact is 
given in the same cell as the proposed individual to collect monitoring information. The 
estimated cost (for both the monitoring process and corrective measures) is given in the same 
cell as the proposed method/tool (s) to be used. However, since most of the mitigation 
measures are to be executed during the construction phase, the contractor will have to build 
the exact cost estimates in the financial proposal. The proposed action to be undertaken 
during the monitoring is given in the same cell as who is responsible for undertaking the 
monitoring and corrective measures.

CONCLUSION 
 
The proposed facility will enable efficient records storage, management and improved 
access to archives by users. The facility will provide a safe repository for cultural, 
historical, legal, economic and scientific records for the next 25 years. Records 
provide a retrospective basis for consistency and reliability in planning and decision-
making. Its convenient location enables centralized access to records by educational 
institutions, business community, general public and government agencies. In addition, 
project development would improve aesthetics and socio-economic value of the site. 
 
Impacts associated with project development are insignificant primarily because the 
site already has good access roads, utilities and infrastructure services such as refuse 
collection. All negative impacts of the project, which include irreversible 
displacement of families currently residing on the site, loss of trees during 
construction, noise impact from onsite standby electricity generator, fire risks are all 
remediable when proposed mitigation measures and EMP are implemented. Prior to 
construction, the developer should seek guidance from all utility companies on precise 
location of any facilities for which way leaves must be observed. The contractor 
should seek guidance about location of subsurface public infrastructure to avoid 
severance, public inconvenience and financial loss. 
 
Inadequate OHS of construction workforce, improper supervision and use of 
substandard materials are major impacts that the developer should avoid. A recent 
spate of collapsing buildings is principally attributed to these causes. The 
consequences are litigation, loss of life, construction time and financial resources. 
 
All potential adverse impacts of the proposed project can be mitigated as shown under 
corresponding sections in Chapter 5. When mitigation actions and environmental 
monitoring plan are implemented, the project would have less adverse environmental 
effects than significant positive socio-economic benefits.

We operate in a road reserve, which therefore belongs to 
Kampala City Council. Under the arrangement we have with 
KCC, we should always maintain clean, the surroundings of 
our work areas.

Present: 
Harriet Mujuni, Lawyer/Sociologist  
(AWE Environmental Engineers) 
Responses to Issues raised by consultant (quoted verbatim): 
 
1.
On the 
expected 
impact of the 
project: 
·
Development of the documentation center is a good idea 
although like other major developments and changes in 
landuse, the project will lead to some inevitable impacts e.g 
issues of traffic flow and parking along the roads adjacent to 
the site.  The developer has duty to ensure minimal traffic 
interference around the site. 
 
·
During construction, the contractor has to ensure that the 
regulations governing urban structures are followed 
(implemented). 
2
On suitability 
of site for the 
proposed 
development 
·
The small piece of land south of the road joining Lourdel 
Road and Yusuf Lule Road should not be developed at all 
because the Town and Country Planning Board resolved to 
preserve it as an open space.   
 
·
In addition, there are several underground utilities within 
that space thus it would not be viable to develop that plot.  
 
·
Moreover building over that small plot has potential to turn 
that area into an accident blackspot when motorists on Yusuf 
Lule Road or Lourdel Road lack visibility of traffic flow on 
either road.

meeting:
 
To obtain KCC’s concerns about the proposed project and its 
recommendations. 
Date held & place:

Present: 
Harriet Mujuni, Lawyer/Sociologist  
(AWE Environmental Engineers) 
Responses to Issues raised by consultant (quoted verbatim): 
 
1.
On the 
expected 
impact of the 
project: 
·
KCC has already granted the developer permission to put up 
a
chain link fence around the site in preparation for 
construction works but observing the road reserves. 
 
·
The developer should acquire titles for proposed plots from 
Uganda Land Commission as evidence of ownership. 
 
·
Permission has to be sought from utility bodies to either 
relocate their underground infrastructure if at all they exist 
bearing in mind that the cost of relocating utility lines is 
borne by the developer. 
2
On how project 
could impact 
traffic safety 
on adjacent 
roads 
There is need to put up traffic signs on all adjacent roads to 
warn motorists about on-going construction works. 
3
On suitability 
of site for the 
proposed 
development 
Nakasero (the proposed project site) is part of the extended 
central business district and the designated use is office/limited 
commercial. So the proposed development properly conforms to 
the area’s landuse zoning.

Responses to Issues raised by consultant (quoted verbatim): 
 
On the 
expected 
impact of the 
project: 
The MTN fibre optic cable does not extend to the proposed site 
currently. However, since MTN is continually extending its fiber 
optic coverage, it would be prudent for a contractor to seek 
advice of the utility company before commencement of works 
because there may be changes in coverage at the time when 
construction commences.

Responses to Issues raised by consultant (quoted verbatim): 
 
On the 
expected 
impact of the 
project: 
·
Any development in the plot adjacent to the Heifer project 
is not feasible because any construction in that area would 
affect/obscure visibility of motorists. 
 
·
The scenic beauty of the place would be affected. 
 
Therefore only the larger plot should be developed and the 
smaller one (across the road) left intact.

Appendix 2: 
Biological (Faunal and Flora) Assessment   
ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AT THE PROPOSED SITE OF 
THE RECORDS & ARCHIVES CENTER 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
The proposed site is an already human impacted habitat in the middle of Kampala 
district. This would therefore imply that very little of it still survives as a pristine 
natural environment with very much significance for conservation of biological 
diversity. Evidently, the proposed development site was much more wooded than it is 
today. Nonetheless the site has a considerable stand of trees lining the roads 
surrounding it. The tree cover could have some significance for survival of urban fauna 
and some flora. Currently on the site exist seven residential houses while large 
portions of un built areas are under cultivation subsistence crops.  
 
The biological environment described in this report is based on the two taxa: birds and 
plants and was conducted following methodology described below. 
 
2.0 METHODOLOGY 
2.1 Vegetation 
 
The aim of biological assessment was to establish floristic composition of this site in 
light of proposed development and prescribe conservation measures for any identified 
species that are of special conservation significance. This involved carrying out an 
inventory of plant species and assessing their abundance, distribution and diversity.  
 
2.1.1 Species enumeration 
 
All trees were identified and recorded. Shrubs and common herbaceous plants were 
also recorded with their respective abundance using the DAFOR scale. Plants that 
could not be identified in the field were brought to the Makerere University Herbarium 
(MHU) for precise identification. Nomenclature followed Polhill 
et al.
 (1954).

2.2 Birds 
 
Given the size and nature of the environment on proposed project site, birds were 
surveyed using the point count method as described by Pomeroy (1992). The point 
count consists of standing at a particular point for a fixed time and recording all birds 
seen or heard within a fixed radius. It assumes that all birds present in the desired 
radius will be detected and recorded. Identifications of the birds were based on 
Williams & Allot (1980). 
 
3.0  
RESULTS OF THE BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
3.1 Plant 
species 
 
A
total of 31 species belonging to 17 plant families were recorded (Table A2-2). 
Commonest tree species on site were 
Cedrella
 sp. and 
Cassia spectabilis
.
Others 
included 
Jacaranda mimosifloia, Cuppressus 
sp
 
and
 Markhamia lutea
.
Plant 
composition at the site suggests past human activity. This is evidenced by presence of 
many ornamental species such as 
Jacaranda mimosifolia
 and fruit trees such as 
Carica 
papaya
.
The presence of gardens of maize, sweet potatoes and cassava are also signs 
of habitation and human influence on floral composition.  
 
None of plant species found at the site are of conservation significance (Katende et al. 
1995; Eggeling & Dale, 1952; Langdale-Brown et al., 1964). 
 
3.2 Birds 
 
Birds recorded at the proposed site comprised a total of 19 species (Table A2-1). The 
large majority of these birds are not dependent on a close stand of trees as would be 
found in a forest.  None of the species recorded at the site could be considered to be 
of conservation significance. Birds recorded at the site are given in table below.

4.0 
POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
The proposed development site is already a human-impacted area but it has 
maintained some refuge to fauna and flora until now. The negative though not major 
impacts that were identified, include: - 
 
i) 
The development will result in habitat loss for both plants and animals and loss 
of foraging grounds for the birds that have depended on this area until now. 
 
Mitigation:  
Preserve exiting mature trees to the greatest extent possible. 
Landscaping should ensure replacement of felled trees.  
ii) 
If the large trees get felled there will be a loss of roosting and nesting locations 
for bird those species that were using these trees. 
 
Mitigation:  
Same as in i)
 
above. 
Overall, given the nature of property to be developed there is no major negative 
impact on biodiversity that would result from the development.
