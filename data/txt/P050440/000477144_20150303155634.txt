the Recipient's efforts to: (a) improve and make its public service delivery affordable,
efficient, accountable, and effective in use of public resources; and (b) improve the policy,
institutional, and regulatory environment of its public service delivery institutions for
sustainable economic growth.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country, Macroeconomic, and Sector Background:

1.      Uganda had achieved remarkable economic progress with GDP growing at an
average rate of 6.9 percent during the 1990s and 5.5 percent during the early 2000s. Over
this period, solid macroeconomic management including fiscal discipline and effective
monetary policies helped to facilitate Uganda’s economic performance, which had a
positive effect on poverty reduction. The proportion of the population living below the
poverty line declined from about 56 percent in 1992 to 38 percent in 2003; the net primary
education enrollment ratio rose to over 86 percent in 2005; the under-5 child mortality rate
declined from 177 (per 1,000 live births) in 1990 to 155 in 2005; access to safe water
improved from 45 percent to 55 percent in rural areas and to 65 percent in urban areas; and
HIV prevalence dropped from 20 to 6.2 percent.

2.      Despite this progress in poverty reduction and human development, performance
in governance was not as impressive, with government effectiveness steadily declining
since 1998. According the World Bank Institute’s (WBI) governance indicators, Uganda
only improved in two out of six WBI indicators between 2000 and 2004, including voice
and accountability and control of corruption. In contrast, there were no changes with
respect to indicators for political stability and regulatory quality, and significant
deterioration was apparent with respect to government effectiveness and the rule of law.

3.     To address these governance challenges as well as to sustain economic growth and
poverty reduction, the Government set out a strategy under its 2004 - 2008 Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). Under the PEAP’s 4th pillar, public sector management
was identified as one of the key constraints to sustaining high rates of economic
development and poverty reduction. Accordingly, the Government developed a
comprehensive strategy to address challenges in public sector management through three
major initiatives, including (i) financial management and accountability reforms; (ii) a
decentralization and local government development program; and (iii) a Public Service
Reform Program (PSRP).

4.     While considerable progress was made with respect to the financial management
and accountability reforms as well as the decentralization and local government
development program, progress lagged on the first two phases of the PSRP. As a result, the
Government revamped the PSRP strategy in 2006 and solicited the support of the World
Bank and other Development Partners (DPs) for its implementation. The objective of the
revamped PSRP was to develop an affordable, efficient, and accountable public service
that would be used to steer rapid economic growth and poverty eradication. The revamped
PSRP targeted six specific areas, which had emerged as obstacles during the previous




                                             1
PSRPs 1 , including: (i) skills gaps and weak management; (ii) weak performance and
accountability; (iii) inefficient and over-extended government organizations; (iv) a
disenabling work environment; (v) poor pay; (vi) and sustained support for reform among
political and technocratic leadership. In parallel, the Government recognized a growing
need to address capacity and performance issues in the public sector as a whole, particularly
in the areas captured in the PEAP results-matrix and the associated Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) benchmarks.

5.      In response, the Bank prepared the Uganda Public Service Performance
Enhancement Project (UPSPEP) to support the implementation of the PSRP through a
basket funding arrangement with DFID, Irish Aid, and DANIDA. Implementation of the
PSRP was supported through a sector wide approach (SWAp), which had been adopted by
the Government as a way of planning and prioritizing interventions for different sectors
and guiding the budgeting process. In addition to supporting the implementation of the
PSRP, the UPSPEP project included, as its original second component, a Performance
Enhancement Facility (PEF), which was designed as the Bank’s response to provide a
flexible approach to improve performance in the context of the reforms identified through
the PEAP/PRSC dialogue.

Rationale for Bank Assistance:

6.      Over the years, the World Bank supported the implementation of Uganda’s PEAP
through PRSCs and sector development programs (SDPs). During the preparation and
monitoring of the PRSC the need for a complementary intervention to enhance public
sector capacity and performance to deliver quality services was flagged as a key area for
engagement. In the 2005 Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS), the predecessor
document to the 2010-2015 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the need for
comprehensive public service reforms was cited as one of the four key elements in DPs’
support for strengthening governance institutions. At the time of appraisal, reforms in this
area were viewed as critical for improving efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in
the use of public resources, improving service delivery, and reducing poverty. The Bank’s
international experience and global perspective in the areas of capacity development and,
more specifically, its technical expertise in public service reform was regarded by
government and donors as key to ensuring the quality and utility of policies, strategies, and
results in these areas.

Higher Level Objectives:

7.     As reflected in the 2005 World Bank Africa Action Plan (AAP), the World Bank
pledged support to countries undertaking public service reform, with a particular focus on
human resources management, and pay and incentive systems. In line with the results and
accountability agenda, the UPSPEP project was designed as the instrument for

operationalizing Bank support to public service and financial management reforms. In
addition, the UPSPEP project supported PRSC and Joint Budget Support Framework
(JBSF) policy triggers including key issues of pay reform, efficiency of government
spending and wage bill controls, and equity in the distribution of services around the
country. To achieve these triggers, the project prioritized the implementation of the IPPS,
review of the pay reform strategy, approval of a new public service strategy under the
transformation paper, development of a framework to support retention of staff in hard to
reach and hard to stay areas, and implementation of the ROM/OOB initiatives. For its part,
the second component (PEF and subsequent support to the refurbishment and
operationalization of a Civil Service College CSC)) was consistent with the Strategic
Framework for IDA’s Assistance to Africa (SFIA) and AAP, both of addressed the need to
develop instruments to build capacity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.       The original Project Development Objective (PDO) of the UPSPEP project was to
support the Recipient’s efforts to: (a) improve and make its public service delivery
affordable, efficient, accountable, and effective in use of public resources; and (b) improve
the policy, institutional, and regulatory environment of its public service delivery
institutions for sustainable economic growth.2

9.    The UPSPEP project had 18 original indicators in the PAD to measure the progress
on PDO and intermediate outputs:

Project Development Objective (PDO) Indicators:

       Percentage satisfaction with public service delivery.
       Percentage of MDAs and LGs that report full achievement of their annual
        performance (ROM) targets as verified through inspectorates.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators:

       Component 1
           Percentage of Client Service Charters established
           Percentage of service standards in Client Charters which are met
           Percentage of MDAs and LGs where ROM is implemented
           Percentage of positions for internal promotion filled through open
             competition


2
  Since there were some minor semantic differences in the formulation of the Project Development
Objective (PDOs) between the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Results Framework, and Financing
Agreement, the text of the Financing Agreement will be used for the purposes of this ICR as it represents
the legal agreement between the Bank and Borrower.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
    and reasons/justification

10.     The project underwent a level one restructuring, which was approved by the Bank’s
Executive Directors on June 20, 2008. As per the re-stated financing agreement, the PDO
of the UPSPEP Project remained the same as in the original financing agreement. However,
as described in detail below, the scope of the second component (PEF) was reduced and
the results framework was adjusted to reflect new indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The primary beneficiaries 3 of the UPSPEP project were the Ministries,
Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Governments (LGs) who applied the
reforms in the delivery of their mandates and who benefited from capacity building
activities under the CSC. Secondary beneficiaries included the civil service staff and
citizens of Uganda that benefitted from enhanced service delivery arising from the
introduction of ROM (sub-component 1.1), better payroll management related to the
introduction of the IPPS (sub-component 1.2), efficiency and restructuring reforms related
to the rationalization and restructuring of public sector organizations (sub-component 1.3),
enhancement of work environment (sub-component 1.4), pay and pension reforms (sub-
component 1.5), and leadership and management development initiatives (sub-component
1.6).

1.5 Original Components

12.      The UPSPEP project originally comprised two components with a total IDA
allocation of US$70 million. The first component was designed to support the
implementation of the government’s Public Service Reform Program (PSRP) through a
sector-wide approach (SWAp) totaling US$31.5 million. The SWAp involved a pooled
funding arrangement or “basket” among IDA (US$15 million) and several Donor Partners
through a 2007 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which included DfID (US$10.5
million), Irish Aid ($4.2 million), and DANIDA (US$5.6 million). The second component
was designed to support a Performance Enhancement Facility (PEF) of US$55 million,
funded solely by IDA and intended to foster demand-driven performance enhancement
initiatives.

COMPONENT 1: Public Service Reform Program (PSRP):
(Total Cost at Appraisal: US$31.5 million of which US$15 million funded by IDA)

Sub-Component 1.1: Performance and Accountability (Total Cost: US$1.6 million)

13.    To enhance performance and accountability of the public service, sub-component
1.1 focused on the achievement of the following:

     Cultivating the commitment of top level political and technical leadership;
     Empowering and enabling MDAs and LGs to drive Results Oriented Management
      (ROM) in their respective organizations;
     Integrating ROM with planning and budgeting systems;

  While the PAD and Restructuring Project Paper did not explicitly identify UPSPEP beneficiaries, the
entities included in this section include those that can be logically extrapolated from the project’s
objectives.



                                                    5
   Strengthening the demand for performance and accountability; and
   Facilitating de-bureaucratization and enhancing client focus in service delivery.

Sub-Component 1.2: Human Resources Capacity (Total Cost: US$7.0 million)

14.   To address issues of performance, accountability, and appraisal of personnel, sub-
component 1.2 focused on the achievement of the following:

      Developing and institutionalizing a meritocratic system across the public service;
      Installing an Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS) closely linked to the
       Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS);
      Introducing a comprehensive approach to human resources development; and
      Launching a senior executive service in the medium- to long-term.

Sub-Component 1.3: Efficiency and Restructuring (Total Cost: US$1.1 million)

15.      To improve public service efficiency and support government restructuring
efforts, sub-component 1.3 focused on the achievement of the following:

      Reviewing roles and functions across government;
      Rationalizing and restructuring public sector organizations; and
      Providing for efficient deployment of personnel.

Sub-Component 1.4: Work Environment (Total Cost: US$19.3 million)

16.    To enhance the work environment in the public service, sub-component 1.4
focused on the achievement of the following:

      Developing policies on crosscutting issues to enhance work environment;
      Making demand-driven improvements to the work environment; and
      Improving records management and decongestion of registries through the
       establishment of a National Records Center and Archives (NRCA).

Sub-Component 1.5: Pay and Pension Reforms (Total Cost: US$0.3 million)

17.    To support pay and pension reforms, sub-component 1.5 focused on the
achievement of the following:

      Developing a comprehensive public service pay policy;
      Designing a strategy for the new pay scheme and the funding of current arrears;
      Conducting job evaluations for the public service;
      Monitoring the progress and impact of pay reform;
      Developing and implementing a framework for the advancement and retention of
       staff in hard-to-reach areas;
      Reviewing pension legislation and its administrative framework; and


                                            6
      Verifying pension arrears and developing a strategy for clearing arrears.

Sub-Component 1.6: Leadership and Management Development (Total Cost: US$2.2
million)

18.   To support the overall PSRP reform and to improve policy making capacity, sub-
component 1.6 focused on the achievement of the following:

      Conducting awareness and sensitization sessions to reinforce and sustain political
       and stakeholder support for the PSRP;
      Strengthening the government’s policy-making capacity; and
      Implanting the capacity for managing change within the public service.

COMPONENT 2: Performance Enhancement Facility (PEF)
(Total Cost at Appraisal: US$55 million of which US$55 million funded by IDA)

19.     The original second component of the UPSPEP project was designed to create a
Performance Enhancement Facility (PEF), which would support a flexible, comprehensive,
and programmatic approach for performance enhancement of public sector organizations.
The overriding aim of the PEF was to help MDAs meet performance targets and attain the
service delivery objectives that underpin the national strategies for economic performance
and poverty reduction as documented in the PEAP. At appraisal, potential PEF projects
included: (i) Support to Statistical Capacity Development (US$10 million); (ii) Support to
Procurement Reforms (US$20 million); and (iii) Support to Financial Sector Technical
Assistance Program (US$l7.4 million).

1.6 Revised Components

20.     After an 18 month effectiveness delay due to a lag in Parliamentary approval, the
UPSPEP project underwent a level one restructuring in order to better respond to
government’s need for capacity building. No changes were made to the first component,
but component two was redesigned to focus on core capacity building initiatives for which
the MoPS had direct responsibility. In particular, the PEF was dropped and new activities
and interventions were added that would: (i) establish a Civil Service College (CSC) to
provide a sustainable source of skilled workforce for the public service; (ii) provide
targeted training and research in strategic areas of the growth agenda; and (iii) equip public
service managers with more strategic skills to manage the public service.

Sub-component 2.1: Establishment of a Civil Service College (CSC) (US$6 Million)

21.    To provide targeted training for public officers, to support policy research and
reviews, and to encourage innovative ideas for enhanced performance in public service
delivery, subcomponent 2.1 focused on the achievement of the following:

      Upgrading existing CSC premises and equipping the facility as necessary;
      Operationalizing the CSC by developing a business plan and curriculum;


                                              7
          Strengthening policy research and engaging in twinning arrangements; and
          Creating and implementing innovative ideas to streamline government processes.

Sub-component 2.2: Strategic Capacity Development for the Transformation of
Uganda (US$2.0 Million)

22.   To support strategic capacity development to help boost industrialization and
economic growth, subcomponent 2.1 focused on the achievement of the following:

           Supporting training and research in strategic areas
           Bridging the existing gaps in leadership and management

1.7 Other Significant Changes

23.     In addition to the substantive changes to the second component, the restructuring
reduced the total credit amount from SDR 48.7 million (US$70 million equivalent) to SDR
14 million (US$23 million equivalent). This reduction pertained to solely to IDA resources
committed to the original second component (PEF), which at project appraisal was
allocated US$55 million, and not to the IDA resources committed to the first component
(PSRP), which remained the same at US$15million. As a result of the restructuring, the
revised second component (CSC) was reallocated US$8 million, which represented a total
cancellation of US$47 million, or nearly two thirds of the original credit amount. This
reduced resource envelope for capacity building activities under the second component
came as a response to the substantial delay in parliamentary approval given the
government’s desire to focus on more targeted capacity building activities which were
better related to its current development priorities. As such, the restructuring was adaptive
in nature, since it occurred before implementation began, and not as a result of the need to
correct poor performance or to opportunistically scale-up the intervention.

24.    Finally, the 2008 restructuring extended the closing date from June 30, 2011 to June
30, 2013. A second extension of the closing date from June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2014 was
subsequently approved in 2013 to allow for the completion of key activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis:

25.     The design of the UPSPEP project was informed by a large body of analytical work
produced by the Government of Uganda, the World Bank, and a variety of external think
tanks, consulting firms, and NGOs. Key analytical inputs included documents that
established the strategic framework for the UPSPEP program, including the Public Service
Reform Program Strategic Framework, the PSRP Annual Work Plan, the PSRP Operations
Manual, the Poverty Eradication Action Plan, as well as the 2005 Institutional Review of
the Ministry of Public Service. The project design also benefitted from funding from the


                                              8
Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant, which provided
resources to undertake the following studies in relation to challenges identified: “Skills
Gap Study in Public Service” (PWC, 2003), “Implications of HIV/AIDS on Public Service
Capacity and Performance” (MoPS, 2003), “Implications of Gender Issues on Capacity
Building and Performance in Public Service” (Kabonesa, 2003), “Study on Cost Efficiency
and Effectiveness in Human Resources Deployment in Social Sectors (PWC, 2003), and
“Leadership and Management Development Needs for Top and Senior Management
Study” (Crown Agents, 2003). Background analysis on implementation arrangements
included the “IEC Strategy for Capacity and Performance Enhancement Program,” the
“Report of the Monitoring and Evaluation Study for the Capacity and Performance
Enhancement Program,” as well as the World Bank’s Procurement Capacity Assessment
Report (2006) and the Financial Management Assessment Report (2006).

26.     Drawing on this large analytical foundation, the design of the UPSPEP project also
reflected lessons learned from the Ugandan domestic context, as well as from similar
operations across the region. First, previous Bank experience suggested that a
programmatic approach fosters more ownership and greater coordination. Accordingly,
UPSPEP provided support to the PSRP through a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp)
arrangement that defined public sector priorities and budget needs for both Government
and donor resources. Secondly, to avoid the potential of a Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) draining the public service of its best human resources, the implementation of
UPSPEP components was mainstreamed in the work plans of the MoPS, which eliminated
the need for a separate PIU. Third, since it can take decades to assess the impact of a public
service reform program and its associated capacity-development activities, UPSPEP was
designed to use the M&E system of the PSRP to track outputs and outcomes from the outset
in order to provide another avenue to assess the progress of public service reforms. Finally,
since low salaries persisted as a pervasive constraint to increasing public service
productivity and effectiveness, a pay reform component was fully integrated into the PSRP.

Assessment of the Project Design:

27.      The PDO of the UPSPEP focused on outcomes for which the project’s activities
and components could be reasonably attributable. In particular, the intention of the PDO
was to respond to the overall PSRP agenda, which the Bank supported together with other
partners. As such, the PDO contained seven constitutive elements to which the various sub-
components of the UPSPEP project were aligned, namely, to improve the (i) affordability,
(ii) efficiency, (iii) accountability, and (iv) effectiveness in the use of public resources, as
well as to improve the (v) policy, (vi) institutional, and (vii) regulatory environment of
Uganda’s public service institutions. Table 2 demonstrates the link between the PDO’s
constitutive objectives and the project’s various sub-components and indicators.

28.     While the components and activities of the UPSPEP project were appropriately
tailored to the achievement of the PDO, the overall complexity of the project design—both
in terms of the scope of components and the number of indicators—was highly ambitious.
Since many of the project activities were second generation governance reforms, which
focused on the implementation of key systems (e.g. ROM, IPPS, etc.), implementation was
inherently more complex than earlier PSRP reforms, which focused on retrenchment and
downsizing of the public service. Given the limited capacity of the Ministry of Public
Service, which functioned as the key implementation and coordination agency of the
project, a more selective project design may have been more appropriate.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment:

29.     The commitment of the government at the preparation and approval stage was
adequate despite initial some challenges. After an 18 month effectiveness delay, caused by
Parliament’s reticence to approve what was perceived to be a large-scale capacity building
project, the President of Uganda wrote to the World Bank to emphasize the importance of
the UPSPEP project to help the government strengthen its public service. Subsequently,
the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) worked with the
Bank to retroactively extend the effectiveness deadline and restructure the project. In
addition, a Public Sector Working Group was established in 2007 to coordinate technical
working groups and share information with all donor partners.



                                                              11
30.     The project was prepared through a fully consultative process which ensured the
effective participation of all the government stakeholders, including the Ministry of Health,
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Labor, Gender and Social
Development, as well as the judiciary, various service commissions, the Office of the Prime
Minister, and the Cabinet Secretariat under the Office the President. For safeguard related
issues, extensive consultations were undertaken by the Bank, Ministry of Public Service
(MoPS), National Environment Authority, as well as citizens affected by the construction
of the NRCA and CSC.

Assessment of Risks:

31.     During the preparation and design process, a number of risks were assessed,
including: (i) continued commitment and support of top political leadership; (ii) potential
resistance from public service leaders and managers toward results-orientation,
accountability, and integrity in resource management and service delivery; (iii) limited
technical capacity of MoPS and MDAs to implement UPSPEP; (iv) potential capture of
the basket fund for the PSRP and component two by narrow interests; (v) complexity with
respect to disbursement and funds flow arrangements for the PSRP component given the
multiple donors involved; and (vi) potential of below market pay and a poor working
environment which might demotivate personnel.

32.      To address these risks, the project design incorporated a number of mitigation
measures which included: (i) the preparation of a change management strategy to kick start
the implementation of UPSPEP; (ii) the completion of an institutional review of the MoPS
structure and functions in order to put in place the optimal structure to implement the PSRP;
(iii) the conducting of audits to ensure full compliance with the procedures and controls in
the operations manuals for the PSRP; (iv) involvement of the Bank’s country Financial
Management (FM) specialist to streamline the disbursement and funds flow arrangements;
and (v) policy dialogue on the PSRP/PEAP to accelerate pay and pension reforms. At the
appraisal stage, these mitigation measures were deemed adequate to address the identified
risks.

2.2 Implementation

33.     Following the project preparation process described above, the IDA Board
approved UPSPEP on June 20, 2006, and the Government of Uganda (GoU) signed the
Financing Agreement on December 18, 2006. However, there was a considerable delay in
the project becoming effective as Ugandan law required Parliamentary approval for all
government external borrowing on a loan-by-loan basis. At this time, there were several
other Bank projects pending Parliamentary approval, some of which were delayed by more
than 16 months in becoming effective. Despite the creation of detailed Information,
Education, and Communications (IEC) strategy to raise government and stakeholder
awareness during the project preparation stage, limited implementation of the strategy
resulted in a lack of visibility and understanding of the project’s activities and scope, which
further delayed effectiveness.




                                              12
34.     As a result, the project effectiveness deadline was extended three times from April
17, to July 17, to October 16 and finally to December 20, 2007, due to delayed approval
by Parliament. In December 2007, the Parliamentary Committee on the National Economy
discussed and recommended that the project components be revisited to limit the capacity
building elements to those strategic areas that could be effectively monitored by the MoPS
and provided skills leading to a more strategic approach to managing the public service.
On April 21, 2008, the Bank approved the extension of the Effectiveness Deadline to
August 20, 2008, after which the project was restructured and approved by Parliament later
in the year.

35.    By the time the restructured UPSPEP project became effective in November 2008,
the Donor Partners (DfID, DANIDA, and Irish Aid) had been disbursing funds to the PRSP
(component one) under a basket (SWAp) arrangement for nearly two years, as per an MoU
signed in August 2007. As they prepared to exit the sector in July 2010, the basket fund
partners decided to front-load their contributions in the last two quarters of FY 10/11, and
released a total of $6.9 million during that period. As a result of this front loading, as well
as procurement delays for several large activities, IDA resources were largely crowded-
out. As of mid-2010 DfID, DANIDA, and Irish Aid has disbursed 100% of their committed
resources whereas only 20% of IDA resources were disbursed. At the same time, the MoPS
informed the Bank that a funding gap had emerged, and that the remaining funding under
the basket was not sufficient for the full implementation of the IPPS, National Records
Center and Archives (NRCA), and support for the implementation of other PRSP reforms.4

36.     The Bank team undertook a Mid-Term Review (MTR) in May 2011 to provide a
detailed assessment of the projects implementation to date. While the Bank noted that the
overall PDO was still relevant and achievable, the team noted that an extension of the
project completion timeframe would be needed as a result of implementation delays related
to the IPPS and NRCA, as well as delays in the construction of the CSC, since planning
and site selection did not start until after the project had already become effective. At that
point in time, the team suggested that the government seek a resolution to funding gap
issues through a possible additional financing operation.

37.     Following the 2011 MTR, project implementation slowed considerably due to
consistent delays over key procurement contracts, submission of financial management
reports, and overall poor management of the IPPS sub-component. In addition to these
issues, limited implementation of risk mitigation measures included in the project design -

  The largest item affected was roll out and implementation of the IPPS, which had a funding gap of $16.5
million as budgeting was done in 2002, whereas the project was not approved until 2006, and work only
commenced in 2010. As a result of the eight year period that elapsed between planning and
implementation, prices for hardware /software systems and civil works rose substantially, changes in
government organization resulted in an increased number of sites to be connected to the IPPS, and the cost
for technical consulting services substantially increased. In addition to the resource challenges for the IPPS,
a significant funding gap had also emerged with respect to the NRCA in the amount of $10.6 million,
largely due to the need to create electronic records as well as increasing costs of construction and building
materials, which were estimated to have increased some 15-20 percent per annum over the period.



                                                      13
such as implementing a change management strategy and hiring additional staff - resulted
in additional delays. For example, just two months before the restructured closing date of
June 2013, only 50% of project funds had been disbursed, the full rollout of IPPS to phase
one and two sites was not completed, and ground had not yet been broken on the
construction of the NRCA. As a result, the government requested a second extension of the
project closing date of 24 months to allow for the completion of all activities in the project
and thus to more fully achieve the PDO. However, given the poor performance of the
project to that date, and the declining ratings noted in successive ISRs, the Bank only
approved a 12 month extension until June 30, 2014.

38.     The project closed on June 30, 2014 with a final disbursement ratio of 95.78%. By
project closure, a number of activities were completed, including the adoption of ROM
across the public service, capturing the establishment wage bill in the IPPS system,
enhancing the capacity of the MoPS to implement the PSRP, and constructing a Civil
Service College. However, a considerable number of project activities remained
unfinished, most notably the IPPS system, which only had two out of eight modules
functioning; the completion of the NRCA, which has yet to be operationalized; and the
construction of phase two of the CSC campus. Prior to official project closure, the
government provided written confirmation to the Bank affirming its commitment to
complete these activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Overall M&E Rating: Unsatisfactory

M&E Design: Unsatisfactory

39.     A large number of indicators included in the project results framework, along with
complex monitoring arrangements, led to considerable challenges in data collection and
evaluation. Project indicators were chosen from among those included in the PSRP results
framework in order to track the progress of various components within the UPSPEP
project. While some of the indicators related well to the outcomes/outputs they were
tracking, relationships with the sub-component objectives for a number of intermediate
indicators were weak. After the restructuring, the project had a total of 20 indicators, two
at the PDO level and 18 at the intermediate level. Responsibility for collecting data was
highly decentralized with various departments within the MoPS tracking different
indicators, and external MDAs individually responsible for monitoring agency-specific
data. As a result of this complex M&E design—both in terms of the number of indicators
and the monitoring arrangements—a number of problems emerged which negatively
impacted M&E implementation and utilization.

M&E Implementation: Unsatisfactory

40.    In addition to flaws in M&E design, M&E arrangements were not effectively
executed throughout the project implementation period. In particular, the original M&E
arrangements were overly complex, and the Government underestimated the cost and effort



                                             14
required to conduct service delivery, client satisfaction, and other surveys. As a result, of
the two PDO level indicators identified in the PAD, only one was tracked during the
implementation of the project. Likewise, of the 16 intermediate indicators originally
identified in the PAD for component one (PRSP), only 3 were tracked on a regular basis.
For component two, the original intermediate indicator related to the PEF was replaced by
3 intermediate indicators related to the CSC, of which only 1 was monitored during
implementation.

M&E Utilization: Unsatisfactory

41.     Since data was not able to be collected for many of the indicators originally
contained in the PAD or formal restructuring documents, they were supplemented by an
additional two indicators collected in the ISRs. The replacement of these indicators was
not done through a formal restructuring, as it was felt that further revisions would
undermine the relationship with the government. Due to the effectiveness delay, the
indicators that were monitored—one PDO level indicator and six intermediate level
indicators—were not able to be tracked in the first six ISRs. Once the project became
effective in 2008, it was not until March 2011—nearly five years after the Board approval
of the original project—that any of the indicators showed results that could be quantified.
At project closure, a majority of the original results indicators had not been tracked
throughout the implementation period of the project, and as a result, the extent to which
appropriate M&E data was utilized to inform decision-making and resource allocation was
presumably low5.

2.3 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.     Based on the original components of the project at appraisal, the project was given
an environmental category rating of B (partial assessment). In the original project design,
the construction of the NCRA triggered two safeguards policies: Environmental
Assessment and Involuntary Resettlement. As the construction of the NRCA could have
had a potential impact in terms of traffic disruption, dust, and noise pollution, a site-specific
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was prepared, approved, and disclosed by the
World Bank and Government. In addition, since there were people currently living at the
site identified for the NCRA who had to be relocated, an abbreviated Resettlement and
Compensation Action Plan (RAP) was also developed by MoPS, approved by the World
Bank and Government, and submitted for public disclosure.

43.    The preparation of both documents was guided by consultations with key
stakeholders including the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), the
MoPS, residents at the identified site where the NRCA was planned, as well as the
construction company, and supervising consultant for the NRCA. The MoPS took the



5
  For the purposes of this ICR, data on a number of indicators was able to be collected ex post during the
ICR mission.



                                                     15
responsibility to ensure that all key stakeholders had access to the EIA and held meetings
with the people residing at the site to implement the recommendations of the RAP.

44.     Following the restructuring of the project, there was no change in the environmental
category, nor were any new safeguard policies triggered. However, an ESIA was prepared
and disclosed to cover the additional infrastructure activities related to the refurbishment
of the Civil Service College in Jinja. The existing facilities and the site were allocated to
the MoPS by Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries, and Fisheries (MAAIF) and
ownership of land was duly transferred. During the ICR mission, it was noted by the project
environmental and social specialists that no major safeguards issues arose during the
implementation of the project. Similarly, project financial management and procurement
specialists confirmed that there were no fiduciary issues related to procurement, financial
management, or disbursements, other than delays related to the production of Interim
Financial Reports (IFRs).

2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.     As of present, there is no formally approved post-completion or next phase
operation. The government has committed to finance the remainder of the construction and
subsequent operationalization of the NRCA. Furthermore, the Government has also
provided funding for implementation of phases 3, 4, and 5 of the IPPS as part of the broader
public financial management program, as well as support to CSC operations. As part of the
UPSPEP project, the government developed a transformation paper which outlines key
reforms that need to be sustained to ensure an effective and accountable public service that
is able to deliver on the National Development Plan (NDP). Accordingly, it is envisaged
that this will form the starting point for further reforms in the public sector. Presently, the
Bank is engaged in dialogue with the government in order to consider future support to the
service delivery agenda as part of a broader governance program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Overall Relevance Rating: Substantial

Relevance of Objectives: High

46.     UPSPEP’s objectives took into account the government of Uganda’s development
priorities both at the time of appraisal and at the time of the ICR assessment. As discussed
above, the project drew heavily on the 2002-2013 PEAP, which was the government’s
Poverty Reduction strategy; the PSRP, which was the key governance Sector Development
Plan (SDP); the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS), which was the country strategy
document developed by the Bank and Donor Partners; the ongoing PRSC 5-7 series; as
well as the recommendations from the 2005 World Bank Africa Action Plan (AAP) and
IDA’s Assistance to Africa (SFIA) strategy. At project closure, UPSPEP’s objectives
continue to be relevant with respect to the government’s NDP I (2011-2015), which



                                              16
prioritizes the strengthening of public sector management through building on the
achievements of the PRSP. These development priorities are consistent with the 2011-2015
CAS, and were reaffirmed in the 2013 CAS progress report, which prioritized a cross-
cutting theme aiming to strengthen accountability and improve public financial
management (PFM), public procurement, and public sector management at both local and
national levels. Finally, the objectives of the UPSPEP project continue to remain relevant
with respect to the Bank’s 2011 Africa Strategy, which places governance and public sector
capacity at its foundation.

Relevance of Design: Moderate

47.      As noted in the discussion on Quality at Entry, the project’s design was relevant to
its stated objectives and the various components were appropriately linked to the PDO (see
Table 2). However, while the design was relevant to the achievement of the PDO, it was
less relevant to the capacity context of the MoPS, which was charged with managing this
relatively ambitious reform project. As mentioned above, a lack of procurement capacity
in the MoPS led to significant delays in the procurement process and frequent reshuffling
of procurement staff undermined efforts to build capacity in Bank procurement procedures.
Likewise, financial management capacity was low, accounting systems were not
automated, and the quality of reporting was poor. These capacity challenges were
especially acute given the ambitious number of project sub-components and complex M&E
arrangements designed to cover a variety of reform areas, from HR management, to the
implementation of a complex pay and personnel system, to two large scale construction
projects. As a result, the complex nature of project design and the lack of implementing
capacity led to uneven implementation, as evidenced by a number of key activities not
being fully achieved by project closure.

Relevance of Implementation: Substantial

48.     The relevance of the UPSPEP project was maintained throughout the
implementation period, as the operation was responsive to changing needs. Given the 18
month effectiveness delay, the objectives of the government changed with respect to the
scope and extent of capacity building initiatives. During the design and appraisal phases,
the project was intended to target large scale capacity building through a US$ 55 million
Performance Enhancement Facility (PEF), which was intended to provide capacity
building initiatives to MDAs and LGs on a demand-driven basis. However, given the
Parliament’s reticence to approve a project that focused on such en masse capacity
building, as well as the changing development context, the scope of capacity building
activities was tailored to more selective interventions to improve key competencies of the
public service. Accordingly, through a level one project restructuring, the relevance of
implementation was maintained through a switch from large scale capacity development
under PEF to targeted training programs under the Civil Service College.




                                             17
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Efficacy Rating: Moderate

49.     The PDO of the UPSPEP project is to support the government “to improve and
make its public service delivery affordable, efficient, accountable, and effective in use of
public resources; and to improve the policy, institutional, and regulatory environment of
its public service delivery institutions for sustainable economic growth.” Formulated as
such, the achievement of the PDO can be measured through the achievement of its
constitutive objectives, namely the extent to which the various components of the UPSPEP
project improved and contributed to the (i) affordability, (ii) efficiency, (iii) accountability,
(iv) and effectiveness of the use of public resources, as well as the extent to which the
various components improved the (v) policy, (vi) institutional, and (vii) regulatory
environment of Uganda’s public service institutions.

50.     Table 3 highlights key achievements and shortcomings on an objective-by-
objective basis, and Annex 2 provides a detailed description of implementation of
activities, achievements of key outputs, and performance of PDO and intermediate
indicators with respect the project’s seven constituent objectives. Only six indicator targets
were met, eight were not met, and additional six indicators were indeterminate as they were
not tracked during implementation. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the PDO was fully
achieved. As a result, the overall efficacy of the UPSPEP project can only be considered
moderate.

                                                                18

3.3 Efficiency

Efficiency Rating: Moderate

51.      The costs involved in achieving the project’s development objectives appear to be
moderately efficient with respect to the benefits derived by the project. At the time of
project appraisal, no economic analysis was completed to determine Net-Present Value or
Economic Rate of Return estimates related to the project’s key areas of intervention. As a
result, it is not possible to recalculate efficiency estimates ex post and compare them to
anticipated returns at project appraisal. However, for the purposes of providing an estimate
of efficiency and value for money in this ICR, a number of key project outputs are worth
noting:

52.    As noted above, the introduction of ROM into 100% of MDA and LGs has resulted
in 72% of MDAs and LGs reporting full achievement of their annual performance targets.
At the same time, service standards have been explicitly enumerated through Client
Charters in a majority of MDAs, which have resulted in decreased waiting times, more
streamlined procedures, and reduced processing steps for certain services (e.g. passports,


                                                                19
vital records, and other government documents). In addition, OOB has in principle made
budging more efficient and performance reviews have enhanced the accountability of civil
servants.

53.     Through the implementation of the IPPS system the UPSPEP project has
contributed to enhancing the integrity of the payroll system, resulting in savings of 3.7
billion Ugandan Shillings (US$1.3 million equivalent) within the first three months of
decentralizing the payroll payment system. Likewise, due to the related payroll cleaning
and supervision activities, there has been a substantial reduction in the number of ghost
workers on the payroll. The discrepancy between staff paid through payroll versus actual
staff (as revealed through payroll inspections as audits), has been reduced from 15 to 5
percent over the life of the project. While the GoU was unable to provide details regarding
the 10% decrease in payroll discrepancies, Irish Aid estimates that payroll cleaning
exercises have resulted in the removal in approximately 9,000 ghost workers from the
government’s payroll, representing an annual savings of $10 million.

54.    In addition to the reduction of payroll discrepancies, the IPPS system has reduced
the time needed for Chief Accounting Officers (CAOs) to process the monthly payrolls;
improved the capacity to engage in forward budgetary and HR planning; eliminated the
need for paper pay statements; reduced the scope for fraudulent pay and pension claims;
improved staff transitions from payroll to pension systems; and ultimately resulted in the
more timely and accurate payment of civil servants.

55.     Based on the results of an independent study conducted by Adam Smith
International in 2012, it was found that the GoU could save approximately US$2.16 billion
by restructuring its MDAs and LGs in line with the report’s recommendations. Although
the recommendations have presently not been implemented in full due to funding
constraints, a number of “quick win” restructurings have taken place that have resulted in
the government recouping 25% of the estimated potential savings (intermediate indicator
6). In addition to formal restructuring, MDAs and LGs have benefitted from the innovation
activities of component two of the UPSPEP project, and have implemented
recommendations to make business processes more efficient.

56.      Finally, through the CSC, the government of Uganda will be able to more
efficiently and effectively train civil servants. While the construction of the CSC facilities
was ongoing, the MoPS developed a “caravan approach” whereby a mobile unit containing
all necessary instructional supplies (e.g. computers, speakers, chairs, tables, projection
screens, etc.,) traveled to various cities across the country, particularly to remote locations,
to offer core courses and trainings. This training delivery innovation has yielded significant
efficiencies as it has reduced cost of transport for participants by 97.5%, translating into
total training cost saving of 19%.

57.     Despite these potential and estimated efficiency gains, there are still areas of the
project that are not delivering their expected economic benefits. First, while the IPPS
system is yielding cost savings through better payroll management, the majority of HR
modules are not functional, which reduces the government’s ability to manage



                                              20
Recruitment, Leave, Pension, Career Planning, Performance Management, and Training.
Second, given that the NRCA has not been fully operationalized, the government is still
bearing the costs of an inefficient records storage and retrieval system, and many national
records continue to be lost and degraded. Third, since the government restructuring
program remains largely unfunded and unimplemented, there is a potential for the
government to benefit from greater cost savings by further rationalizing its structures.
Finally, although the CSC is fully operational at present, cost savings will not be realized
until phase two of the facilities are complete to include dining and boarding facilities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Overall Outcome Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Relevance: Substantial
Efficacy: Moderate
Efficiency: Moderate

58.     As noted above, the overall relevance of the UPSPEP project was Substantial. The
relevance of objectives was high, as they were closely related to the government’s
development priorities at appraisal, throughout implementation, and at project closing.
Although the project’s design provided a strong link between the project components and
the PDO, the relevance of project design was only moderate as it was overly ambitious and
did not sufficiently account for the capacity constraints of the implementing agency, which
contributed to significant delays and ultimately resulted in uneven implementation of
activities. Relevance of implementation was substantial as an adaptive restructuring early
in the life of the project ensured that it remained relevant to the government’s changing
priorities and needs.

59.     Based on the achievement of the PDO, and the performance of the PDO and
intermediate indicators, the overall efficacy of the UPSPEP project was Moderate. The
project had a number of notable achievements, including the completion of the CSC which
will leave a lasting impression on the Ugandan Civil Service, the improved performance
culture which was supported by ROM and OOB reforms, and improved payroll
management resulting from the implementation of the IPPS. At the same time, little
progress has been made on implementing other HR modules of the IPPS system; the
government has not made much progress with respect to pay, pension, and restructuring
reforms under the PRSP; and the National Records Centre and Archives risks becoming a
white elephant if it is not properly operationalized. In addition, poor M&E made it difficult
to decipher if the project has actually delivered the desired outcomes, as numerous
indicators were not tracked during the life of the project.

60.    The overall efficiency of the UPSPEP project was moderate. While efficiencies in
some project areas can be quantified, as with respect to improved payroll management, a
majority of the project’s efficiency gains must rely on qualitative estimates. For instance,
while the project has resulted in improved service delivery through ROM and OOB
approaches, the value of cost savings and benefit has not been systematically calculated.



                                             21
Likewise, while there are a number of project areas that have potential benefits through
costs savings and efficiency gains—including the full rollout of the IPPS system, the
construction of the NRCA and phase two of the CSC, and the implementation of the
government restructuring recommendations—incomplete implementation means that these
potential gains have not been currently realized.

61.    Given the ratings for Relevance (Substantial), Efficacy (Moderate), and Efficiency
(Moderate), the overall rating of the project is Moderately Unsatisfactory with respect to
IEG’s harmonized rating criteria.6

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.     While the UPSPEP project did not have a direct poverty impact, it did substantially
address gender and social issues within the context of the public service. As mentioned
above, efforts were taken to mainstream gender considerations into the recruitment and
retention policies of the civil service. Likewise, similar considerations were addressed with
respect to civil servants living with HIV/AIDS. As noted in detail above, the project
improved access to counseling and treatment by establishing HIV/AIDS focal points in
each MDA to anonymously provide support to civil servants.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.     Improving the country’s capacity and institutions was at the very core of this project
and these issues were individually addressed by the project’s two components. UPSPEP
support for the PRSP helped to strengthen institutions through its focus on results,
accountability, and efficiency in the public service. Through these reforms, MDAs and LGs
have been strengthened and their services delivery has improved through the introduction
of ROM and OOB approaches. Likewise, MDAs and LGs now have increased capacity to
monitor and manage payroll transactions, even though the related HR modules are yet to
come on line. With respect to its second component, UPSPEP’s support has helped to
rehabilitate and operationalize the Civil Service College, which will provide continued
support to developing capacity in the public service.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

64.     In addition to the outcomes and impacts noted above, the 2008 level one
restructuring of the UPSPEP project had a number of unintended consequences which
impacted overall outcomes both positively and negatively. A notable positive unintended


6
 Although the project underwent a level one, Board-approved restructuring, the PDO was not substantively
changed in the amended Financing Agreement. In addition, the project was restructured before it became
effective, and the only funds disbursed with $500,000 related to the Project Preparation Facility. After
consulting with IEG, it was determined that a split rating would not be required.



                                                  22
impact was the development of the “caravan” approach while the construction of the CSC
facilities was ongoing. This adaptation represents a true innovation as it was responsible
for the majority of trainings that took place during the life of the project. Even though the
Civil Service College campus has now since opened, the caravan approach will be retained
to provide relevant and cost efficient trainings for civil servants in hard to reach areas.

65.     While the effects of the restructuring of the second component had a positive impact
with respect to the development of the caravan approach, it had negative ramifications with
respect to the capacity of the MoPS to manage the project. The original design of the project
had envisaged an elaborate implementation structure for the original second component
(PEF), which called for an enhanced capacity building team in MoPS, which would have
been responsible for reviewing applications from various MDAs for funding. Under these
arrangements, the MoPS would have had many opportunities to interact with different
sectors while marketing and supervising the PEF, which would have also complemented
the dissemination of PSRP initiative. However, the removal of PEF component and
decrease in IDA resources reduced opportunities for MoPS to market the PSRP and
UPSPEP project as well as to coordinate with other MDAs and LGs.

66.     Aside from the unintended impacts surrounding the restructuring, the Bank
dialogue around public sector and financial management reforms benefitted from project
supervision missions and all triggers under the PRSC 7, 8 and 9 and the JBSF were
supported by the project. As noted, PRSC policy triggers included key issues of pay reform,
efficiency of Government spending and wage bill controls, and equity in the distribution
of services around the country. To achieve these triggers, the project supported the
implementation of the IPPS, review of the pay reform strategy, approval of a new public
service strategy under the public service transformation paper, development of a
framework to support retention of staff in hard to reach and hard to stay areas, and
implementation of the ROM/OOB initiatives.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

67.    As this was not an Intensive Learning ICR (ILI), no beneficiary surveys and/or
stakeholder workshops were conducted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Risk Rating: Substantial

68.     A first key challenge to the sustainability of the PDO is whether sufficient
government commitment will remain to support the reforms initiated under the UPSPEP
project. Elections in 2016 will likely bring new policies and legislation, so it remains to be
determined how relevant the reforms under the PRSP will continue to be to the
government’s post-election priorities. In particular, the restructuring of government
agencies, to the extent to which they occurred under sub-component 1.3, remains tenuous
as the newly created structures and agencies have not had sufficient time to stabilize.
Likewise, continued commitment is needed to meet pay and pension reform commitments



                                             23
under sub-component 1.5. Finally, strong commitment will be needed to ensure that top-
level government support for ROM and OOB will be sustained.

69.      Second, in order to ensure the sustainability of certain project activities, continued
government financial support is needed to maintain investments made under the UPSPEP
project. Due to implementation delays and the subsequent closure of the project, a number
of key items remain unfinished, including: (i) the furnishing and operationalization of the
NRCA; (ii) the construction of phase two of the Civil Service College; and (iii)
implementation of policy research and innovation initiatives. In order to ensure the
sustainability of these project investments, especially the completion of the NRCA, the
Government has committed funding through the Ministry of Finance to continue to
activities started under the project. This commitment has been affirmed by letter to the
Bank and commitments confirmed in the MTEF and budget for Financial Year 2014/2015.

70.      Third, discussions with basket fund DPs, particularly Irish Aid and DANIDA,
suggest that future support from development partners will be needed to maintain reform
momentum. However, the sustainability of current reforms remains a concern, particularly
with regard to the growing number of public service staff and increasing salaries despite
current resource levels. In this context, a key risk to the sustainability of PSM reforms is
that some DPs are moving support away from Public Sector Management as results are
hard to demonstrate in the short-run and declining aid budgets make it increasingly difficult
to demonstrate to constituents that value-for-money is being achieved. A final and related
risk is that other government policies, such as the recent anti-gay legislation, may make
future partnerships with the certain DPs more difficult.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

71.     As noted above, the UPSPEP project drew on a diverse array of relevant
background analyses that supported the project’s various components and sub-components.
In addition, the project design incorporated lessons learned within the country and region,
as well as from the governance sector more broadly. Additional levels of review were
assured through a QER process and the Project Preparation Facility, which helped to launch
key activities. As a result of the preparatory work conducted, the project’s components
were aligned with the PDO’s intended outcomes, and the outcomes matched the
government’s development priorities at time of appraisal. The project design also
benefitted from an extensive analysis of related risks and a thorough evaluation of fiduciary
capacity, sustainability, and safeguards issues.

72.    At the same time, however, the design of the project was over-ambitious given the
large number of components and indicators as well as the existing procurement and



                                              24
financial management capacity of the implementing agency at time of appraisal. Although
the Bank utilized the PPF to build these capacities, the implementation of the project
proved difficult as delays resulted in several large items not being completed by project
closing. In addition to the overly complex design of the projects sub-components, a poorly
designed M&E system contained numerous indicators which could not be adequately
monitored by the government. Had the M&E system been more appropriately designed and
had the original project design focused on more selective interventions in the PSRP, quality
at entry could have been significantly improved and implementation of project components
would have been more even at project closure.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
73.     During the implementation period, the Bank conducted a total of 16 ISR missions
and completed an intensive MTR in 2011. Both DANIDA and Irish Aid acknowledged that
the Bank’s support missions were frequent and helpful in identifying key implementation
challenges, which were essential for removing road blocks and helpful in targeting areas
for greater attention. While there was an initial delay in the Bank providing resources to
the basket fund, feedback from DPs suggested that the SWAp arrangement was well
implemented and that the Bank was able to bring a great deal of technical expertise to the
implementation of the PSRP. As a lead donor partner in the SWAp arrangement, it was
noted that intensive Bank supervision often ensured that key project management and
fiduciary issues were adequately addressed, and that relevant documents were eventually
submitted despite initial delays.

74.     However, during implementation there were serious issues related to the quality of
M&E arrangements and the systematic monitoring of results. As noted above, of the two
PDO indicators and 18 intermediate indicators in the results framework, only one PDO and
three intermediate outcome indicators were regularly tracked through the implementation
period. Of the six indicators that were tracked during the life of the project, only four were
from the originally approved indicators listed in the PAD, and an additional two indicators
were added on an ad hoc basis. Despite the filing of regular ISRs and the completion of an
intensive MTR, the discrepancy between the indicators tracked and those listed in the PAD
was never noted by the task team, nor was it detected by management. As a result, this
impaired the ability of the Bank to monitor progress on the diverse areas of the project, and
inherently undermined the capacity for results-based decision making. Had the team
adhered to the original results framework and had management ensured that the indicators
be formally restructured, the quality of supervision could have been greatly improved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

75.   As Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry was Moderately Unsatisfactory
and Quality of Supervision was Moderately Unsatisfactory, the Overall Bank Performance




                                             25
for the UPSPEP project is Moderately Unsatisfactory with respect to IEG’s Harmonized
Ratings Criteria.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

76.     As noted above, the government commitment to the UPSPEP project was generally
adequate in some areas. Although there was a substantial effectiveness delay, the
government reiterated its support for the PSRP and the Civil Service College, as evidenced
by a letter of continued commitment by the President, by emphasizing the centrality of the
UPSPEP project in helping the government strengthen its public service. Likewise, during
implementation, the MoFPED firmly supported the implementation of the IPPS by signing
a MoU with the MoPS to ensure that the remaining IPPS modules were made operational
and that the IPPS properly interfaces with the IFMIS system. This commitment was
reiterated at project closing, with the MoFPED indicating that it will continue to support
the PRSP reforms, especially the ROM and performance contracts.

77.     Despite these areas of notable commitment, however, other areas of the project
were not given the same support. Although risk mitigation measures were included in
project design, limited implementation of key elements, such as the government’s IEC and
change management strategies, greatly undermined the visibility and support of the project.
Similarly, while the Civil Service College was built and operationalized at the request of
the government, the MoFPED noted during the ICR mission that it only intends to fund
CSC operations for the short term, and that the continued existence of the CSC will be
predicated on its ability to sustain itself in the next 3-5 years. Likewise, a majority the
recommendations of the extensive government restructuring exercise that took place under
the PSRP have not been implemented despite huge potential efficiency gains and cost
savings. Had the government supported the UPSPEP project more fully and evenly, these
and other key reforms would have been complete by project closing.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

78.     While the implementing agency adequately managed certain reform components,
such as the ROM/OOB activities as well as the construction and operationalization of the
CSC, other aspects of the project, such as the rollout of the IPPS and the construction of
the NRCA, were very poorly executed by the MoPS. As mentioned earlier, there was no
dedicated Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for this project and the responsibility for
implementation was mainstreamed in the MoPS and the relevant MDAs and LGs. Given
its low procurement, M&E, and financial management capacity, these activities were
further delayed by frequent rotation of relevant staff, poor project management for key




                                            26
components, and weak leadership within the MoPS during the first stages of project
implementation.

79.     These issues were echoed by the DPs, who noted that while there was sufficient
commitment, ownership, and clarity at the policy level, the technical capacity of the MoPS
was weak with respect to timely implementation. In particular, there were substantial
delays in the MoPS preparing annual work plans, consistent issues with procurement and
the timely submission of Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), and a lack of capacity in the
unit responsible to the implementation of the IPPS. It was also noted that for a majority of
the project implementation there was a leadership deficit, with the original Permanent
Secretary (PS) not being responsive to reporting requirements as well as not taking
appropriate remedial actions. After the removal of the PS, and despite recommendations
by the Bank to hire a project manager to help speed implementation of key reform areas,
no additional human resources were committed to the project. Finally, the MoPS did not
appropriately monitor the project indicators, which inhibited its ability to take corrective
actions. Had overall leadership, project management, and M&E been better during the
implementation period, it is likely that the project would have likely achieved more of its
objectives and demonstrated greater efficacy at project closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

80.   As Government Performance was Moderately Unsatisfactory and Implementing
Agency Performance was Unsatisfactory, the Overall Borrower Performance for the
UPSPEP project is Unsatisfactory with respect to IEG’s Harmonized Ratings Criteria.

6. Lessons Learned

81.    Implementation of second-generation public sector reforms requires a sustained
commitment in order to achieve long-term impact, which raises important lessons about
how to best design and implement projects and how to effectively engage with the
government. The World Bank’s 2010-2020 Public Sector Management Approach 7
emphasizes the need to better understand the context within which public sector reforms
are implemented and the processes required to effectively implement them. In this context,
analysis of the successes and shortcomings of the UPSPEP raises a number of important
lessons.

82.    A first lesson learned is the importance of investing time and effort in aligning
and securing both political and technical support for the life of the project. The
UPSPEP project was aligned with the Government’s PSRP agenda, and during preparation
a great deal of effort was invested in consulting stakeholders and developing an

  The World Bank’s Approach to Public Sector Management 2011-2020: “Better Results from Public
Institutions” February 2012



                                                27
Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) strategy to market the reforms to both
lawmakers and the public. However, the strategy was not fully implemented due to funding
reallocations, which made it difficult to raise awareness and sustain political support for
the PSRP, and which may have been a contributing cause to the delay in Parliamentary
approval of the project.

83.     A second lesson learned is that appropriate monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms are required to proactively track the impacts of reforms. A strong focus
on developing a tailored M&E framework should be established from the concept stage
and extended throughout project implementation. As evidenced by the UPSPEP project,
there is a tendency for public sector operations to over-promise with respect to indicators
in order to prove their status as an "all of government" intervention. Results frameworks
should be prepared with great caution, focusing on realistic outcomes and indicators,
ensuring links between activities, outputs, and outcomes, and investing in baseline data. It
is also important to anticipate the cost and effort required by both the Government and
Bank teams in collecting data, and to include this in the activity and budget plans.

84.     A third lesson learned is the importance of focusing on context and process in
project design, taking into account political economy factors as well as existing and
potential capacity constraints. The World Bank’s 2010-2020 PSM approach clearly
states that “the process of PSM reform is increasingly emphasized as key for success, to
the extent that it helps uncover the real incentives and interests of the actors involved in
conducting PSM reform change and finds a compromise between them.” As noted, the
design of the UPSPEP was overly ambitious given the existing procurement, financial
management, and project management capacity challenges of the implementing agency at
the time of appraisal. Mainstreaming implementation of the project directly in the MoPS
further exacerbated the capacity challenges forcing the staff to choose between the project
activities and their day-to-day work. In addition, the level of the political commitment
shown during preparation did not last throughout project implementation and reforms
frequently encountered resistance to change, which was exacerbated by the failure to
implement the communication and change management strategies.

85.     A fourth lesson learned is the need for flexible and iterative approaches in
project implementation. A key success of the project was the implementation of the
“caravan” approach in providing training to civil servants in advance of the completion of
the CSC. This approach proactively addressed the delays in the completion of the CSC and
made it possible to achieve tangible results by project closing. Although the CSC has begun
offering on-campus trainings, the caravan approach will be continued as a means to offer
cost effective training in hard to reach areas. Accordingly, the success of the “caravan”
approach demonstrates that the proactive development of “second best” options can still
allow for the achievement of substantial results.

86.     A fifth lesson learned is the importance of adequate leadership, capacity, and
authority in the implementing agency. Given the cross cutting nature of the reforms, the
government acknowledged that it was necessary to create a talent pool of indispensable
positions in all MDAs during the project period. It was also critical to ensure that the



                                            28
implementing agency had the authority to enforce or encourage the implementation of
reforms that require committed participation of other agencies. For example, the need to
enforce the role of accounting officers in various MDAs was essential to the success of the
IPPS. However, absenteeism has remained high at the local level, in particular in schools
and hospitals, which undermined the impact of project interventions on service delivery.
Accordingly, it is important that the risk assessment framework captures risks related to
inadequate capacity, not only at approval, but also throughout project implementation, as
capacity can evaporate very quickly.

87.     A sixth lesson learned is that clear and simple implementation arrangements
are essential to smooth implementation during the life of a project and to the eventual
achievement of project objectives. The UPSPEP project showed how challenges can
emerge when components are too numerous and complex to be effectively managed.
Accordingly, improved design of a multi-sectoral public sector project requires: (i)
developing simpler and focused project components to achieve tangible results; (ii)
understanding the political economy of the country, which will enable the team designing
the project to develop more appropriate implementation arrangements; (iii) creating
incentives for government buy-in; (iv) developing flexible implementation arrangements
depending on political economy considerations; and (v) considering the appropriate
timeframe to implement the project.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

88.     The Government of Uganda’s MoPS provided a full government completion report
of the UPSPEP project as well as comments on the draft Bank ICR. Likewise, comments
on the draft ICR were provided by Irish Aid and DANIDA, who served a co-financiers of
the basket funding (SWAp) arrangement that supported component one of the UPSPEP
project; no comments were received from DfID who was the third funding partner of the
SWAp. Borrower comments on the draft ICR and the UPSPEP project as a whole are
summarized in Annex 7; co-financer comments on the draft ICR are summarized in Annex
8; and comments on key issues raised are noted below.
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

89.      The Bank acknowledges GoU’s concurrence with the report findings and notes
issues with regard to the reduced scope of the project following the first adaptive
restructuring. Whereas the reduction in scope only affected component two of the project,
it is assumed that the implementation structures originally intended for this component
would have supported the implementation of component one as such its removal could
have affected overall implementation capacity. The report discusses this upfront under
context and in the lessons learnt picked up this issue in the lessons learned. With regard to
the results framework and overall M&E, the Bank acknowledges the Government’s
concern on lack of effective monitoring of all indicators during project implementation and
the poorly selected indicators. This is well elucidated in the lessons learned section.

90.    Whereas the Bank retains the overall rating in the ICR as Moderately
Unsatisfactory, the Government has recommended an upgrade to Moderately Satisfactory


                                             29
given the project’s achievements. In addition, the Government recognized that realization
of impact from PSM reforms takes considerable time and capacity and other
implementation challenges make the transition from outputs to outcomes difficult in such
a short period of time. Likewise, this is acknowledged by the Bank.
(b) Cofinanciers

91.    The Bank acknowledges and concurs with all comments raised by development
partners as summarized in Annex 8. Comments have been incorporated in the ICR text.

Annex 2: Outputs by Component

93.     The PDO of the UPSPEP project is to support the government “to improve and
make its public service delivery affordable, efficient, accountable, and effective in use of
public resources; and to improve the policy, institutional, and regulatory environment of
its public service delivery institutions for sustainable economic growth.” Formulated as
such, the achievement of the PDO can be measured through the achievement of its
constitutive objectives, namely the extent to which the various components of the UPSPEP
project improved and contributed to the (i) affordability, (ii) efficiency, (iii) accountability,
(iv) and effectiveness of the use of public resources, as well as the extent to which the
various components improved the (v) policy, (vi) institutional, and (vii) regulatory
environment of Uganda’s public service institutions.

94.     Due to the support of the UPSPEP project, there were a number of key
achievements in making public service delivery more affordable, efficient, accountable,
and effective in the use of public resources. These include, among others: the adoption of
ROM/OOB across the public service, which has supported the development of Client
Charters, performance contracts, and a sanctions frameworks to improve service delivery
(sub-component 1.1); fully capturing the establishment wage bill in the IPPS system, which
has improved HR management, increased efficiencies and cost savings, and reduced
opportunities for fraud and waste in public resources (sub-component 1.2); and support for
payroll inspections, which has reduced the discrepancy between the number of staff paid
thorough the payroll and actual staff (component 1.3).
         

95.     Likewise, much has been done to improve the policy, institutional, and regulatory
environment of public service delivery institutions. These achievements include, among
others: the development and implementation of HR policy and guidelines for vulnerable
groups (sub-component 1.4); the successful implementation of activities to improve the
government’s policy-making capacity (sub-component 1.6); and the construction of a Civil
Service College that has successfully trained thousands of public servants (sub-component
2.1).

96.     Despite these successes, there were also a number of shortcomings in the
implementation of the UPSPEP project caused by price escalations due to initial delays in
project effectiveness and implementation, as well as a lack of capacity and committed
leadership to properly manage the project. Key shortcomings include, among others: a
failure to operationalize all eight IPPS modules in all phase 1 and 2 locations (sub-
component 1.2); limited progress on implementation of recommendations related to the
government restructuring exercise, which has limited the achievement of the projected
potential efficiency gains (sub-component 1.3); incomplete operationalization of the
National Records Center and Archives, which has inhibited efforts to decongest public
records (sub-component 1.4); and limited implementation of the pay and pension reform
agenda despite the approval a pay policy (subcomponent 1.5).




                                               32
97.    In the analysis below, each objective is discussed with respect to the various
component activities and outputs that support them, and Table 4 provides a summary of
key outputs achieved on a component-by-component basis.

   (i)     To improve and make service delivery more affordable;

98.     The UPSPEP project aimed to improve the affordability of service delivery through
the restructuring and rationalization of public sector organizations. Under sub-component
1.3, an external consulting firm identified approximately US$2.16 billion in cost savings
by restructuring its MDAs and LGs in line with the report’s recommendations. However,
the costs of implementing the new structures were considered prohibitively high given the
fiscal constraints faced by the government and only a number of MDAs were reorganized
or rationalized. Restructuring achievements include a review of the Uganda Land
Commission and revitalization of six district land offices under Ministry of Land, Housing
and Urban Development; revitalization of the Petroleum Institute and creation of the
Department of Petroleum in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development; and the
reorganization of the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development, Ministry
of Public Service, and Ministry of Education. Although the recommendations have
presently not been implemented in full due to funding constraints, a number of “quick win”
restructurings have taken place that have resulted in the government recouping 25% of the
estimated potential savings.

99.     Beyond the restructuring and review of the public service, the UPSPEP project
supported the development of a new pay policy under subcomponent 1.5 in order to ensure
the principles of equity and attract qualified staff in competition with the private sector.
Due to fiscal constraints and despite the adoption of the White Paper on Civil Service
Reform, however, these activities have not been fully implemented. In addition, challenges
have been experienced with the revision of pension legislation and creation of a public
sector pension fund to support management of pension arrears.

100. Despite the lack of M&E during the life of the project, ex post evaluations estimate
savings from restructuring efforts at only 25% of the potential savings of US$2.16 billion,
as restructuring recommendations were only implemented in a few MDAs (intermediate
indicator 6). Likewise, it was determined ex post that real pay increases remained at 0%
through the life of the project due to inflation rates (intermediate indicator 11). An
additional indicator—the adoption of Public Service White Paper on Pay and Pension
reform—to benchmark the adoption of comprehensive pay reforms was added and
achieved; however, this was not done through a formal restructuring process. In addition,
information on the reduction of pension arrears suggests that arrears were reduced by 48%
over the life of the project (intermediate indicator 12); however, information on the
accumulation of new pension arrears (intermediate indicators 18) was not collected during
the life of the project.

   (ii)    To improve and make service delivery more efficient;

101. The UPSPEP project aimed to improve efficiency in the use of public resources
primarily through integrating Results Oriented Management (ROM) and Output Oriented
Budgeting (OOB) in planning and budgeting systems and introduction of the IPPS. Under
sub-component 1.1, the project successfully supported the development, sensitization, and
roll-out of the ROM/OOB framework in Education, Health, Works, and transport, Water,
and Environment sectors, as well as to Local Governments. Anecdotal evidence from the
health sector suggest that ROM activities and Client Charters in Regional Referral
Hospitals has resulted in greater efficiencies, including decreased waiting times to see
health care professionals, better availability of medicines, a more efficient referral system
that reduces unnecessary treatments, and more efficient budgeting.

102. In addition to these efficiency enhancing restructuring reforms, the UPSPEP project
was able to support the implementation Integrated Payroll and Personnel System (IPPS)
under sub-component 1.2. As a result, civil servants from 207 MDAs and LGs—
representing the whole of the government establishment—are now captured in the IPPS
database as is 100% of the establishment payroll. This has resulted in more regular and
timely payment of salaries for civil servants, and accounting officers are now able to
generate pay slips, verification reports, and forecasts with less effort. Likewise, payroll
cleaning exercises which took place during project preparation have resulted in the
elimination of approximately 9,000 ghost workers from the government’s payroll, which
according to estimates by Donor Partners, represents an annual savings of US $10 million
per year.

103. While significant efficiency gains were made with respect to the implementation of
ROM/OOB and IPPS, there were a number of shortcomings which undermine the project’s
ability to generate greater efficiencies for the public service. These include: (i) connectivity
issues whereby only 39 MDAs currently have the necessary hardware and LAN
connections for using the IPPS system; (ii) little progress on the implementation and rollout
of other IPPS modules, with only two modules (staff records management and payroll) of
eight functional at project closing; and (iii) limited implementation of government
restructuring recommendations as noted above. In addition, there were a number of
shortcomings with respect to sub-component 1.4, which was designed to improve records
management and decongestion of registries through the construction and operationalizing
of a National Records Center and Archives. Although the construction of the facility was
completed by project closing, the NRCA has not been furnished or operationalized and no
records have been transferred, thus limiting its functionality as a national data repository.

104. Given the mixed performance of the sub-components aimed at generating
efficiency in the use of public resources, the achievement of intermediate outcome
indicator targets is likewise mixed. Good implementation of sub-component 1.1 has
resulted in 100% of MDA and LGs having implemented ROM initiatives, including 23
ministries, 50 agencies, and 111 Local Governments (intermediate indicator 2). In addition,
the government was able to meet its target related to the percentage of the establishment
and wage bill captured in the IPPS database, which currently stands at 100% (intermediate



                                              34
indicator 4). However, this indicator does not capture the poor performance related to the
implementation of the other modules which are critical in ensuring the long-term
sustainability of the IPPS system and delivering value for money. Likewise, since the
NCRA remains un-operationalized, the percentage of transferred archives stands at zero
and it is questionable whether the NCRA will help to decongest public records
(intermediate indicator 9).

   (iii)   To improve and make service delivery more accountable;

105. While ROM and OOB has helped to enhance the efficiency and performance of
civil servants and MDAs, as noted above under sub-component 1.1, the implementation of
Client Charters has also increased the level of government accountability. As part of the
implementation of the ROM/OOB framework, the majority of MDAs and more than half
of LGs have been able to develop Client Charters, which are a valuable means for
communicating expected service standards as well as improving service delivery. In an
interview with INFOC, a leading anticorruption and public accountability CSO in Uganda,
the implementation of Client Charters was cited as “instrumental” in increasing awareness
of available public services, helping individuals become more confident to demand
accountability, and providing whistleblowers a channel to have their complaints and
concerns properly addressed.

106. In addition to the increased accountability as a result of ROM, sub-component 1.2
supported a number of notable achievements with respect to HR reforms, including the
development of a more transparent and meritocratic recruitment system across the public
service. Under the UPSPEP project, the government developed exams targeted to specific
positions and introduced a computerized recruitment system, which is significantly more
transparent and efficient than a paper-based application system. In addition to these efforts
to increase transparency, the UPSPEP project has enhanced government accountability
through sub-component 1.3, which supported systematic payroll inspections and audits. As
a result of project support, MoPS officers now travel to local districts on a monthly basis
to conduct inspections to determine whether internal audits are being carried out before
changes to payroll are approved.

107. The progress made on increasing accountability in the use of public resources is
reflected in the achievement of several indicators. As noted above, 100% of MDA and LGs
have implemented ROM initiatives (intermediate indicator 2), and while the final target
was not met by project closure, 72% of MDAs and LGs have reached their annual
objectives ROM performance objectives (PDO indicator 2). Likewise, 100% of all
government jobs are now filled through open competition at project closure (intermediate
indicator 3). In addition, increased use of payroll audits and inspections has reduced the
discrepancy between staff paid through the government’s payroll and the number of actual
staff working for the government. Although this indicator was not formally approved in
the PAD or in the project restructuring, it would appear that payroll discrepancies were
reducing by 10%.

   (iv)    To improve and make service delivery more effective;



                                             35
108. In addition to the achievements noted above, sub-component 1.1 has also helped to
make more effective use of public resources. As mentioned, UPSPEP support has enabled
the MoPS to introduce a performance management culture which relies on service delivery
standards, client charters, annual performance agreements, and individual staff
performance appraisals. Again, the health sector provides an example of the impact of this
initiative as ROM activities and Client Charters in Regional Referral Hospitals have
resulted in decreased waiting times to see health care professionals, better availability of
medicines, less instances of stock-outs, and greater availability of staff.

109. Despite the anecdotal evidence provided during the ICR mission, however, there is
not much quantitative evidence to demonstrate that public resources are being used in a
more effective manner. Again, while ROM is now implemented in 100% of MDAs and
LGs, and 72% of annual performance objectives are now being met, the percentage
satisfaction with public service delivery (PDO indicator 1) was never tracked during the
life of the project nor is information available on the percentage of service standards which
have been met (intermediate indicators 1 and 17). Presently, the Government is in the
process of finalizing the performance score card as part of the broader initiatives to assess
achievement of performance targets in the ROM/OOB framework; however this
information was not available at the time of the ICR.

   (v)     To improve the policy environment of its public service delivery institutions

110. The UPSPEP project aimed to improve the policy environment through sub-
component 1.6, which was designed to enhance the capacity of the MoPS, and more
generally, to increase the policy making capacity of the government. To this end, the MoPS
was effectively restructured on the basis of an approved MOPS/ARS restructuring report
and a change management strategy was prepared and implemented. In addition, the Cabinet
Secretariat was very active in supporting efforts to strengthen the government’s policy-
making capacity and enhance awareness of reform objectives. To this end, a Cabinet
Committee System was established so that reforms can be fully debated before coming to
full cabinet discussion, and training was provided to Permanent Secretaries in the drafting
of policy.

111. Other efforts to improve the policy environment were addressed by sub-component
2.1, which supported policy research under the CSC related to key government priorities.
The MoPS, with the support of the Ontario Public Service, developed a framework to guide
its policy research. As a result of this initiative, the targeted research has been conducted
in the tourism sector, which has resulted in the creation of two tourism and investment
centers in Jinja and Entebbe.

112. Despite the activities undertaken to improve the policy environment, the UPSPEP
project has produced few outputs that can be measured by the intermediate indicators. The
key intermediate indicator related to this sub-component was the percentage of PEAP
targets achieved (intermediate indicator 13); however, this information was not tracked
during PRSP implementation due to the fact that the PEAP ended in 2008 and the



                                             36
government began monitoring targets through a different methodology. Ex-post
evaluations suggest that 72% of PEAP targets have been met; however this is below the
target value and it is unclear whether the activities under this component can have a direct
causal effect with respect to the implementation of the PEAP. Likewise, one policy
research initiative was conducted under the auspices of the CSC (intermediate indicator
15); however, no target values were set which makes it is difficult to evaluate the efficacy
of these activities.

    (vi)     To improve the institutional environment of its public service delivery
             institutions

113. The UPSPEP project made significant achievements in improving the institutional
environment of its public service delivery institutions through capacity building activities
under sub-component 2.1, which supported the construction and development of a Civil
Service College. With the support of the project, MoPS was able to successfully upgrade
and refurbish a facility in the city of Jinja, which includes a main campus building,
classrooms, conference facilities, library resources, and all necessary ICT to conduct a full
range of trainings8. Under phase 1, the college now has the capacity to train 10,000 civil
servants per year, although given present training demand, it is likely that only 3,000 civil
servants will be trained during the first year of operation. Going forward, the Government
has provided for resources to operationalize the college and construction of phase 2, which
would include building of dining and dormitory facilities for the trainees.

114. In addition to these capacity building initiatives, the project also supported
institutional improvements by developing cross-cutting HR policies for vulnerable groups
within the civil service. Under sub-component 1.4, the MoPS successfully developed and
put in place guidelines to bring a “gender lens” into the HR management, recruitment, and
budging decisions in the public service. In addition, substantial progress has been made to
better mainstream, sensitize, and budget for HIV/AIDS issues in the workplace. To this
end, the MoPS has created HIV focal points in each ministry so that those affected can seek
anonymous counseling and treatment when necessary. In addition, employment policies
have been reviewed in light of HIV/AIDS considerations so that affected employees can
take extended periods of leave for treatment and not be forced into early retirement based
on medical reasons.

115. With respect to the indicators, the construction of the CSC and its operationalization
has been one of the most successful elements of the UPSPEP project. As a result of these
efforts, and through the pioneering caravan approach, 2,545 civil servants have been
trained in core competency areas, far exceeding project targets (intermediate indicator 14).


8
 With the support of the project the MoPS has established twinning and partnership arrangements with the
Ontario Public Service, the Tallinn Development and Training Centre (Estonia), and GIZ, and has been
able to develop a seven core courses, including: (1) Induction for Public Officers, (2) Leadership and
Change Management, (3) Competence-Based Recruitment, (4) Performance Management, (5) Public
Procurement and Contract Management, (6) Innovation Management, and (7) Pre-Retirement Training.



                                                  37
While the CSC and its training programs have been highly successful, the local production
of policy research (intermediate indicator 15) was not tracked and no target values were
set, nor were improvements in leadership management skills tracked (intermediate
indicator 16). Likewise, while no information was collected during the implementation
phase related to work satisfaction or the percentage of women in the workforce
(intermediate indicators 7 and 8), ex-post figures of 44% and 22% respectively were
provided at project completion.

     (vii)   To improve the regulatory environment of its public service delivery
             institutions

116. A final element of the UPSPEP project set forth in the PDO was to improve the
regulatory environment for public service delivery institutions. Under sub-component 1.1,
the mainstreaming of ROM and OOB across the public service, development of
performance contracts, and a framework to reward and sanction on the basis of the
achievements of performance objectives provided for a more effective management of the
human resources in the public service. At the same time, sub-component 1.2 ensured that
regulations were put in place to better guarantee the meritocracy in the recruitment of
public sector workers. Finally, regulations were put into place under sub-component 1.3 to
allow the MoPS to conduct systematic payroll inspections and audits, which have greatly
reduced incidences of ghost workers on the payroll.

117. As a result of these initiatives, indicators show that these additional regulations
have had some tangible impact. As aforementioned, the use of performance contracts and
sanctions framework is now universally applied in the public service and inspections have
reduced significantly reduced payroll discrepancies.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

As noted above, at the time of project appraisal, no economic analysis was completed to
determine Net-Present Value or Economic Rate of Return estimates related to the
project’s key areas of intervention. As a result, it is not possible to recalculate efficiency
estimates ex post and compare them to anticipated returns at project appraisal.
Accordingly, section 3.3 provides anecdotal and qualitative evidence on a number of key

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

COMMENTS ON THE WORLD BANK IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND
RESULTS REPORT FOR THE UGANDA PUBLIC SERVICE PERFORMANCE
ENHANCEMENT PROJECT: P050440

Government of Uganda generally agrees with the report; however the following comments
are made on the specific sections of the report:

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

While the Project was restructured, reducing it in scope and funding, the original Project
Development Objectives (PDO) and indicators were maintained in the restructured project.
The restructured project therefore was unrealistic and ambitious by design. Therefore,
Project objectives and indicators should have been reviewed to match the reduced scope
and funding.

In addition to the above, while PSRP and UPSPEP were separate Programs with different
objectives, indicators, timelines and financing mechanisms, these were fused during
implementation and this caused implementation challenges especially relating to financial
management, reporting and accountability.

2. Results Framework and M&E

The Ministry appreciates the set-up of the M&E system in the Ministry under the project.
However, the design and implementation of the Results framework for the project was
ambitious and unattainable under the restructured project. While the project was
restructured and reduced in scope, the original indicators were maintained in the
restructured project. In addition, during implementation, only few indicators relevant to
the restructured project were monitored. This has therefore had an impact on the overall
rating of the project.

3. Capacity issues

The report indicates that the Ministry lacked the capacity to implement the project
outcomes. The Ministry asserts that there was adequate human resource capacity in terms
of numbers and competencies; however their productivity was hampered by inadequate
facilitation and motivation. It should be noted that the staff who were undertaking project
activities were in addition performing the mainstream activities of the Ministry. In order to
motivate them, they should have been paid a top up allowance/honoraria for undertaking
extra duties and working beyond normal working hours to execute project activities, like
their counterparts in other donor - funded projects. It should be noted that payment of Top
Up and Honoraria is acceptable under the Government of Uganda Regulations and it should
have been upheld under the project.




                                             47
4. Overall outcome rating of the project

The Ministry observes that in many of the interventions, outputs were achieved, but moving
from outputs to results, proved a major challenge due to inadequate Government resources.
In addition, it should be noted that realization of impact/results from PSM reforms takes
time. Suffice to note that the necessary requirements to transform the Public Service are
now in place as a result of the project interventions. Notable among these are: ROM/OOB
framework, Client Charters, Integrated Personnel and Payroll System, Policy Paper on
Transformation of the Public Service, Civil Service College Uganda and related trainings
conducted, Innovations Management and awareness creation for improved service delivery
and the Human Resource Strategy.

The results/ outcomes should have been assessed against the reduced scope and funding of
the project. In this regard, the Ministry’s view is that the overall outcome rating of the
project should be moderately satisfactory and not moderately unsatisfactory as indicated in
your report.

5. Lessons Learned

The Ministry agrees with the lessons learned as indicated in the report. These must be
factored into the next project during the design stage.

6. Way Forward

The project has been able to put in place conditions necessary to achieve the earlier
intended project objectives of supporting the transformation of the public service so that it
is affordable, efficient and accountable in the use of public resources; and improving the
policy, institutional and regulatory environment in targeted areas for sustainable growth
and service delivery. In order to consolidate the above achievements, we request for further
technical and financial support from the World Bank to pursue the following:

   a) Implementation of the interventions under the Policy Paper on Transformation of
      the Public Service;
   b) Implementation of the Human Resource Strategy;
   c) Completion of Phase 2 of Civil Service College Uganda;
   d) Operationalization of the National Records Centre and Archives;
   e) Technical Support and equipping of the 11 IPPS Regional Centers;
   f) Establishment of One Stop Government Service Centers;
   g) Strengthening M&E at Ministry of Public Service; and
   h) Strengthening Project Planning and Management capacity at Ministry of Public
      Service.

Annex 8: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments on the draft ICR were provided by Irish Aid and DANIDA, who served a co-
financiers of the basket funding (SWAp) arrangement that supported component one of the
UPSPEP project; no comments were received from DfID who was the third funding partner
of the SWAp. Overall development partners noted that the consistency and clarity of the
ICRs storyline is adequate, the lessons learned are appropriate, and the overall ratings are
accurate as many indicators were not measured and many targets were not met. Co-financer
comments are summarized in below around key issues.

1. Development Partners’ Relations:
Donor relations and engagement on the project was strong and focused during the initial
years of implementation. However, this level of engagement gradually diminished when
funding from the bilateral donors came to an end and their institutions’ priorities shifted
away from PSM reforms. As a result, it was noted that the DP working group at a certain
point became dysfunctional and ineffective. With regard to GoU relations, Irish Aid noted
that engagement with the government and MoPS was greatly enhanced under the UPSPEP
project due to the strong and active role provided by WB. Likewise, it was noted that the
MoPS and the donor working group greatly benefited from the regular Bank supervision
missions, through which it was possible to conduct deep, qualitative analyses and
assessments of progress by a multiple professionals in the Bank’s team.

2. Consistency and Coherence of the Storyline:
Development partners agree with the storyline and noted that the ratings of the ICR were
largely in line with the project completion exercise they conducted at the conclusion of its
participation in the PSRP basket fund arrangement. In particular, it was noted that there is
a great deal of coherence on key issues, including: (i) the design and operational (internal
and external) challenges highlighted; (ii) the limited political economy analysis completed
during the design stage; (iii) inadequate baseline data and ineffective M&E system as well
as the results framework not being updated in line with the JAR outcomes and
recommendations; (iv) poor sequencing of the reforms; and (v) the need to broaden
ownership of public service reforms beyond MoPS, Public Service Commission, and
Cabinet Secretariat to other MDAs & LGs through the NDP process. Given these
shortcomings, Irish Aid agreed with DANIDA’s comment that it would be useful to see a
few concrete and workable recommendations to ensure that the investments under UPSPEP
project and PSRP are sustained.

3. Implementation:
Development Partners noted that the Joint policy dialogue on the PSRP strategy was not
effectively coordinated under the Government-led Public Sector Management Sector
Working Group and institutions active in the sector had other priorities which were not
properly aligned or coordinated with the objectives of the PSRP. For example, it was noted
that the proliferation of new local governments increased both the size and cost of public
administration, which negated the goals of eliminating inefficient and over-extended


                                            49
government organizations under the project. In addition, donor partners noted that the need
to link public service reform interests to other funding modalities such as the social sector
SIPS & PRDP became very apparent during UPSPEP implementation, and that the Bank
was able to raise the PSR issues to the level of the JBSF/JAF initiative. It was also noted
that the activities would have been more appropriate had they been adequately owned by
the government; however, low levels of political commitment and financial support to the
public sector reforms inhibited the pace of implementation.

4. Ratings:
Development partners generally concurred with the ratings provided by the ICR and raise
concern with the following: (i) whether it would have been possible to drop the
underperforming elements during the MTR or request for extension; (ii) what the
implication is for the PDO as a considerable number of project activities remained
unfinished; (iii) whether attempts were made to address poor indicator design and flawed
data collection arrangements and how the Bank might address M&E to inform possible
future support to Government’s service delivery agenda; (iv) the time frame and cost
required to complete the remaining project activities; and (v) why the recommendations of
restructuring of MDAs were not implemented despite the significant savings & efficiency
gains.

5. Lessons Learned:
Development partners concurred with all the lessons learned and encourage Government
to incorporate these in the design of future PSM strategies.
