SUMMARY

1.     The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to increase the disbursement
percentages for goods, consultant services and training and workshops to 100% and to
extend the closing date of this grant by 12 months.

PROJECT STATUS
2.      This project is a regional project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
The GEF project covers three countries: Thailand, China and Vietnam. The Project
Development Objective (PDO) is to reduce the major negative environmental and health
impacts of rapidly increasing concentrated livestock production on water bodies and thus on
the people of East Asia. Its global environment objective is to reduce livestock-induced, land-
based pollution and environmental degradation of the South China Sea. Separate grant
agreements were signed with each participating country. As of November 19, 2010, 70% of
the $2 million GEF grant proceeds for Thailand had been disbursed.

3.       The project implementing agency in Thailand is the Department of Livestock
Development (DLD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. The project is
currently rated satisfactory in progress toward achievement of PDO and moderately
satisfactory in overall implementation progress due mainly to slower-than-expected
implementation progress in Vietnam. The Thailand portion of the project is to support
participating pig farms in establishment and operation of livestock waste management
facilities. By the end of 2009, achievement of total number of standing pig population (SPP)
covered by farms adopting advanced livestock waste management systems with project
support and the percentage of national SPP implementing improved livestock waste
management practices were on track. Full achievement of the above-mentioned appraisal
targets at the end of extended closing date is very likely.

PROPOSED CHANGES

TF056520-TH will be revised as follows:

4.     The proposed revision of financing percentage is necessary and justified as follows:

       a. The current financing percentages (not all at 100%) have complicated project
          financing during implementation as the government set certain restrictions for
          provision of counterpart funds (e.g. no financing physical construction of
          livestock waste management facilities; no financing for consultant services co-
          financed by other financiers). The inconsistency between the Bank's current
          financing percentages and the government requirements limited the DLD's ability
          in coordinating project financing during implementation;
       b. GEF projects implemented by other GEF implementing agencies in Thailand
          have provided 100% financing for similar activities so this change will make this
          project consistent with other GEF-financed operations in the country;
       c. The total amount of counterpart fund will remain unchanged;
       d. These revised financing percentages are in line with the recently approved
          country financing parameters.

5.     Closing date. The closing date of this project will be extended by 12 months to
December 31, 2011 to allow Thailand to complete all activities satisfactorily. Implementation
delays were caused by the following factors:

       a. DLD's participation in preparation of two associated carbon finance projects right
          after the GEF project approval limited its capacity to carry out the necessary
          activities to launch this project early in implementation;

                                               4
       b. Cabinet approval of the requested domestic counterpart funding for the project
          took nearly three years to obtain. Lack of counterpart funding before June 2009
          limited the ability of DLD to implement the project;
       c. Construction of wastewater management facilities had to be suspended during the
          rainy seasons in 2009 and 2010; and
       d. Recent social unrest in Thailand in late 2009 and early 2010 delayed project
          implementation further.

6.       To ensure timely and satisfactory completion of the project by the extended closing
date, a detailed and realistic project work program (serving as an action plan) was reviewed
and accepted by the Bank. The activities still to be carried out are as follows:
         a. Bidding for and construction of livestock waste management facilities on 11
             participating farms;
         b. Carrying out two studies i.e. (i) Study on Utilization of Pig Farm Wastes for Crop
             Production and (ii) Study on Effects of Pig Waste Farms Treatment and
             Utilization on Human Health Risk;
         c. Carrying out monitoring and evaluation activities;
         d. Organizing study tours, public awareness raising and farmers training; and
         e. Preparing project completion report.

1.     The closing date for East Asia and Pacific, Livestock Waste Management in East
Asia Project, TF056520-TH, P079610 (Thailand Component) will be extended from
December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2011.

2.        The project status and reasons for implementation delays are discussed in the main
text of this Restructuring Paper. The proposed closing date extension is necessary to allow
DLD to complete all activities satisfactorily. DLD submitted a detailed and realistic project
work program (serving as an action plan) to ensure all project activities could be completed
satisfactorily by the extended closing date. The Bank has reviewed and accepted the project
work program.

3.     The requested extension of closing date will not affect the achievement of the project
development objective and the global environment objective, but rather will help ensure their
achievement.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project.
