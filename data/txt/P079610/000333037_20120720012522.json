Livestock Waste\n            Management (LWM) in East Asia Project for East Asia and\n            Pacific were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: livestock waste management technologies\n            should be simple to operate and compatible with the various\n            waste-handling practices and methods of livestock farms, be\n            cost-effective and offer financial returns and, be able to\n            be locally developed and serviced. A number of LWM\n            technologies exist, ranging from simple to complex, with\n            various cost implications that range from moderate to high.\n            As demonstrated by the project, selection of such technology\n            should be based on country specific conditions to ensure\n            acceptance, feasibility, efficiency and sustainability of\n            project investments. This project's comprehensive\n            approach integrated a suite of actions ranging from\n            demonstration of technical solutions, development of policy\n            development and improvement in enforcement, capacity\n            building and awareness-raising, to regional coordination and\n            dissemination. Successful demonstration of technical\n            solutions provided concrete waste management practices that\n            are financially viable, environmentally sound, socially\n            beneficial and locally accessible; showcasing what could be\n            studied and further replicated in the countries. Such\n            demonstration also formed the basis for development and\n            implementation of country specific policy actions such as\n            the replication strategies and improvement in environmental\n            enforcement. The needs and results of such demonstration\n            then helped refine capacity building activities to match the\n            actual needs, as did increased awareness among all\n            stakeholders, which improved acceptance of project\n            interventions and replication actions. Knowledge sharing\n            among the project countries and at the regional and global\n            levels was also a key."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
