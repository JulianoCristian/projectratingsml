Livestock Waste Management in East Asia Project
Ethnic Minority Development Plan for KOS Farm

    1. Introduction

Livestock Waste Management in East Asia Project addresses one of the most significant and
rapidly growing causes of land-based pollution in the South China Sea and the Gulf of
Thailand ­ environmentally unsustainable industrial-scale livestock production. The overall
objectives of the project is to reduce the negative local and global environmental impacts of
rapidly increasing livestock production in selected demonstration areas in China, Thailand, and
Vietnam. Specifically, the proposed project and its replication aims to reduce land-based
pollution from livestock production in Thailand and, consequently, in the international
waterways.

This project consists of four components: Component 1: Livestock Waste Management
Technology Demonstration; Component 2: Policy and Replication Strategy Development;
Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring; and Component 4: Regional
Support Services. The objective of the first component is to improve livestock waste
management technology demonstrations in livestock farming of different size, including the
establishment of improved quality of surrounding agricultural land. The second component
should lead to the development and implementation of policies for both livestock production
and waste management with strengthened and better-enforced regulations, more effective
institutions and financial incentives. The third component would result in efficient project
management and effective monitoring of political/institutional and environmental changes
brought about by the project. The last component would be the supportive organization and
develop decision support tools such as GIS, Cost of Compliance Simulation Model (CoSiMo)
and Nu-Flux Model then unifying these three countries parts as one project.

According to Strategy for Ethnic Minority Development Report by DLD submitted to the Bank
on 12 October 2004, it is necessary to develop ethnic minority development plans (EMDP) as a
"Safe Guard" measurement if impact causes were triggering.

KOS farm is one of the pig farms in Ratchaburi Province that participates in the demonstration
farm program in Component 1 of the project. The wastewater treatment system will be
constructed in this farm.

    2. Legal Framework

The current Constitution B.E. 2550 (2007), Section 30 states that there would be no
discrimination or prevention of cultural socialization to maintain the identity of ethnic
minorities especially the hill tribes. Article 3 in Section 30 pertains to all Thai citizens' rights
of and freedom from discrimination from living according to the culture of each ethnic
minority group.

                                                                                       P a g e  | 2 

 

"Every individual is equal in the eye of the law and is equally protected by law. Both men
and women have equal rights. Unjust discrimination against individuals because of the
difference in original place of birth, ethnicity, language, sex, age, physical or health condition,
individual status, socioeconomic status, religious belief, education, or political thoughts,
which are not against the Acts in the Constitution, cannot be done. The Section enacted to
alleviate obstacles or promote individuals' right and freedom at the same par with others is
not considered unjust discrimination (Article 3)."

Section 42 of the Constitution on land appropriation by the government, states that it cannot
be done without the authority of a specific Act for the purpose of public use, out of the
necessities such as to promote and protect the quality of the environment, to develop
agriculture for industry. The land return must be fairly compensated within timely period to
the owner including those who are negatively impacted by the land appropriation by the
government.

To set the compensation in a just manner, the factors to be considered are the normal selling
prices, condition and situation of the immovable properties and the lost of those whose land
must be returned. The law on land return must clearly specify the purpose and the period of
use of the immovable properties.

According to Section 66, pertaining to community's right," individuals who make up an
ethnic community have the right to conserve their culture, traditions, traditional knowledge,
local art and culture and to participate in the conservation and use of the environment in the
balanced and sustainable ways."

Working of Aliens Act, B.E. 2551 (2008) that covered the working regulation, registration
and permitted fee for alien worker.

    3. Baseline Information

In Thailand, there have been flows of immigrants mainly of mainland China for over three
hundred years. The gradual assimilation makes it difficult to differentiate the ethnic Thai and
ethnic Chinese Thai, who engage mainly in the business sector, and have gained high
economic status in the Thai society. Currently, the Thai comprise 75 percent, the Chinese 14
percent and other EMPs 11 percent of the total population of Thailand.

Other EMPs mainly include the Laotian in Northeast Thailand and the Vietnamese in a few
provinces in the Northeast. In the upland hilly borders in Northern Thailand, there are hill tribe
minorities, including the Karens, Lawas, Lahus, Akhas, Lisu, Hmong, Mien, Khamus and the
Phi Thong Luang.1 The Royal Thai Government (RTG) is concerned about their movement
across borders and the related issue of citizenship.

Ratchaburi Province there are eight ethic minority groups. They are: 1 Thai Pueng Tin; 2
Thai Chine; 3 Thai Yuan; 4. Thai Mon; 5 Thai Khmer Lao Derm; 6 Thai Lao Viane; 7 Thai
                                                            

                                                                                                          P a g e  | 3 

 

Karen; and 8 Thai Song Dum.2. All these groups have been settled in Thailand for so long that
they have attained Thai citizenship and are under the Thai Constitution. According to
information collected from local authorities the following Ethnic Minority People (EMP) are
located in the two demonstration sites selected during the project preparation phase:

rights in accordance to Section 30 of the Constitution and there are no impacts from the
Project.
