SUMMARY 
 
1. 
The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to extend the closing date of the GEF 
grant (TF056521-VN) under the GEF Regional Livestock Waste Management in East 
Asia Project by six months from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011. 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
2. 
Financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), this regional project covers 
three 
countries: Thailand, China and Vietnam. The project’s development objective 
(PDO) is to reduce the major negative environmental and health impacts of rapidly 
increasing concentrated livestock production on water bodies and thus on the people of 
East Asia. Its global environment objective is to reduce livestock-induced, land-based 
pollution and environmental degradation of the South China Sea. Separate grant 
agreements were signed with each participating country. In Vietnam, a US$2 million 
grant was signed on August 14, 2006. As of December 25, 2010, 48.5% of the US$2 
million GEF grant proceeds for Vietnam had been disbursed.   
3. 
The project implementing agency in Vietnam is the Ministry of Natural Resources 
and the Environment (MONRE).  The project is currently rated satisfactory in progress 
toward achievement of PDO and moderately satisfactory in overall implementation 
progress due mainly to slower-than-expected implementation progress in Vietnam. 
However, implementation in Vietnam is much improved since late 2009. By December 
25, 2010, four livestock waste management facilities have been completed and five 
facilities are under construction and are expected to be completed by March 1, 2011. The 
last group of three such facilities has been planned and the construction is expected to 
take about 3-4 months to complete. Full achievement of the appraisal targets of this grant 
at the end of extended closing date is very likely.     
PROPOSED CHANGE  
 
4. 
Closing date
.
The closing date of this project will be extended by six months 
from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011 to allow Vietnam to complete all activities 
satisfactorily. Implementation delays were caused by the following main factors: 
a. 
lack of experience of the Project Management Office (PMO) in early years of 
project implementation; 
b.  change of project area and relocation of project farms in Dong Nai province; 
c. 
Restructuring of MONRE in 2008 inactivated the PMO for more than six months; 
d.  Delay in provision of the committed government funding; and 
e. 
Delay in construction of livestock waste management facilities due to serious 
storms in 2009 and 2010; 
5. 
To ensure timely and satisfactory completion of the project by the extended 
closing date, a detailed and realistic project work program (serving as an action plan) was 
Page  4

reviewed and accepted by the Bank.  Specifically, the remaining activities and their 
expected completion times are:  
a. 
Ongoing construction of five livestock waste management facilities (with a total 
contract value over US$ 630,000) will be completed by no later than March 1, 
2011; 
b. 
Construction of three new livestock waste management facilities (with a total 
contract value over US$ 240,000) will be contracted by no later than February 1, 
2011 and completed by no later than June 1, 2011; 
c. 
Study tours, public awareness raising and farmers training (with a total contract 
value over US$ 210,000) will be completed by no later than June 20, 2011; and 
d.  PMO consultants and operating support (with a total budget over US$ 95,000) 
will be completed by June 30, 2011. 
 
6. 
Based on the agreed action plan, full achievement of the appraisal targets of the 
concerned GEF grant at the end of extended closing date is very likely.

1. 
The closing date for 
East Asia and Pacific, Livestock Waste Management in East 
Asia Project, TF056521-VN, P079610
 (Vietnam Component) will be extended
 
from 
December 31, 2010
to June 30, 2011
.
2. 
 Implementation status of this grant in Vietnam is discussed in the main text 
above.  The proposed closing date extension is necessary to allow MONRE to complete 
all activities satisfactorily. Reasons for implementation delays were discussed above.  
MONRE submitted a detailed and realistic project work program (serving as an action 
plan) to ensure all project activities could be completed satisfactorily by the extended 
closing date. The Bank has reviewed and accepted the project work program.  
3. 
The requested extension of closing date of this grant will not affect the 
achievement of the project development objective and the global environment objective, 
but rather will help ensure their achievements, in Vietnam. 
4. 
This will be the first extension of the GEF grant in Vietnam.
