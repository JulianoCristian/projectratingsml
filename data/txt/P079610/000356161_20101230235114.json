Implementation\n            delays were caused by the following main factors such as: 1)\n            lack of experience of the Project Management Office (PMO) in\n            early years of project implementation; 2) change of project\n            area and relocation of project farms in Dong Nai province;\n            3) restructuring of Ministry of Natural Resources and the\n            Environment (MONRE) in 2008 inactivated the PMO for more\n            than six months; 4) delay in provision of the committed\n            government funding; and 5) delay in construction of\n            livestock waste management facilities due to serious storms\n            in 2009 and 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
