                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall Project development objective is to reduce the major negative environmental and health impacts of rapidly increasing concentrated livestock
                         production on the open waters and thus on the people of East Asia. Its global environment objective is to reduce livestock-induced, land-based pollution and
                         environmental degradation of the South China Sea.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
