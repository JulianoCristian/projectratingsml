The\n            closing date of this project will be extended by six months\n            from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011 to allow Vietnam to\n            complete all activities satisfactorily. Implementation\n            delays were caused by the following main factors such as: 1)\n            lack of experience of the Project Management Office (PMO) in\n            early years of project implementation; 2) change of project\n            area and relocation of project farms in Dong Nai province;\n            3) restructuring of Ministry of Natural Resources and the\n            Environment (MONRE) in 2008 inactivated the PMO for more\n            than six months; 4) delay in provision of the committed\n            government funding; and 5) delay in construction of\n            livestock waste management facilities due to serious storms\n            in 2009 and 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
