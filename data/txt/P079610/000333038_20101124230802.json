Its global environment objective is to\n            reduce livestock-induced, land-based pollution and\n            environmental degradation of the South China Sea. The\n            purpose of this restructuring paper is to increase the\n            disbursement percentages for goods, consultant services and\n            training and workshops to 100 percent and to extend the\n            closing date of this grant by 12 months. The project\n            implementing agency in Thailand is the Department of\n            Livestock Development (DLD) of the ministry of agriculture\n            and cooperatives. The project is currently rated\n            satisfactory in progress toward achievement of PDO and\n            moderately satisfactory in overall implementation progress\n            due mainly to slower-than-expected implementation progress\n            in Vietnam. The Thailand portion of the project is to\n            support participating pig farms in establishment and\n            operation of livestock waste management facilities. By the\n            end of 2009, achievement of total number of standing pig\n            population (SPP) covered by farms adopting advanced\n            livestock waste management systems with project support and\n            the percentage of national SPP implementing improved\n            livestock waste management practices were on track. Full\n            achievement of the appraisal targets at the end of extended\n            closing date is very likely."}, "docdt": "2010-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
