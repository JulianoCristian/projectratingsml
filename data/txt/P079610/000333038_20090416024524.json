The Governments\n            of China (Guangdong Province), Thailand and Vietnam have\n            applied for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant for\n            support to promote livestock waste management in respective\n            countries to address the regional pollution problems from\n            increased growth and intensification of livestock industry\n            in the project countries. This environmental assessment\n            identifies potential environmental risks and proposes\n            measures to mitigate them. Temporary negative impacts,\n            believed to be minor, include: vegetation damage during\n            lagoon, or constructed wetland development for the\n            establishment of treatment facilities; temporary land\n            occupation at the construction sites; potential soil erosion\n            and corresponding increase in sediment load during\n            construction; and noise, air, and water pollution. Other\n            impacts expected during operation include: impact on water\n            resources (surface and groundwater due to percolation from\n            the bottom of lagoons, breakage of lagoon embankments (above\n            ground lagoons), overflow due to incidence of high intensity\n            rainfall lagoon capacity; soil pollution through improper\n            application of solid and liquid manure; explosion of biogas\n            tanks; overproduction of solid and liquid manure and lack of\n            available land or farmer willingness to apply the manure on\n            agricultural land, forcing direct discharge of partially\n            treated manure to surface water bodies; cumulative impact\n            from large manure treatment system (eutrophication, increase\n            in COD, coli forms, etc.); and potential health effects from\n            pathogens and parasites through the application of solid and\n            liquid manure. Mitigation measures include: watershed\n            management; applying best management practices and improving\n            enforcement in livestock manure treatment systems; and\n            control of point and non-point source pollution of water resources."}, "docdt": "2009-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
