1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country sector background Russia has 22 percent of global forest area, the largest in the world,
and 21 percent of the world's standing timber volume. Despite this, in 1990, forests and forest
products accounted for only 3.0 percent of the country's gross domestic product, 5.0 percent of
industrial output, and 9.0 percent of employment. A large part of forested areas occur in remote
fragile environments,. especially Siberia and the Far East, where the trees are slow growing.
Russia's forests have high biodiversity, including unique species; 85 percent of the 605 million ha
east of the Urals are covered with closed-stand forests, many of which remain unaffected by
industrial harvesting. The Federal Forest Service (FFS), a government agency funded from the
Federal budget, had overall responsibility for forest management and an established territorial
structure, including 81 Regional Forest Committees, 29 national, parks, and 1,740 forest
management districts called leskhozes. The FFS also ran a federal network of specialized
organizations for various aspects of forest management including inventory, fire and pest
protection, research, and training.
In the late J 990s, most of Russia's forest enterprises were private and ranged from timber
harvesting to advanced wood processing, pulp-and-paper, and furniture manufacturing. However,
some technologies, especially in the pulp-and~paper subsector, were environmentally damaging
and inefficient; many wood-based industries were isolated from economically accessible forests;
and overall round wood harvesting levels had fallen dramatically compared to pre-1990 levels
causing economic and social hardship and increasing pressure on more accessible forests, which
were cheaper to exploit. Following transition, 'the economic downturn and confusion about
forestry jurisdictions and responsibilities further damaged the sector: timber-harvesting levels
declined drastically as domestic demand for wood products fell from 300 million mJ in 1989-90
to 80 million m3 in 1997. Despite the decline, unsustainable harvesting practices, primarily large
blocks of dear-cutting, led to soil erosion and biodiversity losses in some areas. Also, wood
industry outputs had fal!endramatically, especially in pulp and paper subsectors.
A 1996 World Bank Russian Forest Policy Review whose conclusions were endorsed by the
Russian Government and further analytical work by the Russian authorities identified several key
constraint.s to recovery in the sector.
a) Financial and Economic Viability. Forest management was financed from the general budget,
 but since central government a!iocati<?ns did not cover management costs, local and regional
 forest services resorted to excessive 'sanitary feiling,' that is, clearing forests ostensibly for pest
and disease protection, since they could retain the revenues from these activities. Through lack of
 investment, enterprises' forest harvesting and processing equipment became obsolete and
environmentally damaging. Resource taxes were low, but a heavy and complex taxation system
burdened forest enterprises, which in tum was an impediment to raising resource taxes.
b) Regulatory Framework. The forest code provided guidelines for forest management, but these
needed to be adapted to the regions, and leasing conditions and forest user certification criteria for
sustainable forest management needed clarification.
c) Forest Management Plans. Outdated forest land-use plans needed to incorporate modem
concepts of landscape planning, ecosystem sustainability, local community participation, and
integrated inventory and management information systems. Forest management also needed to
better integrate forest regeneration.
d) Forest Protection. Since transition, fire and pest incidence increased dramatically, in part due
to financial shortages, and in part due to the resource allocation system, which provided
insufficient incentives for fire and pest monitoring, prevention; and management-as opposed to
fire fighting.
e) Forest Industry. Forest 'harvesting and processing enterprises lost domestic and traditional
export markets due to the economic downturn and confusion following the transition in the FSU
countries. Potential investors shied away from the sector, which was severely undercapitalized
and characterized by poor management practices, insufficient market orientation and equipment,
and deteriorating workforce skills. Potential for further processing and use of by-products was
underutilized.
f) Social Issues. Some of Rlissia's most socially and economically vulnerable communities live,in
remote regions and depend on forests for their livelihoods but declining output and rising
unemployment posed significant livelihood risk for many people. Traditionally, forest enterprises
were responsible for heating. education, and housing, but these were now divested to local
authorities.
Rationale for Bank support., Russian authorities requested World Bank involvement in the
forestry, sector to help establish sustainable management practices, demonstrate Government
commitment tO'improved forest management, and create a suitable environment for private sector
investment. More broadly, Bank support would demonstrate that the Bank itself was committed
to Russian forest management and conservation since Russian forests account for the largest
single· area of global forest-22 percent of the total, and the forests are key to carbon
sequestration, and to maintain biodiversity in fragile ecosystems. The 1991 World Bank Forest
Policy included the element of mUltipurpose sustainable forest management; by 2005, the World
Bank's senior management committed to increasing to 200 million ha the forested area under
independently verifiable sustainable management Finally, although other financing agencies
provided assistance to the forestry sector, none contributed to promote much-needed sector
reform.
Higher-level objectives. The Project supported key structural reforms that were critical to
restoring Russian economic growth 'and' poverty reduction, according' to the 1999 Country
Assistance Strategy, including the following: (a) strengthen public sector administration and
governance essential to manage a market economy; (b) establish an enabling environment for
private sector development; (c) strengthen the institutional framework to enforce existing laws;
and (d) establish and enforce regulations for environment and natural resources management.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project objectives were to improve public sector management of Russian forests, strengthen
the enabling environment for private sector involvement in forest utilization in participating
regions, and replicate the policy reforms and improved forest management practices outside the
participating regions. I

    1.3 Revised PD~ (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,and
    reasons/j ustification
 The PD~ was not revised. However, Key Indicators were revised on June 23, 2005. Key
 revisions included adding the phrase, " ... including voluntary forest certification and chain of
 custody ... " to Indicator no 2; increasing specificity to Indicators no. 3 and 5, and eliminating
 Indicator no. 4. The revised Key Indicators were included in the Loan Agreement amendment,
 signed by the Country Director. Revised Key Indicators were as follows:                         .
        Revised I. Significant increases in the level of forest revenue collected.
        Revised 2. Significant increase in the forest area covered by improved forest information
                   and management planning systems, including voluntary forest certification and
                   chain of custody.
        Revised 3. Significant increase in the forest area protected against large destructive forest
                   fires and massive proliferation of forest pests through improved communication
                   monitoring and management systems and supply of specialized equipment.
        Revised 5. Significant increase in the number of people trained in the use of modern forest
                   management, regeneration, and utilization techniques.                    .
        Revised 6. Procurement, disbursement, reporting and Project management undertaken
                   according to the agreed implementation plan and within the budget.
. The amendments in the Key Indicators reflect revisions in several components carried out on the
  same date (section 1.6).

 1.4 Main Benefic.aries
 The target population included the employees of enterprises and inhabitants of forest enterprise
 communities who would benefit from increased employment, enterprise managers, and potential
 investors. Beneficiaries included the Federal Forest Service (FFS), regional administrations,
 forest enterprises, and civil society, including NGOs and local communities, who would benefit
 from Project support for more transparent land-use practices.

 I.S Original Components (as approvet{)
 The Project consisted of three Components:
Component A: Support to sustainable public sector forest management (US$38.6mwith
US$30.5m IBRD and US$8.1 m Government of the Russiat:t Federation (GRF»3 aimed to support
forest policy improvements and sustainable forest management practices in the three pilot regions
of Leningrad Oblast, Krasnoyarsk Kray, and Khabarovsk Kray ("participating regions") for
development of new cost-effective models of forest management that are transparent to forest
users and local populations and replicable in other regions through: (i) Developing and regional .


J   Costs quoted are base costs without physical or price contingencies.



                                                             3
testing of improved market·oriented forest policies and regulations; (ii) improving forest
information and management planning; (iii) improving fire and pest management; (iv) improving
forest regeneration; and (v) replicating policy and management reform in other regions. This
component would contribute directly to Project objectives of improving public sector
management, and replicating policy reforms and improved forest management outside of the
participating regions. The FFS, with each of the pilot Regional Forest Committees, would have
technical responsibility for implementing this component.
Component B: Institutional Strengthening of Forest Enterprises (US$27.1 m with USS22.1 m
  IBRD and US$5.0m GRF) would provide loans to participating regions to finance classroom and
. practical training programs in improved forest harvesting and processing technologies, modem
  management and business practices, and improved utilization of non·timber forest products.
  Classroom training would take place in selected forestry educational institutions. For practical
  training, regional administrations would procure harvesting and processing equipment and lease it
  to selected enterprises, where the training would be provided. Enterprises that send staff to either
  type of training would pay a fee determined on a cost·recovery basis. This component would
  directly support the PD~, "strengthen the enabling environment for private sector involvement in
  forest utilization," by addressing two major challenges faced by the forest sector in the early
  2000s: (i) severe shortage of qualified managers for· forest sector production based on market
  principles combined with environment-friendly and rational forest use; and (ii) technological lag
 of forest sector enterprises. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) would on· lend loan proceeds to
  regional administrations, which would implement their programs with support from the Project
  Implementation Unit (PIU): the Foundation for Enterprise Restructuring (FER).
Component C: "Project Management and Implementation" (US$2.9m with US$2.9m IBRD)
would finance the services of FER as PIU, which would support core implementing agencies
(FFS and Regional Administrations) in project management, including. procurement, financial and
expenditure management; and project coordination, reporting, and monitoring. Efficient Project
management would ensure achievement ofplan ned Project outputs, outcomes, and the PDO.
1.6 Revised Components
Subcomponent AS, "Replication of policy and management reform to other regions," was
amended in 2003 and renamed, "Training and replication of policy and management reforms," to
support training activities in recognition of problems implementing Component B. Subcomponent
activities became: (i) training in support of institutional and policy development; (ii) technical
training in support of main Project objectives; (iii) distance learning; and (iv) sustainable forest
utilization. These activities were fully consistent with the PD~. Additionally, there were nine
Loan Agreement amendments:
1. June 2005
    •   Extend Project Closing Date from September 30, 2005 to September 30 2007.
    •   Increase counterpart financing for Component A by USS30 million.
    •   Revise Component B to provide loans to forestry enterprises in participating regions for
        sub·projects to strengthen enterprise capacity to use modem equipment for forest
        harvesti.ng, timber processing, and non-wood forest product processing; and testing and
        imptementingmodern forest utilization and forest enterprise management techniques.
        MOF would on· lend loan proceeds through an authorized Government agent, later
        determined to be the State Specialized Russian Export·lmport Bank (RoseximbanI<:). FER
        would continue to function as PIU ..
    •   Update key' indicators (Section 1.3).




                                                  4
    The Project added the Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts and the Republic of Buryatia as new
    "participating regions;" all three 4 had experienced major wildfire damage. Expanding
    "participating regions" did not require a Loan Agreement amendment.
    2. October 2005. Policy aspects of Component A retained with MNR; financial aSpects
        transferred to Federal Forestry Agency (FFA). This amendment followed the 2004
        establishment of FFA as a separate executive .agency, creating a two..;level ll1anagement
        system for Component A-MNR for policy and financial aspects,. and FFA for conceptual
        and technical aspects, which led to complex bureaucratic procedures for Project payments
        untt! the amendment resolved this.                                 .
    J. July 2007. Unallocated funds were reallocated to project management and Component A.
    4. September 2007. Closing date extended to 15 December 2007; funds reallocated from one
        disbursement category to another.
    5. December 2007. Closing date extended to 15 February 200S.
    6. February 200S. Closing date extended to 31 March 200Sand funds reallocated to another
        disbursement category.
    7. March 200S. Closing date extended to 15 May 2008.
    The brief extensions listed under (4)-(7) above were agreed to allow the implementing agency
    prepare and obtain Government approval for a major Project restructuring, involving significant
    counterpart funding increase, which occurred in May 200S.                -' .
    S. May200S.
       •Extend closing date to 30 November 2009.
       •
       Component B: transfer PIU function from FER to Roseximbank to avoid duplication of
       administrative functions and allow Project funding for environmental and technological
       assessments and feasibility studies of sub~projects.
   • USS l2.3miltion increase in counterpart financing (of which USSIO million towards
       Component A, about SI.3 million towards Component C, and SI.0 million towards
       Component B to cover all administration costs related to that Component).
9. October-November 2009. Closing date extended for some Component B sub-projects and
   some Component A contracts until May 31, 2010. COl1lponent B cancellation for USS6.94
   million.

1.7 Other significant changes None.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and-Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of the background analysis. Project design was based on a thorough 1996 World Bank
Russian Forest Policy Review, which identified key sector bottlenecks. Nevertheless, Project
appraisal was delayed until September 1999 due to Russia's 1995 fi.nancial crisis, among other
factors, aod project implementation did not begin until 2002. By 2002, the background analysis
was much less relevant due to many changes, including new institutional arrangements and forest
enterprises' access to capital.
Lessons from -earlier operations taken into account. At Project appraisal, only one - forestry
project, the Poland Forest Development Support Project, had been completed in the ECA Region.


4   In this document "region" refers to all members of the Russian Federation, including republics, oblasts, and krays.


                                                             5
The PAD cited lessons leamed, identified in the June 1999 Project Implementation Completion
Report: "(a) In countries with strong forest traditions (like Poland and Russia) the benefits of
Bank assistance to the sector tie more in introduction of modem technologies and institution
strengthening than in expanding production; (b) the introduction of forest management
innovations must be accompanied by clear evidence of their advantages; and (c) institutional
development activities need to emphasize economic ,and financial sustainability." Of the above
(a) was incorporated in Project design by emphasizing modem efficient harvesting and processing
technologies; (b) through training activities built into Project design; and (c) through technical
assistance on better pricing, valuation, and financial management techniques.
The PAD also cited natural resource management sector strategies from the East Asia Region that
emphasized the importance of policy and institutional reform and national consensus for this in
restoring growth and sustainability. The Project design included significant technical assistance
(TA), including stakeholder workshops to support institutional ..reform and consensus building.
Another lesson leamed was the need for implementation readiness. As stated in the PAD, an
implementation plan and bidding documents had been prepared for the first year's contracts, but
significant risk for Project readiness was an emerging issue-the lack of credit-worthiness among
regions selected for sub-loans under Component B (see next section).
 The rationale for Bank support,as articulated in the PAD was sound (Section 1.1 above). The
 Project design was not complex in geographic termS; the three pilot regions, while geographically
 dispersed, were manageable due to Russia's well-developed administrative system. However,
 because the Project design was based on preparation work done during the late 199Os, by Project
 effectiveness in 2002, the design no longer corresponded to sectoral institutional and legal
 realities. The new forest authority was interested in equipment to fight fires and pest infestations,
 but showed less interest in the T A planned during Project appraisal. Furthermore, TAwas to be
 provided through large consultancy contracts, whJch proved to be too rigid and slow to guide
 ongoing policy elaborations. Finally, under the 2001 )3udget Code, insolvent regions were
,ineligible to receive State loans; which meant Component B could no longer be implemented as
 originally envisaged. Government commitment was adequate as evidenced by several key
 ministries' and FFS's active participation in Project preparation; Participatory processes during
 Project preparation were adequate as evidenced. by the impressive list of consultations with many
 regional and central' goverriment, non-government, and academic institutions and international
 organizations active inthe Russian forest sector.                                   "
Assessment of risks and mitigation. measures. The PAD identified eight risks that were rated
'substantial' or 'modest'. Two of these risks,. "regional legislators face political constraints in
passing regional forest legislation," and, "there may be delays in procurement and inadequate
project reporting," delayed project implementation. Repeated changes to institutions and policies
delayed Project .effectiveness and implementation. Aware of policy/regulatory instability, the
team preparing the Project sought to keep the Project design simple; however, in retrospect this
risk could have been articulated explicitly in the PAD. Participating regions' questionable credit..
worthiness to receive sub-loans under Component B was recognized under Section F, "Possible
Controversial Issues," but not identified as a risk factor. However, it was stated that,"If by 30th
June 2000 no formal decision has been made regarding eligibility/creditworthiness of an
individual region, the Borrower would begin to identify alternative regions which meet eligibility
criteria. To avoid excessive delay, a date of six months after effectiveness was agreed as the final
date for presentation of subsidiary loans to the Bank from additional regions." Considering that.
selected regions might not quality for sub-loans, it would have been worthwhile to explore
Project risk and other regions' solvency levels at appraisal.

2.2 Implementation
In May 2000, the Project was approved by the World Bank Board of Directors; it became
effective in May 2002, 1.5 years later the date originally planned. Effectiveness was delayed
because, soon after Board approval, Government carried out a major reform of its environmental
assessment institutions, which. World Bank management considereda,s an environmental
safeguards risk, and implementation responsibility was transferred fromFFS, which prepared the
Project, to the newly established Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). The delay in
effectiveness led to a significant loss of mqmentum.Project implementation stretched over nearly
eight years until Project closure in May 2010; reasons for this are discussed below, as are factors
that influenced Components A and B implementation.
Component A implementation suffered from: 0) frequent institutional changes resulting in
administrative complications; and (ii),an evolving forest policy environment. The Project became
effective in March 2002, but Project staff appointments within the MNR were not completed until
mid-2003; consequently, the first Part A contract was not signed until December 2003. In 2004, a
Federal Forest Agency (FF A) responsible for forest management was established an(l tasked with
managing Project technical aspects; MNR retained responsibility for Project policy-related and
financial aspects. This restructuring significantly slowed disbursements because under this two-
level management structure, MNR paid for goods arid services and FFA received them, which
mad~ supplier payments nearty impossible. Finally,in October 2005, a Loan Agreement
amendment transferred Project financial management to FFA, which accelerated new contract
signings and disbursements. In May 2008, FFA was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture,
which had no adverse impact on Project implementation.
The procured firefighting equipment was highly appreciated, which led Government to increase
its share of project funding from 19.5 percent" to 48.7 percent and in~rease the number of
participating regions. Equipment bought for the European regions where fires. raged in the
summer of 2010 was used to fight them. The Bank team provided timely, cutting-edge advice to
FFA counterparts. On the other hand, planned large consultancy contracts/proved too inflexible to
respond to counterparts' fast changing needs in a .fluid policy and institutional environment.
P·rocurement of consulting services for training and technical assistance for management planning
was slow at times because Government interest in technical assessment wavered, and content had
to change in response to the sntfting policy and institutional environments.
 In January 2007, a new Forest Code was enacted, which decentralized forest management from
the FF A to regional administrations and abolished regional FFA fire management branches. As a
consequence, some equipment already contracted for FFA for its fire management branclles was
delivered to remaining FF A subordinate organizations, such as forest· colleges or the Pest
Management S€rvice, which were not necessarily the highest priority organizations for the.
equipment. Also a planned greenhouse could not be established and Project-promoted distance
learning activities could not be continued. ThechJ'!.nges also led to the lay-off of some Project-
trained FFA staff, negatively impacting Project sustainability. More generally in terms of forest
management effectiveness in Russia, not all regions had. the capaGity or the resources to shoulder
their new responsibilities. The reform also led to the absence of a central cOQrdinating authority,
which was felt during the 2010 forest fires when movement of personnel from Russia's faJ:
eastern regions to western regions where the fires· raged. was delayed~ In the .wake of the reform
the Bank agreed to additional counterpart-funded activities, whkh would contribute to
strengthening of the regional administrations. However, these could not compensate fully for
institutional changes invoked by the new Forest Code.
Component B implementation was delayed significantly and the Project closed before all
investments were completed. The on-lending mechanism devised during Project preparation was



                                                7
rendered unworkable, even before Project effectiveness, by the 2001 Budget Code, which
prohibited state lending to insolvent regions. An alternative direct on-lending process to forestry
companies was agreed in principle during the December 2003 mission, via Vneshtorgbank, a
Government-owned bank for external trade, but the agreement was never given final approval by
Government. In addition, there was little interest in the loans offered on Project terms among
potential beneficiaries in the regions; eligible activities lacked appeal and forest' companies'
access to credit had improved markedly since the late 1990s when the Project was conceived. As
a result, Component B was largely inactive; in June 2005, the Project was rated Unsatisfactory,
and was restructured to on-lend to forestry enterprises for a broader range of environment friendly
investments, through Roseximbank. This change increased the level of interest from forest
companies. However, implementation delays continued because most companies could not meet
requirements for collateral, feasibility studies, and environmental assessments set by the Ministry
of Finance and the World Bank, or comply with the complex and overlapping review and
supervision procedures involving the Rosexirnbank and FER. The May 2008 amendment of the
Loan Agreement addressed some of these problems by transferring PiU functions from FER to
Roseximbank and allowing Project funds to be used to hire consultants to prepare feasibility
studies and environmental and technological assessments for candidate sub-projects. Nevertheless,
difficult collateral requirements continued to be a hurdle. Of the 26 proposals submitted to
Roseximbank in 2005-09, i i passed initial eligibility screening and 5 were awarded contracts.
Disqualifications resulted from companies' inability provide valid collateral,5 reluctance to
disclose financial information, and bankruptcies or changes in short-term investment priorities.
Of the five sub-loan agreements signed, two were later cancelled because the companies could
not meet disbursement conditions. For the remaining three SUb-projects, long disbursement delays
ensued due to complex institutional procedures during 2005-08 for approving. disbursements,
delayed sub-project approval by the World Bank, and sub-borrower delays in meeting
effectiveness and disbursement conditions. Although, disbursements improved in 2009-2010, this
unimpressive result suggests that the Project might have been better closed in 2007.
Despite the initial delays and significant institutional changes, Government remained committed
to the goals of the Project and sought to replicate the Project's results in the other regions, as
evidenced by repeated increases in counterpart contribution to the Project. Numerous project
extensions are not unusual in the Bank's Russian Federation portfolio; when Government is
satisfied with a Project approach, it prefers to increase counterpart funding rather than initiate a
new program, which would entail serious bureaucratic challenges. in this case, at Project dosing
Government financing was 338 percent of the appraisal estimate (Annex 1). That said, lengthy
project implementation -in this case, eight years- poses an administrative challenge for financing
Bank implementation support,

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Impiementation and Utilization
Design. Annex 1 of the PAD lists M&E indicators that were aligned with the Key Indicators for
the PDO, and annual target values. The PAD also provides details of M&E arrangements.
Indicator data were easily available from regional and federal forest authorities. Most Key
Indicators were appropriate to measure progress towll.rds achieving the PDO, except No. I,
"Significant increase in forest revenue," since forest revenuJ;:s are affected by many other factors,
notably, the state of the economy. furthermore, the PAD discussion of project activities suggests
an assumption that passing regulations to improve pricing and financial management would lead



.5 Under Ministry of Finance regulations. collateral may include movable property with depreciation of no more than 70
percent, however in Russia. forestry sector equipment depreciation is significantly higher, and equipment owned by
most enterprises is normally already collateralized with commercial banks.

to higher revenues. However, since the Project had little influence on legislative processes,
anticipating revenue increases as early as year 2 of the Project proved unrealistic.
Implementation and utilization: Appropriate data were collected during implementation to gauge
the Key Indicators and reported in project status reports. Some indicators were used to plan
project activities, including training and acquiring equipment for fire management, which were to
be carried out with additional counterpart financing from the Borrower.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environmental Safeguards. The Project was Category B and triggered the following safeguards.
The environmental assessment (EA) found that Project environmental impacts would be positive
and include: improved forest land-use planning; better- focus on ecology and biodiversity;
improve:d regulations for sustainable fire management; and testing alternate certification
approaches. Improved forest protection would include protection from fires; tr~ining in improved
forest utilization technologies would include higher environmental standards that· would reduce
waste and damage from forest utilization;· and increased carbon storage would provide global
benefits. Environmental risks identified by the EA were linked to non-compliance with existing
certification, permitting, and licensing standards for goods procurement. No major risks were .
associated with works since they were. limited to establishing a forestry nursery. Compliance with
applicable World Bank and Russian policies and legislation and environmental due diligence in
implementation were to be specified in bidding documents and the Project loan agreement. The
FER, working with the Regional Environmental Committees, was responsible to ensure full
compliance with safeguards.
After Component B was restructured to support an enterprise on-lending operation, an
environmental management plan (EMP) was required as part of the sub-loan application. The
implementing agency and the World Bank reviewed the EMPs and compliance. Compliance
remained satisfactory throughout the Project life. It would have been helpful if mission Aide
Memoires had documented supervision activity to justify the "Satisfactory" rating.
Procurement. There were no serious procurement problems; this PIU is the most experienced in
Russia and has sufficient capacity;· procurement management was generally acceptable. From
April 2008, the Russian state bank Roseximbank implemented Project Part B under commercial
practice procedure. During Project implementation, significant delays in procurement
implementation cropped up periodically, relative to agreed dates, primarily due to institutional
restructuring that led to administration changes and lack of authorized signatories for
procurement documents, evaluation reports, and contracts. No serious problems were detected
during regular post reviews, no misprocurement was declared during Project implementation, and
no complaints were received.
Financial Management (FM). Overall, FM was satisfactory. Originally FER carried out FM
functions for the entire Project. Starting from 2008, Roseximbank assumed these functions for
Component B, while FER continued to perform FM for Components A and C. There were no
significant issues with FER; the only issue with Roseximbank was late submission of quarterly
financia·! monitoring reports in the absence of disbursements following the amendment of the
Project Part B implementation arrangements in 2008, which was resolved as disbursements
resumed in late 2009. Balances on Special Accounts were fully documented; FER and
Roseximbank returned unused funds to the World Bank; the final audit reports were submitted by
Roseximbank and FER before the deadline. All audit reports were unqualified and management
letters raised no significant issues.

Implementation arrangements. The 2007 Forest Code decentralized most forest management
functions to regional administrations, therefore, the key Project beneficiary should be regional
administrations.
Financing arrangements. During the Project life, Government significantly increased counterpart
financing, demonstrating that a Bank loan can leverage substantially more budgetary resources
for Project objectives than anticipated.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The Project Development Objective was achieved partially, as the discussion below illustrates on
the basis of Key Performance indicators and associated Project activities.
Component A
The regulatory and methodological materials produced as outputs of Sub-component AI.
"Improvement of Forest Policy" may contribute to an integrated strategy for long-term
sustainable forest use, including reducing roundwood harvest and sale through implementing
deep, waste-free wood processing, and reducing illegal wood harvesting, which may increase
State forest revenues in the long term. However, it is unclear whether Project activities increased
revenues during the Project life (Revised Key Indicator No. I): Most contracts under this sub-
component were completed during 2006·07, so results could have manifested as early as 2008;
instead, revenues fell in 2008 compared to 2007. More importantly, most regulations drafted
under Sub-component A I that were designed to increase forestry revenues were never adopted.
Furthermore, many other factors, such as overall demand for wood products would have affected
revenues. Available region-level revenue data are inconclusive (Table I in Annex 2).
Subcomponents A I and A2 were associated with the Revised Key Indicator No.2 "Significant
increase in forest area covered by improved forest information and management planning systems,
including voluntary forest certification and chain of custody." Subcomponent A I strengthened the
enabling environment in Russia for: broader application of private voluntary certification systems,
through workshops and training, including those of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the
Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes (PEFC). The FSC had been active
in Russia since the early 2000s and had certified 23 million ha by January I, 20 I O. The PEFC-
based Russian National Forest Certification Council was launched in 2009 and had certified
200,000 ha by May I 20 I O. Competition is expected to reduce the cost of certification and
increase the number of certified forest enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized
companies. These developments will expand consumption of verified wood and reduce
consumption of illegal wood, thereby raising tax and forest revenues.
Sub-component A2 Key Indicator was met. Monitoring system modernization at the Federal
Forest Protection Service increased from 37.8 million ha in 2007 to 85 million ha in 2009, the
areas covered by forest pest monitoring based on remote sensing data in high/medium pest threat
zones. Some 529.8 million ha are now covered by pest monitoring in all forest types. Equipment
provided to the Federal Aerial Forest Fire Protection Service improved satellite fire monitoring
on 559.1 million ha; laser and satellite equipment provided to .forest inventory enterprises will
improve surveys and management planning on 840 thousand ha of forests and is expected to lead
to a J5-20 percent reduction in the cost of inventory development. However, planned integrated
information and log-tracking systems were not developed. Consequently the information systems
for inventory, land-use planning, and monitoring fires and pests now use different rules and
approaches.



                                               11
Sub-component A3 "Improvement of fire and pest management" was the most successfully
implemented part of the Project and largely achieved its objective as measured by Revised Key
Indicator No. 3 "significant increase in the forest area protected against large destructive forest
fires and massive proliferation of forest pests through improved communication, monitoring, and
management systems, and supply of specialized equipment." Project~procured specialized
firefighting equipment for 45 mechanized crewslfire-chemical stations operate in eight" regions
with a total area of 80 million ha. Twenty forest management units of Moscow Oblast were
equipped with truck tractors w/trailers, which were used during the 2010 fires. However, some
firefighting equipment was unsuitable for local conditions in Russia's Far East; for example,
tractors were not powerful enough. In the Far East and in Krasnoyarsk, water-tank trailer
instability has emerged as a problem. Some beneficiaries indicated that the specifications used in
the international competitive bidding documents may have been too general, although the
specifications were prepared .with input from the regions. The Project improved radio
communication in seven regions, including 257 leskhozes and 102 aviation forest protection
units, by procuring radio stations with different frequency ranges, 343 antenna masts, and 8
service laboratories for ground and air forest firefighting. These measures facilitated better
firefighting, prompt decision-making and fire suppression over 325 million ha. Implementing
reliable radio communication among aU forest protection subdivisions and firefighting units
contributed significantly to improved firefighting safety and enhanced the efficiency of measures
against illegal logging. However, evidence from the Russian Far Eastern Region suggests, that so
far, local markets have been unable to provide spare parts for the Australian-manufactured radio
equipment, which is problematic for radio operation and maintenance.
Finally, equipment, services and training provided to 14 regional subdivisions of the Federal
Forest Protection Service has improved forest monitoring and pest management on 529.8 million
ha, including300.0 million ha in the zone of high/medium pest threat in 32 Regions. Delivery and
implementation of all-terrain forest pest complexes made it possible to increase the area covered
annually by forest pest surveys by 270 thousand ha. Implementing aerial survey hardware and
software will improve the quality of verification of fire-damaged forestlands and expand this area
to 500 thousand ha per annum.
Subcomponent A4 was partially successful in achieving its objective: "Improvement of forest
regeneration" by upgrading of the Krasnoyarsk Krai Forest Seed Center with state-of-the-art seed
germination and quality control equipment, which will significantly increase seed quality and
reduce losses due to sowing. non standard seeds. It creates potentialfor International Seed Testing
Association accreditation, which could bring substantial revenues. The SUb-component did not
fund civil works for improved regeneration practices in Khabarovsk and Leningrad as initially
planned, but a standard plan with technical specifications for a greenhouse complex in the
Leningrad Oblast was prepared. Fire-devastated forests in Khabarovsk were not regenerated.
Revised Key Indicator No. 5 was partially achieved: "Significant increase in the number of
people trained in the use of modern forest management, regeneration, and utilization techniques."
Subcomponent AS "Training and replication of policy and management reforms" financed 33
workshops, training courses and study tours on issues related to public forest management, forest
and pest management, forest certification, sustainable forest use, and computer literacy, training a
total of 2,445 individuals. Furthermore, forestry colleges under FF A were equipped with modern
forest survey/measurement instruments and one set of machinery (harvester, forwarder, and
simulator). Of two planned training activities on modern forest fire management, a seminar was
carried out in Khabarovsk in 2003. The second activity, a study tour to the USA was cancelled
under the Project; but later carried out with Government funding following an itinerary that was
developed under the Project. Fewer than planned training activities were carried out under
Component B (see below).



                                                12
ComponentB
The PDO related to Component B was only partially achieved, primarily because fewer training
workshops were carried out by the end of Project implementation. Implementation delays meant
that some equipment procured under the three sub-projects was not yet installed or fully
operational at Project close; also, hands-on training for specialists did not occur as planned.
However, a sub-borrower company, Novovyatski Ski Factory, provided internships for 22
forestry school students and hired eight of them as staff; and information was widely
disseminated on the financial benefits of the new technology the Novovyatski Ski Factory
adopted-through presentations at industry workshops, publications, and site visits. There have
been reports of four other companies replicating the practice of using wood-waste to heat drying
kilns, and as many as 26 other Russian companies have expressed interest in adopting wood-
waste and energy saving equipment demonstrated by this sUb-project. Furthermore, 13 forest
companies received Project support to prepare feasibility studies, which they can use to apply for
loans. Finally, there were modest improvements in .me "enabling environment for private sector
involvement in forest utilization" as indicated by reports from the two beneficiary companies on
their energy and cost savings, reduced wood waste, and increased market opportunities.

3.3 Efficiency
Analysis of the efficiency of the Project's largest procurement in firefighting equipment is not
possible due to short period that has elapsed since the investment and the large number of
extraneous factors that impact forest fires and their impact. On the other hand, investments in
improved seed selection, inventory and pest management techniques appear to be highly efficient
(Annex 3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Project was generally successful in modernizing forest fire fighting, pest management, and
seed selection capacity, although sustainability of the outcomes could be undermined by some
equipment inadequacies and significant institutional changes. Nevertheless, further enhancing this
capacity remains highly relevant for Russia, which faces frequent widespread wild fires. The
impact of Component B was limited due to the fewer than planned demonstration enterprises and
training courses during the Project life span.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Some Project outputs will generate local employment and help reduce poverty. Sub-loans to two
forestry enterprises improved their market share and ability to provide employment to local
people. Also, training Lisino Forestry College students in modem harvesting technologies in
Leningrad Oblast will improve their chances of employment in forestry companies.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Project strengthened institutional capacity for forest fire and pest management and seed
selection. However, some impacts and sustainability are compromised by some inadequate
firefighting equipment, inadequate maintenance, unavailability of spare parts, incomplete training,
and job losses among FF A regional staff trained under the Project when forest management
functions were decentralized to Regional Administrations following the 2007 amendment of the
Forest Code. The Project strengthened Rosexill!bank's capacity to work with forest enterprises
under international fiduciary and environmental safeguards.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative). None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary surveys or stakeholder workshops were not carried out.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The prospects for sustaining and replicating the development outcome achieved by the Project are
good, in particular with respect to improved forest fire management due to Government's interest
in a follow-on Project with substantial counterpart financing. Also, demonstrated profitability of
enhanced wood processing in forestry enterprises will likely lead to its continued use by the
beneficiary enterprises and possible adoption by other enterprises.

5, Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank worked closely with Russian counterparts to identify solutions to a broad range of
Russian forest sector challenges-policy, economic, financial management, technical, and
environmental issues. The team carried out considerable preparatory work to ensure that the
Project addressed issues specific to each of the proposed participating regions. The Bank worked
to address the key need for improved skills for a more environment-friendly approach to forest
processing. However, the Bank may have paid insufficient attention to risks, notably policy
vo~atmty, and insolvency among participating regions; later, these emerged as major impediments
to timely implementation.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank provided cutting edge advice on sustainable forest management and established strong
working relationships with technical counterparts. The Bank provided significant technical
assistance by sharing global experience in policy discussions, reviewing terms of reference, plans,
specifications, and consultant outputs. Nevertheless, in some instances, the Bank could have
reviewed procurement packages, SUb-project training plans, and operating manuals in a more
timely and more thorough manner. With respect to Component B, management oversight may not
have been fully adequate in ensuring quality of design of the new arrangements following the
June 2005 amendment of the legal agreement. In 2007, when disbursement under the Component
was still minimal, the Bank should have worked with the Borrower to close the Project. During
the ten year period from Board approval to Project closing, the Project had four task team leaders,
which is not unusually high given Bank staff rotation rates; there was continuity and sustained
institutional memory in the team supervising the Project, and each TTL was able to quickly grasp
Project issues. Supervision was thorough; the team visited the regions often and worked with
counterparts to identify solutions to implementation problems as they emerged. The team
displayed flexibility in amending Project activities as needs arose, such as including the
Arkhangelsk as a participating region. The Bank team's procurement and financial management
specialists were based in Moscow, which facilitated daily interaction with the implementing
agency.


                                                14
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall, the World Bank preparation and implementation support teams transferred cutting edge
knowledge to government counterparts to design a Project that met forestry sector needs and
informed institutional reforms. Supervision was thorough and flexible. More attention could have
been paid to resolving the design issues that paralyzed Component B, particularly changes in the
Budget Code in 200 I. The Bank should have been more determined in closing the Project in 2007
when it was clear that loans to the forestry sector did not respond to a need and were not
contributing to the PD~ in a substantial way. The supervision team was sometimes slow to
respond to counterpart procurement requests for no objections and not thorough enough in
reviewing critical operating manuals and training plans.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Borrower was committed to the Project throughout the eight year implementation period
despite delays caused by policy and institutional changes. The Ministry of Finance (MOF)
managed and supervised the Project on behalf of the Government of the" Russian Federation;
MOF worked with the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and later the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA), the PIU, Roseximbank, and the World Bank to adjust Project activities and
implementation arrangements in response to continuous institutional changes in the forestry
sector, so the Project closed successfully despite long delays. However, these adjustments were
insufficient to prevent delays in Component B implementation. More generally, MOF could also
have considered closing the Project in 2007; when Component A had nearly completely disbursed
and largely achieved its objectives,and state loahs were no longer relevant in a period of high
growth.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
MNR and subsequently MOA and their subordinate Federal Fdrestry Agency were in charge of
implementing Component A worked to adjust Project activities to continuous institutional and
policy changes. Investments in forest fire and pest management were largely a success, but
several key T A activities were neglected.
The Foundation/or Enterprise Restructuring (FER) acted"as PIU, initially for the entire Project,
and from 2008 for Component A only. The FER adequately carried out daily Project and financial
management, and procurement; for Component B, it assisted potential sub-borrowers to prepare
feasibility studies and environmental management plans, which increased the number of
completed applications.
As the financial intermediary for on-lending Component B funds to forestry enterprises from
2005 to Project close, and the PIU for this Component from 2008 Roseximbank built a pipeline of
SUb-projects and largely disbursed Project funds allocated to the Component, albeit only to two
enterprises for reasons discussed above. Roseximbank appropriately engaged consultants because
it lacked familiarity with World Bank procurement procedures or appreciation for Project
environmental sustainability; Roseximbank could have made more effort to ensure that training
was more fully embraced in the sub-project-s it supported.




                                              15
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall, the Borrower displayed commitment to large parts of the Project, as evidenced also by
increased counterpart funding. Policy and institutional changes that are partly responsible for the
Project implementation delays and reduced institutional sustainability were largely beyond the
control of the agencies involved in the Project. On the other hand, some choices made by these
agencies, such as negligence of critical T A activities, prevented the Project from achieving its
PDO fully.

6. Lessons Learned
•   During rapid changes to policy and institutions, providing just-in-time policy advice is more
    helpful to counterparts than large consultancy contracts, which in this case were stalled by a
    quality and cost-based selection method. Rapid policy and institutional changes rendered
    existing TORs redundant and revising them created even longer delays. Small flexible
    contracts, may be more useful and attractive to clients under such conditions and Bank project
    teams should respond rapidly to provide cutting edge advice to clients.
•   Key PDO indicators should be linked specifically to Project activities, unaffected by
    exogenous, confounding factors, and achievable within the Project lifespan. For example, it
    was believed      "increase in forestry revenues" would result from regulations drafted in the
    Project design. However, adoption and implementation of new regulations is a prolonged
    process and both may be incomplete before Project closing. Furthermore, forest revenues
    depend largely on demand for wood products and the overall state of the economy, over
    which the Project had no control.
•   Multiple layers        implementing agencies should be avoided; involving multiple
    implementing agencies created bureaucratic overlaps and slowed Project implementation. If
    several agencies must be involved, responsibilities should be clearly delineated.
•   Modernizing forest harvesting and processing remains relevant for Russian forestry
    enterprises, but the Project demonstrated that on-lending under a Bank-funded project may
    not be the best instrument to achieve this objective. Much effort, possibly beyond the scope·
    of a 5-year Bank-financed project, is needed for a commercial or state-owned bank to adapt
    to World Bank procurement procedures or to fully understand the focus on Development
    Objectives and need to follow the Bank's safeguards policies. Furthermore, if forest
    enterprises have affordable access to commercial credit, a Bank-funded State loan program,
    with complex requirements and slow procedures, is not competitive.
•   Procurement of firefighting equipment helped meet a significant upgrading need in forest
    fighting capacity in fire-prone Russia, as evidenced by the Govemment' s large additional
    contribution to counterpart financing to replicate it in more regions than originally planned.
    As the 2010 fires showed there is room for further replication in other regions. Procurement
    specifications for forest firefighting and other equipment should not be insufficiently detailed
    to address regional differences. Easy availability of spare parts should be factored in
    equipment selection criteria.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrowerllmplementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/impiementing agef!cies.
Roseximbank comments. With regard to training under sub-projects, the Bank feels that since
training remained a Component B objective, it was Roseximbank's responsibility to ensure that


                                                16
sub-borrowers provided ~uch training. However, the Bank agrees that Bank supervision should
have been more thorough in reviewing existence of sub-project training plans. There appears to
be a difference of opinion between the Roseximbank and the Bank on the suitability of a World
Bank funded credit line for forest enterprises, which is rellected in the lessons learnt section of
the main ICR and that of the iCR provided by Roseximbank.

                              Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A.
This Component had five sub-components: (I) improve forest policy; (2) improve forest
information and management planning systems; (3) improve fire and pest management; (4)
improve forest regeneration; and (5) training and replication of policy and management reforms.

Sub-component AI. Improve forest policy
Most planned outputs were delivered. These include:
a) Support pilot voluntary forest certification schemes. Project-funded analytical work,
workshops, and trainings helped develop a national voluntary forest certification (FCR) system
endorsed by the international Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes
(PEFC), and Government formally adopted voluntary forest certification standards. The FCR was
promoted through media outlets and workshops; 25 specialists were trained in PEFC-FCR forest
certification procedures and many more received hands-on training during the Forest Stewardship
Council certification exercises. As of May I, 2010, some 23 million ha of forest was certified
(mainly under the FSC global system), of which some 200,000 ha are now certified under the
recent Russian national voluntary forest certification system.
b) Develop regulations and methods to improve forest land lease, payment, and financial
management systems. Consultant outputs include methodologies to define payments for forest
use activities; prices for FFA-provided forest goods, works, and services; and initial prices for
publicly procured forestry works and services. Also, a system was developed to administer forest
use payments, including procedures to establish and collect payments, and dedicated software;
training was provided to specialists that administer forest use payments; rules and regulations
were drafted for forest lease arrangements to be compatible with the 2007 Forest Code. A
program was designed and implemented for structural reforms to separate forest administrative
and economic management using experiences from market economies such as Canada, Estonia,
Finland, Latvia, and Sweden. Finally, a study was carried out on the competitive potential of
forest sector enterprises and a competitiveness management strategy was developed for forest
sector enterprises. One consultancy was cancelled (#22); it was to have developed an approach to
calculate stumpage prices based on the end products.
c) Develop regional forest use strategies. A long-term Forest Use Development Strategy was
elaborated for Arkhangelsk Oblast, based on principles of sustainable forest use, and taking into
account estimated resource potential, and opportunities for investments to modernize timber
harvesting and processing facilities. During the September 2009 World Bank Mission, the
Administration of the Forest Industry Department for Arkhangelsk Oblast reported that the Forest
Use Development Strategy substantially contributed to developing the Forest Plan for
Arkhangelsk Oblast according to new Forest Code requirements; also, the Project team assisted
the Forestry Agency for Krasnoyarsk Krai to develop terms of reference for a similar assignment.

Sub-component A2. Improve forest information and management planning systems
This Sub-component aimed to: (a) improve forest inventory and management planning, and (b)
improve forest information management and provide assistance to establish chain-of-custody log
tracking systems. Most activities envisaged at appraisal were completed.
Il) Improve forest inventory and management planning
In 2005, software for image processing and forest surveying instrument sets were procured for
forest inventory enterprises in four participating regions to improve the quality of annual forest


                                               19
inventory and management planning on over to,million ha. In 2007, computer equipment was
procured for the FFA and its subordinate organizations, which included servers, computer sets,
peripherals, communication channel for forest data storing, processing, and digital mapping; these
were intended, inter alia, for interpreting satellite imagery for state forest inventory, forest fire
and pest management, and satellite forest fire monitoring.
Initially, forest inventory enterprises were to receive this equipment, but under the 2007 Forest
Code, they became federal state unitary enterprises, no longer direct budget spending units, so the
equipment could not be delivered to them and was re-consigned to branches of the Federal State
Institution "Aerial Forest Fire Protection Service" (FGU "Avialesookhrana"). However, branches
of FGU "Avialesookhrana" were then transferred from federal authority to the jurisdiction of RF
subjects and could no longer receive the equipment. Finally. the computer equipment,
communication channels, installation, and training We(e delivered to the following recipients: 14
sets to regional subdivisions of the Federal State Institution "Russian Forest Protection Service"
(FGU "Roslesozaschita"); one set to FGU "Avialesookhrana," and one set to the Federal State
Institution "Forest Resources Information Fund" (FGU "Lesoinfoteka") to be used for data
collection and processing; individual computer sets under this Contract were delivered to seven
Forestry Departments in RF Federal Districts.
As a result ofmodemizing the monitoring system in·FGU "Roslesozaschita," the area covered by
forest pest monitoring based on remote sensing data in zQnes with high/medium pest threat is
expected to increase from 37.8, million ha in 2007 to 300 millionha in2010, while the total area
covered by pest monitpring in all types of forests will comprise 529.8 million hain 32 Subjects of
the Russian Federation.
Procured equipment also improved satellite fire monitoring by FGU "Avialesookhrana" on an
area of 559.1 million ha.
Servers and presentation equipment were delivered to the Forestry Departments in RF Federal
Districts to develop FF A's information management system.
82· sets of laser and satellite equipment for forest surveys were delivered to 14 forest inventory
units. This equipment will be used to conduct forest surveys, carry out forest management
planning, and establish permanent sample plots, covering about 840 thousand ha; it is expected to
achieve a 15-20 percent increase in work productivity.                                             .
Three sets of aerial survey and data processing equipment were delivered to FGU
"Avialesookhrana" that will be used for forest fire management, and forest management planning,
forest taxation, forest use control, and forest pest management.
A consultancy for developing and testing decision-support technologies in sustainable forest
management and forest land-use planning could not be implemented because none of the
shortlisted companies sent in bids. This consultancy was to have developed regional felling rules,
intensive forest use models, and remote sensing techniques for forest inventory and management
planning. As a potential remedy, the scope of works was restructured and split into three parts.
However, following enactment of the 2007 Forest Code, these matters were no longer under FFA
mandate, so these tenders were removed from the Procurement Plan.
b) Improve forest information management and provide assistance. to establish chain-of-
custody log tracking systems
Technical assistance was to be provided in three stages: (i) test and implement a pilot log tracking
system for chain-of-custody; (ii) develop software, databases, integrated information systems; and
(iii) prepare methodological documents and regulations. During stage (i), an optimal log-tracking




                                                 20
 model for chain-of-custody was selected based on cost/benefit analysis, and model specifications,
 and the cost of equipment and materials to implement the models; training was provided.
 During stages (ii) and (iii), the Consultant was expected to develop software and design a
 database structure for the log tracking model; elaborate testing techniques and produce test
 results; develop recommendations for federal executive authorities and private forest companies
 for equipment utilization, and technology, information, and organization solutions for the log
 tracking system; and draft regional-level methodological documents on the log tracking system.
Under Phase II, this subproject was to help establish a federal integrated log tracking system;
however subsequent forest management institutional changes would have required significant
amendments to the terms of reference for this contract. Moreover, changed conditions would have
made it necessary to replace the pilot regions. Therefore, the FFA terminated the contract and
used Stage I subproject outcomes to further implement a large-scale program to establish a
federal wood flow control system, which would be financed from other sources.
Under a separate contract, 638 specialists from regional forestry agencies and leskhozes
(Arkhangelsk Oblast, Krasnoyarsk Krai and Khabarovsk Krai) received computer training
delivered by certified instructors based on programs to enhance performance effectiveness among
office/management staff; ~hese specialists manage over 100 million ha of forest resources.
A large consulting contract, "Development of Forest Information Support Management System,"
could not be implemented because the terms of reference approval procedure was never finalized
due to ongoing forest sector reforms. In December 2006, at FF A suggestion, the MOF included
this contract in the application package for Project extension. However, the Bank did not provide
No Objection for the Procurement Plan submitted in the application package on the grounds that
the contract was unrealistic, so the Project was not extended on MOF-proposed terms.
Sub-component A3. Improve fire and pest management
The sub-component aimed to: (a) improve forest fire management in participating regions and
improve forest firefighting equipment; (b) modernize radio communication in participating
regions; (c) improve forest fire monitoring and prevention; and (d) improve forest pest
management and monitoring.
a) Improve forest fire management in participating regions
This sub-component-procurement of firefighting equipment-was probably the most
successfully implemented part of the Project. In total, some 668 units of firefighting equipment
and machinery (fire engines, forest firefighting tractors, small fire engines, track-type cross~
country vehicles for transporting firefighting crews, bulldozers, fuel tankers, auto repair vehicles,
and saddle truck-tractors with trailers) were delivered to 45 mobile mechanized crews in the
following seven participating regions.
        Leningrad Oblast - 67 units
        Arkhangelsk Oblast - 117 units
        Krasnoyarsk Krai - 117 units
        Khabarovsk Krai -132 units
        Irkutsk Oblast - 88 units
        Republic of Buryatia - 71 units
        Chita Oblast ~ 76 units
Under the 2007 Forest Code, forest management authority was transferred from FFA to the
regions, therefore, 25 additional units of saddle tractors with trailers were delivered to leskhozes
of Moscow Oblast, which remained within federal jurisdiction (instead of delivering them to


                                                21
regions in the Lake Baikal Basin). In addition, 300 units comprising chainsaws and sets of
protective clothing, 942 sets of fireproof clothing for forest fighters, and 6048 sets of portable
forest fire extinguishers were delivered for firefighting crews. The new Forest Code introduced an
eighth pilot region~Moscow Oblast.
b) Modernize radio communication in participating regions
The following equipment was delivered for modernizing radio communication:
- Leningrad Dblast. Krasnoyarsk Krai. Khabarovsk Krai. and Arkhangelsk Dblast:
         5489 sets of modern radio stations with different frequency ranges and purposes;
         130 sets of 15-meter antenna masts with mounting complexes for VHF radio stations; and
         110 sets of20-meter antenna masts with mounting complexes for IW-HF radio stations.
- Irkutsk Dblast. the Republic of Buryatia. and Chita Dblast:
         1535 sets of modern radio stations with different frequency ranges and purposes; and
         103 sets of ] 5- and 20-meter antenna masts with mounting complexes.
         Eight service laboratories for radio diagnostics and maintenance were delivered to all
         seven participating regions.
c) Improve forest jiremonitoring and prevention
A package of servers, computer equipment, and peripherals were delivered and installed for FGU
"Avialesookhrana" to upgrade satellite forest fire monitoring over 559.1 million ha.
In September 2003, an international workshop on modem methods of forest fire prevention and
suppression was held in the City of Khabarovsk with 70 specialist participants. The World Bank
published the workshop materials.
A textbook and compact disc (CD) on forest fires (Forest Fire Prevention through Outreach
Activities) were published. Some 10,000· copies of the book and CD were produced and
distributed among organizations subordinated to FF A. The textbook was produced by FF A within
the Forest Resources and Technologies (FOREST) Project implemented with the financial
support from the United States Agency for International Development.
Finally, three sets of equipment for digital aerial surveys and image processing were delivered to
FGU "Avialesookhrana" during the final Project stage. This equipment has increased the
accuracy of forest fire damage assessment and satellite monitoring, using improved detection
algorithms; it will also reduce the costs of verifying areas damaged by large-scale forest fires.
Avialesookhrana conducts annual verification works on 300 thousand ha, which takes 175 hours
of flying time for the An-2 plane and costs 15 million Rubles; it costs an additional 5.0 million
Rubles to process the data, and about 66.7 Rubles per ha to verify the data.
Using digital complexes for aerial surveys reduces verification costs to about40 Rubles per ha, or
about the same cost as performing these works on 500 thousand ha,an almost twofold reduction
for leasingthe An-2 aircraft and data processing.
Using automatic interpretation of digital images of fire-affected areas also increases the accuracy
of forest fire. damage assessments, therefore, digital imagery will be used to develop plans to
recover fire-damaged areas and build a permanent database on forest estate changes.
The equipment is also being used for forest use control, forest surveys, forest management
planning, and forest pest monitoring.
d) Improve forest pest management and monitoring
A consulting contract for improving forest pest management was implemented in Krasnoyarsk
Krai, a region prone to massive proliferation of forest pests; it included the following activities:


                                                22
                     of
                     and

Sub-compom:l1t AS.
This
                           in
i) Training to support institutional and policy development
A series of five workshops were conducted for 250 participants: "Management of Public Forests:
Experience of Countries with Market-Based Economy, East-European Countries and the Baltic
States"; "Federative Relations in the Forest Sector: Balancing Interests of the Federation,
Subjects of      Federation, and Municipal Entities;" "Modernization of Secondary Professional
Education in Forestry and Personnel Training" with 50 specialists participating, "Regulatory
Provisions on Forest Use and Forest Management" and "Financial Fundamentals of ".·{'Ilrp.::!....!
under Decentralized Forest Management."
Technical assistance helped develop long-term training programs such as "Provision of
Methodological Services in Preparation and Training of Instructors of Regional Training Centers
under the             "Public Forest- Management and Market-Based Forest Use," About 255
trainers        regional training centers compieted this program; 25 instructors from regional
training centers also participated in a study tour to Scandinavia and the Baltic                 25
instructors of regional training centers from the Institute of Continuous Education in Forestry for
Siberia and the Russian Far East and seven forestry colleges received training under the same
program. This training program is now being implemented by the All-Russian Institute of
Continuolls Education in Forestry (VIPKLH), the Institute of Continuous Education in
for Siberia      the Russian Far East, and by seven training centers operating in forestry
including Usino Forestry College (Leningrad Oblast), Krasnobakovsk Forestry College
Novgorod Oblast), Suvodsky Forestry College (Kirov Oblast), Lubyansky Forestry College
(Republic of Tatarstan), Toguchinsky Forestry College (Novosibirsk Oblast), Divnogorsk
Forestry College (Krasnoyarsk Kray), and Vyazemsky Forestry College (Khabarovsk Kray),
   Distance Learning, (DL)
This activity was intended to set up video-conferencing rooms for: (i) conducting distance
training; and   streng1hening management capacity of regional centers by providing
announcements      information on current events and management decisions. A consultant
was prepared, "Development, Testing, and Technical Imp!ementation of Multimedia Programs
for Distance Learning/Retraining of Forest Staff," which included technical specifications for
program hardware and sofuvare. Computer and server equipment was delivered to FF A 's district
departments;           the DL program was not fully developed due to the decentralization of
forest management and training activities following the 2007 Forest Code.
(iii) Technical training to support main Project objectives
      activity was to fund training to key specialists in fire management, pest management, forest
certification, and sustainable management.
Under the contract "Forest Certification and Sustainable Forest Management," 25 forest
specialists received training in forest certification procedures through a one-week course of
theoretical and field sessions. Under the contract, "Rendering of Technical Services in the
Organization of Training in Forest Certification," a training program was organized in Canada for
eight experts from the Russian National Forest Certification Council, from organizations
subordinated to the Ff A. Finally, a six-module training course on forest certification procedures
was developed and is now used within the framework of the Russian National Voluntary Forest
Certification System.
Under the technical assistance contract, "Trainingof Personnel of the FF A Regional Bodies and
Branches of FGtJ 'Roslesozaschita," an integrated long-term training program on forest pest
management was developed to provide training all over the Russian Federation through FGU
"Roslesozaschita" regional sub-divisions and sectoral educational institutions. A long-term
training course on forest pest management was developed for Krasnoyarsk Krai under the


                                                24
contract, "Improved Forest Protection in Krasnoyarsk Krai: Development of Collections of Forest
Pests and Diseases; Development of Training Programs in Forest Pest and Disease Protection;
Planning of a Network of Permanent Plots for Pest Dynamics Monitoring."
About 70 specialists participated in a workshop on challenges and modem methods of forest fire
prevention and suppression; a planned study tour was cancelled (to the United States for fire
management training).
(iv) Training in sustainable/orest utilization
This activity was cancelled. Forest use training, including harvester training, was to be provided
to instructors of forest colleges.

Component B. Investments in sub-projects
Three sub-projects were implemented under Component B:
1)     Modernization 0/ wood processing facilities at the OAO Novovyatsky Ski Factory in
Kirov for US$3.20 million; the Project funded U$2.42 million and the company funded the
balance. The sub-project did the following: (i) refurbished the gas-based energy generator to bum
wood waste; and (ii) upgraded wood drying facilities to increase output of deeply processed
higher-value wood products.
Under the sub-project, a primary environmental objective was to procure and install a new wood-
waste-fired boiler to use wood waste from company sawing and milling operations and decrease
gas consumption. The new boiler cut gas consumption by half, from 9.0 million m3 in 2007 to 4.5
million m 3 in 2009, and saves the time, money, and inconvenience of wood waste disposal. The
company now provides heating for 14 apartment buildings, a hospital, and a sports school near
the company compound while-reducing the cost of energy generation by about 30 percent         .
Installing and opera~ing four new drying kilns enabled the company to produce high-quality
modem parquet and furniture-grade board. Product quality and competitiveness strengthened the
company's market position and in 2009, parquet reached 60 percent of output and the company
entered the parquet market in the Moscow, Voronezh, Lipetsk, and Tambov regions. Also, the
new drying kilns increased energy efficiency by 20 percent, reduced the number of days required
to dry wood from 29 to 20, and lowered heat consumption three-fold. These impacts are expected
to multiply when six more Project-fundeq drying kilns are installed and operating.
2)      Refurbishing the chipboard production line at OAO Novovyatsky Ski Factory in Kirov for
US$30.5 million; the Project funded US$12.0 million. The Project aimed to expand the
company's woodchip production capacity, diversify the product portfolio, and raise product
quality by implementing modern ecologically safe technologies for deeper wood processing and
broader use of low-quality wood and wood waste. The sub-loan financed equipment for woodchip
production including a thermo-boiler, electric supply .components, board-forming and processing,
debarking, and lamination equipment. Due to delays in the approval and implementation phases,
at Project closure, only 90 percent of the sub-loan had been disbursed. Nevertheless, all
equipment was delivered to the company; installation and related training is expected to be
completed by end-20 10.
3)       Retooling the existing wood processing line at ZAO TAMAK in To.mbak for US$30.5
million; the Project funded US$1.4 million. This sub-project aimed to modernize company
production facilities with new equipment and modern ecologically safe technologies for deeper
initial wood processing, which would expand capacity of some production lines, such as cement-
bonded particle board, house-building, bulk-laminated wood, and window frames, while reducing
wood waste.



                                                 25
 This sub-project was implemented with a significantly lower level of Bank loan finaJi~ingthan
'initially designed. T AMAK cancelled about 69 percent of the end.. loail and finance~' sub-;projiCt'
 activities from other sources. The following investments were carried out under thesub-projeet: "
To secure non-stop production of solid glued lumber, the company purchased ajoiner blade lathe,
calibration and sorting equipment, a diesel side-loader and electric loaders, and a stac~er:'"truck. . .
To launch a window manufacturing facility working with laminated veneerlumberthecompany
procured a window beam press and window frame prO<iuction equipment. The new equipment not
only enabled the company to produce full sets of wood house components,: but also begin to otTer
complete accessory packages, for example, high-grade windows, doors, and joinery improving
company market share. According to TAMAK, these investments facilitated conipanyexpansion
in solid glued lumber production by more than 30 percent, and increased average sellingprice$ by ,
15-20 percent.
To expand cement bonded particle board (CBPB) production. the sulrproject financed
reconstruction of the CBPB workshop by procuring the following equipment: a molding station,
production pellets, emulsion application machine, aspiration unit, trimming saw, automated,
dosing system, roller'sheet straightener, separate chips preparation equipment, and bark peeling
machine. The TAMAK reports that these ,investments increased, CBPBoutput 'growth .by 16 .
percent and raised particle board quality to European standards by adding grinding to the
technological process; expanding CBPB production enabled the company to fuUyprocess wood
waste.
In late 2009, the TAMAK preliminary assessment reported the following sub-project outcome$:
     • 12 percent of wood saved due to lower wood Waste;
     • Increased product quality, competitiveness, (no front corbelling, no cleavage). and prices;
    •   Doubled company output;
    •   Saved instrument costs due to own flanking: 10-30 percent of wood processing
        instruments cost, depending on the milling tool used;
    •   Reduced rejection rates by 5.0 percent due to improved surface treatment with new
        planning machines;
    •   Expanded product Iineto include window frames;
    •   Reduced labor consumption by 15 percent~
    •   Increased labor productivity by 15 percent;
    •   Increased production profitability by 15 percent, depending on wood species, lumber
        section, quality requirements, c;:tc.;and
    •   Expanded product line produced at the'same production sites.
Based on company-provided information. it appears that sub-project objectives were fully
achieved (as originally defined in the feasibility study), although later than expected and hugely
with company funding.


Training
Training constitutes the main Project Development O~jective of PartB; therefore, the following
training activities were planned.
    •    Under the first sub-project, DAD "Novovyatsky Ski Factory" committed to training 70
        ,specialists in operating modern boilers and turbo-electric generators, and in wood drying
         techniques. rhis training was not completed before the Project closed.



                                                 26
    e     Under its subproject, ZAO "TAMAK" committed to training up to 100 specialists in
          improved wood processing techniques and in economics and management of forestty
          sector enterprises; also planned was a final workshop on sUb-project outcomes, and
          further training activities upon the completion ofthe subproject.
    •     Under the second sub-project, OAO "Novovyatski Ski Factory" presented to the World
          Bank through Roseximbank its plan for project dissemination and training, which is
          being strengthened by including monitorable indicators-numbers of seminars and
          conferences held, magazine articles published, and people trained.
Most training activities are expected to. take place following sub-project completion.
Training activities that took place during the Project life include:
    •     30 visits by other enterprises to view the new investments.
    ill   Two professional journals have published articles on Project results.
    •     Students from a local forestry college and technical university received practical training
          at the factory.
    ill   Four local companies that were not sub-loan recipients have implemented wood-waste
          heating for their drying kilns.
   ill    NLK representatives have delivered presentations at forest industry workshops,
          encouraging as many as another 26 companies to pursue energy savings using wood-
          waste equipment similar to that installed by NLK under this Project.
   //I    22 local forestry school students interned at NLK, and eight students were hired as
          regular employees.

                               Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Analysis at appraisal
The economic analysis carried out at appraisal quantified economic benefits due to higher timber
revenues as a result of better forest management, resource assessment and pilot certification from
commercial timber and· non-timber products saved as a result of reduced fire and pest incidence;
and from higher forest enterprise productivity as a result of training, in wood and non-timber
forest products, enterprise management, and technologies. The analysis also identified several
less tangible benefits such improved biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. Recognizing
Russia's high-risk environment, analysis included several sensitivity analyses, notably, the value
of timber production would have to increase by less than US$1 per cubic meter and production
and productivity by i.O percent per year in the three regions for the Project to have an economic
rate of return (ERR) of 12 per(!ent. The ERR for the entire Project was estimated at J2 percent.
Ex-post analysis
The ex-post economic analysis quantitatively analyzed the benefits associated to the following
Component A outcomes:
I) Improved forest fire management;
2) Improved pest management;
3) Improved seed selection;
4) More advanced inventory technology;
5) Improved harvesting technology.
Benefits associated with Component B investments could not be quantified due to lacking data. A
qualitative discussion is provided in Annex 2.

t) Improved forest tiretighting.
As detailed in Annex 2, the Project procured modern firefighting equipment and machinery, and
radio communication equipment in seven participating regions, and satellite-based forest fire
monitoring equipment to cover an area of 559.1 million ha. This equipment significantly reduced
the reaction time to incipient fires and the firefighters' ability to reach areas under fire and battle
the fires. Project investments were completed between 2003 and 2007.
An attempt was made to evaluate the impact of these investments forest fire damage during 2005-
2009 as compared to 1999-2004. 6 2005 was chosen as the beginning of the period with Project
benefits since by 2004 a significant amount of critical radio communication equipment was
delivered to the participating regions. Average losses of standing timber and their stumpage
values were compared, assuming a constant stumpage value of USD 2/m 3•7 The result indicates
that in fact during 2005-2009 standing timber and stumpage value loss was higher than during
1999-2004, even taking into consideration the abnormally large area burnt in Krasnoyarsk in
2006 (Table I). However, this estimate could be misleading about the benefit of project because
forest fire incidence varies significantly from year to year and depends on a large number of
extraneous factors, notably climate, land management practices, and behavior. A multivariate
regression model over a'much larger period of time or across a large number of regions would
likely provide a better insight into the marginal benefit of the project investments.

2) Improved forest pest management
Equipment, services and training provided to 14 regional subdivisions of the Federal Forest
Protection Service has improved forest monitoring and pest management on 529.8 million ha,
including 300.0 million ha in the zone of high/medium pest threat in 32 Regions. Oelivery and
implementation of all-terrain forest pest complexes made it possible to increase the area covered
annually by forest pest surveys by 270 thousand ha. Implementing aerial survey hardware and
software will improve thequaJity of verification of fire-damaged forestlands. and expand this· area
to 500 thousand ha per annum.
The benefits associated with the all-terrain forest complexes are twofold: (i) reduced cost, and (ii)
reduced wood loss. The reduced cost of annual pest surveys is estimated at USD5.8 million
(Table 2.)

3} . I..-proved Seed Selection
The Project financed the procurement of 26 sets of DNA analysis equipment (the Jacobsen
device) ata cost of USD 1,615,970 to seed centers across Russia for the analy·sis of forest seed
qlJalityand 9rigin. The benefits associated with this equipment are twofold:
    (1) Averted losses of erroneous grading of class 1, 2, or 3 seeds as sub-standard. FFA reports
         that prior to the acquisition ofthe advanced .equipment, of the 80 tons of coniferous seeds
         produced by the Seed Centers, about 10 % or 8,000 kg, were graded as sub-standard. This
         is a loss to the economy as resources used to produce the seeds could have been
       . employed for other purposes. The improved te(Zhnology provided by the Project
         eliminated this loss. The avoided loss is valued at 7,000Rubles I kg, which is reported by
         the FFA as the market price, net of taxes, for such seed. Hence, the loss avoided is 56
         million Rubles per annum.
    (ii) Averted losses associated with sowing incorrectly graded seed in the nursery, which led
         to overstocking or understocking. In either case, the seedling output was lower than could
          be attained at correct stocking levels. FF A estimates that this loss is about 5% of the
        . prodlJction, With the total annual production volume of approximately 1 billion seedlings,
          SO million seedlings were lost every year prior to the use of the advanced seed selection
         technology. At an average market price of 0.5 Rubles, the total loss averted amount to 25
          million Rubles per annum.
The ~etits are thus estimated at 81 million Rubles or US$ 2.7 million annually. Under the
assumption of a 10% discount rate, annual O&M costs equal to 10% of the capital investment
costs, and 7-yearly refurbishment costs equal to 25% of the capital costs, the NPV is estimated at
just under USD 6 million.

4} .More advanced inventory technology
The Project procured 82 sets of mobile computers with the global positioning system capability,
geodetic satellite systems, tachometers and electronic field equipment at a total cost of
$1,633,720 to be used in forest inventory by 14 teams on 840,000ha. The application of these
instruments in forest inventories will reduce the cost of forest management planning, forest
valuation and forest inventory works by about 20%. This cost reduction will be possible due to
electronic valuation descriptions eliminating data entry from paper documents, electronic
demarcation of forest parcels eliminating photo contour visualization; improved vatuation quality
due to electronic and laser tools, and more precise demarcation offorest plantations, cutover areas
and other changes in the forest estate registered in valuation descriptions.
Field wOrk using optical and mechanical tools costs 150 Rubles I ha: or 126 million Rubles for
840,O()Oha per annum. A 20% cost reduction amounts to 25.2million Rubles or US$840,OOO per
annum. Assuming annual O&M costs at 10% of the investment cost and a useful life of7 years; a
discount rate of 10 percent, the NPV is estimated at USD 2,273,080, and the IRR at 84%.

S) . Improved harvesting technology.
A s.et of multi.;.functional forest machinery (a harvester, a forwarder and a simulator) was
delivered. to the Lisino Forestry College in Leningrad Oblast. This machinery will help college
students .and instructors improve their skHls in environmentally-friendly timber harvesting and
transporting. Students will be able to do operational planning, fell and process trees, and transport
logs .to the upper. landing. The economic benefit associated with machinery is more efficient and
environmentally friendly harvesting of timber. Harvesting companies met by the Project team
during Project supervision indicated that these skills are valuable to them and they send


                                                31
employees to Scandinavia for training to acquire them. However, quantification of this benefit is
not possible, since data on the marginal productivity improvement or cost of training, and
environmental damage avoided when using this machinery as opposed to Jess advanced practices,
are not available.

forest management, whiC::b 'W4lS' especially important during the period of implementing rather
long-term reforlnsin .th.e,foreshecto...'                        '
GoOd results were' achieved in the imprpvement of forest policy. The deliverables within the
frame ofthis su~omponont-include development of voluntary forest certification; preparation of
regulatoryandmethodoloJieal documents related to the implementation of improved forest lease
meohanisms,adininistration offorest payments and financial management: and elaboration of the
regional forest use strategy,for ArkhangelskOblast.
The deliyerabJe~. 8$sociatt;ci with the preparation of regulatory/methodological documents are
J)tinuldly focused on further development oflong-term sustainable forest use characterized by an


                                                                              36
integrated approach to forestry, including reduced harvesting and sales of roundwood through
increased deep waste-free wood processing. Long-term forest use is also v~wed as one of the
major instruments for reducing the flow of illegal wood .. Both increased volumes of deep wood
processing and reduced flow of illegal wood lead to sound use of forest· resourees,increased
added value, and increased amount of tllx and forest revenues.
                                                               ..                                 .
Forest certification under the system of the Russian National Forest Certification CouncU
developed based on the input from the Project was launched in 2009. The first certificate·was
issued in 2010; as of I May 2010, the total of200,ooO ha offorests was certified; it is expected to
have 3.5 million ha of forests certified by the end of 2010. As a result, an alternative forest
certification system has been developed imd is now in operation (a$ofl January 2010, about 23
million ha of forests in Russia was certified according to thesYSlem ofthe Forest Stewardship.
Council (FSC). A competition in the forest certification market will iead to the reduction of
certification costs and, as a consequence, a!1 increase in the area .of certified forests and In .the
number of certified forest companies, especially with regard to smafland .medium..:sized
companies. These developments will result·· in expanded consumptioQ         of   verified wOod and
reduced volume of illegal wood, thus increasing the !lI11ount of tax and forest revenues.
 Furthermore, a long-term forest use development strategy was elaborated for Arkhangelsk Oblast·
 based on the principles of sustainable forest use and taking into acco'unt the. estimated resource
 potential and opportunities for investment in the modernization of wood harvesting and
 processing facilities. During the World BankMission in September20Q9, the Administration of
 the Forest Industry Department for Arkhangelsk Oblast reported that. the above forest' use
 development· strategy substantially contributed to the development oftbe :Forest Plan for
.Arkhangelsk Oblast produced in accordance with the requirements oHhe new Forest Code.
On the whole, in the recent years the amount of forest revenues in the'RusSianFederation was
increasing at least by 15 percent per annum (US$213.07million in2003~ USSn6.30 million in
2004, US$378.82 million in 2005, US$463.70 million in 2006, US$606.20 million in 2001,
US$478.92 in 2008, and US$380.37in 2009). A reduction in forest revenues during 2 recent
years is associated with the global financial and economic crisis •.
Activities within the frame of information management subcomponent were focused on the
improvement of forest information' management systems, forest inventory and management
planning, and forest fire and pest monitoring. For example, equipment of forest inventory teams
with modern laser and satellite instruments intended for forest taxation and management planning
will make it possible to improve the efficiency of work and the .accuracy of forest inventory and
management units. Forest surveys and forest management plannjngperformed with new
instruments will annually cover an area of 840 thousand ha.                .
The Project contributed to the· modernization of the forest pest monitoring system, Furthermore,
Project activities helped improve forest fire monitoring. by increasing the ~acity· ofserve~ ~nd
computers. The implementation of diS ita I facilities for aerial surveys wiUincreasetheaccuracy'of
forest fire ,damage assessment, while improved detection algorithms will enhance the Jccuracyof
satellite monitoring, thus reducing. costs associated with the verification of areas damaged by
large-scale forest fires.
The stated objectives in improved forest fire and pest managenient were achieved to the fullest
extent and !n a ·most comprehensive way., Within the framework of the Project the system ofndio
communication in 7 RF Subjects (Leningrad Oblast, ArkhangelskOblast, KrasnoYarskKrai,
Khabarovsk Krai, Irkutsk Oblast, the Republic of Buryatia and Chita Oblast) was fully
modernized on an area of 325 million ha;45 mechanized firefighting cre~s. were established to
suppress large forest fires on an area of 180 million ha. The total of 668 units of heavy



                                                37
firefighting equipment was delivered. In addition, fire-chemical stations operating in 20 forest
management units'of Moscow Oblast were equipped with truck tractors w/trailers.
'. The delivery of servers, computer equipment and software products to departments ofFGU
   "Roslesozaschita" .made it possible to computerize, forest pest monitoring on an area of. 48.7
   million ha with an expected expansion of this area up to 310 million ha by 20 I 0 (after the system
   is up and running at full capacity). Furthermore, Project activities contributed to the
   implementation'of forest fire monitoring by increasing the capacity of servers and computers. The
   implementation of digital facilities for aerial surveys will increase the accuracy of forest fire
   damage assessment, while improved detection algorithms will enhance the accuracy of satellite
   monitoring, thus reducing costs associated with the verification of areas damaged by large-scale
   forest fires.
Given the direct impact from the above activities,in 2006firefighting costs in the Pilot Regions
decreased in comparison with average 5-year data by 36 percent- from 480 million Rubles to 308
million Rubles, while ,the associated damage (loss of standing wood, lost young stands, damaged
forest cover, destroyed economic facilities and firefighting costs) was reduced by 2.4 times - from
33.9 billion Rubles to l3.8 billion Rubles.
Improved responsiveness to early detection of forest pests and diseases, as well as prompt
preventive actions will make it possible to increase the value of forest resources by 7.5 billion
Rubles. per annum starting from 2011 provided that an area covered by forest pest monitoring will
increase by 262.2 million ha by the end of 2010.
Within the framework of the improved forest regeneration subcomponent, a standard detailed
plan and technical specifications were developed for the procurement of greenhouse complexes
for growing coniferous ball-rooted planting stock and hangars for technological equipment; these
facilities have a pl'oductioncapacityof2.0 million coniferous seedlings per year.
Modern equipment, including electronic equipment, for DNA analysis of forest seed origin and
quality control was delivered to forest seed centers.
Technical upgrade of forest seed stations with modem laboratory equipment will make it possible
to employ internationally recognized methods of seed analysis recommended by the International
Seed Testing Association (1ST A) and to get 1STA accreditation in the future to become a member
of this organization. Accreditation of forest seed stations operating under FGU "Roslesozaschita"
with the 1STA, in tuin, would authorize them to. issue international seed quality certificates, thus
ensuring high credibility of data provided. In addition, the issuance ofISTAcertificates would
facilitate the development of international trade in forest seeds of Russian origin and the receipt
of rather substantial resources, estimated in millions of Rubles, to develop forestry in a number of
Russian regions (for reference: in the European market the price of 1 kg of pine, spruce or larch
seeds with valuable hereditary properties and verified origin and quality varies from €500 to €700.
The economic effect from the application of modem equipment for forest seed control in the
Russian Federation to ensure stable conditions for seed testing'can be determined based on the
objectivity of obtained seed quality data. Approximately 80 tons of coniferous. seeds (pine, spruce
and larch) are seeded every year in the forest sector. Considering that 10 percent of this volume is
unreasonably recognized as non-standard, the overall loss at the national level comprises 8000 kg
@7.0 thousand Rubleslkg=56 million Rubles per annum. Inconsistent transition of seed lots from
one class to another (either to a higher grade, or to a lower grade) leads to mistakes in
determining the seeding rate in forest nurseries, inefficient utilization of seeds and results in
either overstocking or understocking. In both cases the output of standard planting stock would be
reduced. The reduction of the output of standard planting stock, in tum, involves additional
production costs. Provided that these costs comprise only 5.0 percent of the overall cost of



                                                 38
production of forest planting stock nationwide, this would amount to approx. 50 million seedlings
(with the total annual production volume of approx. 1.0 billion pieces), so with the cost price of 1
seedling at 50 kopecks, the potential costs would amount to 25 million Rubles per annum.
The Project provided substantial support to professional development and promotion among
forest specialists of a new approach to forest management and forest use on the basis of
sustainable development principles. In this regard the Project adapted best international
experience from countries known for their advanced forest use and forest management practices.
All in all 33 workshops, training courses and study tours were organized to address issues related
to public forest management, forest fire and pest management, forest certification, sustainable
forest use, and computer literacy. A total of 2445 specialists were involved in different forms of
training activities.
Training programs for new disciplines in public forest management were developed, instructors
were trained, and the training process was launched on a regular basis in eight regional training
centers organized within the framework of the Institute of Continuous Education in Forestry for
Siberia and the Russian Far East (Krasnoyarsk) and seven forestry colleges. Modern electronic,
laser and satellite equipment was delivered to forestry colleges to educate students about current
trends in forest governance, taxation, and management planning. A set of multi-operation
machinery, including a harvester, a forwarder and a simulator, was delivered to Lisino Forestry
College (Leningrad Oblast) to educate students in advanced forest management and thinning
techniques.
Due to a series of changes made to the forest legislation within a short period starting from 2004,
which eventually ended in the adoption of the new Forest Code on 1 January 2007, several major
adjustments were made in the initial Project plans related to the improvement of forest
information and management planning systems. That was the reason why a large consulting
contract aimed to develop regional felling rules, intensive forest use models and remote sensing
techniques for forest inventory and management planning failed to be implemented.
For the same reason, the initially planned activities in improved forest regeneration also failed to
be implemented. Due to the decentralization of forest management and the transfer of
responsibilities for forest regeneration in leased forests to lease-holders, Rosleskhoz was assigned
tasks related to planning and supervision of forest seed breeding in order to improve the genetic
and species composition of forests. Therefore, during the final stage of the Project some Project
activities were reoriented to the delivery of forest seed laboratories for assessing seed quality and
origin (based on the DNA analysis) to forest seed units.

Economic andfinancial evaluation of investment
With the total of US$77.0 million in investments the overall economic effect amounted to 4.9
billion Rubles, or US$164 million. The economic effectiveness Qver five years from 2004 to 2008
(taking into account firefighting costs) comes to 1.6. According to preliminary estimates, the
economic effectiveness of equipment delivered under the 2009-2010 contracts (with the total
contract value of US$9.7 million) is expected to reach approx. 61.8 million Rubles per annum.
The budgetary effectiveness reached to 316 percent in 2008.
On the whole, from 2003 to 2008, budget revenues in all participating regions (forest income, tax
revenues, etc) increased by 1.8 times. Within the stated period, the total forest income· in the
participating regions increased by 3.5 times; in 2008 the total forest firefighting costs amounted
to US$12.1 million, which is one-third less than in 2003; tax contributions of forest sector
enterprises to the budget system of the Russian Federation in 2008 reached US$531. i million,
which is 1.5 times more than in 2003.



                                                39
The Project input in the achievement of budgetary effectiveness indicators for all the participating
regions constitutes 22 percent.
The Project's effect was the biggest in Chita Oblast (87 percent) and in Khabarovsk Krai (65
percent). This impact is accounted by a sharp reduction in forest fire fighting costs in 2008
compared to 2003 (by 3 times in Khabarovsk Krai and almost by 2 times in Chita Oblast) and by
a significant increase in the forest income collected into the budgets within the same period (by
1.5 times in Khabarovsk Krai and by 2 times in Chita Oblast).      .

Majol'lessons learnedfrom Project implementation
 1) It is advisable, whenever possible, to avoid the multi-departmental subordination of projects.
    Such approach will provide for better project management and prompt decision-making, thus
    speeding up the implementation of project activities and disbursement of resources.
2) It is necessary to clearly outline procedures for amending the loan agreement by defining
   major amendments that require more complex coordination for their approval and minor
   amendments that can be approved through a simplified procedure.
3) It is necessary to classify the participating regions by forest zones and by forest fire risks in
   order to take into account the specifics of technical requirements that may exist in individual
   regions, so that those specifics could be taken into consideration in preparation of technical
   specifications and procurement of equipment.
4) it is necessary, with maximum possible precision, to draft technical specifications and terms
   of reference included in the approved procurement plan already during the preparatory stage
   of the Project. This measure will make it possible to reduce the contract execution period
   after the project startup.
5) For each large-scale consulting project it is advisable that, in addition to subcomponent
   leaders, the responsible agency should appoint contract directors with administrative powers
   who supervise the development of respective directions in the agency.
6) it is necessary, as much as possible, to avoid the duplication of PIU functions already at the
   stage of project preparation.
7) Whenever possible, it is advisable to avoid the replacement of project leaders both, on the
   part of Russian agencies and on the part ofthe Bank.

Plan for future actions
The phin for future actions under the Project envisages the following:
111   fulfillment by the Russian Federation of its financial obligations related to Loan servicing and
      repayment of the principal;
'II   control over the utilization and accounting of equipment delivered within the frame of the
      Project, including firefighting equipment delivered to the participating regions;
III   utilization of procurttment experience obtained in the course of Project implementation for
      further activities of Rosleskhoz and its subordinate organizations;
•     utilization of Project experience by Rosleskhoz in implementing different investment
      programs in the forest sector;
..    dissemination of Project experience to other regions, including the delivery of training based
      on instructional materials produced within the Project;
..    with regard to the subcomponents, it is planned to complete the introduction of equipment
      procured during the final stage of the Project and to ensure further development of those lines
      of activity.


                                                  40
Conclusions
Alongside with minor tasks, the plan for further actions provides for a number of major activities
whose implementation is critical for the development of the forest sector at large and requires
significant capital investments. These tasks include the creation of a publicly-accessible GIS-
based national forest portal through the integration of various forest monitoring data (forest use,
forest pest and fire monitoring) and state forest inventory data, the establishment of innovation
and training centers for forest selection and seed breeding designed to modernize forest
regeneration in the Russian Federation, etc.
          In this context, for the purpose of resolving the above tasks, it is advisable to initiate a
new special-purpose forest project that might be financed both, through the federal budget and, if
reasonable, through a World Bank loan.

B) Summary Borrower's Completion Report by the Rosexim Bank received on October 8,
    2010:


               Russian Fedea:ation: Part B of Sustainable Forestry Pilot Project
                          . Financed by IDRD Loan N!! 4552-RU

            Key Messages of the Borrower's Implementation Completion Report

The initial project concept for Part B of the Sustainable Forestry Pilot Project involved regions in
management and personnel training program for forestry companies by on-lending loan funds to
the regional administrations interested in the program. Unfortunately, at that period most regions
- potential borrowers under Part B - had overdue arrears to the federal budget and thus ineligible
for financing from the federal budget, hence this component of the Project could not be properly
implemented and until 2005 was rated unsatisfactory. Faced with extended unsatisfactory
performance Of Part B of the Project, the Government and World Bank decided in favor of on-
lending loan funds through a bank - authorized agent of the Government to private companies in
the forest sector selected based on the selection criteria specified in the Loan Agreement. By mid-
2006 the Project Part B restructuring was largely completed and new implementation
arrangements and regulations were in place for Part B to restart as in investment program aimed
to provide loans to forest sector companies to help them fund financially, economically and
environmentally sound projects promoting sustainable forest management principles.
The State Russian Export Import Bank (Roseximbank) was selected by the Russian Government
to act as a financial intermediary - a bank authorized to be the agent of the Russian Government.
In line with this financing scheme, the Russia's Ministry of Finance (MOF) provided
Roseximbank with a redeemable Subsidiary Loan funded from IBRD Loan .N'2 4552-RU to
finance sustainable forestry investment projects. Importantly, the MOF provided sub-loan funds
to Roseximbank with a zero margin thus minimizing the cost of end-loans extended by
Roseximbank to forestry companies to finance their investment projects. Part B sub-loans were to
be provided for up to 7 years with a two-year grace period. Taking into account 3-18 months
normally needed to procure, install and launch production equipment, this two-year grace period
offered under Part B of the Project was a significant advantage compared to largely short term
commercial financing available as it allowed a sub-borrower to put a procured equipment into
operation prior to the start of the principal repayment.
The implementation scheme following the 2005 restructuring included a separate PIU
(Foundation for Enterprise Restructuring and Financial Institutions Development - FER) with



                                                41
ensued duplication of responsibilities between the financial intermediary (Roseximbank) and PIU
(FER) that was a major bottleneck of the Project Part B implementation in 2005-2008 slowing
down sub-projects preparation and implementation. In particular, due to discrepancies in
accounting mechanisms used during conversion operations of the agency bank and PIU,
an exchange rate differential appeared. Therefore, MOF decided to suspend disbursement
of IBRD loan proceeds under Part B of the Project with respect to contracts that required
payments in currencies other than US dollars (i.e. required conversion). Having reviewed
the situation in detail, MOF instructed FER to credit the loan account with the above
exchange rate differential using its own funds and also decided to assign the functions of
the Project Implementation Unit to the ZAO ROSEXIMBANK .in order to eliminate
duplication of functions of the agency bank and the PIU and increase efficiency in
implementing Part B of the Project.
Simplified implementation scheme for Part B of the Project has enabled to significantly
streamline: (i) preparation of sub-projects for Part B funding, (ii) procurement and disbursement
process under Part B ensuring timely payments to suppliers, and (iii) as was confirmed by the
audit, save about RUBLE 1.17 million of the operating expenditures budget financed by MOF .
Despite low awareness of the sector of this credit line, overall between October 2005 and May
2010 (Project closure), Roseximbank reviewed 26 sub-projects for financing under Part B of the
Project of which 11 sub-projects were short-listed. Many of these sub-projects did not material·ize
as prospective borrowers failed to provide adequate collateral to Roseximbank and MOF,. present
sufficient information or documentation required by Roseximbank or changed their investment
priorities. Eventually, end-loans were signed with 5 companies, however only 3 of them became
effective and these 3 sub-projects have been implemented. These included: Modernization of
Wood Processing Facilities by OAO Novovyatsky Ski Factory, Retooling of Existing Wood
Processing Line by ZAO TAMAK, and Refurbishment of Chipboard Production Line at OAO
Novovyatsky Ski Factory.
Overall, the equipment procured, works executed, subprojects' environmental impacts,
implementation of training programs and compliance with the stated objectives are in line with
the approved feasibility studies for these subprojects. Outcomes achieved through the
implementation of subprojects underPart B appear sustainable as they support modernization of
wood processing facilities aimed at deeper processing of timber, utilization of wood waste and
use of new environmentally friendly technologies. Roseximbank and the end-borrowers
performed their financial obligations related to the servicing of their respective sub-loans and the
repayment of the principal in a timely manner and in full measure.
Altogether, under ~ctive sub-projects 16 contracts were approved, including 12 contracts for
OAO "Novovyatsky Ski Factory" and 4 agreements for ZAO "TAMAK". In addition, 3 (three)
consulting companies were selected with MOF and IBRD approval and employed by
Roseximbank to conduct research and audit of Part B of the Project. Also 5 (five). individual
consultants were hired to assist Roseximbank with project management in accordance with the
World Bank procedures. No misprocurement was declared throughout the life of Part B ofthe
Project.
The pace of disbursements under Part B of the Loan N!! 4552-RU was very slow in between 2005
and 2008. Following September 2008 when Roseximbank became also a PIU for Part B of the
Project, and as the new Special Account for Part B was opened and the IBRD approved a major
new sub-project with Novoviatsky Ski Factory, disbursements quickly picked up, driven by
streamlined project management arrangements free from duplication of functions under the
previous organizational set up, more efficient interaction between Roseximbank (financial

intermediary and PIU) and the final borrower and thus much stronger ownership of the sub-
project by final borrowers and more client orientated PIU. The total of USD 13,998,736 was
disbursed out of the proceeds of Loan from the beginning of Part B of the Project to May 31,
20 I 0 that makes over 91 % of the reduced Part B amount of USD 15,308,251. Most notably, since
Roseximbank became a PIU for Part B of the Project in late 2008 this component has disbursed
about USD 12 million compared to less than USD 2.2 in between 2005 and 2008 ensuring
successful completion of three sub-projects.
The audit of Part B of the Project for the period of September 2008 to end-May 2010 was
finalized and the audit report with an unqualified auditor opinion was submitted to MOF and
IBRD in end-June 2010.
In addition, Part B of the Project as revised in 2008 enabled Roseximbank to implement with
MOF financing important research on defining forms of support by the State Bank - Agent of the
Russian Federation Government to forestry complex enterprises in the new economic conditions,
developing investment mechanisms to expand production, stimulate domestic demand and build
export potential of the Russian Federation forestry complex, as well as analyzing potential
mechanisms of cooperation between Eximbank of Russia and the World Bank in support of
Russia's forest sector companies.
The following major lessons learned can be drawn from implementation of Part B of the Project:
   •   On-lending through a state bank is greatly facilitated if the PIU functions rest with this
       bank, that if necessary can be strengthened with individual consultants well versed in
       IBRD procedures.
   •   Anyon-lending focused on private enterprises prior to its launch should have a well
       prepared comprehensive mechanism to inform prospective borrowers of the opportunities
       available and requirements attached that is further supported by technical assistance to be
       provided to project participants by the PIU on all project implementation issues,
       including preparation of feasibility studies and of procurement and disbursement
       documents in line with IBRD procedures.
   •   A two-stage collateral processing, first with the Agent Bank and then with MOF should
       be avoided and replaced with a more flexible mechanism, such as, for example, a one-
       time tripartite framework agreement for subsequent pledge of equipment procured under
       a sub-project to be signed by MOF, Agent Bank and end-borrower.
   •   In case on-lending through a financial intermediary is provided to private companies
       commercial practices method should prevail for the majority of contracts hence
       procurement thresholds for commercial practices should be increased accordingly.
       However, prior to the launch of the first sub-project with a particular borrower, its
       procurement practices should be extensively reviewed and improved as necessary as part
       of the overall sub-project approval.

Report for the Sustainable Forestry Pilot Project

Para,. 5.2        Comments:

                 1) Requirements with respect to lending to forest enterprises are
                 fully in line with Russian legislation and have been agreed with
                 the World Bank under Budget Credit Agreement #01-01-06/04-
                 117 dated September 13, 2005, between the Ministry of Finance
                 of the Russian Federation and' the State Specialized Russian
                 Export-Import Bank.

                 2) During preparation of the Project, the Minfin of Russia·
                 developed a detailed implementation plan for Component B of
                 the Project, including under rules and procedures of the Russian
                 legislation. Pursuant provisions of the Budget Code of the
                 Russian Federation, should a region have overdue debt, the
                 federal budget resources may no longer be provided to such
                 region'. This restriction substantially affected implementation of
                 Part B of the Project since majority of regions-potential
                 borrowers under Part B of the Project had overdue debts to the
                 federal budget.

                 Please change language of subparagraphs (a) and (c) given the
                 above comments.                                       .
Section B of     We request that the third and following sentences under para. 3
Annex 7          should be amended to read as follows: "In particular, due to
                 discrepancies in accounting mechanisms used during conversion
                 operations 'of the agency bank and Project Implementation Unit,
                 exchange rate differential appeared. Therefore, the Minfin of
                 Russia decided to suspend disbursement of IBRD loan proceeds
                 under Part B of the Project with respect to contracts that required
                 payments in currencies other than US dollars (i.e. required
                 conversion). Having reviewed the situation in detail, the Minfin
                 of Russia instructed the FER to credit the loan account with the
                 above exchange rate differential using its own funds and also
                 decided to assign the functions of the Project Implementation
                 Unit to the ZAO ROSEXIMBANK in order to eliminate
                 duplication of functions of the agency bank and the Project
                 Implementation Unit and increase efficiency in implementing
                 Part B of the Project"

                 The above language is consistent with the final version of the
                 Implementation Completion Report agreed with the Minfin for
                 Part B of the Sustainable Forestry Pilot Project developed by the
                 ZAO ROSEXIMBANK.

Dear Mr. Alba,

                          Re: Forestry Sustainable Pilot Project (Loan 4552-RU)

   The Federal Forestry Agency has reviewed the draft Implementation Completion and
Results Report regarding the Forestry Sustainable Pilot Project submitted in your letter
#201O-00670IECCUl dated November 25, 2010.

    The Russian Federation Sustainable Forestry Pilot Project was implemented in 2000-
2010 (hereinafter referred to as "the pilot project"). The pilot project envisaged support to
key areas of structural reforms which in the context of IBRD activities in Russia were
treated as the most important conditions for economic growth recovery and decrease in
the level of poverty in Russia,including:

        •    strengthening of the public sector management framework and general state
             administration which is extremely necessary for market economy regulation;
        •    creation of favorable conditions for private sector development;
        •    strengthening of the institutional framework for monitoring of compliance with
             effective laws and regulations related to environment protection and natural
             resources administration, including forest administration.

       The pilot project included three major components:

      assistance in transition to sustainable state forest administration on the basis of the
forest policy reform, improvement of forest regulation and information support systems
as well as improvement of forest protection, conservation and regeneration;
      assistance in restructuring of regional wood entities to be provided via regional
administrations on the basis of programs for training of personnel in the following areas:
cutting-edge wood harvesting and processing technologies, current trends in management
and business as well as contemporary methods of use of non-timber forest products;
      assistance in pilot project management and coordination, including implementation,
procurement, finance management and monitoring.

The pilot project activities were implemented in Khabarovsk, Krasnoyarsk, Arkhangelsk
and Leningradskaya regions; Kirov region was covered at the final stage of the pilot
project.

        Key pilot project objectives were to:

     improve state administration of Russian forests relating to key natural resources of
the pilot regions via reforming the forest policy, improvement of administration in the
field of forest resources use, protection, conservation and regeneration of forests.
     create more favorable conditions for attraction of private investments in forest use
via training of specialists in wood processing and company management as well as
demonstration of cutting-edge technologies.
     replicate forest policy and forest administration reforms in other Russian regions.

    Project Outcomes and Key Performance Indicators

   The following indicators were used to monitor the attainment of the above
development objectives:

    •     Increase in incomes from timber as a result of enactment of improved regulatory
          acts in the field of rent and financing of forestry.
    •     Increase in the area of forest resources where improved fire-fighting and pest
          control systems have been introduced.
    •     Increase in the area of forest resources where improved forest regulation and
          information support systems have been introduced.
    •     The number of persons who underwent training in company management methods
          and use of modern forest resources harvesting and processing technologies.

    The pilot project helped to create conducive· environment in Russia for a broader
introduction of voluntary certification systems through workshops and capacity building
activities, including activities delivered by the Forest Stewardship Council and the
Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification schemes (PEFC). The Forest
Stewardship Council has been present in Russia since early 2000 and by January 1, 2009
has certified 23 million hectares of forests, The Russian National Council on Forest
Certification, a member of PEFC, was established in 2009, and by May 1, 2010, has
certified 200,000 hectares of forests. It is expected that competition will reduce the cost
of certification and increase the number of certified businesses, especially among SMEs.
This would increase the consumption of legally produced timber while reducing
consurription of illegally produced timber, therefore collection of taxes and forest
revenues would improve.

    The area of forest resources where forest pathology monitoring methods (using
remote sensing data) were introduced increased from 37.8 million hectares in 2007 to 85
million hectares in 2009. The area covered by pest monitoring system based on remote
sensing data in areas of high and medium danger of infestation is 529.9 million hectares.
The equipment allowed to improve performance of satellite fire monitoring on 559.1
million hectares. It is expected that the laser and satellite equipment provided to the forest
inventory would help reduce costs by 15-20 per cent.




                                                47
     Special fire-fighting equipment procured under the project to equip 45 fire brigades
(fire stations) operates in eight regions covering a total area of 80 million hectares.

    The project helped to itnprove radio communication in 7 regions, including in 257
leskhozes and 102 forest aviation units. Radios using various frequencies, 343 radio
masts and 8 technical labs for land and airborne forest fighting have been procured. This
served to enhance fire fighting operations, accelerated decision making and facilitated
fire fighting in an ·area exceeding 325 million hectares. Reliable radio communication
between forest protection units and fire brigades significantly improved fire safety and
effectiveness in combating illegal logging.

    Equipment, services and training provided to 14 regional forest protection services
·helped to improve monitO,ring of forest conditions and pest control in 32 regions.
 Delivery and commissioning of all-terrain pest control units helped to expand the area
 subject to annual pest monitoring to 270,000 hectares.

    In Krasnoyarsk region a forest seed center has been upgraded and now it possesses
state-of-the-art equipment for seeds germination and quality control; this will help to
improve seed quality and reduce losses due to substandard seeds use. In tum, this would
allow obtaining accreditation from the International Seed Testing Association which may
bring significant revenues.

    The project has financed 33 workshops, training courses and study tours dealing with
public management of forest resources, fire and pest control, forest certification,
sustainable forestry and computer literacy with the total audience of 2,445 people. In
addition, forest colleges were equipped with modem surveying and measuring equipment
and a set of machinery (harvesting machine, forwarder and simulator).

   Based on its economic performance, the pilot project proved successful and can be
expanded and replicated.

   The pilot project helped to identify possible areas and opportunities for future
improvements in forest management.
