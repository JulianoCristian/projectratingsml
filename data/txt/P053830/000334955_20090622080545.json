The changes will be to: (1) strengthen the new\n            critical functions of the Federal Forestry Agency in the\n            areas of policy development, national forest\n            inventory/monitoring, and staff training (Part A of the\n            project); (2) provide US$l0.0 million of additional\n            Government co-financing for these new activities; (3) open a\n            second special account and consolidate implementation\n            responsibilities for Part B of the project inside\n            Roseximbank (agent bank); and (4) extend the project until\n            November 2009. The primary reason for these changes is to\n            help the Russian Federation upgrade its capacity for new\n            public forest management responsibilities, as defined by the\n            ongoing forest sector reform and mandated by the new forest\n            code. The secondary reason is to help the Russian Federation\n            streamline implementation arrangements for the currently\n            lagging Part B of the project."}, "docdt": "2008-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
