Some lessons learned includes: during rapid\n            changes to policy and institutions, providing just-in-time\n            policy advice is more helpful to counterparts than large\n            consultancy contracts, which in this case were stalled by a\n            quality and cost-based selection method. Rapid policy and\n            institutional changes rendered existing tours redundant and\n            revising them created even longer delays. Small flexible\n            contracts may be more useful and attractive to clients under\n            such conditions and Bank project teams should respond\n            rapidly to provide cutting edge advice to clients. Key\n            project development objective (PDO) indicators should be\n            linked specifically to Project activities, unaffected by\n            exogenous, confounding factors, and achievable within the\n            Project lifespan. For example, it was believed\n            'increase in forestry revenues' will result from\n            regulations drafted in the project design. However, adoption\n            and implementation of new regulations is a prolonged process\n            and both may be incomplete before project closing.\n            Furthermore, forest revenues depend largely on demand for\n            wood products and the overall state of the economy, over\n            which the project had no control. Multiple layers\n            implementing agencies should be avoided; involving multiple\n            implementing agencies created bureaucratic overlaps and\n            slowed project implementation. If several agencies must be\n            involved, responsibilities should be clearly delineated.\n            Procurement of firefighting equipment helped meet a\n            significant upgrading need in forest fighting capacity in\n            fire-prone Russia, as evidenced by the Government's\n            large additional contribution to counterpart financing to\n            replicate it in more regions than originally planned. As the\n            2010 fires showed there is room for further replication in\n            other regions. Procurement specifications for forest\n            firefighting and other equipment should not be\n            insufficiently detailed to address regional differences.\n            Easy availability of spare parts should be factored in\n            equipment selection criteria."}, "docdt": "2010-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
