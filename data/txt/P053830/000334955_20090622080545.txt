ProjectPaper


I. Introductory Statement

a) This Project Paper lays out the proposedsecond-order restructuring ofthe Russia
    SustainableForestry Pilot Project(Loan No.4552-RU, Project IDP053830) and
    accompanyingamendments to the Project's legal documents, as requestedby the
    Borrower inthe letter dated February 14,2008.

b) The proposedchanges would beto: (1) strengthenthe new critical functions ofthe Federal
    Forestry Agency inthe areas of policy development, national forest inventory/monitoring,
    and staff training (Part A ofthe Project); (2) provide US$lO.O million of additional
    Government co-financing for these new activities; (3) open a second SpecialAccount and
    consolidate implementationresponsibilitiesfor Part B ofthe Project insideRoseximbank
    (agent bank); and (4) extendthe ProjectuntilNovember 2009.

c) The primarv reasonfor these changesi s to help the RussianFederationupgrade its
    capacity for new public forest management responsibilities, as defined by the ongoing
    forest sector reform and mandatedby the new Forest Code (effective since January 2007).
    The secondaryreasonis to helpthe RussianFederationstreamline (simplify and
    consolidate) implementation arrangements for the currently lagging Part B ofthe Project.

d) The expected outcomes are a more orderly decentralization of forest management
    functions to the Regions, a concomitantseamless reorientation and strengtheningof
    Federal-level functions, and development of a critical mass of experience of Russian
    development banks and industry inthe long-term financing of sustainable forestry
    investmentprojects.


II. Background and Reasons for Restructuring
a) The Project was approvedon May 23,2000 and it became effective on March 7,2002,
    after a two-year delay caused by the restructuring ofthe Ministry ofNatural Resources in
    2000. The obiectives ofthe Project, as stipulated inthe Loan Agreement, were to improve
    public sector managementof Russia's forests, strengthenthe enabling environment for
    private sector involvement in forest utilization inthe seven (initially -three) pilot regions,
    and replicate policy reforms and improved forest managementpractices outside ofthe
    pilot regions.

b) Proiect Performance: Part A ofthe Project-Sustainable Public ForestManagement-has
    pickedup strongly since 2003 and has overall done well (rated S in last ISR); it is nearly
    fully (97%) disbursed. Part B ofthe Project-Institutional StrengtheningofForest
    Enterprises-has    done less well (downgradedfrom MSto Uin last ISR); it is only 10%
    disburseddue to a protractedlack of adjustments inthe overly complex implementation
    scheme; however, the unused balanceof US$20.1 million is now fully committed under
    the pipeline of subprojects. PartC-Project     Management and Monitoring-has       also done
    well, but lately affected by the continuedproblems with Part B (downgraded from S to
    MSinlastISR) and is 99%disbursed. The overall implementationprogress(IP) andthe

    progresstoward achievement ofthe PDOhasbeenratedS to MS (downgradedin last ISR
    due to problemswith Part B). The Borrower's restructuringideawas agreeduponin
    principle with the Bank in September 2007, at which timethe Borrowercommitteditself
    to a "Calendar Plano fActions o f Project Participants"that would be neededbeforethe
    restructuringcouldbe officially finalized (Attachment2 to the letter ofthe Ministry of
    Financedated September 27, 2007). As o fdate, this ActionPlanhas been fully and
    satisfactorilycompleted-up to the point where the Bank's restructuringdecisionhas to
    take place. The updated status of the ActionPlanis available inprojectfiles.

c) Reasons for Restructuring: With the exceptionof PartBythe Projecthas beenperforming
    satisfactorily,but its outcomes would be enhancedthroughrestructuring. The main
    reasonwhy the GovernmentofRussiahas requestedthis restructuringis to expand the
    reachofthe informationand educationelements ofthe Projectto the entire country. The
    additionalreason is to improveutilizationo fthe remainingloan funds under PartB as a
    catalyst of replicableexperience with long-termfinancingof sustainable forestry
    investmentprojectsby the developmentbanks and privatesector.The Government's
    rationalefor doingthis under the structureofthis Project(rather thanthrougha separate,
    stand-aloneGovernment-fundedprogram), and with the World Bank as a continued
    partner, is becausethe Governmentsees significantvalue inthe continuedaccess to the
    Bank's globalknow-how inthe technicaland policy aspects of forest management, as
    well as inthe Bank's fiduciary control strengths relatedto overseeingthe project
    financing.

d) UnforeseenEvents: The new ForestCode ofJanuary 2007 essentiallydecentralizedforest
    management functions(to a muchhigher degree than initially anticipated) and caused a
    major change inthe federalfunctions, whichneedto be clarifiedand strengthened.

e) Co-FinancinqGovernmenthas proposedto contributean additionalUS$12.3million in
    co-financing($10 million co-financingfor PartA, about $1.3 million co-financingfor Part
    Cyand $1.O million of counterpartbudgetary fundingtowardsthe projectmanagement
    costs of Part B), whichdemonstrates solidownershipand excellent interestinmaintaining
    Bank involvementinthe sector.

    InstitutionaKapacityIssues: Under PartA ofthe Project,the reconfiguredFederal
    ForestryAgency hasbeen greatly changed-in particularvis-&vis its relationshipwith the
    regionalforest agencies-through the provisionsofthe new ForestCode, while its
    responsibilitiesare ever more criticalto the well-being o fthe forest estate. Hence
    clarificationand strengtheningofthose new roles and functions, as well as the
    strengtheningof future Federal-Regionalrelationships, is essential. UnderPartB ofthe
    Project, the proposed consolidationof implementationfunctions within Roseximbank
    (subsidiary o fthe RussianDevelopmentBank)-complementedby additionaltargeted
    assistance from the Ministry ofFinance-will help morefully internalize and mainstream
    the investmentscreeningand due-diligenceresponsibilitieswithin the growingscope o f
    developmentbankingtransactionsinthe Russianforest sector.

111. Proposed Changes
a) No changes are proposedinthe Proiect Development Obiectives. Specific changes inthe
    Project outcomes, design and scope are detailed below for each part ofthe Project.

    ProposedChanges for PartA: The main changes would involve expandingthe PartA
    activities, with an emphasis on scaling-up and strengtheningthe Federal-Regional
    relationship on all mattersof forest policy development(seeAnnex 2for a summary
    description of the Part A expansion scenario). The FFA managementhas clarified its
    overall philosophy of the proposedscaling up ofthe project's PartA at the presentstage
    of forest management development inRussia,which was startedwith the enactmentofthe
    new Forest Code on January I,2007. The regional governments have now receivedmajor
    responsibilities for forest management, together with earmarked federal budgettransfers
    (subventions) to implementthese functions. The pilot phase ofthe Project has helpedtest
    new models for such regional management and strengthencritical capacity, especially in
    fire management.

    Under the new phase ofthe Project ("expansion scenario"), such further federal assistance
    to the regions will no longer be relevant, nor realistically possible (as it would take
    disproportionately more effort to amend the Budget Law and federal regulationsabout
    forest subventions). Instead, the expandedproject would focus on the two critical tasks
    that would support further strengtheningof all levels of forest management system in
    Russiaunder the new Forest Code: (i)developmentofthe new National Forest Inventory
    and Analysis (NFIA) system, including forest fire and pest monitoring; and (ii)massive
    re-training of forest managementstaff innew laws, regulationsand technologies. Bothof
    these elements (inventoryhformation management and training) had beenan integral part
    ofthe original project design, but they could not be fully implementedunder the pilot
    phase becauseofthe inherent limitations ofthe pre-reform system. Under the expansion
    scenario, these original objectiveswould be fully andmore effectively implementedat a
    nation-wide scale, following the institutional changes set up by the new Forest Code.

    The institutional arrangementsfor the NFIA have been achievedthrough the now-
    completed reorganizationof the FederalState Unitary Enterprise(FGUP) Roslesinforg
    and setting up, under it, 11regional NFIA centers co-locatedwith the existing forest
    inventory enterprises. This has allowed to preserveandutilize the technical, data and
    personnelcapacity ofthe existing inventory system, while focusing on further
    developmentof public functions ofNFIA and forest monitoring betweenthe federal center
    and the regions, and separatingcommercial functions oftactical forest management
    planning. The new NFIA system would be developedand strengthened in"double
    coordination" -both betweenthe federal and regional levels of data use, and betweenthe
    forest inventory, fire and pest monitoring data segments. Inthis sense, the fire and pest
    monitoring investmentsto be implemented, respectively, by Avialesookhrana (aerial forest
    fire protection center) and Roslesozashchita(forest pest protection center), would be
    technologically coordinatedwith the NFIA investmentsofthe reorganizedRoslesinforg
    and its field branches; regional forest management unitswould have to be closely involved
    in the design andtesting ofthese investments.

RussiaSustainableForestryPilot Project               - 5 -                               April 12, 2008
ProjectPaper

    An additional element ofthe expanded project supportwould be relatedto the
    development of Russia's capacity to expandits "carbon sink" forest plantationsunder the
    Kyoto Protocol inthe selected central and southernregions. A major increase infederal
    budget is plannedto support these activities -from RUB 200 million ($7.5 m) in2007 to
    RUB 1billion ($38m) in2009 andas high as RUB 4.5 billion($170m) per annum inthe
    subsequent years. The "expanded project" activities would include establishment of seed
    testing facilities (tentatively inNizhniy Novgorod, Saratov and other regions) to produce
    and test high-quality closedroot seedlings for this federal program. These activities
    would be carried out insteadofthe originally plannedproduction nursery development in
    Leningrad and Khabarovsk, which is now a responsibility taken over by the respective
    regional administrations in accordance with the new Forest Code of Russia.

    Regardingtraining activities under the expanded project, long-term strategictask would
    require basic re-training of 100,000-200,000 forest managementand technical staffacross
    the country over a 5-6-year period (covering federal, regional and local forestry
    specialists, including inthe private sector). The FFA has the mandateand budgetary
    funding to organize this work on the basis of its two continuouseducation institutes and
    19 forestry colleges (tekhnikums). The role ofthe expandedproject would be to help
    modernizetechnical equipment and curricula ofthese educational facilities, and retrain
    their faculty accordingly, while the actual training ofthe some ofthe target audiences
    (suchas regional andprivate sector specialists) would be carriedout by these entities
    themselves, without the Project's direct funding.

    Overall these proposedactivities under the expandedprogram scenario are consistent with
    the original Project objectivesas well as with the new Russia-World Bank Country
    Partnership Strategy (CPS) as approvedinDecember 2006.

    ProposedChanges for Part B: Part B ofthe Project-Institutional      Strengtheningo fForest
    Management-has        startedexperiencingserious difficulties soon after its launch in
    September 2005 (after the first Loan amendment). The underlying reason was that this
    component's implementation model heavily relied on atight transactionalcoordination
    betweenthe project implementationunit (FER) andthe agent bank (Roseximbank). While
    this scheme was initiallyjustified, given the lack ofexperienceand capacity inthe agent
    bank, a subsequent growth of the pipeline of investment subprojects inRoseximbankhas
    ledto an increasingoverlap and duplication of fiduciary and processingfunctions between
    the PIUandthe agent bank and eventually causedthe applicableproceduresto become
   mutually contradictory and de-facto dysfunctional. Given poor performance,the Bank
   hadproposed in early 2007 cancelingthis componentaltogether.

   Inmid-2007, Roseximbankbecame a subsidiary ofthe newly createdRussian
   Development Bank, and the Ministry of Financeemphasizedthe importance of usingthe
   experience of Project implementationunder this component as a catalyst for building a
   credible working model and track record of small-to medium-size, long-term investments
    in forest sector innovations and staffretraining by onlending to the private sector via a
   development bank.

    The proposedchanges inthis component would consolidateinsideRoseximbank-and
    streamline-most of the implementationresponsibilities(procurement,financial
    management and disbursement), with openingo fthe 2ndSpecialAccount that would be
    manageddirectly by Roseximbank,andwith additionalcapacity buildingfor this bank
    providedthrough budgetaryallocations ofthe Ministry ofFinance. This would result in
    Roseximbank's legalandtechnical ability to fully implement,within the next 18 months,
    its existingpipelineof 5 investmentsubprojectsaimedat forest sector innovationsand
    staff retrainingin 5 Russianregions, thereby achievingthe originalProjectDevelopment
    Objectivesofthis component and, additionally,helpinginternalize the investmentproject
    processingcapacitywithin Russia's nascent developmentbankingsystem. The entire
    amount ofPart B loanproceeds ($22.25 million) is now fully committed, i.e. either under
    implementation,or approved& signed, or under memorandum o fcommitment(seeAnnex
    - anupdatedstatusof PartBsubprojects). Anadditionalpipelineofover$20million
    lfor
    i s currently under review by Roseximbank(to be financedby Governmentfunds, outside
    of the subject IBRD loan).

b) ComplementamChanges:

          InstitutionalArrangements: No changes are proposed, The Ministry o fNatural
          Resourcesandthe FederalForestryAgency retaintheir role inthe implementationof
          PartA, and the Ministry o fFinancewill continueto leadimplementationofPartB,
          jointly with and throughthe agent bank (Roseximbank). The Subsidiary Loan
          Agreementbetweenthe Ministry ofFinanceand Roseximbankand "Part B
          Guidelines"will be amendedto reflectthe new functions ofRoseximbankas the
          implementationunit for Part B.
          FinancingMechanism/Conduit: No changes inthe mechanism are proposed. The
          Governmentwill significantlyincrease its share ofco-financing(up to 92% for Part
          A and upto 98% for Part C).
          Outputs: Additionaloutputswill be inestablishmentofthe newnationwide system
          of forest inventoryand monitoringand in strengtheningof forest personneltraining
          systems (as mandatedby the new Forest Code).
          ProjectCosts and FinancingPlan(seeAnnex I):Totalproject costs will
          cumulatively increase from US$74.5 million (at appraisal) to US$l13.3million
          (expansionscenario). There will be no changes inthe Bank contribution(US$60
          million loan as approved in2000). The additionalfunding will come from the
          Governmentco-financing(aUS$24.5 million increasewas sanctionedas a result of
          the Loan amendment inJune 2005, and an additionalUS$12.3million will be
          allocatedunder the terms ofthe proposedrestructuring).
          FinancialManagement: No changes for PartsA and C, Le.FMcarriedout fully
          satisfactorily by the Foundationof EnterpriseRestructuring(FER) actingas the
          agent for the Ministry ofFinanceand the FederalForestryAgency. For PartB, the
          FMfunctions will be transferredfrom the FERto Roseximbank. The Financial
          Management CapacityAssessment o fRoseximbankwas conductedby the Bank in
          January-February2008 and is satisfactory.
          DisbursementArrangements: No changes for PartsA and C, Le. disbursement
          carriedout fully satisfactorilyby the FERactingas the agent for the Ministry of

          Finance and the FederalForestryAgency. For Part Bydisbursementfunctions will
          be transferred from the FER to Roseximbankandthe 2ndSpecialAccount will be
          opened by Roseximbankfor the needs ofthat component.
    (vii) Procurement: No changes for PartsA and CyLe. procurement carried out fully
           satisfactorily by the FER acting as the agent for the Ministry of Finance andthe
          Federal ForestryAgency. A new procurementplan has been preparedfor the
          expanded scenario of PartA ofthe Project (available inproject files) and it is
          acceptableto the Bank. For Part Byno changes inthe procurementprocedures
           (mostly by commercial practices). The procurementsupervision for that component
          will be carried out by Roseximbank. The ProcurementCapacity Assessment of
          Roseximbankwas conductedby the World Bank in January-February2008 and i s
           satisfactory.
    (viii) Closing Date: Proposedto be extendedto November 30, 2009 to allow completion
           o fthe expanded and restructuredactivities.
    (ix) Implementation Schedule: All major additional contracts under Part A will be
           signed beforeOctober 2008 and completed before October 2009. All new Part B
           subloanswill be signedbefore June 2008 and completedbefore November 2009.


IV.Analysis
a) Effect of ProposedChanges: The proposedproject restructuringwould have a significant
    impact on the original economic, financial and institutional aspects ofthe Project as
    appraised. These impacts would be positive (and additional to the overall positive impact
    ofthe implementedforest sector reforms on the effectivenessofthe Project outputs). No
    significant impactsare expectedon the technical and social aspects ofthe Project.

    The economic impacts of implementation ofthe new national forest inventory and
    monitoring system would be driven by the increasedcompleteness of forest resource
    assessments across the country and the relatedincrease of efficiency of investments in
    sustainable forest management. The economic impactofthe improved staff training
    would be defined by an increase inavailability of adequately qualified personnel(the
    mainbottleneckto private investmentsinthe sector) andby an increaseinoverall
    productivity and efficiency of forest sector enterprises.

    The overall financial impacts of implementationofthe new national forest inventory and
    monitoring system would be positive becausethe additional moderateupfront
    establishment costs would be significantly offset by the increasedpublic revenuesfrom
    more accurate, transparent and more easily enforceableforest lease/forestuse payments
    by the private sector.

    The institutional impacts of the new inventory and monitoring systemwould be defined
    by the increasedtransparencyand accountability of public forest managementand
    improved overall governance ofthe Russianforest sector. This new system, together with
    improved stafftraining, would also help realign new responsibilities ofthe federal and
    regional levelsof government and strengthentheir overall capacity in sustainable forest
    management.

b) Environmentaland Other Safeguards: The proposedrestructuringdoes not raise the
    environmentalcategoryofthe Project,nor does ittrigger any new safeguard policies.

c) Exceptionsto Bank Policies: The proposedrestructuringdoes not involveany exceptions
    to Bankpolicies.


V. Expected Outcomes
a) Impacton DevelopmentObiectives(DOs), Outcome Targetsand Indicators: There will
    be no change inthe DOs. Neitherthere will be any changes inthe list o fProject
    Monitoringand EvaluationIndicators(as alreadyamended inJune 2005).

    The end-projecttargetswill be increased for the following indicatorsto account for the
    impact of the expanded informationand training systems: (#1) significant increase in level
    o f forest revenuecollected; (#2) significantincrease in forest area coveredby improved
    forest informationand management planningsystems, includingvoluntary forest
    certificationand chainof custody; and (#4) significant increase inthe number ofpersons
    trained in the use ofmodernforest management, regeneration, and utilizationtechniques.
    A table detailingthe currentand proposed projecttargets is enclosed inAnnex 3.


VLBenefits and Risks
a) The expected benefitsof the proposedrestructuringare summarizedin SectionIV(a)
    above.

b) The following          have been identifiedthat couldjeopardizethe achievement o fthe
    restructuredProject's DOsand targets:

    (i)    Political/ Institutional: Significantturnover of staffand management, potentially
           associatedwith hrther reorganizationofthe Government (expectedinMay 2008),
           might have an adverse effecton the institutionalability ofthe FederalForestry
          Agency and the Ministry ofFinanceto maintainsteady course o f implementationof
          the restructuredProject. Risk rating - "Moderate    ".

    (ii)Capacity: Existingcapacityoftheimplementingagencies(FFAandRoseximbank)
          mightbe insufficientto process, with due diligence andwithin the remaining
          timeframe, the proposedtechnically complex investments(IT and
          geodetidnavigationsystems, training simulatorsunder PartA; wood processing
          equipment under PartB). Risk rating - "Low ".

c) RiskMitigation: The lSt would be mitigatedby a significant relianceon technical
                                risk
    (non-politicallyappointed)subdivisionsand agents ofthe responsibleGovernment
    institutions, e.g. Roslesinforgand FERfor the FFA, and Roseximbankfor the Ministry of
    Finance. The 2ndrisk would bemitigatedby the upfront mobilizationofadditional
   technical and procurementconsultantsinthe FERand Roseximbank.

       (Excerpt from the submissionof the Ministry of Natural Resourcesof Russia
                                       dated January 22,2008)

Followingthe Instructionfrom A.L. Kudrin, DeputyChairmano fthe Governmentofthe
RussianFederation,Minister of Financeo fthe RussianFederation,the Ministry ofNatural
Resources ofthe RussianFederationis hereby reportingthat:

The Sustainable ForestryPilot Project ( `the Project') was implementedinaccordance with
LoanAgreement# 4552-RU, dated March30,2001 ( `the Loan Agreement') betweenthe
RussianFederationandthe InternationalBank for ReconstructionandDevelopment
(`IBRD').

As per the LoanAgreement, the loanmaturitydate is June 15, 2017, and its closingdate is
September 30, 2007.

The project consistsoftwo components: Part A to finance activities relatedto forest policy
reforms,and Part B to finance sub-projectscomposed o f forest industryactivitiesto buildup
regionalcapacityto operate modernequipmentand machineryfor forest logging, wood and
non-woodforest resource processing.

Inaccordance with the amendedLoanAgreement, Part A o fthe project(includingactivities
fundedfrom the federal budget)was been financedinthe following way:
                                                                                 fcumulative)

As ofDecember 31, 2007, PartA disbursedUS$70.3 million, includingUS$ 32.8 million
from the loan and US$37.5 million from the federal budget.

So, as o f December 3 I 2007, the balance of Part A was US$0.98 million (loanproceeds) and
US$0.78 million (federalbudgetproceeds).

The balance under PartA resulted,among other things, from savingsofthe funds allocatedto
procuregoods, works, and services through competitiveselection ofsupplierswhen the

for inthe ForestCode ofthe RussianFederation(FederalLaw # 200-FZ, dated December 4,
2006).

Subcomponent A(3) ofPartA (ForestFire andPest Management) procuredfire-fightingand
pest control equipmentand machinery andyielded economicbenefitsexceeding US$40.5
million in 2005 alone as it permittedto reduce burnt areas inthe forest estate.

Currently, the projectis ratedby the IBRDas most successful, particularly, interms of forest
fire control, more sustainable forest use and improvedhumanresource capacity o fthe forest
sector (PartA). The total cost o f signed contracts is above 97 %ofthe loan proceeds
committedfor respectiveactivities.Duringits implementationin7 Russianregions,the
projectsupplied693 unitsof fire equipment capable to cover morethan 180 million ha, and
fully up-gradedcommunicationsystems.

Article 81o fthe ForestCode ofthe RussianFederationsets forth powersof public authorities
o fthe RussianFederationinthe area of forest relations.To ensure duly performanceo fthe
functionsvestedto public authoritiesofthe RussianFederation, it is intendedto: (i) design
and put inplacea geographic informationsystem to develop digital databases, and process
remotesensing data andnationalforest inventorydata; (ii)put inplacea telecommunication
system for informationsharingand coordinationunderthe nationalforest inventory;and (iii)
develop and introducea systemto evaluate regionalforest management and use.

The projectextensionis not in conflict with the key guidelines and objectivesofthe public
debt management policy as approved by the Governmentofthe RussianFederation.The
appropriatenesso fprojectactivitiesisjustified by the fact that the projectprovidesan
opportunityto get technicalassistance from independentconsultantswho have international
experienceinaddressing similar issues, without mobilisingresourcesfrom the IBRD. In
addition, projectmonitoringand projectmanagement will restnot only with stakeholder
federal executiveauthorities (MNR, FFA, MOEDT, MOF), butwill also involveIBRD
experts.

Ifthe projectisextendedby2years, additionalfunds willbechannelledto:

1). Establishsystems o fnationalforest inventory, forest healthmonitoring,and forest fire
danger monitoring;

2). Strengtheninfrastructureand up-gradeequipment of subordinatedresearch institutes;and

3). Builduptrainingcapacity of forest colleges, improvetraining/learningprocessesand
introducenew specializations.

It is proposedto: procure field and laboratorydevicesandequipment,multifimctionalheavy
machinery (forwardersand harvesters)and simulatorsto master new skills; traintrainers from
forest colleges and arrange study tours for them, procurecomputerhardwareand equipment
for presentationsto be installedinclass-rooms.
