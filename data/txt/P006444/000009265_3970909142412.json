"abstracts": {"cdata!": "This is the Implementation Completion\n            report (ICR) for the Federal Highways Management and\n            Rehabilitation Project in Brazil. The project, following on\n            the Sixth and Seventh Highway Projects, was designed to\n            continue assisting in modernizing the road subsector's\n            organization and management and in strengthening its\n            agencies. The project was successful in achieving its\n            physical objectives but success was uneven in fulfilling\n            institutional goals. Overall, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory in terms of responsiveness to client needs,\n            although with shortcomings. The Borrower's performance\n            was unsatisfactory with respect to the provision of\n            counterpart funds but satisfactory in terms of project\n            coordination and monitoring, which contributed to reduced\n            field supervision inputs by Bank staff. Among the lessons\n            learned: 1) the decentralization process of a large highway\n            network such as the federal system of Brazil involves\n            regional, economic and political interests of large\n            magnitude, and requires more time to mature and implement\n            than was anticipated at appraisal; 2) counterpart funding\n            problems adversely affected the implementation of the\n            physical investment component of the project; 3) Bank\n            supervision teams were often unable to identify delays and\n            issues early enough to propose timely remedial measures; 4)\n            The investments financed under the project were justified in\n            economic terms, and technical solutions were optimized at\n            the level of each individual investment; 5) Work programs\n            should be based on a multi-year investment program supported\n            by objective network survey and economic evaluation and not,\n            as was often the case during implementation, on a stock of\n            available project design studies launched on the basis of\n            perceived needs by district engineers; 6) To be effective,\n            the institutional components of projects need to more\n            focused and address a few essential issues with realistic\n            timetables and designs adapted to the capacity of the\n            executing agency; and 7) Continuity in the Bank team during\n            implementation had a positive and stabilizing influence\n            during a period of many changes in National Road Department\n            key personnel."}, "docdt": "1997-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
