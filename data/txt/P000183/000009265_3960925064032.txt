PREFACE.
Credit 1132-BU (SOR 20.5 mtilion _J/ ) was signed on December 17, 1981
and became effective on March 17, 1980.  The actual closing date was June 14,
1985, six months later than estimated at appraisal. The Credit was fully
disbursed.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
Infrastructure Operations Division, South-Central and Indian Ocean Department,
Africa Region on the basis of the appraisal report, project files, supervision
mission reports, and the completion report by the Oirectorate 6eneral of Roads
(Direction 66n6rale des Routes - D6R) of the Ministry of Public Works (Ministore
des Travaux Publics - MTP).
The project was co-financed by the Government of Burundi (USS5.2
million equivalent including taxes Z  ', Japan (US$2 million equivalent), United
Nations Capital Development Fund (US81.6 million equivalent), Belgium
(US$300,000 equivalent) and France (US$400,000 equivalent). The total external
financing covered 1001 of the project foreign cost and about 491 of the project
local cost net of taxes. The remaining 511 of the local cost net of taxes was
financed by the Government, which also met the road-maintenance recurrent costs
amounting to about USS9.2 million for the three and a half years of the project
implementation, or about US$2.6 million equivalent per year.
In accordance with the revised procedures Zor project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but
the project waS not audited by ORD staff. The draft PCR vas sent to the
Borrower on November 9, 1988.  No comments were received.
j   US$25 million at appraisal.  Because of currencies realignments, total
diaburseoments of SOR 20.5 million were actually equivalent to about US$21.4
million.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HI6HWAY PROJECT
CREDIT 1132-9U
HIGHLIGITS
1.        This project was the third financed by IDA in the transport sector.
It was designed to assist the 6overnment in improving (i) the road ne'.work to
facilitate dacentralization and to support development efforts in the
northeastern part of the country and (ii) an alternative land connection to the
port of Dar es Salaam. The project was a logical continuation of the efforts
started under the Highway Maintenance Project and the Second Highway Project.
2.        Project preparation was difficult and long, because of increasing
costs of road construction in Surundi. Project preparation began in August
1978, and IDA approved the project in April 1981. The credit, however, could
not be signed until Decembar, because of lack of IDA's funds.  There were no
major problems durin¢ projec. implementation; the project w&s completed in
December 1984, eix months later than estimated at appraisal, because of the
delay in sikning the credit.
3.        Project total cost, including taxes, was FBu 3,147 million (US$30.9
million equivalent), compared to a total project cost, including taxes and
contingencies of FBu 3,150 million (US$35.0 million equivalent) estimated at
appraisal. The re-calculated overall rate of economic return was 18.51, as
compared to 191 estimated at appraisal.
4.        All contractors, local and foreign, including DOR's two brigades, and
all consultants carried out their works well and on schedule.

THIRD HIGHWRY PROJECT
CREgIT 1132-IU
I. !NTRODUCT12M
1.01      Burundi is a small country of about 27,800 kr2.  Situated in Eastern
Africa, south of the eouator, about 1,400 km from the Indian Ocean, it borders
on Zaire, Rwanda ana Tanzania. It is a mountainous country astride the
Congo/Nile ridge; the central plateau falls steeply away to marshy valleys in
the north and east and to a plain in the west. Bujumbura, the country's capital
and commercial center, is eccentrically situated in the west on lake Tanganyika
and is separated from tha rest of the country by chain of mountains.
1.02      With about 4 million inhabitants, Burundi is one of the most densely
populated countries in the world, averaging 155 inhabitants per km2. However,
the population is xrregularly distributed, with densities ranging from about 300
inhabitants per km2 in the north and center to only 30 in the east. About 95X
of the population lives discersed on subsistence agriculture and on one
principal cash crop, coffee, which provides. the major source of foreign
exchange.
1.03      The country, therefore, depends heavily on imports.  The jxternal
trado is mostly with industrialized countries and averages 200,000 tons of which
SSZ are imports. Mining and industries are very limited. Its rugged
topooraphy, which makes road construction and maintenance costly, its dispersed
rural population and it. landlocked position, have greatly influenced the
development of Burundi's transport system.   These geographic features, the
imbalance between the in-bound and out-bound traffic, and the seasonal nature of
the coffee exports, keep the transport costs in Burundi high.
1.04      Internal transport is composed of (i) exports, mainly coffee, tea and
cotton, (ii) beer and agricultural produce, and (iii) imports, fuel, consumer
goods, construction materials, plant and equipment. Internal transport is
mostly by roads there are neither railways nor navigable rivers, and Lake
Tanganyika is mainly used for international transport.
1.05      As a land-locked country, Burundi depends on the transport
infrastructures and services of the neighbouring countries for access to the
Ocean ports. External transport is by lake and rail to Oar as Salaam (about
1,400 km), and by road (about 2,000 km) or road/rail (about 2,270 km) to
Mombasa. However, shipments of imports and exports through these two outlets
have been beset by frequent delays and losses due to (i) capacity problem3, poon
management and thefts on the Tanzania railways and in the port of Oar as Salaam,
(iL) cumbersome administrative procedure at border customs, and unroliability of
Uganda's railways, and (iii) political instability in the region.
1.06      Wheraos internal transport is within the Government's control,
external transport is not: the volumo of its international trade traffic has
been relatively so low, that Burundi has had little leverage to get the transit
countries to improve their transport facilitieo. To aosist the land-locked



:ountries in the Region in identifying the actions ano investments required to
.mprove the performance of the internationai routes to the ocean ports. in 1980
!he Bank carried out a survev of the external transoort connections of Burundi
and Rwanoa.   .ater on. UNCTAD carried out a more extensive survey also covering
Uganca and easzern Zaire. In 1986 the Bank reviewed the situation of
.n;ernational transoort in Burundi ano Rwanoa.
1.07      The three major socioeconomic goals of the Government have oeen to
(i) improve institutional ano structural support to the agriculture sector, to
increase production and reduce the country dependence on imports, (ii) diversify
the agricultural sector and deveiop mining and industry, to reduce the country
dependence on coffee exports and (iii) promote the development of other regional
economic centers, to decentralize the economic and social activities away from
Bujumbura.
1.08      To support these objectives, Burundi needs an efficient and economic
internal and external transport. Therefore, the Government's long term
objectives for the transport sector have been to (i) improve and maintain the
internal road network aoeouately, to support decentralization and
diversification of the economy, (ii) improve in particular those roads which
connect with international routes to ocean ports, to reduce the country's
dependence on the lake/rail connection to Dar es Salaar, and (iii) develop and
strengthen transport planning.
1.09      At appraisal the transport system consisted of:
(a) about 3,000 km of clessified roads of which 280 km were paved,
0 km were gravelled. anl about 160 km were being paved,
(b)  about 2,500 km of non-classified rural roads,
Cc)  the lake part of Bujumbura and
Cd)  the international airport of Bujumbura.
At present about 900 km of roads are paved. 75 km are being paved and
650 km are grovelled.
1.10       IDA's involvement in Burundi's highway subsector began in 1970 with
the Highway Engineering Project (Credit SlI-BU, USS3B0,000), which helpil
finance detailed engineering of the Bujumbura-Nyanza Lac road and a study for
the improvement of road maintenance.  In 1974, IDA approved of the Highway
flaintenance Project (Credit 467-BU, USS5.0 million), which helped financet
Ca)  the preparation and implementation of a four-year maintenance
program, including the establishment of a labor intensive road
maintenance organization and one mechanized maintenance brigade,
(b)  the technical assistanice for these activities and for training of
local staff and
(c)  a general road investment study and feasibility studies of the
Ngozi-Kobero road (106 ki) as well as of other roads identified
under the investment study.



The Highway Maintenance Project. compieteo in Seotemoer 1980 (PCR dated
eotemoer 2S, 1981). significantly imoroved the road maintenance organization.
!.11      In 1978. .DA approveo oi the Second Highway Projoct (cracit 773-BU,
'JS$14 mllion, 1978).  The Project provided for the (U) paving of
Bujumbura-Rugomoo roac (6S km) , ( i ) start-up pnase of an improvement program
for selected secondary reads ana bridges, (iii) the construction of a new
central laboratory, (lv) strengthening of the mechanized maintenance brigade and
(v) the provis.on of technicai aasistance and road eQuipnent.
1.12      Serious problema beset the road paving component.  In September 1978,
the Government awarded a US$10.2 million  contract.  The contract price was
about 11% lower than the appraisal estimate. According to the contract, the
work was scheduled to be finished by May 1980, i.e. in 18 months. However, the
work was delayed by about two and a half years, mainly because transport to and
from Oar es Salaam and Mombasa were often interrupted due to hostilities between
Tanzania and U.ianda. The contractors equipment arrived at the work site several
months late and shorcages of essential supplies occurred frequently.
1.13      In May tS92, two years later than the contract completion date, when
the work was almcst fini.hod, the contractor went bankrupt, and the Government
had to award a US5130,400 contract to another contractor to finish the work.
The actual total construction cost was 1S4X higher than the initial contract
price and 691 higher than the appraisal estimate. The work was finished in
December 1982.
1.14      At the beginning of 1983, some sections of the road began failing and
after a few months about SO km, out of 65, were in urgent need of being either
strengthened or repaired. Tho total cost of this additional work was about
US08.6 million of which USS1.3 million was financed by the 6overnment, US$3.8
million was financed under the Third Highway Project and USS3.5 is being
financed under the Fourth Highway Project. In spite of all this, the
recalculated ERR for this component was 141 compared to 161 at appraisal. On
the other hand, the execution of the other components, though also beset by
problems and long delays, was considered satisfactory, and the project, as a
whole, still economically justified.
1.15      Also, IDA  helped the International Transport Company (INTRACO),
engaged in road transport to and from Mombasa (Kenya), reduce Burundi's
dependence on the route through Tanzania. Under a Oevelopment Bank Project
(Credit 731-8U, USS3.4 million, 1978) IDA helped INTRACO buy trucks. After
INTRACO become insolvent in 1980, the Gover.nment liquidated the company and the
funds provided under the credit were used by the Transport Office of Burundi, a
Government's road transport company.

II. PROJECT MDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Proiect Identification ana P-eaaration
_.01      In 1975, -he Country Program Paper provided for US$10 million for
Highway II in 1978 ano USSIS million for Highway III in 1980. Highway II would
be a road construction project, and the paving of the Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road
(106 km) aeeoed to be the best choice. This road passes through a densely
populated area, where most of the coffee is grown, and is part of the road/rail
route linking Bujumbura to Oar es Salaam port via Isaka in tsnzania. Highway
III, instead, would support the highway maintenance prograri.
2.02      The then ongoing Highway Maintenance Project, IOA 'a first road
project in Burundi, included a general road investment study and a feasibility
study of this road and of other roads identified under the investment study.
This atudy indicated that the Bujumbura-Cibitoke road (75 kin) topped the list of
the investment roads. This roaa carried the highest traffic volumes, traversed
a region with the highest development potential and was estimated to yield an
economic return (ER) of about 18 as compared to 13.5Z of the Ngozi-Kobero road
which, then, was set aside for Highway III.
2.03      The 6overnment and IDA's missions began exchanging their views on the
composition of the Third Highway Project in August 1978. According to the
initial Project Brief, dated June 1, 1979, the project aimed at continuing
improving the road network and comprised the following components,
(a)  continuation of the Highway Maintenance Program, including
technical assistance and equipment replaoenent,
(b)  road investment, including improvemuant of selected earth tracks
4o low standard gravel roads, reconstruction to bituminous paved
*tandards of the Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobsro road (108 km), and the
construction of custom and storage facilities at Kobero, situated
at the border with Tanzania, and
(c) a study of the trucking indubtry.
2.04      The estimated total project cost was US$30 million.  The estimated
cost of reconstructing the Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road wan US$16 million,
excluding contingencies, i.e. about US$150,000 per km. Tentatively, IOA's
lending program allocated US$15 million to the project, depending on the amount
of co-financing available to the Country. The African Development Bank (AfOB)
hnd expressed an interest in co-financing the reconstruction of Ngozi-Kob4"%o
road.
2.05      Justification of the reconstruction of Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero road, wae
to be based on the feasibility study, carried out undor the Highway Maintenance
Project. The study of the trucking industry had been included following the
recommendation of the Burundi Transport Sector Memorandum (July 26, 1978) to
examine the possibilities for establishing an adequate trucking capacity in



Surunoi.  The study was tq o) examine actuai ano prospective demana for bulk
-oaa transportation, %ii) review the operations of the Internationai Tranaport
ompany (INTRACO) ara (i±i) basea on the findings under 'L) and (ii), recommend
iessures to enable Burunci to meet itO road transportation neeos aceouately.
Later on, this study was croppeo, and technicai assistance to MTPT anu MTP for
transport planning ana programming was added.
'.06      Project preoaration actually began in mid 1979, wnen under IfDB's
financing, the Government entrusted coneultants with the cetailed engineering of
the reconstruction of the Ngozi-Kobero road, including the update of the
feasibility study.  In Septemoor 1979, the consultants submitted  their first
report on the updating of the feasibility study.  IOA was not satisfied and
requested  clarifications on various points.  In particular, IDA suggested that
the Direction 6enerale des Routes (06R) should carry out some traffic counts and
the consultants should recalculate the rate of return when the detailed
engineering would be in an advanced stage and a bctter estimate of the
road-construction cost would be available.
'.07       The project preparation was more difficult and longer than expected.
Because of persistently high inflation rates, both world wide and in Burundi,
road construction costa continued to go up in Burundi, reaching about US$410,000
per km, average cost per km of the lowest bid for the reconatruction of the
Kayanza-Ngozi road, financed by the European Development Fund (EOF), as compared
to the initially estimated USS150,000 per km of the Ngozi-Kobero road.
Therefore, the cost estimates of reconstructing the Ngozi-Kobero road and of the
whole project had to be revised upwards several times.
2.08       The total available financing was not sufficient to cover the total
cost of the project as it had been conceived. Therefore, the Government and IDA
had to revise downwards the project several times, especially the
road-construction component. Table 1 shows the evolution of the project
composition and costs during the preparation phase through appraisal. The
Government and IDA cut down the length of road to be reconstructed under the
project first from 106 km (Ngozi-huyinga-fobero) to 73.4 km (Ngozi-Muyinga), and
then to 39.4 km (Ngozi-Junction RIG 14). The consultants revised the design of
the project road on the basis of lower standards. IDA increased its allocations
to the proJect from US$15 million to USSZO million. However, there was still a
gap of about US$10 million. AI'B agreed in principle to jointly finance the
road-construction component, for which it would make available about US$10
million, and Belgium promised about US$1.0 million for tools and equipment. IDA
decided to go ahead with the project.
Aporaisal and Neanotiations
2.09       IDA appraisad the project in June 1980.  The total cost was estimated
at US$34.8 million, excluding taxes and duties.  The foreign cost was estimated
at US$28.6 million and the local cost at US$6.2 million.  IDA thought that the
Government, who had to me&t the recurrent costs for road maintenance, estimated
at US$11.0 for the three-year period of the project, could finance no more than
l0X of the project cost.  With IOA's and Government's contribution to the
project of US$20.0 million and US$73.4 milLion, the amount of co-financing
needed was of US$11.4 million.



:.I0      Tho main issues concerneo the Government's budgetary allocations to
the roaa maintenance. counteroart staffing and co-financing. 2uring
negotiations, the Government agreeo to (±) allocate at least US$3.0 million
eouivaient in 1981 prices eacn year curing the project implementation and (ii)
consuit with IDA on the levei ana structure of the ouoget in relation to the
worK orogram during the last Quarter of each fiscai year of project
implementation.  The Government also agreea to (1) attach three counterparts to
eacn technical assistance expert financed under the project, with the exception
of the project manager and the two economists at the M1nistere des Travaux
Publics (MTP) and Ministers des Transports, Postes et Telecommunications (MTPT)
to wnom fewer than three counterparts could be assigned. and (ii) require
counterparts to remain in service of MTP and MTPT for at least three years.
2.11      IOf thought that co-financing of US$11.4 million still needed did not
represent a real problem, since the Government had obtained the following
agreements, even if only in principle:  AfOB would contribute with at leart
US$10.0 million, the Belgian Government with US$1.0 million, and the United
Nations Develooment Program (UNOP) would continue to provide technical
assistance to MTP at least for 1982 and 1983.  IDA  decided against making
co-financing a condition of effectiveness to avoid delaying the maintenance
component, in which AfOB did not participate. However, it decided that AfB
co-financing would be a condition of disbursement for the road-construction
component.
2.12      A formal agreement with AfOB to jointly finance the Ngozi-Junction RIG
14 section, however, never materialized. Eventually, AfOB financed the
construction to two-lane bituminous paved standards of the RIG 14-Muyinga
section (37.1 kn). At present, therefore, of the 106 km between Ngozi and
Koboro, originally planned to be reconstructed to bituminous paved standards,
only the Muyinga-Kobero section (29.5 ki) is not yot paved.
2.13      The 6overnment and IDA revised the project once again downwards.  The
new total cost was estimated at US$32.1 million, excluding taxes and duties.
The foreign cost was estimated at US$25.S million and the local cost at USS6.2.
IDA increased its allocations again by USSS.0 mill ion to US$25.0 million, and
the 6overnment reached agreements for the following grants: USS1.0 million for
equipmont and tools from the Belgian Administration G6n6rale do la Cooporation
au D6voloppoment (AGCO), US$2.0 million for equipment from Japan, US$300,000
from France ?or technical assistance. In addition, UNOP was planning to grant
US$600,000 for technical assistance for transport planning and programming. The
Goverrment would cover the balance of US$3.3 million.
2.14      IOA  approved the project in April 1981.  The Credit could not be
signed until Docember 1981 because IDA's funds became available only in October
1981 and then because the Burundi's ambassador was absent fron Washington until
the bmginning of December 1981. It became effective on March 17, 1982. Not to
delay the project execution, however, IOA agreed to retroactively finance
expenditures incurred by the Government since the date of Board presentation.



F-oiect Obiec%1ves ang Description
_.t5S      The main onIectives of the project were to assist the Government in
:arrying out the fol1owing:
(a)  improvement of the roao o1etworK to facilitate cecentraiization
ano to suoport development efforts in the northeastern part of
the country,
(b)  improvement of an alternative land connection to the port of Oar
ea Salaam, and
(c)  deveoioment and strengthening of the Government's transport
planning and highway maintenance capability.
2.16       The project consisted of:
-  construction to two-lane bituminous paved standards of the
Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 section (39.4 km);
-  improvement of selected secondary and tertiary roads totaling
about 360 km,
-  procurement of tools and vehicles for the manual maintenance, and
-  consultants services.
Table 2 shows the project composition and costs in detail (appraisal
report Table 3.4).



III.   =ROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
Roaa Cons%rucucn
G1I.    The project provided for the construction to two-lane oltuminous paved
stanoarUa of the Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 roaa, which is a section,
39.4 km long, of the Route Nationale 6 (RN 6).  RN 6 traverses the
country's high northern plateau in the north of the country and is
part of the roaa/rail route linking Bujumoura to the port of Oar
es Salaam via Isaka in Tanzania.  This route 1S 1,578 km long, 880
km of road from Bujumbura to Isaka, and 598 km of rail from Isaka
to Oar es Salaam.
3.02       At appraisal, the importance of this road was based on the followingt
-  the area served by the road section had the highest population
density (300 innacLtants per km2 as opposed to the country average
of 142) and had the highest production rates for subosBtence crops
and coffee,
-  a feasibility study for the exploitation of the Akanyaru
river-Kirundo peat deposits was underwey, and the project road was
part of the extraction route, and
-  the project road was part of one of the routes linking the country
to ocean ports and could provide a viable alternative to the
traditional lake/rail route, Bujumbura-Oar es Salaam, via Kigoma
within the next five to seven years..
3.03      At prasent, the area served by the project road is atill the most
densely populated and fertile of Burundi. Exploitation of the peat deposits has
not yet started and there is no plan showing if and when it will start. Of the
980 km of road between Bujumbura and Isaka, about 802 km are paved to bituminous
standards, and about 35 km near Isaka are being paved and scheduled for
completion by October 1988. As to the remaining 145 km, the feasibility study
and detailed engineering are finished for Muyinga-Kobero (37.1 km) in Burundi
and underway for Bukombe-Isaka (113 kn) in Tanzania, but no arrangements for the
financing of the construction works have been concluded so far. In 1986,
about 5% of the total external trade of Burundi used this route, as compared to
1% in 1984.
3.04      The Ngozi-RI6 14 road wao in poor condition, with a tortuous
alignment, very poor earth surface and inadequate or non-existent drainage.
Maintenance was difficult and expensive because of the rugged terrain, frequent
heavy rains and long distances to the aggregate quarries. Traffic was about 100
vpd, of which about 30X were cars, 452 pickups and 25% trucks.
3.05      The detailed engineering, financed by AfOB, was carried out by
consultants from 1980 to 1981. The now alignment was about 3 km shorter, down
from 42,5 km to 39.4 km.  The roadway was 8.5 m wide and the pavement, which
consisted of a selected granular soil sub-base, crushed stone base and double



oituminous surface treatment. was 6.0 m wide. The aesign standards were
:onsistent with those used for otner pavea roaas in Burunci ana were appropriate
,or tne terrain. zilmate ana forecast traffic.
3.06       The Government invitea nids for the road construction twice.  The
i1rst time, it prequaiified eieven contractors during the second auarter of 1981
and receivea f:ve olds by the ciosing date, Novemoer 30, 1981. The lowest bid
'as FBu 2,055 million (US$22.3 miilion equivaient), including taxes and duties,
about 90% higher than the appraisal eatimate excluding contingencies, or 25%
higher than the appraisal estimate including contingencies. To reduce the cost.
the Government ano IDA agreea to lower the specifications of the materials for
the base course, raise the maximum grade in the mountainous sections from 7% to
10%, and to replace the drainage structures in reinforced concrete with stone
lined structures.
3.07      The Government invited new bids by April 23, 1982.  The loweot bid was
FBu 1,431 million (US$1S.9 million equivalent).  After adjustments, the bid
price was brought down to FBu 1,338 million (US$14.9 million equivalent), i.e.
:4% higher than the appraisal estimate excluding contingencies, or 13% lower
than the appraisal estimate including contingencies. In August 1982. the
Government awarded a contract for this amount.
3.08       The completion time was 20 months.  The work started on February 7,
1983, proceeded smoothly without any major problem, though the design waa still
changed several times, and was finished on October 6, 1984, according to
schedule. At appraisal, the estimated total cost, including taxes and
contingencies, was FBu 1,516 million (US$16.9 million equivalent). The final
total cost, including taxes, was FBu 1,365 million (US$13.1 million equivalent),
i.e. about 11% lower than the appraisal 4stimate. In U.S. dollars, the total
cost was even lower (24%) because of several realignments of the Burundi franc
via-a-via the U.S. dollar during the execution of the contract. Excluding
taxes, the total cost was FBu 1,160 million (US$S11.1 million equivalent).
3.09      The project provided for the supervision of road-construction work, at
an estimated total cost, including taxes and contingencies, of FBu 83 million
(US$900,000 equivalent). On July 23, 1982, the Government awardad a contract
for the supervision of the work to a joint venture of two consulting firrst  the
first firm, who had done the studies, was responsible for the supervision of all
the construction work but the drainage structures and laboratory geotechnical
control, for which the second firm was responsible. The contract price was
about F9u 6 .5 million (US$717,000 million equivalent) for a total of 19
man-months.
3.10       The consultants began working in January 1983, a month before the
start of the physical execution and finished in November 1984, a month after the
end of the construction work to prepare the final certificate and report. The
final total cost was FBu 69.8 million (US$737,000 million equivalent), i.e.
about 8% higher than the initial contract price. This increase is explained by
the longer duration of the consultants'services: actual 20.5 months as against
the estimated 19 months. In U.S. dollars, the final total cost was about 31
higher than the initial contract price. However, compared to the appraisal
estimate, the actual total cost was about 16% lower.



improvement of Seconajrv ana'Te-ttarv Roso5
_.1l       The project croviced fTr the improvement ci about 360 km of secondary
and tertiary roads ano for tne procurement of equipment. This conoonent of the
pro;ect was the continuation of tne roac improvement program. recommenced by a
=tuay carriec out uncer the Highway Maintenance Project (paras 1.10 ano 2.02)
ana started uncg,r tine Secono Hignway Project tpara 1.11). Up to 30% of the
work, consisting of minor earthworK ano drainage structures, was to be carried
out by contract, i.e. by local contractors, and the balance, consisting of
earthmovement, gracing and regraveling, was to be carried out by force account.
3.12       OGR had only one mechanized brigade, set up under the Sicond Highway
Project, which was not ecuipped adequately: part of the equipment was either
obsolete or out of order. Besides, one brigade was not sufficient to carry out
the prvogram. The project provided for the replacement of part of the equipment
for the first brigade and for the acquisition of equipment for a second brigade.
The total cost, including taxes and contingencies, was estimated a- FBu 366
million (US$4 million equivalent); IDA was to finance about S2X% and the Japan
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund ((OECF) 48%.
3.13       However, the United Nations Capital Development Fund granted the
Government US$3.1 million for the procurement of road equipment, and IDA's funds
were, then, reallocated to finance the repairs work on RH S (pares 3.29-3.31).
The equipment financed by OECF was delivered in February 1982 and could, then,
be fully utilized under the project. However, most of the equipment financed by
UNCOP could not be utilized, because it was delivered during the last quarter of
CY 1884, i.e. at the end of the project. The cost of OECF equipment was about
US$2.0 million, and that of UNCOP was USS1.6 million. The total cost for
equipment was, therefore, 10 less than the appraisal estimate.
3.14       At appraisal, the total cost, including taxes and contingencies, of
the improvement work was estimated at F6u 409 million (US$4.5 million
equivalent): FBu 240 million (US$2.6 million equivalent) for work by force
account and FBu 169 million (US$1.9 million equivalent) for work by contract.
The work by force account started in March 1982, and by December 31, 1984, end
of the project, the OGR's two brigades had improved about 201 km of roads, i.e.
about 6 km per month as compared to 7 km estimated at appraisal.
3.15       The following considerations show that the output was actually higher
than that estimated at appraisal. The two brigades, which carried out the
improvement work, were underequipped during the project execution, because of
the delayed delivery of about half of the equipment (para 3.13), and most of the
roads were improved to higher standards than planned. The total cost was
FBu 258 million (USS2.5 million equivalent), excluding taxes and equipment
depreciation. Including taxes (152), the total cost would have been F8u 303
million (US$2.9 million equivalent), i.e. a cost of about US$14,400 per km, as
compared to US$10,S00, cost per km, including taxes and contingencies, estimated
at appraisal.
3.16       Three local contractors carried out some minor work in concrete and
stone masonry totaling FBu 21.0 million (US$200,000 million equivalent), whereas
a foreign contractor carried out an important work on RIG 7. This road, which



s5 located in the south ano goes from Boma ou Chef to the Tanzania ooroer via
Mabanoa. was to be imorovec entirely by force account.  On a section between km
IS ano ie Z6, however. :o reauce tne tortuosity ana the grace. -hat on some
Eiopes was greater than 17%, .; was necessary to execute heavy earthworKs,
Including excavation in roCK requiring the use of exoioSive.
3.17      The Government ano IDA agreec that the origaces could not do this type
of worK.  in May 1983. :ne Government, with IOA's agreement. 3warced a contract
to a foreign conzractor, registered locally.  The work was carried out without
major problems and was finished on scnedule in May 1984.  The total cost was FBu
ZZ1 million (US$2.4 million equivaient), including taxes and duties, the same as
the contract price.  The total cost. excluding taxes and duties, was FBu 199
million (US$2.2 million equivalent). DGR supervised this improvement work.
Road Maintenance
3.18      The project provided for the procurement of tools, vehicles and camp
eouiPment for manual maintenance for an estimated total cost, :ncluding taxes
and contingencies, of FBu 140 million (USS1.6 meilion equivalent).  IDA was to
finance 90X of the cost or this component. However, the 6overnment and IDA
agreed to use the funds provided for this component, as well as those provided
for the procurement of equipment (para 3.13), to finance the repaira work on
RN S (paras 3.29-3.31). Belgium agreed to grant FBe 27 million (US$300,000
equivalent) for the procurement of the items included in this component, and
the Goyernment financed the balance.
3.19      The four regional centers in Bujumbura, Gitega, Bururi and Ngozi
carried out both manual and mechanized maintenance of earth and gravel roads, as
well as patching and sealing of paved roads. Each center was responsible for
about 750 km of road.  It was staffed with about 42S men, i.e. about one man
every two kilometers, and equipped with hand tools and a few trucks. Also, the
Government planned to set up a mechanized brigade for the reshaping and
regroveling of earth roads, as well as for the haulage of construction
materials. This brigade was to be equipped with some of the old eQuipment and
trucks made available by the arrival of the new equipment purchased under the
project.
3.20       In 1994, however, the Government cut down on funds for maintenance
and, in particular, reduced the maintenance labour force.  During negotiations,
the Government had agreed to make available, for road maintenance, US$9.0
million (FBu 810 million) at 1981 prices for the three years of the project
implementation. On the assumption that the local component of the manual
maintenance cost was 801, and the foreign component 201, and on the basis of the
same rates of price increases as those indicated in the appraisal report (Table
3.4, page 26), the Government was to make available for road maintenance a
minimum of FBu 1,029 million (US$10.3 million equivalent). During this period,
however, the actual total expenditures were about FBu 915 million (USS9.2million
equivalent). Furthermore most of the new equipment financed by UNCOP waS
delivered only at the end of the project, and the old equipment could not be
released (para. 3.13). Thus, anly few of these mechanized maintenance
operations could be carried out.



7ecfnxcai Psistance
The project crovioed tecnnicai assistance to help carry out the
-|oao-imorovement worK and road maintenance. uoth manual and mecnanicai.
i rnciuding on-the-job training. 7n 1975, uncer the Highway Maintenance Project,
JNOP financed consulting services to assist the Government in carrying out a
four-year highway maintenance orogram. Under the Secona Hignway Project. IDA
ana UNOP financeo the services of the same consultants from Marcn 1978 to June
1981. In September 1981, the Government awarded a contract to the same
consultants for the continuation of their services under the Thira Highway
Project. The contract, including two amendments, covered the
project-implementation period,July 1991-December 1984, and was financed by
PPF102 up to February 1982 and then by the Credit. The same consultants are
still assisting the Government under the Fourth Highway Project.
3.22      The consultants'team consioted of seven experts: a head of mission, an
accountant, four road construction and maintenance engineers and a mechanical
engineer. The head of mission and the accountant helped the Government
i) manage the road improvement and maintenance programs, (ii) prepare a
five-year rehabilitation and maLntenance program for paved roads and (iii)
prepare the Fourth Highway Project. The other experts assisted in planning and
carrying out the road improvement and maintenance operations, including the
bridge replacement and maintenance work financed by the Federal Republic of
Germany (FR6) as well as the improvement of RP 84 financed by the United States
Agency for International Development (USAIO). Also. the consultants carried out
on-the-job training of their counterparts and of local clerical and field
personnel at all levels.
3.23      At appraisal, 264 man-months, over a period of three years, were
estimated for these consulting services at an estimated total cost of
;Bu 396 million (US$4.4 million equivalent), including contingencies. The
consultanta'contract, including two amendments, provided for 294 man-months,
over three years and a half, at a total cost of FBu 80.2 million and 70.3
million Belgian francs (FBe), i.e. about FBu 233.8 million (USS2.4 million
equivalent). The consultants actually provided 294 man-months at a total cost
of FBu 64.5 million and FBe 65.1 million, i.e. about FBu 206.5 million (US$2.2
mtilion equivalent). Whereas the actual number of man-months was about 11l
higher than estimated at appraisal, the actual total cost was about 42X lower
than the appraisal estimate.
3.24      The project provided for technical assistance to train 06R's
personnel. With IDA's and UNOP's financing, under the Highway Maintenance and
Second Highway Projects, the Government had hired consultants to carry out a
training program for OGR's personnel at all levels, from superintendent to
section chief, including equipment operators, at the Public Works Schools in
Bujumbura and Gitega, at the Training Center in Gitega and at Rushubi with the
training brigade. The Government hired the same consultants to continue the
training progran.

3.25      At appraisal, 308 man-months, over a period of three years, were
estimated for these consulting services at an estimated total cost, including
taxes and contingencies, of FBu 163 million (US$1.8 million equivalent). The

Thiefs ano gang foremen, and iE equipment operators.  -bout 20 superintenoents
ano overseers. 800 section chiefs and gang foremen for manuai maintenance, and
:00 eauipment ooerators were actuaily trained unoer the project.
3.26       Under UNOP's financing, tha project provided for 48 nan-months of two
economists to help MTP and MTPT pian and program, at an estimated total cost,
inciuding taxea and contingencies, of FBu S8 million (US$600,000 equivalent).
UNCOP, however, agreed to finance the procurement of equipment (para 3.13) and
cancelled the financing of these services, which IDA, then, agreed to finance.
The credit Was amenced accordingly. Eventually, the Government hired only one
tk-anaport economist, who startedF in December 1983 and carried out various taska
for coth ministries.
3.27      For MTPT, the transport economist carried out the following taska:
;i) elaboration of a transaort policy, (ii) study of an alternative means of
transport to the ferry-boat link between Bujumbura and Kigoma, (iii) forecast of
import and exoort traffic in the year 2000 and needs in maintenance and
replacement of the lake fleet to meet the demand, (iv) survey of the external
trade, (v) survey of the delays on the main external routea, and (vi)training of
two counterparts. For MTP, he carried out economic analyses of road
improvements, the re-evaluation of the Second and Third Highway Projects, and a
survey of the axle loads on the north route, including a proposal for
standardization and taxation for overloading.  The economist provided 13
man-months at the total cost, including taxes and contingencies, of
FBu 10.5 million (US888,000 equivalent). Under the Fourth Highway Project he
provided 11 man-months more.
3.28      The project provided for the preparation and supervision of the
road-improvement work at an estimated total cost, including taxes and
contingencies, of FSu 35.0 million (UST400,000 equivalent). The 6overnment
assigned this task to the three experts attached to OGR and financed by France.
The experts with their counterparts helped select and design the roads to be
improved, and supervise the improvement work.
Road Rena=r
3.29      RN S, Bujumbura-Rugombo, (66 kn), constructed to bituminous paved
standards under the Second Highway Project, Credit 773-BU, began showing signs
of failure at the beginning of 1983, i.e. only a few months after the end of the
work. The National Laboratory carried out a study and concluded that the road
needed to be repaired and strengthened urgently. First, the Government awarded
a contract to repair the road to a foreign contractor, the same as for the
improvement of RIG 7 (para 3.16), and financed the total cost of FBu 117 million
(US$1.3 million equivalent ) from its own budget.

totaiing about 18 ki, local repairs on four stretches totaling 32 km and
reconstruction of drainage structurea.  The work proceeded smoothly and was
finished in April 1984.  The total cost was FBu 364 million (US$3.8 million
equivalent), i.e. about 2% less than the initial contract price.  In U.S.
dollars, the total cost was about 7% less than the initial contract price.  The
total cost excluding taxes and duties woJ FBu 328 million (US$3.4 million
eauivalent). OGR ana the National Laboratory carried out the supervision of the
worK.  More repairs work on RN5. however, was still needed.  This additional
work is being financed uncer the Fourth Highway Project, Credit 1S83-BU, at a
cost of about USS3.S million equivalent.
Construction of RP 84 with labour-intensive methods
3.32      The project provided for technical assistance only to this
road-construction work (para 3.22). In January 1981, the construction with
labour-intensive methods of Route Provinciale 84, which links Minago and Tora
(58 km) in the West of the country, began under Government's and USAID's
financing. The work progressed slowly but steadily, and was finished in March
i985. The total cost, excluding taxes, waS about F-u 312 million (US$3.1
million equivalent). The average cost per km was FBu 5.2 million (US$52,000
equivalent).
Imroreveient and maintenance of bridoes
3.33      The project provided for technical assistance only to this program
(para 3.22).  FRG provided the structural elements of bridge decks.  The total
coat was about FBu 78.S million (US$750,000), of which FR6 financed 60X and the
Government 401.

3.34      IDA received reports on the construction of Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 road
and on the improvement work regularly. These reports were prepared by the
consultants who supervised the construction work and by those who assisted the
Government in carrying out the improvement work. They did not cover all the
components of the project and were too detailed on certain project elements and
insufficiently detailed on others. The crodit agreement (section 3.4 b)
required the Government to send IDA quarterly reports, and the appraisal report
gave the project progress reporting requirements in annex 7.

comparisons between appraisai estimates ano actual costs, are given in detail in
the paragrapha of this chapter dealing with that component. A summary of
estimates and costs by component is given in Table 3. The record of actual
disbursements is given in Table 4, and the total disbursements by category in
Table 5. The actual total project cost, including taxes, was FBu 3,147 million
(USS30.9 million equivaient), compared to a total project cost of FBu 3,1SO
million (US$35.0 meilion equivalent) estimated at appraisal. The financing of
the project was as follows:

The 6overnment financed maintenance expenditures during the three
years and a half of project implementation for a total amount of about FBu 916

Performance of Contractors.- Suoliers and Consultants
3.36      No major problems were encountered during the execution of the
project.  All contractors, local and foreign, including DGR's two brigades, and
all consultants carried out their works well and on schedule.  Most of the
equipment ordered and financed by UNCOP woa delivered very late, practically at
the end of the project.  The delay is not to be imputed to the suppliers, but
rather to slowness in preparing the bidding documents and in evaluating the
bids.

IV. :NSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMgNT
4.01      At appraisai, the Association wes concerned about the
transoort-planning caoabolity of the Government and the staffing of 0GR. The
3overnmene's capacity to pian and coordinate transports, as well as to prepare
road maintenance and construction programs, was very limited.  Under the
project, two planning units were created at MTPT and OGR of MTP, and with the
assistance of a transport economist, who also trained counterparts, both MTPT
ano OGR began improving their planning and programming capacity.
4.02      Because of competition from the private sector, where salaries are
higher, DGR had difficulties in retaining sufficient local engineers and
managers with experience and competence. During negotiations, the 6overnment
agreed to attach counterparts to each technical assistance expert and to require
counterparts to remain in the service of MTP and MTPT for at least three years.
The situation did not improve much during the pr3ject implementation.
4.03      Under the project, staff at various levels continued to be trained.
According to the appraisal report of the Fourth Highway Project, however,
transport sector management still needed to be improved, especially coordination
of road, port and lake transport development.   Transport planning and
coordination was not yet well established, and assistance to DGR and MTPT for
institution buLiding was still required for some time. Expatriate experts are
still in OGR in the same positions and In the same number.

V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01      At aapraisal,  the road construction and improvement components were
economically evaiuated on the basis of costs estimates and traffic counts
carried out by consultants in 1975 ano upoated in 1980. As part of the
preparation of the project completion report, O0R, with the assistance of an
expatriate transport economist, carried out the economic re-evaluation of the
project components in 1985-86, on the basis of 1984 costs and traffic counts.
The overall rate of economic return was 18.5X, as compared to 19X estimated at
appraisal. We reviewed both the hypotheses and calculations and found them
correct.
Construction of Noozi-Junction RIG 14
5.0?      According to the appraisal report, the construction to bituminous
paved standards of the first section of the Ngozi-Kobero road was (i) to improve
communications and reduce transport costs between Bujumbura and the provinces of
Ngozi and Muyinga, which are the most populated and important in terms of coffee
production and (ii) to contribute to the creation of an improved transport
connection, either all road or road/rail to the Indian Ocean.  Also, the
conatruction of this road section would improve transports to and from the pest
deposits in the Akanyaru river-Kirundo region, should exploitation of these
deposits start.
5.03      The road connecting Bujumbura to the provinces of Ngozi and Muyinge ls
now all paved to bituminous standards, and communications have improved.
However, transport costs have not been surveyed recently, and it is not possible
to know whether now they are actually lower than at appraisal.  In 1986, about
S5 of Burundi's total external trade used the project road, as compared to 1S In
1984, when the construction of the Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 was finished.
Exploitation of the peat deposits in the Akanyaru river-Kirundo region has not
yet started and there is no plan showing if and when it will start.
5.04      At appraisal 1930 traffic was estimated at 96 vp  and was to grow at
an average rate per year of S.9X. In 1985, ono year after the opening of the
road, traffic was to reach 173 vpd, including about 40 vehicles of generated
traffic. The economic return (ER), based on vehicle operating costs savings,
was estimated at 15S. The re-calculated ER was 17S, i.e. about 131 higher than
at appraisal. This higher than est!Aated ER is explained by the following
considerations: (i) actual construction costs were about 10% low4r than
estimated at appraisa., and (ii) counts carried out by 06R in 1904 showed that
traffic on the project road was higher than estimated at appraisal,
According to counts carried out in 1986 by consultants, traffic on the
Ngozi-Junction RIG 14 section averaged 300 vpd, i.e. it had grown at an annual
rate of about 20X since 1980.



-18-
imorovement of Seconnarv .eno Tertiary Roads
:.05      At a praisai. the selection criterion for the earth roads to be
:mproved derivea from a targez minimum ER of 17.1 which required traffic levels
of about 21 vpd. 'On the oasis of the traffic levels on the road sections for
wnich more detailed information was avaliable, Lt was expected that an average
ER of Z22%  requiring a traffic of some 30 vpd,  would be attained.
5.06      As part of the roac improvement, the project provided for the
financing of road eouipment and of a portion of the brigades'operating
costs. The actual economic analysis was conducted separately for each brigade.
For the existing brigade. the economic analysis focused on the incremental
output of the brigade ootained from the equipment replacement and funding of
operating costs, while for the additional brigade the analysis focused on the
total output of the brigade. The estimated ER was 27%.
S.07      OGR did not use the same method, but it evaluated the economic return
of  this component on the basis of vehicle operating costs savings.  The traffic
considered in the evaluation varied from 50 to 100 vpd according to the road,
and the average growth rate was 6%. According to the counts carried out in 1986
by consultants, the traffic on the roads improved under the project turned out
to be as low as 100 vpd and as high as 185 vpd. The economic rates of return
were as follows:

was 38X.

5.08       OGR evaluated the improvement work executed by contract on RIG 7
(paras 3.16-3.17) and the repairs work carried out on RN S, works which were not
initially provided for uncer the project. Tha ratep of the economic return was
11.6X for RIG 7 ana 17.9% for RN S.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      The project was a logical continuation of the efforts started under
the Highway Maintenance Project and the Second Highway Project to improve the
road network as well as the road maintenance organization and operations. The
project included basically road construction and improvement components which
were not particularly difficult, and it was executed without any major problem.
The project was completed six months later than estimated at appraisal, but
project implementation had started about six months later, because of lack of
IDA's funds.
6.02      The only difficulties encountered were during the project preparation
and appraisal, when the project had to be scaled down several times, because of
increasing road-construction costs.
