2.      The Health Sector Support Project was approved on June 2, 2005 and became
effective on June 26, 2006. Project implementation was stalled for two years while
Guinea was under OP7.30 Dealing with De Facto Government status. Following Bank re-
engagement in Guinea, the project closing date was extended until December 31, 2013.
The revised project development objectives (PDO) to improve the coverage and quality
of maternal and child health services in targeted districts and health centers in suburbs of
Conakry. In December 2012, the PDO was upgraded from unsatisfactory to Moderately
Satisfactory thanks to improvements in the




                          by the Fiduciary Management Agency with the latest audit
report submitted on time and assessed as not qualified. No procurement issues have been
flagged and compliance with safeguards is satisfactory. The original credit is SDR 16.6
million (US$25.0 million equivalent). As of March 15, 2013, 69.81 % (or SDR 11.5
million) was disbursed.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to finance additional training following the
cancellation of the acquisition of equipment for the planned Reproductive Health
Training and Research Center since its construction has been suspended by the authorities
following issues with construction contracts. Therefore, the Center will not be completed
before the end of the project. Since the Center was to train midwives, it was agreed with
the Government to use the funds initially allocated for the equipment of the Center
(SDR2.5 million) to training activities for nurses in obstetrics and goods and services.
The proposed reallocations are as follows:

      a) Reduction of SDR 2,578,013 from Category 1 (goods) to take into account the
         fact that the project will not purchase equipment planned for the Reproductive
         health training and research center .
      b) Increase in Category 2 (works-renovations) by SDR 91,024 to renovate eight
         health centers that caught fire as a result of the improper use of refrigerators
         purchased by the project.
      c) Increase in Category 3 (consultants’ services) by SDR 182,947 since the 2013
         annual plan adds new activity on health financing and the preparation of a
         health sector Public Expenditures Review.
      d) Increase in Category 4 (training) by SDR 1,023,215 because training expenses
         have doubled (there are more people to be trained and the cost of the training
         itself has increased).
      e) Increase in Category 5 (subproject grants) by SDR 805,723 to accommodate
         for the payment of six months’ salary for community health contractors.
      f) Increase in Category 6 (work program agreements) by SDR 136,794 to cover
         the cost overrun caused by higher than expected inflation.
      g) Increase in Category 7 (recurrent cost) by SDR 339,613 because of the rise in
         some unit costs such as per diems and gasoline; and supervision activities that
         were reclassified under this category.

4.     In addition to the Bank's agreement to the reallocation, Government will be
informed that the project is eligible to the standard 4-month disbursement grace period,
which for the project will be from January 1, 2014 to April 30, 2014.
