The reallocation is necessary to finance\n            additional training following the cancellation of the\n            acquisition of equipment for the planned reproductive health\n            training and research center since its construction has been\n            suspended by the authorities following issues with\n            construction contracts. Therefore, the center will not be\n            completed before the end of the project. Since the center\n            was to train midwives, it was agreed with the Government to\n            use the funds initially allocated for the equipment of the\n            center (SDR2.5 million) to training activities for nurses in\n            obstetrics and goods and services. In addition to the\n            Bank's agreement to the reallocation, government will\n            be informed that the project is eligible to the standard\n            4-month disbursement grace period, which for the project\n            will be from January 1, 2014 to April 30, 2014."}, "docdt": "2013-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
