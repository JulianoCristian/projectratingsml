1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.    Country Context. After initiating implementation of the first poverty reduction strategy
(PRSP-I) in 2002, Guinea continued to face a particularly difficult economic and social situation.
The average annual economic growth rate was estimated at 2.3 percent, compared with the goal of 5
percent. Per capita GDP dropped from $379 in 2002 to $332 in 2006; at the same time, inflation
rose from 6.1 percent in 2002 to 39.1 percent in 2006, further contributing to a substantial
deterioration in the purchasing power of the population. Nationally, the poverty rate rose from 49.2
percent in 2002 to 53.6 percent in 2005; 19.1 percent of the estimated population of 10.3 million
were considered in extreme poverty, with an income below US$116 per person per year.

2.    Though essentially a rural phenomenon (60 percent of Guineans living in rural areas account
for 86 percent of overall poverty), urban poverty was also a growing phenomenon, with the
incidence of poverty at 21 percent in Conakry and 27 percent for the other urban areas. Upper
Guinea (67.5 percent) and Middle Guinea (55.4 percent) were the country’s poorest regions, and
included the country’s poorest prefectures: Tougué (72 percent), Mandiana (71.3 percent), Mali (71
percent), Koubia (70.8 percent), Dinguiraye (69.7 percent), and Lélouma (67.6 percent).

3.    Weak economic growth, poor governance and corruption were key factors in the high
incidence of poverty. Politically, the national dialogue begun in 2003 initially raised hopes of
ending the tensions that had characterized politics since the first elections in 1993. However, despite
the introduction of electoral reforms, the results of the municipal and regional elections (held in
December 2005) were contested on the grounds that they lacked transparency. Further, while
Guinea had the legislation and institutional framework needed, powerful interests continued to
delay the implementation of these means to strengthen the rule of law, with a disproportionate
impact of the poor and powerless.

4.    Sectoral Context. Comparisons of the results of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
showed mixed results between 1999 and 2005. Infant mortality declined from 98 to 91 per thousand
live births and infant-child mortality was reduced from 177 to 163 per thousand, but maternal
mortality increased from 528 to 980 per 100,000 live births, which is among the highest rates in
West Africa. Use of modern contraceptive methods increased (from 4 percent to 6 percent, but so
did fertility (from 5.5 to 5.7). Among pregnant women, the proportion receiving professional
prenatal care and delivering in a health facility increased modestly from 71 percent to 82 percent
and from 29 percent to 31 percent. During the same period, the proportion of children (12-23
months of age) completely vaccinated rose from 32 percent to 37 percent, but moderate malnutrition
increased from 23 percent to 26 percent.

5.    Despite the high incidence of poor nutrition, inadequate hygiene, and communicable and
endemic diseases, utilization of health services was low as was the satisfaction of the recipients of
health services. The 2007 PRSP noted that more than half (53.7 percent) of recipients (and
especially those in rural areas) were dissatisfied with the services provided, particularly for the high
cost and the low quality of treatment (including long waits and insufficient drugs).

6.   Systemic problems in the sector related to: (i) inadequate sector financing. Between 2001 and
2005, the budget allocated to the health sector declined from 4.5 to 3.4 percent, and only 30 percent

                                                                                                     10
of the allocated budget was actually executed (according to the 2003 Health Expenditure Tracking
Survey); (ii) significant shortages of skilled health professionals in the country and a
disproportionate number of these professionals located in Conakry; and (iii) unavailability of
essential drugs and consumables. Stock-outs of essential drugs and vaccines undermined service
quality. 3

7. Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The 2003-06 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) supported the implementation of the country’s First Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) and included pillars to foster sustainable and equitable growth, to improve
access to and the quality of basic services, and to strengthen governance and institutional and
human capacity. The CAS was consistent with (i) the health priorities presented in the National
Health Development Plan (2003-12) and the Five Year Health Development Plan (2003-07), and
(ii) the proposed transition from a project approach to a programmatic approach by strengthening
Guinea's fiduciary capacities and institutional arrangements for service delivery.

8.     In addition to its extensive experience in the health project (with a series of health projects and
a MAP over the period 1986-2005 and its projects in related areas of governance and local capacity
building 4, the Bank’s experience and support of a programmatic approach made its participation
important and useful. Given the existing status of the health sector, the Bank proposed: (i) to
proceed with a classic investment project (emphasizing maternal mortality, which constitutes a
useful proxy for health system performance) rather than playing the role of lender of last resort; and
(ii) to assist the Ministry in establishing the conditions for a more programmatic approach. To this
end, the Bank expected to collaborate closely with other partners in the sector (particularly, the
European Union, UNICEF, France, and GIZ) to support the achievement of the PRSP goals by
implementing MOH’s National Health Development Plan (2003-12) and the Five-Year Plan (2003-
07) to achieve the health specific MDGs as reflected in the PRSP objectives.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

9.    The original Project Development Objective (PDO), as stated in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA), was to contribute to reaching the maternal and under-five mortality reduction
objectives of the Borrower’s Five-Year Plan, Program, and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and
the Millennium Development Goals. Specifically, in the 18 targeted districts, the project was
expected to help decrease: (i) maternal mortality from 528 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to slightly
above 200 per 100,000 live births in 2011; and (ii) infant mortality from 98 deaths per 1,000 live
births in 1999 to around 50 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2011. These key PDO results would be
achieved by avoiding the deaths of 12,000 pregnant women and 27,500 children under 1 year old.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10. The objective of the restructured Project, as stated in the revised DCA, was to improve the

 These included the institutional strengthening project, the urban project, and the community support program (PRCI,
PUIII, and PACV, respectively).

                                                                                                                 11

11. The revised PDO was justified by the need to limit the project’s ambitions since reductions in
maternal and infant mortality will require: (i) more than the project lifetime to change; and (ii)
actions beyond the health sector that are not part of project activities. As a consequence, the results
chain was modified and more realistic indicators selected which could more effectively measure the
project’s achievement and would be more likely to be met by project closing. The revised measures
of project achievement for the period 2011-13 were defined as follows:
    • By 2013, the proportion of institutional deliveries assisted by trained health personnel
        increases from 21 percent to 25 percent
    • By 2013, the proportion of children 12-23 mos. old fully immunized (DPT3+M) increases
        from 39 percent to 41 percent
    • By 2013, the proportion of children 0-11 mos. immunized (DTC3) increases from 52 percent
        to 54 percent
    • By 2013, the number and proportion of pregnant women receiving at least 1 ANC visit to a
        health provider increases from 194 475 to 267 774 and from 85 percent to 90 percent
        respectively
    • By 2013, the number of project beneficiaries (of which female) increases from 1.96 million
        (1.05 million female) to 3.00 million (1.6 million female)

12. Data on the original and revised key outcome and intermediate outcome indicators are
presented in Section F of the Data Sheet and discussed in more detail in Section 3.2 and Annex 2.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries and Benefits

13. The project’s main beneficiaries were expected to be pregnant women and children in the
poorest areas of Guinea. The emphasis on pregnant women was especially justified both by the
severity of maternal mortality in Guinea and by its significance as an overall indicator of health
system performance. The emphasis on children, particularly those under one year of age, was
justified by the need to promote a complete package of basic services to address the low utilization
of health facilities and the poor health outcomes of this population. Sixteen of the 18 project
prefectures were selected based on the national poverty map and have the worst health indicators;
the two other prefectures (Gueckedou and Kissidougou) were added due to the influx of refugees
from neighboring countries.

14. Other populations at all levels of the country were also expected to benefit from the project.
These included: (i) the Ministry of Health, which would benefit from support in collecting and
analyzing data (on monitoring health expenditures), developing health reforms (such as national
insurance and performance contracting), and preparing for budget support; (ii) local authorities,
who would benefit from the pilot effort to establish community-managed facilities; (iii) public and
private health facilities, which would benefit from incentive grants to improve the quality of health
services; and (iv) local communities, which would benefit from grants to increase village level
awareness of critical health problems.

15. The project was expected to have other positive benefits, including: (i) reducing maternal and
child mortality by increasing access to and improving the quality of health services; and (ii)
contributing to essential sector management reforms at central, local, and community levels.


                                                                                                    12
1.5     Original Components

16. Component 1: Strengthening Health Care Services (Appraisal: US$18.99 million
equivalent; Restructuring: US$20.40 million; Actual: US$17.62 million or 93 percent of
appraised cost). This component sought to strengthen the ability of health posts, health centers and
hospitals in the 18 selected prefectures to provide a package 5 of quality services to at least one
million pregnant women and 933,000 children less than one year of age. The project was expected
to focus on three sub-components: (i) improving the quality of health care; (ii) supporting
community mobilization; and (iii) instituting quality insurance.

17. Health care quality would be improved for pregnant women and children by: (i) reinforcing
the chain of care for at-risk deliveries, starting with early identification by traditional birth
attendants (TBAs); (ii) strengthening emergency delivery care at higher service levels, especially
the ‘Centres de Santé Améliorés”, private clinics (including NGOs), and prefectoral hospitals; (iii)
increasing the utilization of family planning services and IMCI activities (namely EPI, diarrhea
control, acute respiratory illnesses, malaria, nutrition); (iv) strengthening the roll-back malaria
program(through malaria prevention, treatment, and operational research via insecticide-treated
bed-nets, anti-malarial drugs, and advisory services). According to the level involved, the project
intended to invest in: (i) basic medical and office equipment; (ii) the referral system (ambulances
and communications); and (iii) drugs, vaccines, and other medical supplies. To increase the
availability of skilled midwives, the project intended to finance the existing master plan for human
resources and to contract retired and other midwives to fill the gap (especially in rural areas) during
the three-year training period required. The health care quality sub-component would be
implemented mainly through performance-based agreements signed between MoH and health
centers and district hospitals and contracts with private clinics and NGOs.

18. Community mobilization would be achieved through support for: (i) the existing community
health insurance (mutual) system (MURIGA), which provides coverage mainly for women’s health
risks related to child birth; (ii) pilot activities in six prefectures to test the feasibility of
decentralizing management of selected health facilities to the urban and rural communes; (iii)
increased public awareness and official accountability for actual Government health expenditures
through publication of the planned budgets and actual expenditures of the health facilities in the
project areas; and (iv) community sub-projects for village-level awareness activities related to the
early detection of at-risk pregnancies and their follow-up, full DPCT3 immunization, and
development of the MURIGAs. Depending on the activity involved, the project intended to invest in
equipment, vehicles, training and technical advisory services, and sub-project financing.

19. Quality assurance, tested by GIZ and evaluated in 2004, would be expanded to the 18 project
districts to: (i) finance self-evaluations of and plans for improving health facility performance; (ii)
award quality incentive grants to the best plans; and (iii) assist and monitor the implementation of
the plans. In addition to the quality incentive grants, the project was expected to finance equipment
and training and technical advisory services.



5
 The package of services comprised: (i) prenatal care, normal and emergency delivery for women; and (ii) integrated
management of childhood diseases and control of communicable diseases (TB, malaria) for children.

                                                                                                                13
20. Component 2: Institutional Strengthening (Appraisal: US$8.37 million equivalent;
Restructuring: US$5.60 million; Actual: US$5.91 million or 71 percent of appraised cost). The
project was expected to: (i) strengthen the Ministry’s leadership and policy-making capacity; (ii)
support the ministry’s operational policies and practices; and (iii) finance project management and
coordination.

21. Leadership and policy-making capacity as well as health sector reform would be reinforced
through: (i) integration of maternal mortality into the health information system; (ii) assistance to
the structure in charge of developing the national insurance scheme; (iii) financial support for
carrying out an annual public health expenditure tracking survey.

22. Ministry operational policies and practices would be strengthened by: (i) technical support
from a Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA) to help MOH’s Administrative Unit (DAAF) and
decentralized units prepare for budgetary support; (ii) monitoring MOH’s procurement of works,
goods, and services; (iii) jointly financing equipment for the Reproductive Health Training and
Research Center in Conakry; and (iv) further implementing the country’s Medical Waste
Management Plan (MWMP).

23. Project management and coordination would be implemented through: (i) establishment of a
Pilot Committee for the Five-Year Plan and a Task Force to facilitate technical implementation of
the project; and (ii) support (including incremental operating costs) for entities involved in Project
implementation.

1.6    Revised Components

24. The Level 1 restructuring of the project (approved on January 4, 2012) modified both of the
project’s components as indicated below. For Component 1: (i) the health care quality sub-
component was expanded to include health centers in peri-urban areas of Conakry and PMTCT as
part of the MCH service package and the integration of maternal mortality information was
expanded to address strengthening M&E more generally; (ii) community mobilization was revised
to eliminate support to MURIGAS (since deliveries were made free of charge); and (iii) quality
assurance was dropped (as it was considered a medium-term issue to be addressed through
economic and sector work (ESW).

25. For Component 2: (i) the leadership and policy-making sub-component was modified to
eliminate development of national insurance (which became the focus of ESW), annual expenditure
tracking surveys, and measures to strengthen health sector reform; (ii) the operational policies sub-
component continued support for the Reproductive Health Training and Research Center and the
Medical Waste Management Plan implementation; and (iii) the project management and
coordination sub-component was expanded to incorporate support for the DAAF.

1.7    Other significant changes

26. In addition to the restructuring (discussed in Section 2.2), the DCA was amended to: (i)
eliminate counterpart financing (March 2008) and to reallocate the proceeds (March 2008 and
March 2012); and (ii) revise the closing date of the project (from September 30, 2011 to December
31, 2011 and then to December 31, 2013.


                                                                                                   14
2.          Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1         Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27. Project preparation. An initial project identification mission was conducted in May-June
2000. The project was later dropped, as the Bank decided to assist the country through a multi-
sectoral effort (including a health component) rather than through a targeted intervention.
Subsequently, the Bank reinstated the project 6, approved the Project Concept Note (March 2003),
carried out preparation missions in May and November 2003, and pre-appraisal missions in
February 2004, and March 2004. 7

28. The Decision Meeting (June 2004) proposed several important changes for the PAD to revise
the PDO, increase the project cost from US$20 million to US$25 million, establish the amount of
counterpart funding, change the risk ratings to reflect the recent experience in Guinea, and
determine the conditions for negotiations and effectiveness. The appraisal mission was conducted
immediately after the Decision Meeting, and negotiations were expected (in principle) to be held in
July 2004. As a result of the readiness conditions agreed on at the Decision Meeting, however,
negotiations were delayed until April 2005. The project was approved by the Board on June 2, 2005.

29. Soundness of the background analysis. The background analysis reflected the evolving nature
of the project’s contribution to the CAS. The PHRD grant (approved in May 2000 for US$400,000
and amended in 2002) was intended to prepare the elements for a sector-wide approach; the Project
Preparation Facility PPF (requested in June 2003 and approved in January 2004 in the amount of
US$600,000) modified the approach to prepare the groundwork for a regular investment operation
with the Bank identifying specific investments for project financing rather than positioning itself as
the lender of last resort. The following table summarizes the planned background studies:

6
  The project was included in the CAS as phase two of the existing APL rather than as a (more complicated) sector-wide
approach (SWAP). The project was to be designed as a transition operation preparing the sector for funding of the third
APL phase under a PRSC.
7
  The initial Decision Meeting in February 2004 concluded that progress in preparing the project was not sufficient to
conduct appraisal as scheduled in March 2004.

                                                                                                                                 15
30. Virtually all of the studies were initiated under the PHRD grant and the PPF, but despite
extensions for both 8, most were not completed by project effectiveness; however, except for the
analysis of drug supply issues, they were all eventually completed during project implementation.

31. Project preparation also relied on the lessons learned from: (i) the three previous health
projects financed by the World Bank since 1988; and (ii) successful operations (e.g., the PRCI, the
PACV, and the Urban Project, which had piloted results agreements between the central and
municipal government levels) which provided a model for MOH to follow in better defining the role
of the regional and district health authorities with respect to the local authorities (municipalities and
CRDs).

32. Assessment of the project design. Project design involved considerations of the appropriate
instrument as well as the specific content. Over the lengthy period for project preparation, the
proposed approaches for the project evolved in relation to the Bank’s appreciation of Guinea’s
country context and implementation capabilities:
    • from an Adjustable Program Loan (APL) intended to: (i) complement the Population and
       Sexual Health Project (PPSG); (ii) provide flexibility in addressing health issues and
       introducing performance indicators; and (iii) establish the Bank as the donor of last resort;
    • to a program or sector-wide approach, based on support for the National Health
       Development Program (PNDS), experience with IDA-financed local level contracting
       (through PACV and PRCI), and the eventual transition to budget support;
    • to a regular investment operation based on the unfeasibility of pooling donor resources 9 and
       the determination that the World Bank should not be the lender of last resort but rather a
       contributor to specific outcomes in the poorest areas of the country.

33. Though a traditional investment operation was ultimately agreed on, several of the earlier
intentions were maintained as the PAD included: (i) implementation arrangements to integrate the
project within the existing ministry structures; and (ii) criteria and indicators in the Results
Framework (RF) to measure the ministry’s readiness for graduation to a PRSC.

34. Within the context of a traditional operation, it was decided to focus the project on reducing
maternal mortality rates because: (i) maternal mortality was particularly elevated; (ii) reductions in
maternal mortality represented a proxy for overall improvement in health system performance; and
(iii) improvements in this indicator would require the MOH to focus on the poorer populations.

35. Not surprisingly, the project design was somewhat of a hybrid comprising elements of both
approaches in each of the final components. Component 1 (comprising more than 70 percent of the
proceeds of the credit) intended both to strengthen MCH services and to introduce innovative
approaches (e.g., community mobilization through mutual health insurance, quality assurance, etc.);
while promising, these approaches were untested. Similarly, Component 2 envisioned a project
integrated within the MOH under the leadership of the Secretary General. However, concerns about
the ministry’s readiness resulted in several project-style conditions, such as preparation of a project
implementation manual, recruitment of a Fiduciary Management Agency (FMA) to assist the

to June 30, 2005 and then to December 22, 2005.

  As highlighted by the Public Expenditure Review and Public Expenditure Tracking Survey.

                                                                                                                     16
ministry’s Directorate for Finance and Administration (DAAF), etc. In addition, though
decentralization was a key element of the project (with health structures to receive funds for eligible
activities based on a performance agreement signed with MOH), the modalities were not adequately
explained in the PAD.

36. Government commitment/Risk assessment and mitigation. The PAD indicated that the
Government had adopted a number of relevant policies and strategies (PRSP, PNDS, Five-Year
Plan, etc.) confirming its commitment, but the PAD did not otherwise explicitly address the issue of
government commitment. Rather, much of the discussion in the PAD (and PAD reviews) focused
on the potential risks of the design and of the environment, especially: (i) macroeconomic (and the
likelihood of counterpart financing); (ii) political (and the possible effects of instability and
conflict); and (iii) governance (and especially equity). 10

37. The initial risk assessment was inconsistent and the proposed mitigation measures were
cursory. The Decision Meeting recommended changing the risk assessment from “modest” to
"substantial" if not "high" and requested that the risks at the various levels (community
participation, decentralization to regions and districts, weak ministerial leadership) be enumerated;
the PAD did the former. 11 Other concerns about the project’s risk were reflected in the significant
number of conditions for negotiation and effectiveness.

38.    Quality at Entry. No quality at entry was carried out.

2.2      Implementation

39. The Development Credit Agreement was signed on September 29, 2005. Project effectiveness
was delayed by the difficulties in meeting the conditions, including the project implementation
manual, the initial deposit of counterpart funds, the contracts with the Fiduciary Management
Agency and the independent financial auditors, and the conclusion of performance-based contracts
with at least 10 health structures in the 18 targeted districts. Then, when these conditions were met
(February 2006), the illness of the president delayed ratification of the credit, which became
effective on June 26, 2006.

40. Disbursement overview. Under the financing plan for the project, the Bank was expected to
finance US$25.0 million and the Borrower was expected to finance US$2.8 million equivalent
bringing the total project cost to US$27.8 million equivalent.

41. As the following table shows (see the disbursement profile as well in Section I of the Data
Sheet), the project’s disbursements lagged the PAD’s planned disbursements through the end of
2008, at which point the suspension brought spending to a virtual halt for 2009-10. After project
restructuring, expenditures accelerated quickly and continued at a high level throughout the period
2011-13.




10
   Though interested in the SWAP approach, Government commitment was tentative, possibly because of the reluctance of the other
donors in the sector to join.
11
   Of the four risks, three were rated as moderate and the fourth substantial, but the overall risk rating was high, reflecting the
Decision Meeting’s view.


                                                                                                                               17

42. Implementation overview. The project began after a year’s delay and was implemented
throughout in a very difficult socio-economic and political context: (i) violent street riots in 2007;
(ii) a military coup in December 2008 leading to the suspension of Bank operations; (iii)
presidential elections in 2010; (iv) Bank re-engagement and a restructuring of the project in 2011;
and (v) on-going protests over the country’s deteriorating economic situation.

43. The project was confronted almost immediately after start-up by a number of internal
constraints. First, the integration of implementation arrangements within the ministry met with
institutional constraints: (i) because all decisions had to pass through the Secretary General, there
were often delays in requesting required actions (e.g., for non-objections, reallocations of project
funds); (ii) the project coordinating Task Force comprising high-level MOH staff was unable to
maintain the planned meeting schedule and contribute effectively to the implementation of the
project; and (iii) collaboration between the DAAF and the FMA was handicapped by the absence of
the designated MOH staff. 12 Second, the unavailability of the requisite health personnel for the
project area (which comprised eighteen of the poorest and most remote districts) required the local
recruitment of health workers. 13 Third, an early supervision mission expressed concern that the
Government’s critical underfinancing of the sector would alter the project’s role from contributing
(along with other partners) to overall sector financing to substituting for the National Budget. 14

44. The Bank responded to these constraints by: (i) revising the Bank’s financial parameters to
provide Bank financing for 100 percent of eligible expenditures; and (ii) contributing to the 2007
emergency plan by increasing (by 15 percent) the quantities of goods being procured (drugs,
mosquito nets, equipment, etc.). 15 In addition, the Bank agreed to reallocate US$2 million from the
training to grants for the Annual Operating Plans (PAO) of the regions, districts, hospitals, and
health centers. Finally, the Government and the Bank concluded in October 2007 that the project


12
   Despite repeated reminders from the supervision missions to the ministry about the DCA obligation to name
counterparts to work with the FMA, MOH staff was never effectively available. As a consequence, the FMA contract
was maintained throughout project implementation.
13
   The Government also took action on a national level to address the problem by raising the retirement age (for those
willing) for certain categories of personnel (e.g., midwives and nurses).
14
   The Bank was also concerned with the difficulties of mobilizing counterpart funding and the implications for project
implementation; for example, virtually the entire amount of the Government’s initial counterpart contribution was
disbursed to meet its previous PPF obligations.
15
   In October 2007, the Government instituted a free-service policy for cesarean sections; anti-retroviral drugs; drugs to
treat opportunistic infections (tuberculosis), along with specific biological exams; and impregnated mosquito nets. As
the Public Expenditure Review (p. 94) notes, funding for this policy was “miniscule.”

                                                                                                                      18
would need to be restructured after the mid-term review.

45. Restructuring began in February 2008 and the project was authorized to hire three full-time
consultants to assist in the implementation of the project’s components. Subsequent supervision
missions advanced the restructuring process, but it had not been completed at the time of the
suspension in December 2008. A Level 1 restructuring was completed in 2011 with: (i) a revision of
the PDOs and related intermediate outcome indicators; (ii) a streamlining of project activities; (iii) a
revision of institutional arrangements; (iv) a reallocation of credit proceeds; and (v) an extension of
the closing date.

46. In essence, the project was effectively implemented over two relatively brief periods (2007-08
and 2012-13 16 ), which were distinguished by: (i) the transfer of implementation responsibilities
from the ministry during the initial phase to an autonomous unit during the latter phase; and (ii) the
improvement in communication and decision-making between the project and the Bank. During this
latter phase, a concerted effort was made to develop quantitative data on the project indicators: (i)
publication of available (but unpublished) annual statistics for the years 2006-11 was financed; and
(ii) based in part on these (and project) data, annual results for all of the indicators for the entire
duration of the project were constituted.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

47. M&E design. A Results Framework with annual objectives was prepared, though without the
definition of numerators and denominators for the KPIs. There were other problems as well with the
KPIs. First, only two outcome indicators were linked to the services component and none to the
institutional capacity component. Second, the intermediate outcome indicators were a mix of both
population-based results and project outputs, and they were not well understood by the project. The
restructuring paper recognized the flaws, replacing the 2 initial outcomes with 6 new or revised
outcomes, eliminating 14 intermediate objectives, and replacing them with 12 new or revised
intermediate outcomes.

48. The project’s M&E plan envisioned several layers: (i) monitoring of project expenditures by
the FMA as well as internal (carried out by the FMA) and external audits at all levels; (ii)
monitoring of project activities as defined in the annual operational plans and contracts/agreements
funded by the project at the national, regional, district, and health facility levels; (iii) monitoring of
project results through the health management information system (with a subset of data for the
eighteen project districts); and (iv) evaluation of outcome and impact through Demographic and
Health Surveys to be conducted at the beginning and end of the project.

49. Finally, other studies (e.g., health expenditure tracking, assessment of the quality of health
services delivered, and a survey of client satisfaction) were envisioned on an annual basis. Prior to
the Mid-Term Review, additional studies and surveys were planned to measure progress toward
attaining the development objectives of the project.



16
  Though the project was effective in June 2006, very few activities (see Annex 2) were carried out in 2006; similarly, a
number of activities (based on the 2009 annual work plans) were restarted in 2011, but the project was not approved
until December 28, 2011 and the revised DCA was not signed until March 20, 2012.

                                                                                                                     19
50. Implementation. The M&E ratings in the ISRs varied over time; (i) from Satisfactory over
the first year; (ii) to Moderately Unsatisfactory (due mostly to the realization that the indicators
were unsuitable) before recovering to Moderately Satisfactory during the period prior to the
suspension; (iii) to Unsatisfactory over the period of project suspension; and (iv) to Satisfactory for
the final period after restructuring.

51. Physical and financial monitoring. The combination of competent technical assistance (FMA),
newly procured computer systems, and proven accounting software (TOMPRO) enabled the project
to prepare the financial management reports required by the credit agreement. These reports were
generally on time and acceptable to the Bank, though various supervision missions noted that they
did not always adequately address physical results and the link between expenditures and outputs.

52. Project monitoring. As a result of the many parallel (and often competing) information
systems comprising the ministry’s health management information system, project monitoring of
the agreed-upon indicators was initially: (i) tardy and unreliable for the country as a whole; and (ii)
not always applicable to the districts covered by the project. Throughout 2007-08, Bank supervision
missions provided technical assistance to improve project monitoring and evaluation. In addition,
the project financed preparation of a plan to strengthen the overall management information system
through unified data collection formats, hardware and software for analysis, training, and support to
ensure the use of the resulting information. Subsequently, the project financed the publication of the
annual statistical data for the years 2007-2011.

53. The mid-term review of the project was initially planned for March 2008 but then postponed
to November 2008 and subsequently to early 2009. With the suspension of the project in 2009, the
mid-term review was cancelled. Though considered after restructuring, there were concerns that not
enough time had elapsed between the restructuring and an eventual MTR; consequently, the Bank
and the Government agreed to accept the restructuring as the MTR.

54. Surveys and research. Aside from the description of the PHRD and PPF requirements at the
beginning of the project and the conduct of a follow-up DHS at the end of the project, the PAD did
not identify the surveys and research to be carried out during project implementation. As indicated
in Annex 9, the project produced an important number of studies and reports essentially in three
waves: (i) prior to effectiveness when the PHRD studies were completed; (ii) in 2008 when the bulk
of the PPF studies were completed; and (iii) in 2012-13 when several sector financing studies and
technical evaluations were completed. The DHS results of 2004 and 2012 (funded in part by the
project) as well as the MICS results of 2010 (using the DHS methodology but for a more limited
number of variables) provide a reasonable series of data points for measuring project progress.

55. Utilization. While supervision missions noted a history (beginning with the Bamako
Initiative) of conducting periodic monitoring missions and collecting information (particularly at
health facility and district levels), they also pointed out the lack of analysis and use for decision-
making at regional and central levels. Among the weaknesses noted in data utilization were: (i)
concerns about the quality of the data which reduced the interest in and credibility of the
information produced; (ii) the irregular meetings of the various coordinating structures, which




                                                                                                    20
eliminated the occasions for exchanging results 17; and (iii) the lack of a communications strategy
involving the dissemination of results.

56. M&E is rated modest. The range of information collected and disseminated during project
implementation was substantial and included: (i) financial reports; (ii) consistent annual project and
HMIS monitoring data (helped by the project’s hiring of and M&E specialist and contribution to the
publication of the annual statistical digests); (iii) national surveys (DHS and MICS); and (iv) a
number of studies and operational research reports on a variety of topics related to the project area.
However, the functionality of the established institutions at central, regional, and district levels and
the use of the information for project and sectoral management were not adequate.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

57. Environment. The environment category of the project at the time of appraisal was B. The
National Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP), adopted in May 2002 in the context of the
Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project, identified a number of environmental risks, including: (i)
inappropriate handling and disposal of medical waste by untrained staff; and (ii) inadequate
management of the disposal sites. It proposed measures to mitigate the potential risks with adequate
institutional arrangements to monitor proper medical waste management in the country; and it
included: (i) an implementation schedule; and (ii) estimated costs for equipment, public awareness
raising, and capacity building to effectively implement the plan. The report was reviewed, found
satisfactory; and disclosed in country and in the Bank Info shop.

58. The project intended only to renovate some health posts and was therefore not expected to
have substantial adverse environmental effects. Under the institutional strengthening component,
responsibilities for implementing the MWMP were assigned to: (i) the Directorate of Public
Hygiene (DNPH) at central level; and (ii) the heads of the hospitals, health centers and health posts
for the decentralized levels. A revised action plan was requested for December 2007 and approved
in January 2008. After project restructuring, a further revision of the MWMP was requested in 2011
and (after some delay) disclosed publicly in Guinea and in the Bank Info shop.

59. Prior to restructuring, the project financed (i) incinerators for the district hospitals; (ii) safety
equipment for the health facility personnel at district and health center levels; (iii) training for
hospital staff; and (iv) public awareness campaigns. After restructuring, the DNPH was particularly
active: (i) formulating a national strategy and regional plans for bio-medical waste management; (ii)
disseminating norms and procedures; (iii) installing the incinerators and distributing equipment and
materials; and (iv) training and supervising staff. The ICR mission to the project area confirmed
health staff’s awareness and implementation of appropriate waste management practices.

60. Except for the period during which the revised MWMP was being prepared, the overall
safeguards ratings were Satisfactory both before and after restructuring.

61. Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management. The DAAF, assisted by the
FMA, was expected to be responsible for procurement and financial management. The FMA was to


17
 Annual reviews were envisioned by the DCA but were held only in 2007. Task Force meetings at the national level
were rare; they seem to have been more frequent at regional level, but there is no record of the nature of the discussions.

                                                                                                                       21
be evaluated annually and judged in part on its success in ensuring the transfer of knowledge, skills,
and methods to the DAAF. This transfer was never fully implemented, and the FMA continued to
play the major role in fiduciary matters throughout project implementation.

62. Procurement. The PAD’s assessment of procurement capabilities concluded that there were
weaknesses in each phase of the procurement process: bid preparation and evaluation, management
of the contract awards, payments to contractors, and record keeping. At project start-up, the FMA
had been recruited and a procurement plan prepared (though with weaknesses) for the initial
eighteen months. Subsequent supervision missions repeatedly cited: (i) the need for timely updating
of the procurement plan; (ii) the lengthy delays in conducting the tenders and in signing the
contracts; (iii) the need to strengthen document preparation, handling, and archiving; and (ii) the
importance of improving the capabilities of the procurement staff within the DAAF.

63. The project used several approaches for procurement: (i) tenders for minor renovations of
health centers were organized through the Regional Development Councils (CRD) which had
gained experience with a concurrent Bank project; (ii) bidding for large scale goods was the
responsibility of the FMA while small-scale procurements were left to the regions; (iii) procurement
of drugs and medical supplies was subcontracted to the Central Pharmacy; (iv) consultant contracts
were handled by the FMA; and (iv) procurement of consumable materials was left to the
decentralized health structures through the funds included in the Annual Operating Plan (PAO).

64. During the period of project suspension, procurement was rated Unsatisfactory; otherwise,
procurement was rated Satisfactory both before and after restructuring.

65. Financial management. The FM assessment concluded that: (i) the minimum financial
management tools were in place at the regional, district, and health facility levels; and (ii) the FMA
would ensure the FM responsibilities under the supervision of the DAAF. At the time of project
start-up, the basic elements of a financial management system were in place: (i) the
accounting/financial management manual had been approved 18 and simplified guides prepared for
the decentralized structures; (ii) the FMA had been recruited (though MOH counterpart staff were
not functional); (iii) accompanying computer hardware and software (TOMPRO) were functional;
and (iv) agreement had been reached on procedures for the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR).

66. There were four recurring problems with the transfer of project funds to the implementing
units at central, regional, district, and facility (hospitals, and health centers) levels: (i) the timely
approval of annual plans and budgets; (ii) the availability of funds in the appropriate budget
category; (iii) the difficulty of recovering justifications for the amounts spent (which reduced the
funds available and the execution of planned activities; and (iv) the rejection of some of these
justifications (initially by the FMA and subsequently by the Bank).

67. As previously noted, financial reports acceptable to the Bank were submitted in a timely
manner. External audit arrangements were established as a condition for effectiveness, and annual
audits (except for 2012) were conducted in a timely manner and generally without qualification 19.



18
     The manual was subsequently revised in 2012 after the project was restructured.
19
     The 2007 audit, for instance, included a qualification linked to the Bank’s modification of the financing parameters.

                                                                                                                         22
68. The quality of financial management was consistently rated Moderately Satisfactory and the
risk assessed as Moderate by the FM specialists. The ISRs rated financial management as
Satisfactory, except: (i) during the period of project suspension, when it was rated Unsatisfactory;
and (ii) during the last ISR period, when it was rated Moderately Satisfactory due to the volume of
outstanding justifications for expenditures.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

69. The original PAD expected that the project would: (i) contribute to the PRSP objectives by
supporting MoH’s Five-Year Plan 2005-09; (ii) complement other existing Bank projects; (iii)
establish planning and management capabilities at regional, district, and health facility levels; and
(iv) serve as a transition to adequate budget support through a PRSC/sector approach. Though the
project restructuring modified these objectives somewhat, most had by project closing been
achieved in a manner that provides a basis for the future project currently being planned for FY16.

70. Specifically, policies, strategies, and protocols have been adopted in key technical areas,
including MCH services, supply chain strengthening, training and human resource development,
etc. Institutional arrangements have been adopted for decentralized planning and program
management, and the implementing capabilities of health structures at regional, district, and facility
levels were strengthened through the Annual Operational Planning process. The future project,
which intends to introduce Performance-Based Financing, will benefit from these improvements.

71. Despite these positive elements, project closing will likely mean the return to a reliance on
MoH’s chronically underfinanced share of the national budget impacting the improved practices
(e.g., direct financing of health structures, autonomous facility management, training and
supervision, timely data collection, etc.) introduced by the project. In addition, inadequate human
resources remain an issue which constrains service delivery and sector management.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

72. To facilitate the assessment of outcomes, the following discussion is linked both to the
summary of ratings by PDO in Table 10 (the Overall Outcome Ratings) and to the specific results of
the PDO indicators and Intermediate Outcome indicators in the Section F of the Data Sheet.

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

73. Project relevance is rated Substantial for the project objectives, Modest for the project design
and implementation, and Substantial overall. Prior to restructuring, the objectives were
substantially in line with the existing political orientations and technical considerations, but the
weaknesses in project design and implementation, noted previously, handicapped the translation of
these orientations into effective actions; after restructuring, the project’s objectives, design, and
implementation arrangements were significantly better aligned.

74. Relevance of the project objectives. As discussed earlier, the project’s objectives were
substantially in line with the political orientations and technical considerations existing at project
start-up. At project closing, the project’s objectives remain substantially relevant to the country’s
global obligations and national objectives, through its support for: (i) the achievement of MDGs 4
and 5; (ii) the goals of the 2013 Poverty Reduction Strategy; and the priorities of the National

                                                                                                   23
Health Policy and the National Health Development Plan (currently being updated). The project
also remains relevant to the development of the sector through the roadmap for maternal and
neonatal death (2008) and the 2011 National Gender Strategy. Finally, the project’s original
principles remain relevant: (i) empowerment of MoH services for the implementation of the project,
(ii) complementary funding from the project and the national budget; and (ii) reliance on enhanced
local capacity to manage the implementation of project initiatives and participate in the proposed
studies and evaluations.

75. The project also contributes to the achievement of the 2014-17 Country Partnership Strategy
which seeks to balance fiscal austerity measures with mitigating actions in the social sector.
Specifically, building on the free health policy of 2007, the government decided in 2012 to provide
free pre-natal consultations and deliveries as well and in 2013 to include consultations for children
under five years old. Based on evidence seen elsewhere, these policies can substantially increase the
demand for these services, if the corresponding supply side needs (supported by the project) are
provided, e.g., equipment, drugs, supplies, and training.

76. Relevance of the project design and implementation arrangements. The project design built on
previous health project experience by focusing on: (i) vulnerable women and children in Guinea’s
poorest districts; and (ii) proven essential interventions for pregnant women (risk identification and
emergency care) and children (vaccination, malaria, etc.). The design also incorporated: (i) an
approach for implementing quality assurance already piloted by GIZ; and (ii) a Government
commitment to implement the project through agreements with decentralized health administration
and health service providers. Finally, the design took into account the Guinean context for project
implementation with the recruitment of the FMA and the medium-term transfer of skills to MoH.

77. While all of the above were strong elements of the initial project design, there were several
shortcomings, including: (i) the ambitiousness of the PDO and the proposed targets; (ii) the number
and complexity of the various interventions considered (quality assurance, compulsory health
insurance, sector financing, human resource management, etc.); and (iii) the appropriateness of the
proposed implementation arrangements. For these reasons, project design and implementation are
considered Modest prior to restructuring.

78. Project restructuring was initiated in early 2008 to strengthen the project while maintaining
the positive aspect of the design. The PDO were simplified, the project’s interventions were
streamlined, the implementation arrangements (with accompanying changes in project personnel)
were improved, and a performing monitoring and evaluation system was established. Though not
formally completed until early 2012, the essential elements of project restructuring had been set in
motion in 2011, and project design and implementation effectiveness were Substantial thereafter.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

79. As shown in the overview below, fifteen of the project’s outcome and intermediate outcome
targets were achieved (and often exceeded); seven were partially achieved; three were not achieved;
and one could not be assessed due to a lack of information. Overall, the project fully or partially
achieved 85 percent of its objectives.




                                                                                                   24

80. Based on: (i) the project's overall results shown in the Data Sheet, in Annexes 2a and b
presenting the quantitative and qualitative outputs, and in the following paragraphs; and (ii) the
project's weighted results as a proportion of actual disbursements at restructuring and at closing, as
shown at the end of this section, project efficacy is rated Modest prior to the restructuring,
Substantial/High after the restructuring and Substantial overall.

Outcome Objective 1: Strengthening Health Care Services

81. Health care quality. To decrease maternal and infant mortality (under the original project)
and improve the coverage and quality of maternal and child health services (under the restructured
project), the project sought to improve the quality of care and increase the demand for health care.

82. Project inputs. As indicated in Annex 2, the project provided important inputs to strengthen
health services, including minor health facility renovation, equipment, blood transfusion capabilities,
drugs and vaccines, and training. Of particular importance for the quality of services were
expenditures to: (i) recruit trained staff for facilities lacking midwives and nurses; (ii) strengthen
communications and transport, including costs for evacuation for emergency obstetrical care; and
(iii) provide comprehensive support for operational costs, implemented mainly through performance
contracts between MOH, the district hospitals and the health centers. These agreements identified
costs paid by central level (including equipment, vehicles, maintenance, salaries of contracted
personnel) and paid at decentralized levels (training, supervision, and minor maintenance).

83. In addition to these inputs, the Government’s introduction of free health care services for
pregnant women (2007) and children under five years (2012) would normally be considered as a
significant contribution to results in the project area. However, as the Public Expenditure Review
(PER) documents, these initiatives were never adequately funded (representing less than 2 percent
of the ministry’s budget) over the period 2008-12. 20

84. Project outputs/results. As shown in Table 4 below, the project: (i) increased the coverage of
health services for pregnant women and children at basic and first referral health facilities; and (ii)
strengthened the technical skills (training and monitoring / post training evaluation) of clinical staff.
For each of the indicators, the results show that the project achieved significant gains after the
restructuring, where the actual results surpass the planned results.

85. Intermediate outcomes. Outcomes resulting from improved health services in the project area
generally exceeded the targets. The number and proportion of women receiving at least one ante
natal visit increased substantially, as did the proportion of institutional deliveries assisted by trained
staff. The proportion of children receiving DTC progressed, but full immunization of children 12-23
months stagnated.

86. As shown below, results for several intermediate outcome indicators were not as positive.
Particularly disappointing (in view of the Government’s decision to eliminate fees) were the rates
for caesarian sections. While rates rose during the project from 0.60 percent to 1.54 percent, they
did not reach the anticipated minimum rate of 5 percent or even the revised rate of 2 percent. 21

ARVs prior to project closing. The proportion of pregnant women benefiting from intermittent

preventive treatment for malaria (TPI) varied throughout the project. The number of LLINs
distributed was less than originally planned, due in part to the contribution by other partners and in
part to the fact that the project did not use mass distribution but rather targeted the distribution of
nets to pregnant women appearing for ANC and to infants on the occasion of various vaccinations.

88. Outcomes. Based on data available from the 2004 and 2012 DHS, the ICR estimated the
number of deaths avoided for pregnant women at 15,596 (or 130 percent of the target of avoiding
12,000 deaths) and children under 1 at 14,542 deaths (or 53 percent of the target of avoiding 27,500
deaths). 22 The project substantially achieved its target of 3 million beneficiaries, reaching 2.6
million persons (85 percent of the target), of which 1.4 million were female.

89. Finally, as indicated in the following table, which compares annual project results with
periodic national results (as measured by the DHS and the MICS), the project zones lagged behind
the country as a whole through 2010, but have made substantial progress on certain key indicators
since project restructuring, generally catching up or surpassing the national averages. 23

   As noted in the data sheet, the initial baseline data for both indicators were incorrect, and the targets were very

90. Community mobilization. To mobilize community support for and utilization of the
improved health services, the project relied on three quite different approaches.

91. Project inputs: As indicated in Annex 2, the project financed: (i) pilot activities in six regions
to test the feasibility of decentralizing management of selected health facilities to the urban and
rural communes; (ii) community sub-projects for village-level awareness of MCH-related activities;
and (iii) the expansion of the existing community health insurance system providing coverage
mainly for women’s health risks related to child birth.

92. Project outputs/results. Early studies concluded that compulsory health insurance and the
decentralization of health facility management to the urban and rural municipal governments (IOI
7) were not feasible and they were dropped.

93. Subprojects (IOI 12 and 13), implemented by community-based organizations to promote the
benefits of preventive health services, were financed before the project suspension but not restarted
after restructuring. The impact of the sub-projects was evaluated in 2012 and showed that: (i)
knowledge of the interventions had increased substantially in the selected areas (from 30 percent to
90 percent for prenatal care, from 50 percent to 80 percent for vaccination, and from 9 percent to 78
percent for family planning); and (ii) utilization (of a third prenatal consultation, of the DTC3, and
modern family planning methods) lagged far behind the level of knowledge.

94. Studies of community-organized health insurance (IOI 6) were promising, and promotion of
the approach was initiated early; although interrupted by the suspension, it was restarted after
project restructuring and at project closing, 53 (of a planned 89) schemes had been initiated. A
preliminary progress report for the community health schemes was prepared in December 2013 and
showed that 7,232 households had subscribed (covering 17,708 beneficiaries or approximately 0.3
percent of the population in the project area) and that 91.2 million FGN had been mobilized. It
should be noted that while these are very small numbers, they were achieved during the last five
months before the end of the project.

95. Quality assurance. Beginning in 2002, German Technical Assistance (then GTZ, now GIZ)
organized, in collaboration with the ministry and the Faculty of Medicine, an annual review of the
quality of health care services (“concours”) provided by hospitals and health centers in selected
regions. Although some of the regions in the project zone participated in the exercise, none were
targeted by the GIZ project; it was therefore anticipated that the project would finance GIZ to
expand the assessment of quality for the health facilities.

96. Project inputs. A workshop to introduce the ideas was financed by the project in 2008, but the
contract with GIZ was never finalized. After restructuring, workshops were held in 2011 and 2012
to refine the quality assessment tool, but the tool itself was never formally introduced. The project
financed the introduction of training (in-school and continuing) and follow-up supervision to
measure the retention of training skills provided for emergency obstetric care and for the treatment
of childhood illnesses.

97. Project outputs/Results. Self-evaluation exercises (IOI 18) were organized in eight of the
project regions in 2003, expanding to nine in 2007, and eleven in 2009; cumulatively, the number of
participating facilities increased from 56 in 2003 to 95 in 2007 to 116 in 2009. The mission was
unable to find the results of these exercises. The sub-component was dropped at restructuring.

                                                                                                   28
98. The quality of obstetric care was measured at the national level through evaluations led by the
UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) in 2003 and 2012. 24 The comparison of results was
mixed: (i) the completeness and coverage of the services offered had not materially improved; but
(ii) all of the other indicators (treatment of obstetrical complications, caesarian sections, and
maternal death rates) improved. The quality of treatment of childhood illnesses was measured
during the supervision of a sample of health centers in the project zone, which found that 80 percent
of the facilities were evaluating and treating/referring cases correctly.

Outcome Objective 2: Strengthening institutional capacity

99. Under the original project, the project’s intermediate objectives were intended to prepare the
ministry (through support for and monitoring of the PNDS) to meet the criteria for graduating to a
PRSC approach for financing the sector. Under the restructured credit, the objectives were limited
to strengthening specific sectoral functions, including planning and financial management (through
the DAF, supported by the FMA), monitoring and evaluation, and project coordination (through the
PMU). Support for waste management and training and research (through the reproductive health
training and research center) were continued.

100. Project inputs. As shown in Annex 2, the project financed personnel and material for
coordinating project implementation and activities in four important areas: (i) formulation of broad
policies (including the revision of the National Health Development Plan) and specific strategies;
(ii) development of the health management information system and support for the 2012 DHS; (iii)
strengthening of the planning and management of human resources; and (iv) contributing to the
national implementation of measures to control medical waste.

101. Project outputs/results. Prior to project restructuring, the results framework was programmatic
in nature, and set seven conditions as targets for the transition to budget support 25. Of these, three
were monitored through the key performance indicators: (i) annual monitoring of a complete five-
year plan (IOI 9&10) was not carried out; (ii) health expenditure tracking surveys to verify the
budgeted amounts actually reaching health centers (IOI 11) were not conducted (although three
studies, including a public expenditure review, expenditure tracking survey and beneficiary survey,
were done after restructuring); and (iii) MOH budget execution of more than 70 percent (IOI 16)
was achieved, as results from the PER show that, except for 2011 (65.1 percent) all of the annual
results from 2006-2012 were greater than 70 percent.

102. After project restructuring, the results framework emphasized project oriented achievements
and showed that: (i) all of the health centers and district hospitals were supervised (IOI 8) at least
twice annually; and (ii) the proportion of the annual project budgeted executed (IOI 20) rose to 98
percent in 2013. Finally, as noted previously, 17 incinerators were purchased and installed (IOI 14)
by the project (one was purchased and installed by WHO); and project records show that 14 were
installed by the end of 2010.

ICR guidelines (requiring separate outcome ratings weighted in proportion to the share of actual
credit disbursements made in the periods before and after formal restructuring), the following table
assesses the project's efficacy as modest prior to the restructuring, substantial/high after the
restructuring, and Substantial overall. 26

104. As indicated in the table, the restructuring and extension of the project contributed
significantly to the achievement of the PDO. In addition, a number of the project’s achievements are
not captured in the results reported above, including: (i) the participation of health workers, NGOs
and members of the community in raising awareness about preventive care and the increased
availability of improved services; (ii) improving the functioning and contractual quality of staff at
the health centers and district hospitals; (iii) the establishment of a referral and counter referral
system (with ambulances and radios); (iv) support for the recapitalization of the Central Pharmacy
(PCG); (v) contribution to the management of human resources; (vi) the implementation measures
for medical waste management (including with incinerators in hospitals); and (vii) strengthening the
coordinating bodies of MOH.

3.3        Efficiency

105. As discussed in the PER (2014), the project was implemented within a sectoral context of poor
allocative and technical efficiency. First, public funds were concentrated at: (i) central level and in
Conakry rather than in rural areas; and (ii) referral hospital level rather than primary health center
level. This was due mostly to the disconnect between the needs for and deployment of health
personnel and services. Second, as seen earlier, spending priorities did not give sufficient emphasis
to basic public health programs with high potential effectiveness and positive externalities; of the
eighteen priority public health programs operating in the country, the PER examined five which
were large enough to be traceable: Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), tuberculosis
prevention pro-gram (TB), malaria prevention program (PALU), program against AIDS (AIDS) and
Comprehensive Care for Diseases of Newborns and Children (PECIMNE). In 2012, these programs

received only 2.7 percent of total ministry expenditures. 27

106. Further, the PER noted the inefficiencies of budget execution, resulting from the low levels of
budget execution for personnel and the consequence that, despite budget availability, less staff is on
the ground than planned with deleterious effects on the quality and coverage of health care.

107. Allocative and technical efficiency. Annex 3 of the PAD anticipated these issues in its
economic and financial analysis and proposed strategies to: (i) improve allocative efficiency (to
needier regions and more vulnerable populations); (ii) implement a cost-effective package of
priority services; and (iii) increase technical efficiency in the delivery of health services (through
outreach, follow-up of vaccination, etc.).

108. In contrast to the sector’s demonstrated inefficiencies, the project’s design promoted both
allocative and technical efficiencies. The project’s allocative efficiency was substantial both before
and after the restructuring, based on: (i) the level of poverty in the targeted areas and the
accompanying inequitable access and quality of health services; and (ii) the focus on mothers and
children (who bear a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality). Similarly, the project’s
design favored technical efficiency by financing proven interventions to improve maternal and child
health services and control communicable diseases (including vaccination coverage). 28 Technical
efficiency is rated modest prior to the restructuring, based on the scope of the project’s activities, a
number of which were financed once or twice and then dropped. Though potentially important for
long-term reform, these activities tended to compete for attention and resources from the essential
objectives of improving the coverage and quality of maternal and child health services. After the
restructuring, the project’s activities were more focused and technical efficiency was substantial.

109. Managerial efficiency. Prior to the restructuring, the implementation arrangements, which
sought to combine internal government structures and methods with an external fiduciary
management agency’s procedures created delays in procuring and delivering goods and services to
the service delivery point and in disbursing the project’s funds. In addition, the late effectiveness
(2006), the slow start spending (2007), the lack of timely availability of counterpart funding, and
the suspension of the project (2009-11) all detracted from the project’s efficiency. With difficulty,
the project coped with the problem of coordinating the timing, nature, and modalities of the
resources required to achieve the anticipated results. After project restructuring, as can be seen in
the volume of activities achieved over the final two years of the project, the revised implementation
arrangements contributed significantly to managerial efficiency. More than 50 percent of project
funds were disbursed during calendar years 2011-13.

110. Efficiency before and after project restructuring is rated as follows: (i) allocative (substantial-
substantial); (ii) technical (modest-substantial); and (iii) managerial (modest-substantial). Overall,
based on these dimensions of efficiency, the project’s efficiency is rated as Modest.

   PER, pp. 96. The PER indicates that public funding for these programmatic areas (which is less than GNF 3 billion
for all eighteen programs and less than about 1 billion for the five priority areas) is almost irrelevant in comparison to
the needs of the country. In 2012, the total cost of running these programs was GNF 180 billion, all of which was
funded by the international community.

   The package of interventions implemented by the project were known to be cost-effective at US$82-142 per DALY.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

112. The project contributed to the government’s poverty reduction strategy and, based on the
national poverty map established with Bank support, explicitly targeted the country’s poorest
regions. The PDOs were articulated around two groups known to be the most vulnerable: pregnant
women and children under the age of five. During the last year of the project, an estimated 1.4
million women were direct beneficiaries of the project. As previously indicated in Table 7, the
proportion of pregnant women benefiting from antenatal care and institutional deliveries (with
assistance from trained health personnel) increased steadily and substantially in the project areas
while remaining more or less static for the country as a whole.

113. According to the PER (2014), Guinea established two pro-poor programs, the Indigents Fund
(2005) and the Caesarian Fund expanded to include children under five (2007, 2012), which were
established to support the free delivery of certain health services to the poorest Guineans. The
project supported these poverty oriented initiatives indirectly by providing goods and services to the
health facilities rather than to the funds themselves.

114. Finally, the project contributed to the establishment of more than 50 community health
financing mechanisms (mutuelles de santé) which could ensure the continuation of at least some of
the services strengthened under the project. As described to the ICR mission by several respondents,
despite a long history in Guinea of attempts to support them (and the existence of a legal code),
these mutuelles must still overcome a number of technical difficulties and a persistent lack of
knowledge and distrust on the part of the populations, which have handicapped their expansion.




                                                                                                     32
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

115. Though the project did not achieve its very ambitious sector reform agenda (including the
steps for graduation to a budget support approach), this was due in large measure to constraints
beyond the control of the health sector. The project did achieve other, more narrowly defined sector
reforms, which can be categorized in three groups: (i) sustained technical (safe motherhood, blood
transfusion, IMCI, medical waste management, etc.) and administrative support (decentralization,
annual planning, pharmaceutical management, etc.); (ii) periodic interventions which have not yet
been fully embraced (community health insurance, human resource planning and management,
public expenditure tracing, etc.); and (iii) pilot experiences which were implemented but were not
deemed feasible (national health insurance, community ownership of health facilities, quality
assurance, CRD sub-contracting, etc.).

116. Within the sector, (i) task forces have been established at regional and district levels to plan,
implement, and evaluate activities, and community participation for health center management has
been reinforced; (ii) performance contracting has enhanced the autonomy of all levels of the health
system with the accompanying strengthening of planning and budgeting methods, financial
accounting, and reporting practices; (iii) health information systems and M&E have been updated
(and annual statistical reports brought up to date); and (iv) tools for assessing the technical
competence of health workers and the effects of training have been introduced.

117. One of the project’s major contributions was in establishing expectations for the performance
of the health system. Health staff and beneficiaries saw that, with adequate resources and support,
the health system in Guinea could function adequately. For health service providers, the
introduction of the performance contract provided a mechanism for planning results, projecting
costs, receiving funding directly into facility bank accounts, and disbursing for pre-approved
expenses. 29 Facility autonomy and results were enhanced. For beneficiaries, pregnant women, for
example, received and came to expect: (i) free transfer of pregnant women to the district hospital in
case of need (telephone communication, ambulance, etc.); and (ii) the availability of the requisite
services at the district hospital (surgical care, blood, etc.). Similarly the availability of drugs and
vaccines 30 ; periodic supervision at all levels, outreach with community health workers, etc. all
represented significant improvements in the functioning of the health care system.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

118. From a positive perspective, the contract signed with the Central Pharmacy (PCG) to procure
and distribute drugs had the intended effects of increasing the availability and improving the
management of drugs and other medical supplies at health facility level, but it also had the
somewhat unintended positive effect of providing a means to recapitalize the PCG without
providing a direct project subsidy.

119. From a negative perspective, while in almost all countries where caesarian sections are



29
   The Ministry of Finance approved these measures on an exceptional basis (par dérogation) in large part because of the presence of
the FMA.
30
   The ICR mission to the field confirmed both the availability of drugs and supplies and the use of proper stock management
techniques through the assistance of the Central Pharmacy (PCG).


                                                                                                                                33
provided free, coverage has increased, this was not the case in Guinea either at the national level or
in the project area. The 2012 evaluation of emergency obstetric services did not provide an
explanation, but it may well be due to the Government’s inability to finance the declared policy,
with the result that the policy was not implemented by the health services.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

120. Beneficiary assessments were conducted in 2002 as part of the project preparation and in 2013
at project closing. The ICR mission was unable to obtain access to the initial beneficiary
assessment; the latest beneficiary assessment is summarized in Annex 7.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High
121. While durable progress has been achieved and should continue in many areas as indicated
above, three types of risk should be noted. First, a chronic problem of leadership exists within the
ministry of health as demonstrated by the number of reform initiatives which were not brought to a
satisfactory conclusion. Several promising pilots were simply abandoned (e.g., quality assurance,
community awareness sub-projects, national insurance, etc.) while other proven successes (e.g.,
emergency obstetric services) are likely to disappear without additional support.

122. Second, in the short term, insufficient funding from the national budget since project closing
has already had negative effects on: (i) the stability of contractual staff of which an estimated 70%
have left their positions); and (ii) the functionality of services for which operational expenses
(including inputs, regular supervision, etc.) are no longer adequate. In the longer term, insufficient
numbers of qualified staff combined with a lack of motivation and rapid turnover will lead to a
declining interest in the methods and tools introduced by the project.

123. Third, the participation (through performance contracting and direct financing) of regional,
district, and health facility officials in the implementation of annual operational plans developed the
tools and methods for effective decentralization of health service delivery. Without these key
elements, continuation of this participation will be jeopardized.

124. Finally, given the potential for continuing political instability, the fragility of the economy,
and the uncertainty over the future leadership and direction of health service delivery in Guinea, the
risk to the development outcomes is considered High.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

125. Despite the multiple changes in the overall project framework for the delivery of services, the
project preparation process consistently focused on certain key principles, including the poorest
geographical areas, the most vulnerable population groups, and the most effective interventions. It

                                                                                                    34
also sought to build on the Government’s commitment to decentralization, demonstrated in other
successful Bank operations (e.g., the PRCI, the PACV, and the Urban Project), and focused on
enhancing the autonomy of health administration and health service providers to implement the
project. At the same time, the project design did not ignore the constraints of the Guinean context
for project implementation and included the recruitment of the FMA as a condition of effectiveness.

126. Unfortunately, the PAD did not entirely reconcile these different elements with the result that
the project combined many ideas and specific activities for strengthening MCH services with
institutional arrangements which were not entirely suited to the implementation of these initiatives.
There were delays in project preparation due to the project’s design: (i) the conditions imposed for
effectiveness; (ii) misunderstandings between the DAAF and the FMA which handicapped their
cooperation for the duration of the project; and (iii) the breadth of the planned mix of program and
project activities expected to be carried out by MOH’s technical services.

127. There were other weaknesses as well. First, while a number of the background analyses (at
least for the PPF) proved to be relevant, they were generally not available until long after project
effectiveness and therefore did not influence the project design. Second, a better assessment of the
potential risks might have anticipated some of these difficulties. Third, the project design’s internal
inconsistencies were reflected in the results framework, which established very ambitious targets for
indicators which were neither easy to measure nor particularly relevant to the PDO.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

128. Though supervision was hampered by the recurring restrictions on travel to and within the
country, it was enhanced by the continuity of the TTL, the thorough treatment of the essential issues
(technical, legal, fiduciary) by the Task Team members, and the systematic review of actions taken
on recommendations of the previous missions. With a couple of exceptions, the supervision mission
aides-mémoires were comprehensive, and the implementation status reports (ISR) were candid.

129. Supervision was characterized by flexibility and proactivity as measures were planned early in
the project to address: (i) weaknesses in the institutional arrangements for project implementation;
(ii) inadequate health personnel in the project area; and (iii) insufficient data to monitor the project’s
progress. Project restructuring, initially planned after the mid-term review, was accelerated when it
became apparent that waiting would have a negative effect on project performance. Restructuring
was relatively advanced when the Bank suspended activities in Guinea.

130. After restructuring, each of the issues above was adequately addressed. Mission assistance
was particularly valuable in ensuring the availability of statistical data for the country as a whole
and for monitoring the project. Although a formal exit strategy was not formally adopted, planning
for a follow-on project was initiated prior to project closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

131. Following ICR guidance indicating that, when ratings for the two dimensions are in different

                                                                                                       35
ranges (moderately unsatisfactory for quality at entry and satisfactory for supervision), the rating for
overall Bank performance depends on the outcome rating and is therefore rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2      Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

132. Socio-economic instability and political conflict preoccupied authorities during project
implementation and, in combination with frequent ministerial changes and shortcomings in the
institutional arrangements, weakened political and technical leadership for the project within the
Ministry. First, while the basic policies and directives for the sector were established, the daily
operations to monitor implementation were ineffective: the steering committee functioned poorly,
the reform initiatives were not followed up, and the lack of central-level support was felt
particularly at regional and district levels. Second, though the project demonstrated that satisfactory
results can be obtained with a certain level of financial resources and autonomy (to recruit staff
locally, to spend money on specific inputs, etc.), the Government’s long-term underfinancing of the
sector (as shown by the latest PER) has seriously undermined sector performance. 31

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

133. Project Coordination Unit. The PCU had responsibility for the overall implementation of the
project; specific project implementation responsibilities were shared with the appropriate Ministry
services for technical matters and with the FMA and the DAAF for financial and administrative
matters. The ISRs consistently rated project management as satisfactory or moderately satisfactory 32.
Assessment of implementation progress varied considerably, from moderately unsatisfactory over
the period 2006-07, to moderately satisfactory for 2008 and then for the entire period of the
restructured project.

134. As noted previously, the PCU’s performance was handicapped by the original implementation
arrangements, but the modification of these arrangements, the recruitment of limited (but dedicated
and competent) staff; and the enthusiasm of central and decentralized MOH personnel contributed
to the project’s achievement of many of its expected results.

135. Fiduciary Management Agency. The FMA succeeded in its principal task of ensuring the
fiduciary responsibilities of the country in a transparent manner as described in the DCA. Although
there were problems cited with respect to the timeliness and justification of the FMA’s actions and
to the limited number of its supervision missions 33, the ISRs consistently rated FM as satisfactory.



31
   The Government’s counterpart contribution was paid in full, but not in a timely manner.
32
   Except for the latter half of 2007 and the suspension period.
33
   For instance, in 2008, the decentralized structures received only one of two planned advances because the FMA had not conducted
the supervision missions to confirm the expenditures incurred.


                                                                                                                              36
The FMA also succeeded in strengthening financial management capabilities at regional and district
levels. The FMA did not succeed in the planned transfer of fiduciary capabilities to the appropriate
financial and administrative services within MOH.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

136. Following ICR guidance indicating that, when ratings for the two dimensions are in different
ranges (moderately unsatisfactory for government performance and moderately satisfactory for the
implementing agency performance), the rating for overall Borrower performance depends on the
outcome rating and is therefore rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned

137. Project design must balance a range of considerations. These include the desired outcomes,
the financing instrument, and the implementation arrangements. While certain instruments (such as
APLs or sector support) may offer an innovative approach for addressing identified weaknesses in a
traditional project approach, their selection may raise other, more significant problems. Therefore,
project design should be simple and focused on the Government’s priorities and commitment and
not on the latest development trend. For the project, perhaps too much attention was focused on the
financing instrument (and the resulting institutional arrangements) and not enough on a more
complete understanding of the previous results and the existing socio-political situation.

138. Risk assessment is an essential aspect of project design. While overall risk was rated as
high, the components of this rating were underestimated and the mitigation measures were
insufficient. A more rigorous assessment might have concluded that: (i) significant risks (political,
socio-cultural, technical, and financial) existed; and (ii) the feasibility of completing the project as
designed was questionable. While project preparation cannot be expected to pre-identify all of the
potential problems and their solutions, the proposed mitigation measures for the operation should
have been justified and not just asserted.

139. Where ministry leadership is inadequate, other champions must be found to advance the
project’s objectives. Guinea offers an example of where progress was achieved in the context of
political instability and insufficient leadership. Significant advances were made where champions
initiated service improvements (e.g. prevention of childhood illness, bio-medical waste, blood
transfusion, etc.). Project support from these champions was able to compensate (at least in part) for
varying government commitment and weak capacity. Consequently, proactive project supervision
(and effective management) should seek to identify opportunities and encourage them where
possible.

140. The Bank's comparative advantages need to be recognized and exploited. Guinea
demonstrates several of the Bank’s comparative advantages, which will be very important for the
proposed follow-on project to introduce Results-Based Financing (RBF), namely its flexibility and
willingness to support innovative strategies, and in particular to: (i) adopt measures to strengthen
health systems and health personnel; (ii) support decentralization of services and program
coordination; and (iii) promote initiatives to improve services, experiment with sectoral reforms,
and improve health care financing (e.g., better transparency, community health insurance, etc.). In

                                                                                                     37
these efforts, the Bank's non-financial support was often as essential as its financial support for
persuading all stakeholders in the sector.

141. There is a need to temper expectations that a single health project can impact the entire
health sector. Even good projects cannot necessarily change the sector context. While a single
project financed by the Bank may be a necessary condition for sectoral change, it is not sufficient
without greater political leadership and financial commitment from the Guinean authorities.
Inadequate sector financing and shortage and distribution of health personnel remain an issue in
Guinea that can only be tackled with increased Government spending for the sector. This is all the
more important in the context of the introduction of an RBF approach to strengthen the sector’s
focus on results towards improved availability and quality of health services.

142. Monitoring and evaluation can be improved throughout the project. Though the general
prescription is that M&E systems, including arrangements for collecting and analyzing data, should
be established prior to project launch, Guinea shows that projects can recover from inadequate
M&E design and early implementation weaknesses. While the timing of the DHS (in 2005 and
2012) was fortuitous for evaluating the project, the project’s sustained efforts to establish the annual
HMIS reports (2007-2013) and reconstruct project data for the entire period were essential in
providing an evidentiary trail for the project.

*At project restructuring, fluctuations in the SDR to dollar exchange rate had increased the original credit to US$27.8
million; the reduction of US$1.8 million in the estimated project cost resulted from dropping the subcomponents on
quality assurance, development of national insurance scheme, and tracking survey of health expenditures.

                                                                                       45
                                     Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The PAD did not provide a cost-benefit analysis for the proposed project; rather it argued
that in view of severe budget limitations, the project would implement strategies based on: (i)
improving allocative efficiency (to needier regions and more vulnerable populations and to a more
cost-effective package of essential services); (ii) increasing technical efficiency in the delivery of
health services (through outreach, follow-up of vaccination, etc.); and (iii) enhancing the efficiency
of current financial resources and the potential of out of pocket expenditures (whether to the public
or private sectors) through better cost-sharing schemes and the introduction of community health
insurance.

2.     Allocative efficiency. The PAD identified mismatches between: (i) priorities in the Five-
Year Plan and budget allocations; (ii) budget allocations and expenditures; and (iii) insufficient
expenditures on operational and maintenance costs of the health infrastructure. The project
envisioned the following actions for increasing allocative efficiency:
   • re-allocating resources to poorer regions with larger disease burden from urban areas;
   • increasing preventive outreach and revitalizing primary health care; and
   • improving hospital coverage; and
   • strengthening the capacity of the different levels to improve budgetary execution.

3.      Allocative efficiency was significant throughout based on: (i) the level of poverty in the
targeted areas and the accompanying inequitable access and quality of health services; and (ii) the
focus on mothers and children (who bear a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality) and
on effective interventions to improve communicable disease control (including vaccination
coverage) 35. The intended emphasis on instituting a quality of care instrument did not prove to be
feasible, but comprehensive training and regular supervision were financed by the project.

4.      Strengthening of planning, budgeting, and budgetary execution at the different levels
through the use of the Annual Operating Plans (PAO) was somewhat more problematic. While
greatly appreciated by the local health authorities and the service providers as a means of financing
key operational costs, the PAO, could only be expected to have a very indirect effect on results. In
addition, the Government's inability to adequately finance the national health budget meant that the
project substituted for (rather than complemented) key elements of the Government’s operating
budget in the project area.

5.      Technical efficiency. The PAD analysis does not address Government inefficiencies in
health spending, namely: (i) the very low level of health spending; (ii) the delays in procuring and
delivering goods and services to the service delivery point; and (iii) the known leakages between the
central level, regional and district health authorities, and hospitals and health centers. Data are
available on the first two points.




35
     The package of interventions implemented by the project were known to be cost-effective at US$82-142 per DALY averted.



                                                                                                                              46
6.      Data from the WHO National Health Accounts website show that both total health
expenditure as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product and general government spending on health
as a proportion of total general government spending have remained stable at 5-6% and 6-8%
respectively since 2003. Data from the Survey to Monitor Public Expenditures to Destination
(2012) provide information on the extensive delays in procurement and on the consequent lag in
deliveries and payments.

7.     From the project’s perspective, technical efficiency was modest throughout, based on the
timing, the nature, and the modalities of the project’s financial support. First, as a result of
procurement delays and the socio-political situation, the project had difficulty coordinating the
availability of all of the resources required to achieve the anticipated results. Second, the scope of
the project’s activities somewhat diverted resources from its essential objectives of improving the
coverage and quality of maternal and child health services. Among these activities, a number were
financed once or twice and then discontinued.

8.      Enhancing fiscal space. The PAD noted that in 2001, 83.5 percent of total health spending
in Guinea was from private sources, and almost 99% of private spending on health care was out-of-
pocket (OOP) at the point of service. While the benefits of prepayment for services had been
recognized, the existing social security system covered a very limited number of individuals in
Conakry, and no such mechanism had been developed to cover populations in poor, rural areas. The
project envisioned the following actions to enhance efficiency and increase fiscal space:
    • improving risk pooling through the community health insurance (mutuelles);
    • ensuring that existing public and private resources support public health goals; and
    • initiating a program approach to: (i) consolidate the ministry’s budget to increase the amount
        and avoid duplications in donor financing; and (ii) shift the ministry’s focus from project
        implementation progress to results.

9.     As noted on the WHO website, since 2003 the share of private spending on health has
declined somewhat from 99% to 93%. OOP spending has increased since 2003 from US$15 per
capita to USS$21 per capita. Private insurance finally attained 1% of total private health
expenditures in 2010 and has remained at that level. As with risk pooling, the coordination of the
various sources of financing to achieve public health goals has only just begun to be initiated.

10.      Managerial efficiency. Managerially, the implementation arrangements during the project’s
initial phase, which sought to combine internal government structures and methods with an external
fiduciary management agency’s procedures created disbursement problems from the beginning. In
addition, the delay in implementation (2006), the slow start spending (2007), the lack of timely
availability of counterpart funding, and the suspension of the project (2009-11) all contributed
negatively to the project’s efficiency. Finally, as can be seen in the volume of activities achieved
over the final two years of the project, the revised implementation arrangements after project
restructuring contributed significantly to the rate of disbursement. More than 50 percent of the
project proceeds were disbursed during calendar years 2012-2013.

                               Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results

Methodology
         In each prefecture investigators visited two towns (an urban district and a rural commune);
occasionally, districts far from the capital of the municipality were visited to account for the effect
of distances. A total of 71 Focus group discussions involving 535 participants (male and female)
were organized; and 1245 questionnaires were administered to 321 patients and 924 health care
facilities, including: Urban Hospitals and prefectural CS , CS houses, national Hospital ) and of the
health services (DRS , DPS and DCS , urban and rural CS , Community health Workers , national
Direction ( family Health Community Health Directorate in Charge of Hospitals , Office of Strategy
and Development).

        The questions concerned the following services provided by the project: Antenatal care;
treatment of common diseases during pregnancy; complications related to pregnancy; assisted
delivery; Family Planning; care and services for the integrated support of childhood illness;
vaccination of small children; nutrition and diet; care and services for the Reference and Counter
reference; primary curative consultation; mobilization and community participation; and the status
of infrastructure and associated equipment.

Overall conclusion
      Based on an analysis of the various beneficiary groups surveyed (men and women, patients
encountered in health facilities, and health personnel at various levels of the health pyramid):
   • People feel a sense of satisfaction with the relief provided by the care and services in public
      health facilities through the efforts of government and the support of numerous technical and
      financial partners, despite the persistent socio-political difficulties;
   • However this level of beneficiary satisfaction apparently is still at a high level means taking
      into account the actual gap between care and health services in some areas compared with
      standards and procedures on the one hand, and on the other hand many
      limitations/constraints raised by the beneficiaries themselves (and confirming some opinions
      of health personnel), as well as the expectations expressed during the field survey.

Recommendations
      To enhance the level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries of care and health services in the
Republic of Guinea, in accordance with the standards and procedures, it is recommended that:
   • A substantial renovation of infrastructure (buildings and equipment associated water,
      energy, toilet) would improve the work of health personnel;
   • A strengthened infrastructure development plan would improve services by building and
      equipping new health facilities closer to the to the beneficiaries of services and would
      increase access to a greater number by eliminating the constraints of distance and isolation;
   • The continued improvement in the level of care equipment and services and the supply of
      medicines and care products in the health facilities;
   • The development and implementation of an integrated IEC based on the technical guidance
      documents developed in the context of health promotion action plan;
   • The substantial implementation of measures for human resource envisaged in the National
      Health Development Plan but only modestly implemented as noted in the evaluation report;
   • The application of measures to improve the governance of health facilities to better reassure
      beneficiaries and encourage more to attend health facilities.

Introduction

The Project was originally planned to cover the period 2006-2011 but was extended until December
2013 because of political developments in Guinea in late 2008 which led to a two-year suspension
(2009-2010) of project activities.

The main objective of the project, based on the five-year plan, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,
and the Millennium Development (MDGs), is to contribute to the objectives of reducing maternal
mortality and child mortality. The specific objectives of the project are:
   • Reducing maternal mortality, neo natal and infant in the project area ;
   • Strengthen community participation for ownership of health facilities by the community;
   • Strengthen the management capacity of the structures to provide at any time quality
       services.
The two components of the project are to strengthen health services and institutional capacity.

Results

Relevance of the project (consistency of project strategies with the strategic axes of the PNDS): The
analysis of the various components of the project shows that they are a perfect fit with the strategic
axes 1 and 2 respectively of the PNDS for integrated fight against disease and maternal mortality
and institutional strengthening and management. This justifies the relevance of the project and its
perfect harmony with national priorities described in the strategy document of poverty reduction
and the priorities of the World Bank, which aims to support countries in reducing poverty.

Assessment of project effectiveness (level of achievement of objectives): A gradual evolution of
immunization coverage as well as coverage of other activities related to maternal and neo natal care
was observed for: vaccination across the four antigens, antenatal consultations, assisted deliveries,
caesarean sections, etc. This development was probably the result of health center implementation
of their activities including support for outreach sessions; contracting health workers and the
payment of bonuses to vaccinators; the financing of operating costs for refrigerators, regular
supervision, etc.; and support for institutional strengthening of prefectural health departments.

Coverage: A gradual evolution of BCG coverage (83% to 93%) was observed in all health centers
since the actual start of the project in 2007. The fall observed since 2009 could be explained by the
termination of funding from that date following the political developments in Guinea in December
2008. Another drop in BCG coverage in 2012 was due to a significant decrease availability of BCG
vaccine during this period.

Use of MNCH services: As measured by ANC1 coverage (for first contact) and ANC3 coverage
(for acceptability/continuity), there was a gradual evolution of the coverage in the area, from less
than 27% in 2006 to 91% in 2012. CPN1 coverage is well above the national coverage described in
the DHS 2012 where it is 85.2%. ANC3 coverage also followed the pace of progress in the project
area from 25% in 2006 to 75% in 2012 while it was 56.6% at the national average according to the
DHS 2012.



                                                                                                   52
Deliveries in health facilities: They increased significantly during the project period, from 11% in
the project area in 2006 to 43% in 2013, while the national rate is 40.3 % according to the DHS
2012. Training for emergency obstetric care providers in the project area as well as the equipment
of certain structures in materials explains this performance. It should be noted that this rapid growth
may not be the mere fact of the project but rather the result of a combination of contributing factors,
including the decree establishing the free delivery of 2010, although the accompanying measures in
place for its implementation have not been to the full satisfaction of service providers in terms of
the need for drugs and consumables necessary for the normal functioning of health facilities.

Coverage rates for caesarean sections: Given the national goal is of covering 5% for all cesarean
deliveries expected, the project made steady progress between 2006 (where only 0.4 % of caesarean
sections were performed) to 2008 (1.30%) before declining between 2008 and 2010. This rise in
coverage between 2007 and 2008 followed the implementation of the government's 2007 decision
establishing the free caesarean section.

Blood transfusion: Staffing hospitals in the area of equipment and consumables, needed for
collection, storage and administration of blood and blood products, improved progressively and the
number of blood transfusions increased from 188 in 2006 to 1944 in 2013.

Effects

Benefits in quality and care: Integration of the main diseases that cause child mortality (diarrheal
diseases, malaria and respiratory infections) into child health care services; training on emergency
obstetrical care provider for health workers at health center and hospital levels; improved quality of
care for beneficiaries. Similarly, the provision of delivery kits and caesarean kits and equipment for
the management of bio-medical waste, including incinerators for hospitals and sanitation equipment
at the small centers health have also helped to improve the quality of care and strengthening the
institutional capacity of structures.

Benefits in institutional strengthening: Project interventions in terms of institutional capacity
building covered all levels of the health pyramid.
    • Central level: all departments and central services have benefited from the support of the
       project, including financing their participation in important national meetings of MOH, such
       as the Regional Technical Committees of Health (CTRS ) and support financing of
       supervision teams and intermediate structures at the central level. Also some Directions
       received logistical support by providing vehicle support fuel and vehicle maintenance
       provided.
    • Intermediate and peripheral: Most targeted areas received vehicle supervision and financial
       support for supervision and monitoring of health facilities. In addition, the supply of
       ambulances for hospitals as well as the provision for DRS, DPS and DH of the project area
       for telephone service strengthened operational capacity of these structures especially in
       communication with front-line health structures for effective management of obstetric
       referrals and timely transmission of information on the epidemiological situation. It should
       also be noted that the decentralized level, the agents received training in the development of
       operational action plans and monitoring its implementation.
    • Community level: Capacity building at the community level is done through training of
       members of the health committee and health management resources and training of


                                                                                                    53
       community-based health workers on Community PCIMNE well as the training of village
       midwives to recognize danger signs of pregnancy and childbirth and refer cases to the health
       center.

Sustainability: The sustainability strategies developed by the project have included: the involvement
of communities in health center management; training midwives; financial support for certain health
center budget items; development and implementation of participatory annual plans and budgets
with health centers/hospitals; introduction of tools for managing resources; logistical support
including vehicles, equipment and operating costs; training of health center and hospital personnel;
transfer of financial management responsibilities to health centers and hospitals; networking of
community-based associations.

Lessons Learned
• Project transparency through accountability in the management of CCS
• Upgrading agents and AV provides support quality patient
• Business planning helps streamline efforts
• Good training delivery agents can qualify services
• Proper training of service providers MNCH ensures proper management of women
• The proper formation of AV and AC facilitates the mobilization of women around the MNCH
   services
• Proper training of AV and AC allows an increase in attendance at the CS
• Community empowerment in the management of funds promotes good governance
• The allocation of funds to beneficiaries structures increases the credibility of structures
• Contracting officers with the community can improve services
• Substantial financial support led to an increase in the level and quality of services
• Contracting of local staff is a guarantee for retention agents
• The establishment of the Steering Committee has minimized duplication.

The synthesis of lessons learned from the project shows that the two basic elements that emerge are
those related to human resources and management arrangements of the project.
    • With regard to human resources, health workers were the most important investment made
        by the project at health center level. The staffing of health facilities including recruitment
        and management have been made at Community level filled a deficit when the project
        promoted local recruitment. Even despite the delayed payment of their wages, contracted
        staff remained in their posts for the duration of their contract with the communities. This
        experience should be used to address the chronic shortage of health personnel especially in
        rural areas.
    • The second element is emerged from discussions accountability of health centers and health
        committee and health as a motivator and a guarantee of good governance in these structures.
