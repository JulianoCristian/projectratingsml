                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


1.      The closing date for Guinea Health Sector Support Project, Credit No 4072 GUI -
Project ID P065126 will be extended from September 30, 2011 until December 30, 2011.

2.      Project Progress. The project was approved by the Board on June 2, 2005. The
credit of SDR 16.6 million (equivalent to US$25.0 million) became effective on June 26,
2006. As of September 22, 2011, SDR 7.7 million (about US$ 12 million) or
approximately 46 percent of the financing had been disbursed. The current closing date
is September 30, 2011. The project currently targets 18 districts (of which 16 were the
poorest and 2 with refugees).

3.       From the start, the project has had implementation problems, including a one-year
delay in effectiveness. The Bank provided significant implementation support, with close
and frequent supervision, but soon it became obvious that the project needed to be
restructured. However, this could not be done because Bank operations were suspended
after the December 2008 coup. Some important project activities have taken place such
as the funding of decentralized action plans and the provision of ambulances in
Component 1, but activities linked to training and supervision have lagged behind. To
date, little progress has been made on the relevant project indicators, although
immunization rates did increase from 70% to 86% between 2004 and 2007, and 30 health
facilities have been provide with integrated mother-child intervention packages. The last
archived ISR, from March 24, 2011 shows all aspects of the project being rated as 'U',
including safeguard compliance. This reflects the fact that given that the project could
not be supervised for a period of more than two years.

4.       Two legal covenants, the presentation to IDA of the Annual Work Plan and that
of a progress report (including M&E indicators) should be complied with soon after
activities restart. There are no outstanding audit reports and 2009 audit report is
acceptable to the Bank. It is worth mentioning that this report issued a qualified audit
Opinion due to ineligible expenditures of US$72,000. These were reimbursed to the Bank
by the government on April 21, 2011 as part of the arrears clearance.

5.       The project remains highly relevant especially in this period of Bank re-
engagement where the government’s fiscal austerity measures will need to be balanced
with mitigating actions in the social sector. In the health sector, the government has
recently decided that pre-natal consultations and deliveries (including Caesarean
sections) would be provided free of charge. This will require the significant supply side
interventions such as equipment, drugs, supplies (such as delivery kits and C-section
kits), and training which would continue to be provided by the project.
6.       This extension is needed to provide sufficient time for the task team to finalize a
level 1 restructuring with the Government. The proposed changes which will be included
in this restructuring are as follows: (i) a revision of Project Development Objectives
(PDOs) and related indicators; (ii) a streamlining of project activities; (iii) a revision of
institutional arrangements; (iv) a reallocation of credit proceeds; and (v) a further
extension of the closing date to December 31, 2013. The short extension in the closing
date requested in this paper will allow this process to continue and the restructuring
package to be finalized.

7.     This      will      be      the     first     extension      of      the      project.
