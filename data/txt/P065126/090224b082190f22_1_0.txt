                         Following a project restructuring which revised the PDOs, modified the institutional arrangements; revised disbursement categories, and extended the closing date to December 30,
                         2013. The revised PDO isto improve the coverage and quality of maternal and child health services in targeted districts and targeted health centers in the peri-urban areas of
                         Conakry, achievement of the project so far include: (i) strengthened flow of care for at-risk deliveries; (ii) improved norms and adherence to the norms for basic as well as emergency
                         birth delivery in public health centers; (iii) improved emergency birth delivery care at all levels of health centers through the project zone; (iv) improved IMCI activities ; (v) a steady
                         supply of drugs, vaccines, bednets, equipment; (vi) purchase of ambulances, supervision vehicles, motorcycles and bicycles; (vii) trained nurses, midwives, doctors in the field as
                         well as trained people at central level in maternal and child health; and (viii) improved blood collection and security. The project increased access to care by improving the referral
                         system via radio and ambulances, with the service being free for the pregnant women. The project also financed annual work plan at health center level and at district level. In

                         addition to conducting studies on human resources, the project financed the recruitment of 490 nurses to address the shortage of midwives in the project zone. Regarding health
                         services quality, an emphasis has been put on nosocomial infection, prevention in health centers. For MURIGAS (community pooled insurance) since all health matters related to
                         pregnancy became free, the project organized a health forum on mutual and signed contracts with 4 NGOs specialized in Mutual to create or reactivated the old health mutuals. On
