Project for Guinea was judged to be\n            moderately satisfactory.  The Bank and borrower performance\n            were moderately satisfactory. The risk to development\n            outcome was high. Significant changes included restructuring\n            of the project, and amending the Development Credit\n            Agreement to: (i) eliminate counterpart financing  and\n            reallocate the proceeds; and (ii) revise the closing date of\n            the project.  Several lessons were learned. Project design\n            must balance a range of considerations. These include the\n            desired outcomes, the financing instrument, and the\n            implementation arrangements. Risk assessment is an essential\n            aspect of project design. While overall risk was rated as\n            high, the components of this rating were underestimated and\n            the mitigation measures were insufficient. Where ministry\n            leadership is inadequate, other champions must be found to\n            advance the project's objectives. The Bank's\n            comparative advantages need to be recognized and exploited.\n            There is a need to temper expectations that a single health\n            project can impact the entire health sector. While a single\n            project financed by the Bank may be a necessary condition\n            for sectoral change, it is not sufficient without greater\n            political leadership and financial commitment from the\n            Guinean authorities. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) can\n            be improved throughout the project. Though the general\n            prescription is that M&E systems, including arrangements\n            for collecting and analyzing data, should be established\n            prior to project launch, Guinea shows that projects can\n            recover from inadequate M&E design and early\n            implementation weaknesses."}, "docdt": "2014-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
