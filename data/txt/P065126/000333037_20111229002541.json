The changes are as follows: (i) a revision\n            of Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and related\n            indicators; (ii) a streamlining of project activities; (iii)\n            a revision of institutional arrangements; (iv) a\n            reallocation of credit proceeds; and (v) an extension of the\n            closing date. The expected outcome of the restructuring will\n            be a more effective project implementation resulting in an\n            improvement in mother and child health services in the 18\n            poorest districts of Guinea and 16 health centers in the\n            poorest peri-urban areas of Conakry, leading eventually to\n            reductions in maternal and child mortality and improvements\n            in health status."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
