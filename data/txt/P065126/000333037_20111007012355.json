This extension is needed to provide\n            sufficient time for the task team to finalize a level 1\n            restructuring with the Government.  The changes which will\n            be included in this restructuring are as follows: (i) a\n            revision of Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and\n            related indicators; (ii) a streamlining of project\n            activities; (iii) a revision of institutional arrangements;\n            (iv) a reallocation of credit proceeds; and (v) a further\n            extension of the closing date to December 31, 2013.  The\n            short extension in the closing date requested in this paper\n            will allow this process to continue and the restructuring\n            package to be finalized."}, "docdt": "2011-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
