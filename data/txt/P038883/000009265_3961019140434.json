scale enterprises in\n            Argentina and to improve the performance of export-related\n            public agencies, thus facilitating export growth. The\n            project will help firms to become more internationally\n            competitive through three avenues: 1) the project will help\n            increase awareness among entrepreneurs about export\n            opportunities through the provision of basic information\n            about foreign markets and profitable export strategies; 2)\n            the project will prompt a limited number of enterprises to\n            invest their own resources in productivity improvements and\n            export development expenditures through the incentive of a\n            one-time grant to share these costs; and 3) the project will\n            help to improve the performance of agencies providing\n            quality control and certification services. The project will\n            also facilitate export growth by supporting the\n            simplification and reduction of export procedures. It will\n            have two main components: 1) an enterprise assistance\n            program to develop export competencies in the private sector\n            in manufacturing and service industries; and 2) an\n            institutional strengthening to help improve the performance\n            of export-related public agencies."}, "docdt": "1995-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
