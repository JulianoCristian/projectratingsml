Key lessons show high\n            responsiveness to the export program by the small and medium\n            enterprises (SMEs), particularly regarding competitiveness\n            improvement mechanisms. Nonetheless, and although the\n            project tried to reduce the financial burden on the SMEs by\n            allowing partial grant payments, as required by exporting\n            practices, matching program grants can be hindered by lack\n            of access to credit by the SMEs to finance export consulting\n            contracts, or to implement the recommended changes. It is\n            thus suggested that export plans may be divided into stages,\n            or modules so as to provide frequent reimbursement to\n            enterprises, reduce their financial burden, and allow in\n            turn, the introduction of experienced export changes,\n            provided greater export credit accessibility is explored\n            through financial institutions in the country. Apparent\n            difficulties resulted from the use of a private management\n            service contract managing a Government program, since in the\n            context of Argentina, delegation of administrative authority\n            to a private operator, limits its role to that of ex-post\n            performance evaluator, exacerbated by the many approval\n            conditions required for replenishment of revolving funds.\n            Hence, delimitation of respective roles, specific\n            information requirements, and the use of performance\n            incentives should be ensured, under review by an external panel."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
