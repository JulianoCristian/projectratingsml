1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

   1. In the y ears prior t o the pr oject p reparation, the M oroccan economy w as s lowly
      recovering f rom a l ong period of w eak e conomic growth i n the late 90s , w hen t he
      country's pr edominantly agricultural economy w as h it by a pe riod of extreme drought
      and t he industrial out puts were stagnant. The economy experienced a f aster g rowth
      during 2000- 2004, thanks t o i mproved agricultural r evenues and increased tourism.
      Despite t hese challenges, the e ducation sector remained an i mportant priority for the
      government, with 6.6 percent of GDP allocated to the sector. The government declared
      the period of 2000-2009 as the decade for education and training.

   2. Adopted in 1999, the National Education and Training Charter outlined the government's
      education s ector s trategy, which, a mong ot her ob jectives, c alled f or uni versal primary
      education by 2007, i mproved system efficiency, better education quality, and improved
      access t o s chools. B y 2 005, M orocco ha d e xperienced s ignificant a chievements i n
      education, particularly for primary education, which was extended to almost all children
      of that age. T he national net enrollment rate for primary education increased from 52.4
      percent (1990-1991) to 92 percent (2003-2004). Over the same period, net enrollment in
      middle s chool increased from 17.5 pe rcent t o 3 2 percent, and in uppe r s econdary
      education from 6 percent to almost 15 percent.

   3. Despite t his pr ogress, how ever, the s ector w as facing many c hallenges, i ncluding high
      internal i nefficiency, a s evidenced by high dropout and repetition rates, and gender and
      geographical di sparities. The demand f or pos t-primary e ducation was a lso growing,
      while the government ha d l imited fiscal s pace for expanding i ts a lready l arge
      expenditures f or the sector. I n or der t o address t hese issues, in F ebruary 2 004 t he
      Government de veloped a S trategic F ramework f or t he D evelopment of t he E ducation
      Sector (SFDES), which presented policy directions and strategies of the education sector
      for the s econd phase of the education reform between 2004 a nd 2009. F ocused on pr e-
      university education, the SFDES had the following main objectives: (i) increasing access
      to basic education; ( ii) i mproving quality of e ducation; (iii) r einforcing i nstitutional
      capacity, and (iv) ensuring fiscal sustainability.

   4. The implementation of the SFDES was supported by a number of development partners,
      including the World Bank's PARSEM project. The rationale for the Bank involvement
      was b ased o n: (i) t he B ank's s ubstantial ex perience with l arge-scale ed ucation r eform
      programs a nd i ts ability t o i dentify be st practices i n o ther c ountries w ith s imilar
      development challenges that could inform the reform process in Morocco; (ii) the Bank's
      ability to he lp s trengthen t he l ink be tween e ducation r eform, macro-economic stability,
      and the de velopment o f other s ectors, such as agriculture, he alth, w ater, i nfrastructure,
      legal, and social p rotection; a nd ( iii) t he B ank's c ontinuous support t o t he Moroccan
      education sector since the 1960s, and commitment and trust built with the Government.
      The P ARSEM w as de signed t o be f inanced jointly by the World B ank a nd t he
      Government of Morocco.

   5. The 2004 CAS for Morocco also clearly spelled out the Bank support for decentralization
      and education sector reform in the country. Strong emphasis was placed on social sector



                                                 1
       reform and education w as i ndicated a s one of t he p illars of s ocial de velopment. The
       Bank's s upport f or the implementation of the National E ducation and Training Charter
       was a lso included i n the CAS. By s upporting t he G overnment's sector-wide reform
       program, t he Bank also aimed to: ( i) contribute to i mproving t he education s ystem's
       capacity t o better a ddress t he demands o f a changing s ociety; ( ii) s trengthen t he
       individual's c apacity t o e xercise h is or h er f reedom v ia i mproved a ccess t o qua lity
       education, and (iii) contribute to poverty reduction via improved productivity of workers,
       particularly women.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

   6. The principal objective of PARSEM was to support Government efforts to provide basic
      education of i mproving q uality t o a ll c hildren a ges s ix t o f ourteen i n a f inancially
      sustainable m anner. T o m eet t his ob jective, PARSEM w ould c ontribute to t he
      establishment of practices, mechanisms, and approaches to improve the education system
      on an ongoing basis.

   7. The ope ration w as m onitored v ia p erformance indicators a nd monitoring i ndicators.
      Performance indicators were u sed to f ollow t he a nnual p rogress of basic education
      development by t racking e nrollment, repetition, retention, and c ompletion r ates,
      desegregated by g ender a nd r egion ( urban a nd rural). P erformance i ndicators were not
      directly linked to disbursements and served rather to monitor the overall progress towards
      achieving the objectives of the Charter. They are also used to track the PDO indicators.

   8. T he Monitoring indicators were identified as critical steps required toward achieving the
       overall targets of PARSEM and they were linked to actions and activities that introduce
       new practices or have significant long-term impact on t he development of the education
       system. Monitoring indicators were planned to be established on the basis of the DEN's
       Annual Work Plans and served as benchmarks for disbursements of the loan. They are
       also used to track the project's intermediate outcome indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

   9. The project objectives and indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

   10. The project was designed to support the Government's efforts in promoting education to
       meet the objectives of National Education and Training Charter. The direct beneficiaries
       would include the central government, t he m inistry i n c harge o f ba sic e ducation, t he
       regional educational academies, provincial and local education departments.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

   11. Based on the G overnment r equest, the W orld B ank w as e xpected to s upport the
       implementation of PARSEM via two consecutive loans, each for an amount equivalent to
       US$80 million. The first Bank operation (Loan No. 7273-MO, US$80 million) supported
       the f irst t hree y ears of the i mplementation of P ARSEM ( an e stimated bud get of
       US$150.55 million).



                                                 2
   12. PARSEM had three components:

           ·   Generalize basic education [estimated cost: US$95.87 million]: This
               component's objective was to ensure that basic education would be available to
               most s chool-age c hildren by 2008. I ts ov erall s trategy w as t o increase the
               provision of schooling i n a c ost-effective m anner by us ing ne w c onstruction
               norms. It would a lso f und pr ovisions o f s ocial s ervices (boarding facilities,
               school transport, etc) for under-served s tudents by pr omoting pa rtnerships w ith
               local stakeholders. Demand would also be strengthened t hrough t he promotion
               of pre-school education.

           ·   Improve the quality of education [estimated cost: US$42.53 million]: The
               objective of this component was to improve student learning and reduce dropout
               and repetition rates. The principal strategy implemented through this component
               was t o establish t he ca pacity n ecessary t o ensure ongoing i mprovements i n the
               quality o f e ducation: systematic assessment of st udent achievement, c ost-
               effective i n-service t eacher t raining an d teacher support se rvices, setting an d
               using quality standards to promote and monitor school efforts to improve quality,
               and t he development of a r egularly pr ogrammed research agenda for t he
               development of quality enhancement innovations.

           ·   Build institutional capacity [estimated cost: US$12.16 million]: This component
               would s upport the s ector's de centralization pr ocess a t t he c entral, regional,
               provincial, a nd local levels through capacity bui lding. I t would a lso introduce
               two i nnovations. First, i t w ould help implement t he g overnment-wide publ ic
               administration reform w ithin t he e ducation s ector, t hrough pr ogram budg eting
               and personnel deployment based on standard job descriptions. Second, it would
               improve key s ystems ( procurement, f inancial m anagement, e nvironment, a nd
               social protection) for g reater a ccountability, t ransparency, e fficiency, a nd
               performance.

1.6 Revised Components

   13. The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

   14. The original closing date for the loan (June 30, 2008) was extended twice (December 31,
       2008, a nd June 30, 2 009) t o a llow m ore time f or the G overnment to c omplete the
       implementation of policy measures identified in the project.

15. Soundness of the background analysis. The background analysis supporting the operation
    was s olid and b ased on t he pr iorities set by the Government in the National E ducation
    and Training Charter (1999) and the measures proposed in the Strategic Framework for
    the D evelopment o f the E ducation S ector ( 2004). T he pol icy directions and strategies
    adopted f or P ARSEM w ere ba sed on the lessons l earned f rom t he G overnment's
    experience of implementing t he first phase of t he C harter. F urthermore, t he operation
    preparation d rew l essons from previous B ank operations in the education s ector in
    Morocco, na mely the ne ed f or: ( i) p romoting de centralization t o a ccelerate

    education; (iii) m aintaining a ba lance b etween bu ilding i nfrastructure a nd improving
    education quality, a nd (iv) matching t he implementation capacity of executing agencies
    and the p roject de sign. Based o n t hese l essons, the Bank i ntended to: ( i) support
    Government in itiatives t o d ecentralize e ducation s ector r esponsibilities to r egional,
    provincial, and local levels; (ii) encourage local stakeholders to become more involved in
    the provision of school services; (iii) limit civil works in order to strike a better balance
    between a ccess and quality of education; and (iv) us e t he existing capacities of AREFs
    and DEN, which, at the time of the project preparation, the Bank assessed as adequate to
    monitor and implement program activities.

16. Assessment of the project design. The project design was complex and involved a large
    number of central and decentralized structures in the education sector. This complexity
    of de sign w as due t o t he nature of t he p roject, w hich w as ba sed on a s ector w ide
    approach, requiring a large number of actors involved in implementation, new processes
    put in place to manage the decentralized nature of activities, etc. There were, however,
    several a spects o f q uality o f e ntry t hat were n ot met, including p articipation o f t he
    AREFs i n t he design, a ction pl ans, and implementation pr ocedures, a nd de tailed
    assessments of the capacity of decentralized structures to implement the project activities.
    In addition, the PARSEM goals were ambitious, its end-of-project indicators were often
    not realistic and there were no clearly defined strategies to achieve those high targets.

17. The project's use of the results/report-based disbursement method for an investment loan
    was innovative and its reliance on the national capacities to implement the project was
    also a positive element. Disbursements for the project activities were to be made to the
    Government budg et, us ing the country budg etary s ystem and procedures. The
    implementation process was planned to be reviewed each year and the funds were to be
    disbursed annually subject to satisfactory completion of the agreed actions and activities.
    The P ARSEM w as also d esigned to be implemented by t he M EN w ithout creating a
    separate implementation unit.

18. The concept of SWAp was ill-defined. PARSEM was the first Bank SWAp operation in
    Morocco, and in the MENA region overall. During the project preparation the Bank team
    faced many challenges in using the new approach due to a lack of clarity of the SWAp
    concept both within the Bank and within the Government. The main issue had to do with
    the us e of country f iduciary a nd s afeguards s ystems i n a S WAp ope ration. T he
    Government i nterpretation was that a S WAp is i mplemented entirely us ing country
    systems, while the Bank team expected this to be the case only if the specific government
    procedures provide an equivalent level of fiduciary risk as that expected using the Bank's
    procedures. I n all o ther cases, t he B ank pr ocedures f or traditional investment loans
    would apply. While the final agreement accepted the Bank approach, the issue remained
    sensitive t hroughout t he project l ife. This difficulty could ha ve b een avoided o r



                                              4
       minimized ha d the B ank team r aised t he issue earlier in project pr eparation, e specially
       with high-level decision makers who were part of the negotiating team.

   19. Adequacy of G overnment's c ommitment. As th e main fi nancier o f P ARSEM, th e
       Government's commitment to the pr ogram w as s trong. T he operation w as built a round
       the Government's main priorities for basic education and the proposed project activities
       were endorsed at the highest levels.

   20. Assessment of risks. The critical risks t oward meeting pr ogram de velopment objectives
       were i dentified as: ( i) unbalanced implementation due t o a possible prioritization of
       access to education a t t he e xpense of t he ne ed t o i mprove quality and the i nstitutional
       capacity; (ii) weak capacities of the newly decentralized education system to implement a
       rather complex program, and (iii) lack of government resources to implement PARSEM.
       Arising from components to outputs, there were also additional risks identified related to
       several program components.

   21. Among the risks identified during the project preparation, the issue of weak capacity of
       the AREFs t o i mplement rather a mbitious and c omplex a ctivities of t he P ARSEM
       became a major obstacle during t he program implementation. This w as pa rticularly
       evident w ith re gard t o f iduciary a nd s afeguard r equirements, as the re cently created
       AREFs did not have enough qualified personnel to comply with the Bank requirements
       on procurement and financial management. The project had envisaged strengthening the
       capacity of the A REF t o meet s uch requirements a nd indeed m any training workshops
       were organized, especially in the areas of fiduciary management. However, these efforts
       were not sufficient to meet the needs and expectations of the key stakeholders.

2.2 Implementation

   22. The implementation of PARSEM was mainstreamed and carried out using the national
       capacities. The DEN had overall accountability for meeting the objectives set out in the
       Strategic F ramework, providing oversight, monitoring a nd e valuation, and t echnical
       support to the AREFs. D EN d irectorates w ere r esponsible for their r espective areas of
       expertise for pr ogram i mplementation. I n pa rticular, the D irectorate o f Strategy,
       Statistics a nd P lanning (DSSP) s erved a s an ov erall c oordinator f or t he Strategic
       Framework, a nd t hus the P ARSEM. In line w ith t heir g eneral responsibilities, t he
       AREFs w ere a lso in c harge of implementing most of t he a ctivities described i n the
       Strategic Framework, such as construction, equipment, and partnership agreements. The
       DEN, t hrough r elevant directorates, was also r esponsible f or i mplementing most of t he
       institutional capacity building activities of the Strategic Framework. While relying on the
       national s ectoral capacities was a po sitive element f or the pr oject d esign, on the other
       hand, the lack of a clearly designated unit responsible for the overall implementation of
       the project proved to be an additional challenge (see next section).

   23. The project closing date was extended twice to allow the Government more time to
       implement actions and activities planned under PARSEM. The majority of the activities
       planned unde r P ARSEM w ere i mplemented a nd h elped a chieve t he pr oject o bjectives
       (Annex 2) . T he delays in i mplementing some studies a nd r eforms were partially
       contributed to the fact the Ministry w as de eply i nvolved in t he p reparation of the
       Education Emergency P lan requested by t he G overnment. The B ank management
       reviewed and granted the two closing date extensions in order to give sufficient time to



                                                 5
       complete some of the ongoing reforms and to provide a bridge for the preparation of the
       second Bank operation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

   24. PARSEM had a relatively w ell-developed r esults-based f ramework to monitor progress
       of t he e ducation reform program through P erformance a nd Monitoring i ndicators.
       Performance i ndicators t rack the o verall p rogress of t he ed ucation sec tor, whereas
       monitoring i ndicators t rack r eform pr ogram implementation. The D SSP ha d t he
       responsibility f or m onitoring the implementation of t he Strategic Framework a nd
       coordinating with other directorates and the AREFs responsible for specific actions and
       activities. D irectorates a nd A REFs re sponsible f or th e i mplementation of specific
       activities t hen p rovided updates on Monitoring indicators to t he D SSP, w hich
       consolidated the information r eceived f rom t he d irectorates and A REFs, s ynthesized
       findings, a nd submitted progress r eports to the Bank. T he B ank a nd D EN c arried out
       semi-annual reviews to monitor the program implementation.

   25. Data on the PARSEM performance indicators were collected on a regular basis. The
       DSSP has built good capacity to collect, process, and analyze data related to educational
       outcomes. Published annually, the education yearbook covers statistics on a wide range
       of i ndicators. H owever, there w ere certain delays in c ollecting da ta on PARSEM
       monitoring i ndicators. The design of t he pr oject required i nteraction and information
       sharing among a large number of central and decentralized structures. W hile the DSSP
       played a key role in the process, it had to rely on the information coming from different
       sectoral departments as well as from the AREFs. A s mentioned earlier, the capacity of
       AREFs t o f urnish ne cessary da ta r emained l imited throughout t he pr oject c ycle a nd
       resulted i n delays f or program r eporting. T his r esulted in delays in the pr eparation of
       project p rogress r eports. T he w eak c oordination a nd c hange i n l eadership w ithin the
       DSSP also contributed to lower effectiveness and generated delays.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

   26. Safeguard measures were included in the project design, but the Bank and Government
       teams did not comply due to poor interpretation, application and monitoring of these
       measures. The Bank and the Government differed in their interpretation and application
       of a clause in the Legal Agreement that stipulated that all construction activities under the
       project should t ake pl ace on land owned by t he B orrower and no resettlement of l ocal
       population should take place. The Government interpretation was that it could purchase
       land provided that there was no phy sical resettlement. T his resulted in the Government
       acquiring new land for construction and building up the arrears to land owners, an issue
       that is common in many sectors in Morocco. According to the project design, during the
       first y ear o f implementation the Ministry was supposed t o c reate a database for
       monitoring issues related to land acquisition, but this was not done.

   27. The implementation capacity of AREFs was weak to comply with Bank fiduciary
       requirements. The project design gave t he A REFs a l eading ro le in p roject
       implementation, i ncluding fiduciary compliance, b ut the r egional academies lacked t he
       capacity to adequately meet these requirements and the project did not provide sufficient
       training to s ignificantly im prove s uch c apacities. The n ewly cr eated A REFs sh ow
       evidence of limited capacity in managing their budgets i n general a nd i n carrying out



                                                6
       procurement i n particular. I n mid-2008, i n a n effort to b etter understand reported
       difficulties encountered by A REFs i n a pplying PARSEM pr ocedures, a M EN working
       group v isited six A REFs with a que stionnaire a nd issued a n internal report that
       recommended: ( i) developing an operational manual for t he use of r egional budget; ( ii)
       providing a dditional t raining on t o A REF f iduciary s taff; ( iii) improving information
       sharing between central and decentralized structures; and (iv) developing an information
       management s ystem t o improve financial m anagement. The implementation of t hese
       recommendations w ould b e c ritical for the success of t he E ducation Emergency P lan
       (EEP) and the Bank's new operation.

   28. Disbursements were slow due to delays in project implementation as well as in data
       collection and reporting. Beyond the first initial advance to the special account in April
       2005, there were a total of three disbursements every two years, in June 2005, June 2007,
       and June 2009, accordingly.

   29. Annual audits were carried out annually by the Inspection générale des finances (IGF).
       There were no m ajor irregularities during 2005-07, the three years of Bank financing of
       PARSEM. The 2008 a udit of PARSEM activities, mainly financed by the Government,
       has identified a number of financial management issues, including some expenditures that
       were not properly classified. It would be important to address these irregularities and to
       give proper attention to financial management in future operations.

2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

   30. The Bank will continue supporting the education sector in Morocco via a programmatic
       series of development policy loans (DPL). The decision t o change t he f inancing
       instrument f rom a n i nvestment l oan t o a D PL was ba sed on a r equest f rom t he
       Government to employ a more flexible financing mechanism that would rely fully on the
       use of national systems. This instrument is also in-line with the way other development
       partners finance the EEP implementation.

   31. Currently unde r p reparation, the p roposed three s ingle-tranche D PL would s upport the
       refinement and implementation of the EEP reform agenda, in close collaboration with the
       other donors. The DPL instrument would support essential policy measures and actions
       while r einforcing results-based approaches. The DPL pr ogram i s being de veloped in
       close c oordination with t he G overnment t o e nsure f ull ownership of t he pr ocesses,
       actions and outcomes.

   32. The proposed DPL would help put in place the education reform program and accelerate
       implementation be tween 2010 a nd 2013. The f irst E ducation D evelopment P olicy
       Program ( EDPPO1) w ould support k ey i nitial i nstitutional a nd r egulatory measures a s
       well as the introduction of new approaches to improve service delivery effectiveness and
       efficiency. T he s econd operation ( EDPPO2) w ould support de epening i nstitutional
       reforms a nd s caling up t he pr ogram t o t ackle c ore cross-cutting issues, w hile t he t hird
       operation ( EDPPO3) would aim t o consolidate t he r eform i mplementation, building on
       the results of preliminary effectiveness and impact evaluation studies.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

   1.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation



                                                  7
    33. The project objectives remain highly relevant although too ambitious. M orocco h as
        always a ttached pa rticular i mportance to e ducation and t raining, v iewing t hem a s k ey
        elements of e conomic a nd s ocial de velopment. The c ountry's di verse popul ation
        constitutes a rich human potential and is associated with a strong commitment to unity.
        Implementation of the 2000 National Charter of Education and Training (CNEF) resulted
        in impressive progress in terms of access to education. Efforts to increase the availability
        of educational services and opportunities have led to expanded access to education at all
        levels.

    34. The P ARSEM ob jectives, how ever, were overly a mbitious a nd t he de sign di d not
        adequately t ake this into consideration i n pr eparing t he p rogram, a nd f ailed to link
        activities to the performance indicators. The project did not fully assess the capacity gaps
        and e nsure adequate or ganizational strengthening a nd i t d id no t e nsure a n a ppropriate
        assessment of policy reform implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

    35. The project has mainly achieved its objectives. Although the Bank's contribution to the
        overall e ducation s ector budget w as m odest (less t han 10 pe rcent of t otal a nnual
        spending), the PARSEM activities were well-aligned with the main sector objectives and
        played a n i mportant r ole i n i ncreasing a ccess t o e ducation, pa rticularly i n r ural a reas,
        improving education quality, and promoting decentralization.

         Component 1: Generalize basic education: Moderately Satisfactory.

    36. The project largely succeeded in achieving the objectives of this component. During the
        life o f t he p roject, fo r i nstance, there w ere significant improvements i n e ducation
        outcomes for m iddle s chool, one of the main areas of f ocus by PARSEM1: the n et
        enrollment r ate i ncreased from 32 percent ( 2004) t o 47.4 pe rcent (2008), with 53.9
        percent of rural communities having middle schools in 2008 compared to 39.6 percent in
        2004; the retention rate increased from 71.5 percent (2004) to 79 percent (2008), and the
        end-of-cycle completion rate increased from 43.7 percent (2004) to 53.5 percent (2008).
        Despite this p rogress, h owever, t he a ctual increases w ere less than the i nitial e nd-of-
        project indicator t arget values. I mprovements in primary education were more modest,
        explained partially by t he f act that the s ubsector has reached the plateau and t he
        incremental i ncrease i n primary education out comes requires specific interventions for
        certain vulnerable groups and children with special needs. The project's activities in this
        area also resulted in a significant increase in the number of students receiving assistance
        through social services.

         Component 2: Improve the quality of education: Moderately Unsatisfactory

    37. During the life of the project there was very modest progress made at the national level in
        reducing dr opout and repetition rates, the t wo indicators used to measure the quality of
        education. The project, h owever, was successful in s upporting the de velopment a nd

  The outcome indicators used in the ICR are based on the Ministry of education estimates using the 1994 population
census data and they differ from more recent estimated that use the 2004 population census data. This approach was
adopted to be able to compare the data recorded during the project preparation and implementation.

       Arabic and French. The Moroccan National Education Council's 2008 survey of learning
       achievement poi nts to small gender gaps in mathematics and s cience, but l arge g ender
       gaps i n f avor of g irls i n A rabic a nd F rench. I n a ddition, there a re considerable
       differences between urban and rural areas and between public and private schools.

       Component 3: Build institutional capacity: Moderately Satisfactory

   38. PARSEM activities were instrumental i n supporting the Government effort f or capacity
       building and decentralization in the education sector. Despite the program's shortcoming,
       PARSEM ha d a s trong impact on delegating m ore r esponsibility a nd a ccountability t o
       decentralized s tructures ( AREFs and Delegations) as well as o n pr omoting a s chool-
       based a pproach in sector programming. In 2009, t he AREFs ha ve a m uch stronger
       capacity to independently develop and manage their regional education sector programs
       and t hey ha ve become a n a ctive pl ayer in the na tional dialogue on future education
       reforms.

3.3 Efficiency

   39. At the project preparation stage, the cost of reforms suggested in the Strategic Framework
       was ba sed on : (i) the e ducation sector targets w ith regards to access a nd internal
       efficiency; (ii) an e ducation s ector m odel t o d etermine t he r esources r equired to meet
       these t argets; and (iii) t he impact on the government budget, i ncluding identification of
       the f inancing g ap a nd opt ions t o close t he g ap. T he main indicators us ed f or t he
       simulation model were an annual growth r ate ( assumed t o grow annually at 5 pe rcent),
       the g overnment bu dget a nd t he s hare o f education r ecurrent spending, a nd t argets f or
       access to and efficiency of education (repetition, promoting, and retention). Depending of
       the three scenarios considered f or t he s imulation m odel, this estimation s uggested a
       financial g ap of 21 to 3 6 percent of the recurrent budget, t o be covered i n pa rt by the
       Bank financing provided under PARSEM.

   40. The economic analysis at the project preparation stage did not include a full cost-benefit
       or cost-effectiveness an alysis; t herefore, it is d ifficult t o q uantitatively m easure the
       performance o f i nternal e fficiency in dicators. N evertheless, th e P ARSEM included
       actions t hat were i ntended t o m ake t he reform financially su stainable. Such act ions
       included, a mong ot hers, a m ore e fficient use of pe rsonnel w ith the us e o f po lyvalent
       teachers; m ore ba lanced a llocation of non- salary e xpenditures between s ocial a nd
       pedagogical expenditures; closer monitoring of the teacher/student ratio and its impact on
       expenditures; and optimal use of school infrastructure.

   41. During the i mplementation of P ARSEM, t he m acro level e conomic indicators w ere
       mainly consistent w ith the estimates, with t he Moroccan e conomy growing a t a steady
       rate a nd t he s hare of e ducation budg et r emaining c onstant a nd e ven growing. T he
       internal efficiency, however, failed to meet the targets, as repetition, drop-out, promotion
       and r etention rates ha ve not s ignificantly i mproved dur ing t his p eriod. With t he
       government spending on education rapidly increasing under the EEP (education spending
       at t he r egional l evel, for instance, i s a lmost doubl ing be tween 2009 a nd 20 10), t he
       Government i s e ager t o see i mprovements i n i nternal e fficiency t hrough a ne w s ector
       programming that is based on results and not constrained by the availability of resources.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

    42. The project objectives were highly relevant to the country needs and the project mainly
        reached its objectives. The main education sector outcomes show good progress in the
        areas w here P ARSEM m ade i ts m ain i nterventions, namely in a chieving fu ll primary
        education enrollment, increasing equitable access to middle school, improving quality of
        education, and promoting decentralization. I mpact could have been greater if sufficient
        attention had been paid during design and implementation to processes of implementation
        (how to) and to support, especially at local levels, for capacity building in these "how to"
        areas.

    43. Despite s hortcomings, t he pr ogram pl ayed a n important role i n m aintaining a nd
        furthering r eforms i n the education s ector a nd i ts experience and lessons p rovided a
        bridge to the development of a new education plan (EEP). T he program, however, was
        less successful i n sizably i mproving internal e fficiencies as improvements i n retention,
        repetition and completion rates, particularly in primary education.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

    44. While focusing only on basic education, PARSEM was part of the Bank's overall support
        to the Government i n: (i) increasing access to basic education, literacy and other social
        services, a nd (ii) i mproving t he quality and effectiveness of service delivery. Together
        with other Bank p rojects i n t he s ocial sectors, P ARSEM c ontributed to t he objective of
        increasing a ccess to basic s ervices a nd promoting pa rticipatory a pproaches a nd
        partnership arrangements. The experience of PARSEM has been critical for the on-going
        preparation of t he f irst D PL i n t he h uman de velopment sector i n Morocco, the second
        phase of the Bank's support to the Government to implement the 1999 CNEF.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

    45. Policies a nd interventions supported by PARSEM were largely pr o-poor and p romoted
        gender- and geography-based equity. During the project life, for instance, at the middle
        school l evel the g irls' n et e nrollment r ate increased f rom 31.2% to 46.8% a nd t heir
        repetition rate decreased from 15.5% to 12.7%. The operation also focused on improving
        physical a nd f inancial a ccessibility of ba sic e ducation to all school-aged children in a n
        equitable m anner. It a lso c ontributed t o i mproving t he inclusiveness of the ov erall
        country's economic and social development by providing access, through education, for
        the poor and the marginalized to reap the benefits of economic opportunities. The project
        placed much e mphasis on the e xecution of s upply- a nd de mand-side i nterventions t o
        narrow t he g ap be tween lagging and l eading g eographical regions (especially b etween
        urban, rural and peri-urban areas), as well as between girls and boys. There was a large
        increase i n t he number of s tudents, particularly girls, r eceiving different t ypes of s ocial
        assistance, such as scholarships, transport, and school lodging.

(b) Institutional Change / Strengthening

    46. PARSEM made an important contribution in promoting decentralization in the education
        sector in Morocco an d v ia i ts activities h elped to improve t he capacity o f AREFs and


                                                  10
       Delegations t o implement a variety of s ector r eforms. The school-based project
       programming was also an i mportant m echanism f or delegating r esponsibilities t o the
       school level. Capacities of decentralized structures, however, remain weak and the Bank
       and the Government ha ve a greed to c ontinue working t ogether to strengthen t hese
       capacities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

   47. Lessons l earned from P ARSEM ha ve be en i ntegrated i n t he G overnment's E ducation
       Emergency Plan, a strategic sector document that has been put in place to accelerate the
       implementation of the Education and Training Charter. The EEP has four main axes: (i)
       provision o f m andatory e ducation t ill the a ge o f 15; (ii) pr omoting i nitiative a nd
       excellence in s econdary a nd hi gher education; (iii) s trengthening m anagement a t a ll
       education levels; a nd ( iv) s ector financing. I mproving qua lity of education and
       promoting results-based sector performance are also important priorities in the Plan.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

   48. There were no beneficiary surveys or stakeholder workshops conducted for this ICR.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

   49. The Government is committed to further reforms in the education sector and it has
       significantly increased its budget for the sector. The political w ill for the re forms
       remains high at all levels, with the highest level authority actively involved in setting the
       country's long-term e ducation v ision focused on improved quality e ducation. Despite
       overall slowdown in t he world e conomy due to the c urrent f inancial c risis, t he
       macroeconomic prospects for Morocco r emain p ositive a nd t he c ountry's economy i s
       expected to maintain its healthy growth in the coming years. I n addition to maintaining
       high-level spending on e ducation, reaching the ambitious education goals set in the EEP
       would a lso r equire that t he G overnment bui ld consensus among a ll s takeholders a nd

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

   50. The B ank pe rformance i n ensuring qua lity a t entry is r ated Moderately Unsatisfactory
       due to the issues related to project preparation and its design. The ambiguity on the use
       of c ountry f iduciary a nd safeguard s ystems unde r a S WAp w as not r esolved unt il t he
       project negotiations and the issue remained thorny and had a negative impact throughout
       the project life on the quality of dialogue between the Bank and t he Government. T he

       project was complex, its indicator targets were often not realistic, and the risk mitigation
       measures concerning the new decentralized structures were not solid.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   51. The Bank qua lity of supervision i s rated Moderately Satisfactory. Supervision missions
       and annual reviews were carried out on a regular basis, and the Bank team was proactive
       in p roviding g uidance and support to the Government in the p roject i mplementation.
       However, the team perhaps focused too narrowly on fiduciary issues (where, it is evident
       that t he capacity of de centralized s tructures w as pa rticularly l ow), whereas the
       complexity of the project called for a broader focus that would include a greater emphasis
       on the technical aspects of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   52. O verall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory due to the Bank team efforts
       in pr oviding good s upport t o t he G overnment i n t he i mplementation of P ARSEM, a n
       innovative, a lthough c omplex, S WAp-based e ducation p roject. The B ank t eam a lso
       played a n important role i n s upporting t he MEN t o develop i ts E ducation E mergency
       Plan (EEP), pa rticularly on i ssues r elated t o i mproving qua lity of education and
       effectiveness of public expenditures, which would be supported by the Bank's follow-up
       operation. The Bank's active role in donor harmonization in the context of preparing the
       follow-up operation to support the EEP implementation was particularly successful.


5.2 Borrower Performance

       (a) Government Performance

       Rating: Satisfactory

   53. T he G overnment remained committed t o the reforms out lined in PARSEM, w itnessed,
       for instance, by its willingness and flexibility to accept and adopt World Bank fiduciary
       and safeguard po licies to i mplement the program. T he G overnment ha s also b een
       proactive i n terms of a ssessing t he implementation of t he e ducation C harter a nd
       developing a new education action plan (EEP) to accelerate reforms in the sector.

       (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   54. The M inistry in c harge of education faced c hallenges in implementing s uch a c omplex
       sector wide program within its relatively newly decentralized structure. Despite this, the
       authorities made much effort and largely succeeded in training the Ministry's central and
       decentralized s taff t o understand a nd a pply t he B ank f iduciary a nd s afeguard policies.
       The Ministry, how ever, w as less s uccessful in p utting i n pl ace an e fficient monitoring

       and evaluation system to collect and analyze data and information on PARSEM activities
       in a timely manner.

       (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   55. T he Borrower's o verall p erformance is rated Moderately Satisfactory ba sed on t he
       following factors:

       - Government performance is Satisfactory
       - Implementing Agency performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

   56. PARSEM experience provides the following important lessons:

   ·   The c oncept o f S WAP should be m ore clearly de fined to avoid c onfusion a nd
       misinterpretation both by the Bank and Government teams.

   ·   The project design should be realistic in terms of the ability of the different agencies to
       implement r eforms, a nd c apacity de velopment s hould be pr ovided on a regular a nd
       permanent basis. The effective implementation of some reforms requires time, especially
       in t he h uman de velopment s ectors. I t i s i mportant t o t ake into c onsideration the t ime
       required t o bui ld up executing a gencies' c apacity w hen preparing the reform
       implementation plan, especially when the agencies are in the process of being developed.

   ·   Project p reparation s hould i nclude representatives of a ll s tructures involved i n t he
       operation, central and decentralized, to better inform preparation and implementation of
       the project. O n the other hand, key issues related to project design and implementation
       should be brought early to the attention of high-level policy makers to avoid delays at the
       project negotiation stage.

   ·   Communication c hannels a mong various a ctors ( central, regional, p rovincial, and
       schools) should be maintained throughout the life of the project, not just at its launch, and
       mechanism should be established to foster this communication.

   ·   More efforts s hould be made t o h armonize na tional a nd Bank f iduciary a nd s afeguard
       policies at the country level so that the policy dialogue can be more focused on substance
       and less on procedures and processing.

   ·   Bank supervision m ission should no t be limited to f ollow-up meetings w ith the c entral
       authorities, bu t s hould a lso i nclude r egular interactions w ith a nd s upport t o t he
       decentralized l evels. H aving a s ector sp ecialist in the country o ffice i s c ritical f or
       maintaining regular policy dialogue with the Government.

   ·   The role of pr oject i mplementation m anuals s hould not be unde restimated a s t hey a re
       most often the first a nd main document t o guide project i mplementation, especially for
       decentralized units and a gencies. M anuals should be updated f requently a nd translated
       into the national language.

  The outcome indicators used in the ICR are based on the Ministry of education estimates using the 1994 population
census data and they differ from more recent estimated that use the 2004 population census data. This approach was
adopted to be able to compare the data recorded during the project preparation and implementation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The financial a nalysis c arried ou t a t t he t ime of pr oject pr eparation concluded that the s ector
goals of the Strategic Framework and the Education Charter were financially sustainable over the
long t erm, w ith a temporary s pike of a dditional r esource requirements e xpected over t he n ext
decade. The e stimations s howed that d emand f or ba sic a nd upp er s econdary e ducation w ould
peak i n five a nd t en y ears a fter t he P ARSEM launch, w hich l ed to t he a ssumption t hat t here
would be a shift of some resources from primary to middle to upper secondary school over that
period. N evertheless, the financial si mulations p redicted at that t ime an o verall f inancing gap
averaging 12 percent of the education expenditure annually ov er t he ten years f ollowing t he
project commencement. The simulations assumed an average economic growth rate of 5 percent
and held education spending as a proportion of government spending constant.

To help ease the budget pressure, the Strategic Framework included several measures and actions
aimed at improving sector efficiency, such as (i) increasing the average number of hours taught
by middle a nd upp er s econdary s chool t eachers to o fficially s anctioned l evels and i ntroducing
polyvalent teachers who can teach more than one discipline, and (ii) limiting the growth of non-
salary e xpenditures allocated t eachers a nd s tudents social s ervices (housing subsidies, boarding
facilities, e tc.) for the savings to be reallocated t o f inance i mprovements i n the qua lity o f
education (e.g., teacher in-service training and school grants).

The p roject estimates, nevertheless, p redicted that o n t he i nvestment si de a considerable g ap
could r emain as t he government a ttempts t o m eet t argets t o i ncrease s chool e nrollment. T he
PARSEM w ould finance a s tudy on c onstruction norms dur ing t he f irst year of the program t o
determine whether more cost effective approaches could be adopted to reduce the overall cost of
building schools. Additionally, it was projected that using partnerships grants to local entities to
establish a nd r un boa rding f acilities f or m iddle a nd uppe r secondary s chool s tudents w ould
decrease overall sector investment needs.

The implementation of PARSEM and the analysis carried out in preparation of the EEP showed
that e nsuring the f inancial s ustainability of school e xpansion a nd s trengthening t he ov erall
sector's governance remain c hallenging. E xpanding e ducation has exerted t remendous f inancial
pressure on Morocco's n ational budget. P ublic expenditure i n t he education sector h as b een
below 5 percent of GDP on average and around 20 percent of the national budget over the past
five years. Between 2004 and 2008, the nominal amount of public spending increased faster that
the GDP growth, but the share of education as part of GDP and total government budget declined
(Table 1). The overly large amount of education expenditure reflects problems with technical and
financial e fficiency a nd t he r elatively hi gh bur den o f s alary e xpenditures on t he s ystem. T his
structural e lement calls for pa rticular attention to be pa id t o t he qua lity of management and
allocation of human resources within the Moroccan education system.

Lower and upper secondary education absorbs nearly half of the education sector budget, with no
major c hanges i n t he c omposition of e ducation s pending by s chool l evel in the past f ive y ears
(Table 2). The decline in primary student enrollment, following the demographic shift, provides
favorable conditions for a reallocation of r esources to support e xpansion of ot her levels o f the
education system. Ensuring a greater accountability for education outcome improvements by the
various actors remains a challenge. It is critical that resource reallocation be made in an effective
manner to avoid compromising the system's financial sustainability. The unit operating cost for
secondary education is substantially higher than that for primary education, and it is about twice
as hi gh per student a s in other countries in t he region. T he high cost of secondary education is
explained by the allocation of human resources, with low student/teacher ratios compounded by a
high ratio of administrative staff (nearly three administrative workers for every ten teachers).
