Some lessons learned included:\n            the project design should be realistic in terms of the\n            ability of the different agencies to implement reforms, and\n            capacity development should be provided on a regular and\n            permanent basis. The effective implementation of some\n            reforms requires time, especially in the human development\n            sectors. It is important to take into consideration the time\n            required to build up executing agencies' capacity when\n            preparing the reform implementation plan, especially when\n            the agencies are in the process of being developed.\n            Communication channels among various actors (central,\n            regional, provincial, and schools) should be maintained\n            throughout the life of the project, not just at its launch,\n            and mechanism should be established to foster this\n            communication. More efforts should be made to harmonize\n            national and Bank fiduciary and safeguard policies at the\n            country level so that the policy dialogue can be more\n            focused on substance and less on procedures and processing.\n            The role of project implementation manuals should not be\n            underestimated as they are most often the first and main\n            document to guide project implementation, especially for\n            decentralized units and agencies.
