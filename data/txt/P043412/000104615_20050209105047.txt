Country and Sector Background / Contexte sectoriel du pays 
Morocco’s education system has shown remarkable progress despite adverse economic 
conditions.  The country underwent a period of economic stagnation in the late 1990s and the 
early 2000s as a result of extreme drought that negatively affected a predominantly agricultural 
economy (with average GDP growth rates of 2.5 percent during the 1990s).  Despite these 
challenges, education has been extended to almost all children at the primary level.
1
The 
national net enrollment rate for primary education increased from 52.4 percent (1990-1991) to 
92.0 percent (2003-2004).  Net enrollment in middle school has increased from 17.5 percent to 
32.0 percent, and in upper secondary education from 6.1 percent to 14.9 percent over the same 
period. 
The future development of the Moroccan formal education system, however, faces many 
new challenges.  Internal inefficiency is high, as evidenced by high dropout and repetition rates 
(see Annex 1).  Gender and geographical disparities remain important at all education levels.  
There is also rapidly growing demand for middle school, as a consequence of successful 
increases in access to primary education.  Budget allocation to the education sector is already 
substantial at 6.6 percent of GDP, limiting the financial margin to expand the system.  In this 
context, the education authorities need to simultaneously manage a complex education system 
and meet increasingly diverse demands while they implement a large-scale education reform. 
1
Formal education consists of three levels of instruction: basic, upper secondary and higher.  Basic education 
includes two sections: primary (grades 1-6) and middle (grades 7-9).

Objectives / Objectifs du projet 
The principal objective of PARSEM is to support Government efforts to provide basic 
education of improving quality to all children ages six to fourteen in a financially sustainable 
manner.  To meet this objective, PARSEM contributes to the establishment of practices, 
mechanisms, and approaches that will improve the education system on an ongoing basis.   
c. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement / Argumentaire en faveur d’une intervention de la 
Banque 
There are three principal reasons for Bank involvement to support education reform in 
Morocco.  First, the Bank has substantial experience with large-scale education reform programs.  
The Bank can identify best practices in other countries with similar development challenges that 
can inform the reform process in Morocco.  Second, as a major development partner, the Bank 
can help strengthen the link between education reform, macro-economic stability, and the 
development of other sectors, such as agriculture, health, water, infrastructure, legal, and social 
protection.  Third, the Bank has provided continuous support to the Moroccan education sector 
since the 1960s.  Many years of collaboration between the Government and the Bank have built 
commitment and trust.  For these reasons, the Government of Morocco (GoM) requested the 
Bank to provide technical and financial support for their education reform, in the specific area of 
basic education.   
Moreover, Bank support for decentralization and education sector reform is clearly 
spelled out in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).  Strong emphasis is placed on social sector 
reform, and education is indicated as one of the pillars of social development.  There is a strong 
link between illiteracy and poverty, and the availability of quality education will be critical for 
decreasing the poverty rate in Morocco.  Higher primary education attainment levels are 
positively correlated with less poverty and improved living standards for the poor, particularly 
for women.  The CAS also emphasizes the importance of community development and 
decentralization to reach the population in extreme poverty, mostly living in rural and peri-urban 
areas.  Finally, the CAS states that the Bank will support the implementation of the National 
Education and Training Charter. 
d. 
Description / Description du projet 
PARSEM adopts a Sector-wide Approach (SWAp) to be implemented as a Sector 
Investment Loan (SIL).  The PARSEM operation supports the implementation of the education 
sector five-year Strategic Framework described above.  It provides financing for those budget 
lines of the Education Ministry and Education regional offices (
academies nationale d’éducation 
et de formation – 
AREF) that fund specific components of the Framework.   
 
The actions to be supported by PARSEM are organized into three components.  
Component One: Generalize basic education [estimated cost: US$ 95.87 million]:
 
This 
component’s objective is to ensure that basic education is available to most school-age children 
by 2008.  Its overall strategy is to increase the provision of schooling in a cost-effective manner 
by using new construction norms.  It also funds provisions of social services (boarding facilities, 
Page  3
school transport, etc) for under-served students by promoting partnerships with local 
stakeholders.  Demand will also be strengthened through the promotion of pre-school education. 
Component Two: Improve the quality of education [estimated cost: US$ 42.53 million]:
The objective of this component is to improve student learning and reduce dropout and repetition 
rates.  The principal strategy implemented through this component is to establish the capacity 
necessary to ensure ongoing improvements in the quality of education: systematic assessment of 
student achievement, cost-effective in-service teacher training and teacher support services, 
setting and using quality standards to promote and monitor school efforts to improve quality, and 
the development of a regularly programmed research agenda for the development of quality 
enhancement innovations. 
Component Three: Build institutional capacity [estimated cost: US$ 12.16 million]:
This 
component supports the sector’s decentralization process at the central, regional, provincial, and 
local levels through capacity building.  It also introduces two innovations.  First, it will help 
implement the government-wide public administration reform within the education sector, 
through program budgeting and personnel deployment based on standard job descriptions.  
Second, it improves key systems (procurement, financial management, environment, and social 
protection) for greater accountability, transparency, efficiency, and performance. 
The following table summarizes PARSEM’s three components and 13 sub-components.

Implementation / Modalités d’exécution du projet 
The DEN is ultimately accountable for meeting the objectives set out in the Strategic 
Framework, providing oversight, monitoring and evaluation, and technical support to the 
AREFs.  Directorates in the DEN are responsible for their respective areas of expertise for 
program implementation.  The Directorate of Strategy, Statistics and Planning (DSSP) serves as 
an overall coordinator for the Strategic Framework, and thus of PARSEM.  In line with their 
general responsibilities, the AREFs will take charge of implementing most of the activities 
described in the Strategic Framework, such as construction, equipment, and partnership 
agreements.  The DEN, through its relevant directorates, is responsible for implementing most of 
the institutional capacity building activities of the Strategic Framework.  
A
Program Operations Manual (POM) will guide implementation.  The POM describes 
guidelines and procedures to successfully carry out Annual Work Plans (AWP).  It defines 
procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.  This 
document also includes action plans for improving procurement and financial management 
capacity within the education sector.  The document will be disseminated to the DEN 
directorates as well as to AREFs before program implementation.  Its contents will be regularly 
revised as institutional capacity improves and program implementation progresses. 
g. 
Sustainability / Pérennité du projet 
The Government’s program is ambitious, and requires significant financial, human and 
institutional resources to succeed.  The government has adopted a number of strategies and 
measures to ensure program sustainability. 
In terms of financial sustainability, the DEN and the Ministry of Finance and 
Privatization (MFP) will establish an annual financing plan for the implementation of the 
Strategic Framework.  This financing plan ensures that sufficient resources are allocated to 
implement programmed activities and to cover their recurrent cost implications.  Budget 
allocation and execution will be closely monitored through the review process described above. 
Furthermore, the Government’s program includes a number of measures that will 
improve the allocative efficiency within the sector, which are reviewed in greater detail in Annex 
9
(e.g., maintaining student-teacher ratios in primary levels, increasing the number of hours 
taught per teacher at middle and upper secondary levels, and using existing infrastructure to meet 
the increasing demand for middle school education in urban areas).  According to the 
Government’s education sector financing strategy, these savings will be re-allocated toward 
recurrent non-salary budget categories that finance education quality actions and inputs, such as 
school operations, teacher support services, and teacher training. 
Page  5
Finally, in line with the Government’s finance sustainability strategy, the Government 
has divided PARSEM into two phases.  Over the first three years, the DEN will establish the 
mechanisms and systems to conduct better sector operations, while beginning to expand capacity 
at the sector.  For the subsequent two years, these approaches will be operationalized and 
generalized.  This operation supports the first phase of PARSEM. 
In terms of institutional sustainability, the Strategic Framework aims to consolidate the 
transfer of responsibilities towards the AREFs, ensuring the deployment of appropriate staff and 
the allocation of needed resources.  Furthermore, AREF and central staff will be provided with 
training as well as technical and material resources.  Finally, the DEN aims to develop new 
mechanisms (e.g., teacher support services, information systems, financial and human resource 
management) that take advantage of the new decentralized structure of the sector.  
h. 
Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country & Sector / Enseignements 
tires des operations antérieures au pays et dans le secteur 
PARSEM builds on the experiences and lessons learned from previous sector operations.  
The following key lessons were raised in Implementation Completion Reports (ICR) of other 
basic education projects: i) decentralization can accelerate implementation; ii) community 
contributions should be promoted; iii) a balanced approach between school construction and 
quality of education is important; and iv) executing agencies capacity should be evaluated prior 
to the beginning of the project. 
In response to these lessons, the following measures were incorporated in the program 
design.  First, PARSEM supports Government initiatives to decentralize education sector 
responsibilities to regional, provincial, and local levels, thus improving implementation capacity.  
Second, the program encourages local stakeholders to become more involved in the provision of 
school services so as to increase access to quality education (e.g., school-based projects and 
partnership agreements).  Third, the program strikes a balance between access and quality of 
education.  Fourth, as part of the project preparation process, the Bank conducted assessments on 
the implementation capacity of the DEN and AREFs.  These assessments indicated that the 
AREFs have the capacity to monitor and implement program activities. 
i. 
Safeguard Policies / Directives en matière de protection des populations vulnérables 
et des ressources naturelles
 
In order to comply with the Bank’s Operational Safeguards Policy relative to 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) was 
conducted for PARSEM during the preparatory phase of the program. This assessment addressed 
environmental as well as social safeguards concerns mainly related to the construction of new 
schools. An Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF) was prepared during this 
assessment process. This details the mitigating as well as monitoring measures that need to be 
carried out during project implementation. It also lists ways to improve capacity of the 
implementing agency(ies). This document also takes into consideration the current institutional 
and regulatory framework in Morocco as applicable and necessary in a Sector-Wide Approach 
(SWAp) operation. 
Page  6
The findings of the ESA are the following: (i) existing construction and functional 
standards, as well as construction monitoring norms do not fully guarantee the safety, health, and 
well-being of students, teachers, and personnel at schools; (ii) there is a lack of adequate 
resources for school maintenance; (iii) the practice of sole-source contracts with architects does 
not guarantee cost-effectiveness of school construction programs; and (iv) there is a sector-wide 
issue of arrears related to payment of land acquired for construction of schools.   
Although existing land acquisition procedures in Morocco are, in general, consistent with 
the corresponding Bank policy, the issue of arrears in payment of compensation is of concern. 
The Involuntary Resettlement policy (OP4.12) was triggered because of the concern stemming 
from delayed payment of compensation for land acquisition although this issue is not specific to 
the education sector. An on-going Bank adjustment operation, the Asset Management Reform 
Loan (AMRL, 4700-MOR), is currently assisting the Government of Morocco to alleviate this 
problem. Measures have been agreed with the Ministry of Education to minimize  shortcomings 
related to compensation payments.  The ESSF includes activities that will help improve the 
capacity for monitoring the progress achieved in this regard. 
Both environmental and social safeguard mitigating and monitoring measures as defined 
in the ESSF have been included in the Program Operations Manual (POM), which will be 
available to all implementing agencies before effectiveness. This manual will constitute a central 
depository of norms and guidelines for the implementation of the government’s program and for 
reporting on program progress.  For example, this manual will define mechanisms for monitoring 
the application of construction norms and functional standards and payment of land acquired for 
school construction.
