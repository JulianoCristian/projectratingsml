INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EKECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO INSTITUTO DE ACUEDUCTOS Y ALCANTARILLADOS NACIONALES
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Instituto de Acueductos y Alcantarillados Nacionales (IDAAN) with
the guarantee of the Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$21.6
million to help finance a Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project. The
loan would have a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with inter-
est at the standard variable rate. IDAAN would relend US$1.6 million
equivalent to the Ministry of Public Works at the same terms and interest
rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Panama:  Special Economic Report - Metro-
politan Unemployment" (3833-PAN) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on June 7, 1982. The Report's findings are summarized below. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        In recent years Panama reversed a decline in per capita GDP expe-
rienced during 1974-77. This decline stemmed largely from the uncertainty
caused by the negotiations with the U.S., over the Canal, although the
world recession of 1975 and some inappropriate domestic policies also
played a part. The period 1978-81 was one of recovery-real GDP increased
at an annual average rate of 5.5 percent, double the rate of population
growth.  In 1978 the service sectors--banking, commerce, transport, commu-
nications and storage--were the most dynamic, while in 1979 manufacturing
and public utilities were the fastest growing sectors. Construction
recovered strongly in 1980; during 1981 it fell slightly but banking,
commerce, and other services showed great buoyancy during both years.
Unfortunately, agricultural output has not increased since 1977.
4.        The Government's three main concerns since 1968 have been to eli-
minate rural poverty, to increase national control over the economy,
including the Panama Canal, and to create new sources of economic growth
and exports. Social programs in health and education were extended to most
areas, and an agrarian reform program was initiated. The second goal was
achieved by the U.S.-Panamanian Treaty by which the administration of the
old Canal Zone reverts to Panama. Major investments were undertaken in
transport, tourism, international commercial infrastructure, water supply
and sewerage, and power, mostly to provide support for expected private
activities. Power and most telecommunications facilities were national-
ized. New State enterprises were created for export crops such as sugar,
citrus, and bananas; and a State-owned cement plant was built. Self-suffi-
ciency in basic foodstuffs such as rice, corn, and beans was also accorded
high priority.



-2-
5.         The Government's social programs have had considerable success in
enhancing the quality of life in Panama, as reflected in demographic,
health and educational indicators. Infant mortality declined by 20 percent
between 1968 and 1976, while fertility rates fell from 131.3 per thousand
in 1971 to 114 per thousand in 1975. Access to potable water for the rural
population increased from 43 percent in 1970 to 63 percent in 1976. The
proportion of the population enrolled in schools of all types increased
from less than one-quarter to over one-third between 1968 and 1978.
Despite these achievements, estimates indicate that some 21 percent of the
urban and about 30 percent of the rural population continue to live in
poverty.
6.         As regards the Government's economic programs, the Colon Free
Zone and past hydroelectric projects have increased employment and earnings
from export of services, and reduced the burden of rising petroleum costs.
The most successful of Government programs was a major change in the bank-
ing legislation in 1970. This has attracted about a hundred banks to
Panama; it is now a major regional Eurodollar Center. Other programs
involving direct production by the public sector or affecting private sec-
tor decisions have been less successful. Agricultural programs have led to
self-sufficiency in rice and increased the output of milk, but have had
less impact on the output of beef, and feed grains. State sugar mills have
increased output but they operate unprofitably. Similarly, State enter-
prises in tourism and cement together with the sugar operations, have been
a burden on the fisc. The public enterprises' direct competition with pri-
vate enterprises and some uncertainties relating to Government labor and
price policies adversely affected the climate for private investment.
Recent improvements in the dialogue between the Government and the private
sector and a more flexible approach to labor and price policy have
increased private sector confidence.
7.         The high level of outlays for economic and social infrastructure,
coupled with the substantial losses of State enterprises, resulted in
significant increases in the public sector deficit, despite periodic
efforts to strengthen the public finances. This deficit increased from 4.4
percent of GDP in 1970 to over 15 percent of GDP in 1978. Although it fell
to 11 percent in 1979, this was mainly due to a reduction in investment
rather than in current expenditures or increased revenues. Panama has no
Central Bank or control over its currency. Consequently the authorities
cannot finance their deficit by resorting to Central Bank credit. Short-
falls are therefore met by borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars. At the
end of 1978 Panama's disbursed external public debt reached 85 percent of
GDP and interest on the debt absorbed about 40 percent of the Central
Government's current revenues. This alarming situation prompted the
Government to take a series of actions during 1980. These measures
included increases in taxes and improved tax administration. Current and
capital transfers to decentralized agencies and public enterprises were
also reduced. Some profitable state enterprises were required to increase
their transfers to the Central Government. An emergency public employment
program which had grown to employ over 17,000 people by the end of February
1980, was discontinued on that date. In conjunction with favorable sugar
prices, a major increase in canal revenues, and very buoyant tax revenues,
these measures reduced the deficit to less than 6 percent of GDP in 1980
and 1981--successfully meeting the targetted reduction required under the
IMF Standby Agreement.



-3-
8.        The IMF Board approved another Standby in support of a financial
programme for 1982 which once again included a public sector deficit ceil-
ing of 6 percent of GDP. However, information which became available early
in the second semester indicated that this target would not be met. Panama
was feeling the effects of the world economic recession. Real growth
during 1982 will not exceed 1- percent compared to the 5 percent which had
been anticipated. This means that the expected increase in fiscal revenues
will not materialize. At the same time expenditures, particularly by some
of the state enterprises and autonomous agencies, are substantially higher
than forecast. The Government is aware of the importance of fiscal
discipline for the country's creditworthiness and has accordingly taken a
series of measures which should reduce the deficit for the second half of
1982 by some US$50 million. This, unfortunately, will still lead to a
shortfall for the year as a whole. Consequently the Government will have
to undertake further substantial reductions in expenditure during 1983.
9.        The strategy for economic recovery now requires that private
capital and entrepreneurs provide the buoyancy in economic activity that
the public sector can no longer provide. New opportunities have indeed
been created for the private sector. The past high level of public invest-
ment has provided an expanded physical infrastructure. Panama's workforce
is among the best educated in the area. There is social tranquillity, and
tax incentives and financing facilities for industry are readily avail-
able. In agriculture there is a good potential for increased production
and exports of beef, fruit, cocoa, and coffee, and for replacing imports of
vegetable oils and dairy products.
10.       The prospects for growth also depend on the use of land and
facilities reverting to Panama and on the higher earnings to be received by
Panama under the new Canal Treaty. Implementation of the Treaty began on
October 1, 1979, and will be completed on December 31, 1999, when the Canal
and all ancillary facilities will revert to Panama. Already the ports of
Balboa, Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte, two abandoned airfields, much
valuable land, and most service outlets of the former Panama Canal
Company's supply division have reverted to Panama. The reverting land
makes even more feasible a spatial orientation in development strategy
which emphasizes the metropolitan area, bounding the Canal and traversing
the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, as the best site for activ-
ities to take advantage of Panama's excellent geographic location. The
Government is actively planning the conservation and further development of
infrastructure in this area for expanded private sector activities which
would generate employment, revenues and rents adequate to pay for these
investments.
11.       The longer-term outlook for the Panamanian economy seems favor-
able, given its geographic advantages, educated workforce, low population/
land ratio, and good physical infrastructure. The medium-term outlook will
depend on key domestic policies and on the international economy. The
critical domestic issues include rising urban unemployment, the size of the
public external debt, the relative roles of the public and private sectors,
and the climate for private investment. The Government is now keenly aware
of these issues. It has a continuing dialogue with businessmen, and
recognizes the need to reduce its direct involvement in activities which



- 4 -
not only compete with the private sector, but often operate at a loss.  In
addition, it is aggressively pursuing a program to attract
internationally-integrated assembly industries by simplifying procedures
for establishing plants and granting incentives and by training labor in
response to the specific manpower requirements of incoming firms.
12.       During 1980 and 1981 the Government acted decisively to reduce
the relative size of the public sector deficit. As a result, public
external debt fell compared to GDP and interest payments on this debt
dropped to 7.5 percent of GDP. While this burden is lower than those for
the late 1970's it is still a major cost to the economy. For reasons of
debt management further action to reduce Government expenditures will be
vital to ensure a continuing stable financial environment. After the
deterioration of the situation during the first half of 1982, the
Government is now tackling the fiscal problem. Major cuts in the public
investment program and some recurrent programs are being made. Panama has
invited the IMF and the Bank to review its draft 1983 budget in order to
identify areas where further reductions can be realized. The authorities
have stated that they will negotiate a new Standby with the IMF before
April 1983, when the present Agreement expires. Panama has a long record
of prompt payment of its debts and a proven capacity to reduce rapidly the
public sector deficit when necessary.  On this basis, and given the
Government's intention to reach an agreement on a stabilization program
supported by the IMF, Panama is considered creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS 1/
13.       The Bank has to date made twenty-four loans to Panama totalling
US$382.9 million (net of cancellations). Of these, 12 loans for US$147.0
million are fully disbursed, two for roads totalling US$13 million; one for
an airport project for US$20 million; four for agriculture totalling US$9.0
million, three for power for US$76 million; one for ports for US$24 mil-
lion; and one for fisheries for US$4.9 million. Ongoing operations include
one project for livestock credit; one for development of tropical tree
crops, two for development banking; two for highway maintenance and rehabi-
litation; two in the power sector (for generation, transmission and distri-
bution); a project to support energy planning and petroleum exploration;
one to help develop the water supply and sewerage sector; and a loan for
the urban development of Colon. The most recent loan to Panama, for a
second port project, was approved by the Executive Directors on June 17,
1982.
1/   Part II of this report is substantially the same as Part II of the
President's Report for the Second Port Project (Report No. P-3110-PAN,
dated May 25, 1982).



- 5 -
14.       IFC has made three investments in Panama.  The first was a
commitment in 1971 to acquire US$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion
de Desarrollo Hotelero, S.A. and to lend to the Corporacion US$1.2 million
to build a new international hotel. The second was a commitment in
December 1977 to lend US$2.4 million and acquire US$1.4 million in equity
in Vidrios Panamenos, S.A., the first glass container factory in Panama.
These projects have been satisfactorily completed. The third is a commit-
ment in 1979 to acquire US$2.5 million in equity in the Banco Latino-
americano de Exportaciones (BLADEX), a regional export bank promoted by the
Government of Panama.
15.       While there are some difficulties, satisfactory overall progress
in the implementation of ongoing projects is reflected in the steady
increase in Bank disbursements, from US$17 million in FY79 and US$16.1
million in FY80, to US$31 million in FY81, and US$39 million in FY82.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as
of September 30, 1982, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       Bank lending to Panama is designed to support the Government's
development strategy particularly as regards the further development of
Panama's insfrastructure and service industries and the diversification of
production and exports. Specifically, the Bank assists those sectors in
which it can make a special contribution in terms of: (i) developing
policies and institutions; (ii) removing infrastructure bottlenecks; and
(iii) better utilizing the country's natural resources, including its
geographic location. In addition to the proposed project, projects under
active consideration for Bank lending are a development banking project,
and further development of the power sector and livestock production.
17.       Both the USAID and the IDB have invested substantial amounts in
agriculture and social services (including family planning in the case of
USAID). Past lending patterns are likely to persist, at least as regards
the social services, because the Government prefers to borrow on conces-
sionary terms for these sectors, while utilizing other assistance for
projects which are expected to result in more immediate economic benefits.
In addition to agriculture and social services, the IDB is financing road
construction, industry and telecommunications, sectors in which it is
likely to continue lending. The IDB also participated with the Bank in the
financing of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project and is financing a rural
electrification program. USAID expects to concentrate its efforts on man-
power training and projects oriented toward environmental protection.
USAID is also lending for alternative sources of energy (other than petro-
leum).
18.       The Bank's share of Panama's publicly-guaranteed external debt
outstanding and disbursed was 5.8 percent at the end of 1980 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was estimated at 3.7 percent in
1980. These percentages are expected to increase slightly in the 1980's.

PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Water Resources and Population
19.       With a dense network of rivers and marshes and 1,800-3,000 mm of
rainfall a year, Panama is rich in water resources. The seasonal rainfall
pattern, however, causes pronounced variations in river flows. The two
largest bodies of fresh water, Lake Gatun and Lake Madden, constructed to
provide water for the operation of the Panama Canal, serve as water sources
for nearby Panama City and Colon. Exploration of groundwater sources was
neglected in the past, because of the abundant supply of surface water. So
far, aquifers supply mainly small urban communities and rural areas.
Attempts to locate aquifers suitable for large-scale exploitation have not
been successful. However, with the prospects of increased demand, efforts
to locate and exploit ground water sources are being stepped up.
20.       Panama's population in mid-1980 was about 1.8 million with about
half of this total in urban centers of more than 1,500 inhabitants. Urban
population is concentrated in the regions surrounding Panama City, the
capital and commercial center, and Colon, the industrial center, located on
the Pacific and Atlantic entrances to the Panama Canal, respectively. The
Panama City metropolitan area alone has about 35 percent of the country's
total population and 70 percent of its urban population. Between 1970 and
1980, the population grew at an average of 2.5 percent annually, as
compared to 3.1 percent per year between 1960 and 1970. Population growth
was higher in urban areas (2.8 percent) because of migration of rural
people seeking employment opportunities. The Panama City Metropolitan Area
was one of the main targets of this migration with an average annual growth
rate of 3.7 percent between 1971 and 1980. The Government intends to
divert some of the migration from Panama City by increasing infrastructure
investments in medium-size regional centers (Santiago, David, and La
Chorrera) and transforming them into alternative poles of development.
Service Levels, Past Investments and Sector Issues
21.       Water supply and sanitation service levels in Panama are
generally high in comparison to those in other countries of Latin America.
The percentage of the total population served by public water supply
systems increased from 70 percent in 1974 to 85 percent in 1980, of which
private house connections accounted for 60 percent, public standpipes for
about 13 percent and protected wells 11 percent. In urban areas almost all
people are served by public systems and about 95 percent receive water
through house connections. In rural areas, the service level is 70
percent: 27 percent through house connections, 20 percent through
standpipes and 22 percent through protected wells.
22.       Roughly 97 percent of the urban population has access to sanita-
tion facilities. About 68 percent of the people have connections to public
sewer systems, 7 percent have individual septic tanks, and 22 percent use
latrines. Sewage is generally disposed of with insufficient, or no, treat-
ment. The few existing treatment facilities, such as communal septic tanks
constructed by housing developers, are generally overburdened and badly



- 7 -
maintained and are thus ineffective in most cases.  Consequently, streams
near densely populated areas are heavily polluted. About 81 percent of the
rural population has access to sanitation facilities, mostly in the form of
latrines (75 percent) and septic tanks (5 percent). Less than 1 percent
has access to sewerage services. Moreover, a large portion of the latrines
and septic tanks are in poor repair and do not give the protection they
could provide, if properly maintained. Although, Panama's population
enjoys generally good water supply services, there are areas where service
is of lower standard, and provision should be made for the increase in
population. There is also an acute need for maintenance, improvement or
rehabilitation of urban and rural sanitation facilities and for reduction
of environmental pollution.
23.       Since 1971 investment in water supply and sewerage excluding
developers' contributions, amounted to a total of about US$155 million in
1981 prices, an average of US$14 million a year. More than 90 percent of
this investment was made by the Instituto de Acueductos y Alcantarillados
Nacionales (IDAAN), the national water supply and sewerage authority. All
major investment programs have been supported by external financing.
Budgetary allocations from the Government or funds from IDAAN itself
accounted for 45 percent of total sector investment. Ninety percent of
these investments were devoted to urban areas.
Government Objectives and Strategy
24.       The Government is making efforts for a more efficient development
and operation of the sector. As a result and with the targets of the
International Water and Sanitation Decade in mind, IDAAN and the Ministry
of Health (MH) have formulated the following sector goals for 1990: (a)
maintaining existing urban water supply assets in good repair and expanding
services to the incremental future urban population; (b) expanding urban
sewerage systems to reach a 90 percent service level in Panama's 15 largest
urban centers and providing at least primary sewage treatment (oxidation
ponds) in those urban centers, where environmental pollution is most
critical; (c) providing adequate and safe water supply services through
public systems to 85 percent of Panama's rural population with specific
minimum targets according to community size; and (d) providing safe excreta
disposal facilities by individual means of disposal (septic tanks,
latrines) to 90 percent of the rural population. In order to achieve these
targets, IDAAN and MH would have to double their annual investments
compared to past levels. Total investments required would be about US$300
million in 1981 prices, while IDAAN's and MH's six-year (1983-88) invest-
ment programs are estimated at about US$126 million (of which IDAAN's share
amounts to US$110 million or US$139 million in current prices), which makes
the 1990 overall goals unlikely to be fully met.
Institutions
25.       IDAAN was established in 1961 as an autonomous tax exempt public
entity. It enjoys wide administrative but limited financial autonomy. It
carries out upwards of 90 percent of annual investments in the sector with
specific responsibility for planning and operating water and sewerage
systems in communities with more than 500 inhabitants.  Its investment
program requires the approval of the Ministry of Planning and Economic
Policy (MIPPE) while the National Controller's Office reviews its annual



- 8 -
budget.  IDAAN proposes tariffs and charges which need Cabinet approval.
MH plans and operates the systems in the rest of the country. The Ministry
of Public Works (MOP) is responsible for the construction and maintenance
of urban storm drainage systems.
26.       IDAAN is headed by an Executive Director with ministerial rank
who is appointed by the President of Panama for a six-year term. An eight-
member Board of Directors, chaired by the Minister of Health, provides
policy guidelines and makes major operational decisions. Four national
departments provide support and supervision in technical, operational,
engineering, logistical, administrative, commercial and financial areas.
The Executive Director is assisted by two advisory units: the Planning Unit
and the Legal Unit. Maintenance and operational responsibilities are
delegated to 10 regional offices. The regional managers report directly to
the Executive Director.
27.       Although IDAAN has capable management, further improvements in
the areas of personnel and operation are still needed. For instance, the
number of employees per 1000 connections (15) is high compared to other
Latin American water utilities of similar size, unaccounted-for water is as
high as 36 percent, and gross arrears represent about five months of water
revenues.
Financial Policies
28.       IDAAN's organizational law requires that its tariffs and charges
be set at levels sufficient to cover operating costs, depreciation, debt-
service payments, and a provision for system expansion. In addition to
tariffs, IDAAN recovers costs of water supply mains and distribution net-
works, and sewage collection networks through property betterment levies
(valorization charges) from property owners who benefit from water supply
and sewerage works. IDAAN determines valorization charges by apportioning
the total cost, including financial costs to property owners, either on the
basis of lot frontage or property size. Property owners may pay valoriza-
tion charges in installments of generally up to 20 years.
29.       IDAAN is expected to contribute about 56 percent of its US$139
million 1983-88 investment program from its own internal sources. The
introduction of a separate sewerage tariff when the next tariff increase
becomes necessary would make the tariff structure more equitable, by elimi-
nating the current implicit subsidy from customers not connected to the
sewerage systems to those connected.
Bank Role in the Sector
30.       The first Bank operation directly with IDAAN was the 1976 Water
Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 1280-PAN) which aimed at improving the
water supply systems of the cities of Panama, Colon, La Chorrera, Arraijan,
and providing water to the fishing port of Vacamonte. It also aimed at
strengthening IDAAN's management, planning, operational, and maintenance
capabilities. Works financed under the Loan were completed in August



- 9 -
1982, about two years behind appraisal estimate, mainly because of delays
in preparing designs and bidding documents at the outset.  Progressive
2 percent monthly tariff increases of 3 percent from February 1976 to
February 1977, and 2 percent from March 1977 to February 1978 enabled IDAAN
to improve its revenues and substantially meet the revenue covenant under
the Loan Agreement for 1979. Although IDAAN could not meet its revenue
covenant targets in 1980-81, it contributed about 25 percent of its
investment programs from its own internal sources during the 1977-81
period. Otherwise, IDAAN's compliance with the covenants under the Loan
Agreement was generally satisfactory. Because of a 30 percent average
tariff increase in April 1982, and of measures being implemented, such as
improved billing for unmetered connections, increased metering and
reduction of arrears, IDAAN's financial position is projected to remain
satisfactory through 1984 and would thereafter require only modest tariff
adjustments. Technical assistance provided has helped IDAAN to improve its
organizational structure and performance in areas such as billing,
collection, accounting and planning.
31.       Further Bank involvement in the sector would assist IDAAN to
rehabilitate and upgrade existing systems, extend the service to areas
currently not served and provide the technical assistance needed to reduce
water losses, further improve operational and financial management,
restructure its tariffs and plan the future expansion of the systems.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The project was identified by a Bank mission in April 1978, and
prepared by IDAAN with the assistance of consultants and Bank missions.
The project was appraised in March-April 1982.  Negotiations were held in
Washington, D.C. in October 1982. The Panamanian delegation was led by
Mr. Ivan Estribi, Executive Director of IDAAN. The appraisal mission's
report, entitled, "Staff Appraisal Report - Panama Second Water Supply and
Sewerage Project" (No. 4121-PAN, dated November 12, 1982), is being
distributed separately. Annex III contains a supplementary project data
sheet.
Project Objectives and Description
33.       The main objectives of the project are to improve health and
living conditions in several urban areas and the District of Arraijan and
to strengthen the institutional capabilities of IDAAN and MOP's Directorate
of Storm Drainage. In Panama City, Santiago and La Chorrera sewage systems
would be improved and extended. Service coverage and quality of water
supply in Panama City, Colon and the District of Arraijan would improve and
unaccounted-for water would be reduced. In the District of Arraijan the
increased safe and continuous supply of water would also meet the increas-
ing demand from the industrial installation at the fishing Port of
Vacamonte, and cover rural areas where IDB finances distribution networks.
The Colon storm drainage component would help eliminate the health hazard
posed by chronic flooding and reinforce the urban rehabilitation of the
city. Technical assistance and training would be provided for IDAAN and
MOP.



- 10 -
34.       Sewerage:  Works in Panama City would comprise construction of
about 32 km of sewer networks and 6 sewer collectors with 15 km of pipes,
and rehabilitation and reequipment of a sewage pumping station. In
Santiago, about 40 km of laterals and collectors, two sewage pumping
stations and two oxidation ponds would be constructed. In La Chorrera
about 60 km of laterals and collectors would be constructed.  In Colon four
sewage pumping stations would be rehabilitated and about 6 km of sewer pipe
replaced.
35.       Water Supply:  Works in Panama City would include the construc-
tion of a 5 km transmission main, installation of pressure regulators,
rehabilitation of storage tanks, replacement or repair of valves, implemen-
tation of a leak detection program and improvement and mechanization of
pumping stations. Works for the District of Arraijan would comprise
construction of a pumping station at the Miraflores treatment plant and
transmission mains of about 9 km, including the crossing of the Canal.
Works in Colon would consist of a rehabilitation and operations improvement
program including the replacement and repair of valves and hydrants.
36.       Equipment:  Maintenance equipment, vehicles and radio communica-
tions equipment would be provided.
37.       The Metering Program would consist of the purchase and installa-
tion of: 20,000 house water meters, primarily in Panama City and Colon; 60
source water meters for facilities throughout the country; and instrumenta-
tion and equipment for IDAAN's meter repair shop.
38.       Technical Assistance and Training for IDAAN would include
programs in maintenance and operation of water supply and sewage, metering,
commercial and administrative practices, tariff structure review and
preparation of a sewerage master plan for Colon.
39.       Consulting Services would be provided for supervision of complex
construction components and for preparation of the sewerage master plan for
Colon.
40.       The Colon Storm Drainage component would provide for rehabilita-
tion of two pumping stations, repair or replacement of storm drains in a
30-block area, purchase of maintenance equipment, provision of technical
assistance to organize an operations unit within MOP, and training of
engineers and operators in maintenance techniques.
Project Implementation
41.       IDAAN would be the Borrower for the proposed loan and executing
agency for the water supply and sewerage components. A capable Project
Manager and experienced staff who were in charge of the First Project, have
been assigned to the proposed project. The Engineering Directorate would
be responsible for supervising construction of the less complex components,
while experienced consultants would supervise construction of the more
sophisticated components such as the Miraflores pumping station and the



- 11 -
Canal crossing. With the assistance of consultants during project
implementation, IDAAN would continue its metering program to cover 70
percent of all customers by 1985 and reduce unaccounted-for water from the
present 36 percent to 25 percent by 1986. By December 31, 1988, IDAAN
would gradually reduce the present ratio of 15 employees per 1,000
connections to no more than 9/1,000.  IDAAN plans to reach this target
mainly through attrition and system growth, and has set intermediate
targets for this purpose.
42.       A large number of the potential beneficiaries of the sewerage
works belong to the low-income groups. As installing even rudimentary
sanitary facilities and plumbing may cost about US$600 per dwelling, many
families might find this cost beyond their immediate means. In order to
enable access to the sewerage facilities and to facilitate their full use,
by June 30, 1985, IDAAN would establish a US$100,000 equivalent revolving
fund to finance loans for in-house sanitary installations for low-income
families (Section 3.09 of the draft Loan Agreement). About 2,800 families
are expected to benefit from the financing through 1988.
43.       MOP would execute the Colon storm drainage component through its
recently established Directorate of Storm Drainage. The Directorate's
personnel appear to be experienced and capable of executing the component
with the assistance of consultants in preparing the final designs and
supervising construction. MOP is familiar with Bank work through the two
Bank-financed highway projects (Loans 1565-PAN and 2020-PAN), and its
performance is expected to be satisfactory. By January 31, 1984, MOP would
establish a properly staffed and equipped storm drainage operation and
maintenance unit in Colon (Section 3.07 (b) of the draft Guarantee
Agreement).
44.       About 80 percent of all project designs have been completed and
the bidding process initiated. The water supply and sewerage components
would all be completed by June 1988. The Colon storm drainage component
would be completed in mid-1985.
Technical Assistance and Training
45.       Under the proposed project IDAAN would receive technical
assistance and training in the areas of planning and information systems,
administration, accounting, operation and maintenance and the formulation
of the tariff structure. The Directorate of Storm Drainage of MOP would be
assisted in upgrading its operation and maintenance capabilities in Colon.
Project Cost and Financing
46.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$39.3 million
equivalent, including contingencies, but excluding interest during
construction and the front end fee. The project would be exempted from
taxes and duties. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$21.3 million
(54 percent), and local costs at about US$18 million (46 percent). Cost
estimates for civil works and equipment are based on recent bids for
similar works in Panama. The average allowance for physical contingencies
is 12 percent and varies from 5 percent to 15 percent of a component's base
cost, depending on the status of design and the nature of the component.



- 12 -
Price contingencies are based on a 5.5 year construction schedule. Inter-
national inflation rates of 8 percent in 1982 and 1983, 7.5 percent in
1984, 7 percent in 1985, and 6 percent thereafter were applied to both the
foreign and local exchange components.
47.       Total financing required for the project, including interest
during construction (US$6.7 million) and the front end fee on the proposed
Bank loan (US$0.3 million) would amount to US$46.3 million. The proposed
US$21.6 million Loan would cover the foreign exchange cost of the project,
excluding interest during construction, and the front end fee. IDAAN would
finance US$7.4 million of the local cost of the water supply and sewerage
components, plus interest during construction, through internal cash
generation (US$14.1 million) and the Government would provide US$8.8
million as equity contribution. The Government would also provide US$1.8
million towards MOP's storm drainage component.
48.       IDAAN would relend US$1.6 million equivalent out of the proceeds
of the proposed loan to MOP at the same interest and terms of the Bank
loan. Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between IDAAN and MOP would
be a condition of disbursement against the Colon storm drainage component
(para. 4(b) of Schedule 1 to the draft Loan Agreement). Terms and
conditions of the subsidiary loan agreement have been agreed upon during
negotiations.
Financial Aspects
49.       The April 1982 tariff increase (para. 30 above) has introduced a
progressive element in the tariff structure and is expected to enable IDAAN
to achieve its financial targets through 1984. No accurate record of sewer
connections is kept and there is no separate sewerage charge. This results
in an inequitable subsidy from consumers with only water supply connections
to consumers with both water and sewer connections. IDAAN has initiated a
survey of sewer connections to be completed by June 30, 1983 (Section
5.08(a) of the draft Loan Agreement). With a view to establishing an
equitable tariff structure at the appropriate levels, IDAAN would complete
a comprehensive tariff study, with the assistance of consultants by March
31, 1984 (Section 5.08(b) of the draft Loan Agreement). IDAAN would review
its tariffs annually and adjust them as required to produce annually an
internal cash ratio (funds from internal sources in relation to average
revalued net fixed assets in operation) of at least 3.5 percent (Section
5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement). This would be consistent with IDAAN's
financial policies. It is expected that meeting the cash ratio target
would require an average tariff increase of about 11 percent in 1985, which
is expected to be achieved with the introduction of a sewerage charge.
Thereafter, tariffs would be adjusted periodically for inflation.
50.       IDAAN's investment program for 1983-88 totals US$139 million.
This program includes the proposed project (US$43 million) and another
(US$42 million) project assisted by an IDB loan. The remaining US$54 mil-
lion would be on account of expansion of other water and sewerage services
throughout the country.  IDAAN would contribute about 56 percent of the
necessary funds through internal sources, which is satisfactory. The
proposed Loan and the IDB loan of US$26 million would finance 31 percent of
investments. Government equity contributions (US$18 million) would cover
the remaining 13 percent of the financial requirement.



- 13 -
51.       IDAAN's debt-to-total-capitalization ratio is expected to be less
than 25 percent throughout project execution. The debt service coverage
ratio would not be less than 1.5. Any large borrowings in addition to
those already included in IDAAN's investment program would endanger satis-
factory financial performance. IDAAN would obtain Bank concurrence before
incurring any additional long-term debt which would cause the debt service
coverage ratio to drop below 1.5 in any twelve-month period (Section 5.06
of the draft Loan Agreement).
52.       Although IDAAN improved collection of water charges under the
first Project, at the end of 1981 gross arrears of water charges still
amounted to US$11.9 million, equivalent to five months' billing, and of
valorization charges amounted to US$3 million, equivalent to one year's
billing. IDAAN would gradually reduce accounts receivable to the equiva-
lent of no more than three months' billings by the end of 1983 for water
supply, and by the end of 1985 for valorization charges (Section 5.09 and
5.07 of the draft Loan Agreement, respectively).
Procurement and Disbursement
53.       Contracts would be awarded under international competitive bid-
ding, in accordance with Bank guidelines, except those for civil works of
less than US$300,000 up to an aggregate of US$2.3 million and equipment and
materials of less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate of US$0.4 million,
which would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures
acceptable to the Bank. Contracts subject to international competitive
bidding exceeding US$500,000 for civil works and US$100,000 for equipment
and materials, for the IDAAN components, and all procurement documentation
for the MOP component would be subject to prior review and approval by the
Bank. Domestic suppliers would be granted a preference of 15 percent or
the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower. General conditions and
technical specifications for repetitive contracts would be reviewed and
approved prior to the first bid and used unchanged thereafter. Contracts
awarded under local competitive bidding would be subject to ex-post review.
54.       Consulting and engineering services for technical assistance,
training programs, supervision of complex construction components and pre-
paration of the sewerage master plan for Colon are estimated at US$1.85
million. This amount includes a total of 275 staff-months, of which 169
staff-months are for professional and technical staff and 106 staff-months
for support staff. Some of the more complex engineering tasks (para. 41)
would require high qualifications and experience and would have to be
performed by expatriate experts. The average cost per staff-month for
expatriate staff (107 staff-months), including salaries, international
travel and subsistence, is estimated at US$11,000. The average cost per
staff-month (62 staff-months) for local consultants is estimated at
US$4,000, including salaries and administrative costs.
55.       Proceeds of the loan would meet the estimated foreign exchange
cost of the proposed project. Disbursement would be made against 40% of
total expenditures for equipment, civil works and materials for the sewer-



- 14 -
age component and for pipes and civil works for the storm drainage compo-
nent; against 70 percent of expenditures for equipment, materials and civil
works for the water supply component; against 100 percent of foreign or 40
percent of local expenditures for equipment and materials for the metering
program, for maintenance and for equipment for the storm drainage compo-
nent; against 50 percent of expenditures for consulting services; against
100 percent of foreign expenditures for training; and against 50 percent of
expenditures under the revolving fund established by IDAAN for financing of
in-house sanitary facilities. Disbursements for the revolving fund would
be made against statements of expenditures. All other disbursements would
be fully documented. In order to permit the early start of the Colon storm
drainage component, retroactive financing of up to US$50,000 for engineer-
ing services incurred after September 1, 1982, is proposed.
Benefits, Justification and Risk
56.       The project would be the least cost solution for providing the
water supply, sewerage and storm drainage works proposed, which in turn
appear fully justified. It would benefit a total of about 260,000 people
directly, 41 percent of whom belong to the poorer segment of the popula-
tion. The project would also support the Government's urban development
objectives. The sewerage works in Panama City would help improve sanita-
tion standards in some of its poorest sections. The components in La
Chorrera, Santiago, and Arraijan are important measures towards diverting
rural migrants and reducing pressure on Panama City. The project compo-
nents in Colon are essential to the success of the GovernmentTs efforts to
revive this economically depressed city and reinforce its urban renewal
supported by Loan 1878-PAN.
57.       About 55 percent of the total investment is in sewerage and 10
percent in storm drainage. Benefits derived from these systems are not
meaningfully quantifiable, and the absence of a cost-based sewerage charge
makes the calculation of an internal rate of return impossible. The incre-
mental financial rate of return for the two major water supply components
(transmission main in Panama City and works in Arraijan District) account-
ing for about 20 percent of the project cost would be about 14.6 percent.
The economic rate of return of these two components would be higher. The
remaining 25 percent of the project supports the improvement of the opera-
tion of the water supply and sewerage systems and the institutional
capabilities of IDAAN. The benefits derived from these project components
cannot be meaningfully quantified. Therefore, since the rate of return can
be estimated for only 20% of the total project investment, the presentation
of an aggregate rate of return for the total project is not possible.
58.       Delay in project implementation was considered as a possible
risk. However, because of the advanced stage of preparation, chances of
such delay would be slight, particularly in view of IDAAN's experience with
implementation of the first Project (Loan 1280-PAN). To ensure the
successful implementation of more complex components (Miraflores pumping
station and the Canal crossing) qualified consultants would be hired to
assist in project supervision.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and IDAAN, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Panama and the Bank and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement are being distributed separately. The execution of a
subsidiary loan agreement between IDAAN and MOP would be a condition of
disbursements against the Colon storm drainage component (para. 48).
Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex III.
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION (as of September 30, 1982) 1/
Loan 1280:      Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$12 Million Loan of
June 9, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 15, 1976;
Closing Date: July 30, 1982.
Project execution has been slower than estimated at appraisal due in part
to changes in the management of the Borrower (IDAAN). As a result of the changes,
there were delays in the selection of the consultants to carry out the engineer-
ing of the Colon treatment plant and the rehabilitation of the Chorrera treatment
plant, the largest components of the project. Construction of all project
components, started during 1978)were completed in August 1982. Improvements in
the accounting and commercial systems have been carried out: asset inventory
and valuation has been completed and the billing and collection system improved.
IDAAN has been financially sound largely as a result of substantial increases
in water rates in 1976 and 1977. In addition, IDAAN recently modified its
tariff structure and increased its rates. The Loan account is being closed.
Loan 1397:    Second Livestock Development Project; US$8 Million Loan of
April 28, 1977; Date of Effectiveness: February 1, 1978;
Closing Date: August 28, 1984.
After a slow start progress is picking up. Changes in the milk legisla-
tion required in connection with the project involve a modification in the
method of determining milk grade and thus the price paid to producers: the
grade of milk is now determined by the standard of on-farm buildings. The
modified legislation will require that producers be paid according to the
quality of milk produced. The legislation was approved in 1978 but Government
has not yet announced a date for its implementation.  In 1981, the Bank agreed
to modify the livestock breeding farm component which was to be carried out in
an autonomous state farm that has become part of a military base; it is now
being carried out in five different research extension farms of the Ministry
of Agriculture. Action is also being taken to hire consultants to implement
staff training and assist with implementation of the new milk pricing legisla-
tion. Loan commitments are behind appraisal estimates due to delays in
commitments in 1977, the year of the Canal Treaty ratification. However, as
of September 30, 1982 about 45 percent of project funds had been disbursed and
78% committed. The Loan is expected to be fully committed by mid-1983 and
disbursed by August 1984.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 1470:      Fourth Power (Fortuna Hydroelectric) Project:  US$42 Million
Loan of July 1, 1977; Date of Effectiveness: February 8, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
All major contracts have been awarded. The underground civil works have
suffered delays in the excavation work largely resulting from unforeseen
geological problems in the tunnels and underground cavern. The project is
now expected to be completed in October 1984 with a delay of some 16 months.
Management and supervision of the project have improved considerably. Construction
of the dam, which is now expected to be completed in March 1983, and procurement
of equipment and transmission are proceeding satisfactorily. There is now a
substantial increase in the project cost because of the change in the power-
house design, due to the geological problems encountered and the longer
construction period. There is also a cost overrun of approximately US$160
million, 72% of the original cost estimates. Requests from the Government
of Panama for supplementary financing for the project are being considered by
the IDB and the Bank, and syndicate co-financing from other sources is also
being sought for the balance. The project remains economically justified in
spite of the substantial cost increase.
Loan 1565:      Highway Maintenance Project:  US$12 Million Loan of June 30,
1978; Date of Effectivness: October 2, 1978; Closing Date:
March 31, 1983.
The project started about one year behind schedule due to delays in field-
ing a team of consultants, instead of a consulting firm, as a consequence of a
change in government views. A group of seven experts is now working in Panama
in two pilot provinces. Procurement of maintenance equipment and spare parts
is underway and the project is now progressing steadily, though slower than planned.
Nationwide implementation of standard maintenance procedures and a new main-
tenance management system started in 1981, following testing in two pilot
provinces. Procurement of maintenance equipment and mechanics tools is complete.
However, the project is experiencing some temporary budgetary difficulties and
discussions are in progress with the Minister of Public Works on this problem.
Programs for overhauling equipment and procuring spare parts are underway.
Additional assistance on equipment and workshop management has been included
under Loan 2020-PAN.
Loan 1641:      Development Banking Project:  US$15 Million Loan of January 23,
1979; Date of Effectiveness: September 25, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
The loan only became effective on September 25, 1979 because of delays in
obtaining Government guarantees covering COFINA's exposure in several enter-
prises in excess of the limits stipulated in COFINA's Policy Statement. The
problem has been resolved and implementation is progressing satisfactorily. The
Loan is now fully committed, except for a small portion of a US$1.0 million
component for small scale enterprise lending through the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry.

Loan 1672:     Tropical Tree Crop Development Project:  US$19 Million Loan of
April 25, 1979; Date of Effectiveness: July 25, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
The coffee and cocoa components are proceeding satisfactorily. The banana
component has suffered delays because of a change in management in one of the key
implementing organizations, the Banana Corporation of the Pacific (COBAPA) which
led to a deterioration of its finances and technical capability. The Ministry
of Agriculture has been trying to resolve the problems, but cancellation of
this component may have to be considered. The oil palm component is also facing
some problems, but with the appointment of a new project director and the
assistance of consultants, it is expected that there will be an improvement in
project execution generally.
Loan 1778:     Fifth Power Project:  US$23 Million Loan of January 30,
1980; Date of Effectiveness: April 22, 1980; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
Under the direction of a new project manager, project execution is
progressing satisfactorily. The delays experienced at the beginning have
been compensated and completion is expected in March 1984, only 3 months
behind schedule. A cost overrun of about 29% over appraisal estimate is being
financed by IRHE from its own resources.
Loan 1878:     Colon Urban Development Project:  US$35 Million Loan of
August 7, 1980; Date of Effectiveness: August 14, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
Execution of the housing component was delayed by changes in type and
location of some of the housing units proposed by the government. Implementa-
tion, according to the modified proposal, which has been approved by the Bank,
is proceeding slowly but well, notwithstanding staff changes in the Housing
Ministry. The port expansion and the Technical Assistance components are also
making satisfactory progress, and the development of the commercial area in
the Free Zone continues to progress. However, the employment generation
component (the industrial estate) may fall short of appraisal expectations due
to reduced demand, delays in implementation and the component may have to be
modified. Efforts are being made to resolve existing problems and developments
are being closely monitored.
Loan 1954:     Energy Planning and Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project:
US$6.5 Million Loan of April 23, 1981; Date of Effectiveness:
July 21, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
After initial delay in the appointment of consultants for planning of
energy development, energy audit and energy conservation planning, the project
is progressing satisfactorily. An Energy Strategy Paper should be in final
draft by the end of December 1982, and would incorporate the conclusions of
an on-going energy pricing and substitution study. A study covering an energy
audit, an energy conservation strategy and action plan for CONADE has now
been finalized and is being reviewed in the Bank. Cumbersome administrative
procedures and changes in Government officials have delayed the appointment
of the petroleum exploration consultants and coal exploration consultants.

ANNEX II
Page 6 of 6
The respective contracts have been negotiated and are presently being reviewed
by the Government Finance Committee. Proposals from geothermal exploration
consultants are being invited for studying the Baru-Colorado prospect. A
draft of petroleum legislation is currently being reviewed by a special
committee of the Parliament. Due to the delay in the formalization of the
petroleum exploration consultants contract, the implementation of the project
may be delayed by about 18 months.
Loan 1955:       Second Development Banking Project; US$20 Million Loan of
April 22, 1981; Date of Effectiveness: July 21, 1981;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Progress of this project is momentarily less than satisfactory. However,
there is active demand from entrepreneurs. More than 50 percent of the loan
is already committed and the balance is estimated to be committed by mid-1983.
Loan collections are low and arrears are rather high. Several old problem
projects are currently being sold, which will result in an estimated US$7.0
million loss in equity. During the first half of 1982, COFINA had three
different general managers and almost all management positions were changed
recently in an attempt to improve COFINA's public image.
Loan 2020:      Road Rehabilitation Project; US$19 Million Loan of July 24, 1981;
Date of Effectiveness: October 13, 1981; Closing Date:
December 31, 1985.
Due to initial delays resulting from a change of the Ministry of Public
Works' management, the project is about a year behind schedule. Detailed
engineering for the first year's roadworks is now almost complete. Contractors
have been prequalified and bids are being prepared for four road sections.
Consultants' proposals for technical assistance to the equipment maintenance
service are being evaluated and a program of expanding vehicle weight control
has been started. A revised execution program is now being considered by the
Ministry of Public Works in view of budget constraints, and the Bank is
monitoring the situation.
Loan 2182:      Second Port Project; US$24.4 Million Loan of September 15, 1982;
Date of Effectiveness: December 15, 1982; Closing Date:
December 31, 1986.
This loan is not yet effective. However, consultant and staff appointments
have been completed and procurement action is underway.
