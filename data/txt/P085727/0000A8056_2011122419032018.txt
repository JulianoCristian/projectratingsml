                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The purpose of this APL2 project is to reduce the vulnerability of the Capital District of Bogota to adverse natural events, by strengthening its capacity to
                         manage disaster risks, and by reducing vulnerability in key sectors.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         sectors. A high number of schools and kindergartens have been retrofitted/reconstructed to seismic resistant standards. As of June 30, 2011, the population at risk in public buildings
                         was reduced from 575,000 to 252,000 (achieving above and beyond the end of project target of 450,000). With respect to the resettlement component, 1,074 out of 1,075 households
                         living in high risk areas have been resettled to safe areas, and alternative housing has been selected by 1,067, of which 1,054 are already in permanent housing.

                         However, retrofitting and repositioning of health infrastructure is progressing slowly, with nearly all pending works having delays of over 5 months. The Bank team expressed its
                         concern during the last mission and is closely following the action plan presented (upon request) by the District Secretariat of Health implementing unit.
