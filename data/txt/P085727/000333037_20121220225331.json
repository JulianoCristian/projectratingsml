The purpose of this\n            restructuring paper is to seek approval for a second level\n            restructuring to extend the closing date of the project,\n            from December 31, 2012 to January 31, 2014. This will be the\n            second extension and will result in a cumulative extension\n            of 30 months (including the previous 18-month extension).\n            This extension will allow sufficient time for the\n            rehabilitation and construction of four hospitals, all of\n            which are already under construction, to national\n            seismic-resistant standards. The following two changes are\n            proposed for the project: extension of closing date to\n            complete hospital infrastructure; and introduction of\n            additional intermediate outcome indicator."}, "docdt": "2012-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
