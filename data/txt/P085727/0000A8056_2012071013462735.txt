                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The purpose of this APL2 project is to reduce the vulnerability of the Capital District of Bogota to adverse natural events, by strengthening its capacity to manage
                         disaster risks, and by reducing vulnerability in key sectors.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         are also doing well with a high number of schools and kindergartens retrofitted/reconstructed to seismic resistant standards. In addition, the population at risk in public buildings was
                         reduced from 575,000 to 252,000 (achieving beyond the end of project target which was 450,000). However, retrofitting and repositioning of health infrastructure is progressing slowly
                         as a result of contracting delays and complications. The District Secretary of Health submitted a request for extension of the project until December 31, 2013.
