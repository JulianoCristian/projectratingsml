                         The purpose of this APL2 project is to reduce the vulnerability of the Capital District of Bogota to adverse natural events, by strengthening its capacity to manage
                         disaster risks, and by reducing vulnerability in key sectors.

                         project target, which was 480,000). However, investments in the health sector have experienced significant contracting delays and complications. The District Secretary of Health
                         submitted a request for extension of the project until December 31, 2013. An action plan containing specific milestones for each hospital was defined with the SDS and SDH. Those
                         hospitals which met the milestones by November 30, 2012 would be included for financing under the requested project extension.
