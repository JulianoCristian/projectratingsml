                            RESTRUCTING PAPER

A.       SUMMARY

1.       The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to seek approval for a Level 2 Restructuring to
         extend the closing date of the Bogotá Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (APL 2), from
         December 31, 2012 to January 31, 2014. This would be the second extension and would result
         in a cumulative extension of 30 months (including the previous 18-month extension). This
         extension will allow sufficient time for the rehabilitation and construction of four hospitals, all
         of which are already under construction, to national seismic-resistant standards.

B.       PROJECT STATUS

2.       The Project is a US$80 million loan to the District of Bogotá with a Guarantee by the Republic
         of Colombia. The Project Development Objective is to reduce the vulnerability of the Capital
         District of Bogota to adverse natural events, by strengthening its capacity to manage disaster
         risks, and by reducing vulnerability in key sectors. To date, performance under the project has
         been satisfactory; targets for the education and social integration sectors are at 90% and 103%
         respectively, with 38 schools and 29 kindergartens retrofitted/reconstructed to national seismic-
         resistant standards. As of June 30, 2012, the population at risk in public buildings was reduced
         from 579,000 to 235,000 (surpassing the end-of-project target of 455,000). However, the
         investments in the health sector have experienced significant delays for which the closing date
         of the Project was extended from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012.

3.       Borrower performance has also been satisfactory and there is broad compliance with existing
         legal covenants. To date, the Project has disbursed US$58 million (75%) of loan proceeds. Of
         the US$40.3 million assigned to the District Secretariat of Health (SDS) for civil works
         relating to six hospitals, US$22.8 million has been disbursed and US$15.1 million has been
         committed.

C.       PROPOSED CHANGES

4.       The following two changes are proposed for the project:

        Extension of closing date to complete hospital infrastructure: Only those hospitals with civil
         works which demonstrated significant progress by November 30, 2012 as defined per
         milestones agreed with the District Secretariat of Finance (SDH) and the SDS, are to be
         financed with loan proceeds during the project extension. Based on attainment of defined
         milestones and current work schedules, it is expected that each hospital will be completed
         ahead of the proposed new closing date.

        Introduction of additional intermediate outcome indicator: In order to monitor progress in civil
         works of hospitals included in the proposed project extension, an additional intermediate
         outcome indicator will be introduced. The indicator, which has been agreed to by the SDH, the
         SDS and the Bank, will use a weighted average of construction progress based on contract
         value of each hospital to provide an aggregate percent completion of hospital infrastructure
         (Annex 1).
