Key areas of major success include the\n            maintenance of a good macroeconomic framework especially on\n            the external front, the fast implementation of the free\n            trade agreement included in the Association Agreement signed\n            with the European Union, and the big push given to\n            privatization in late 1997 to early 1998 which resulted in\n            the successful privatization of two large cement companies.\n            The first key lesson learned is that 1) there are gains to\n            be made in fast, yet orderly, implementation of structural\n            reforms as seen with privatization and trade reforms; the\n            Tunisian authorities and the World Bank should continue to\n            seek ways to speed up structural reforms in other areas of\n            the economy. The second lesson is that collaboration with\n            other development partners such as the European Union (EU)\n            and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can greatly\n            leverage Bank resources and enhance the impact of Bank intervention."}, "docdt": "1998-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
