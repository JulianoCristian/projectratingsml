               Re:  Credit No. 1911 G
                    (Financial Sector Adjustment Credit)
                    Amendment
Dear Dr. Botchwey:
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Financial Sector
Adjustment Credit) dated June 14, 1988, between the Republic of
Ghana and the International Development Association (the
Association).
     The Association proposes to amend the Development Credit
Agreement for the above-referenced Project by adding a new sub-
paragraph to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to the Development Credit
Agreement so that paragraph 2 shall read as follows:
     "2.  (a)  Contracts for goods estimated to cost the
     equivalent of up to $2,000,000 each may be awarded: (i) in
     case of procurement of goods by the Borrower, its political
     subdivisions or stateowned enterprises, on the basis of the
     Borrower's or the state-owned enterprise's procedures which
     have been reviewed and found acceptable to the Association;
     and (ii) in case of procurement by private entities, on the
     basis of their normal procurement procedures.
          (b)  Contracts for petroleum and petroleum products
     commonly traded on the international market may be awarded on
     the basis of the normal procurement procedures of the
     purchaser of such items."
     Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing
the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
                   Sincerely yours,
                     Anand K. Seth
