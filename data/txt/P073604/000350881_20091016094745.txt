Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The objective of the Project was to consolidate macroeconomic stability in the
Borrower#s territory and contribute to the economic recovery in the country through: (a)
a first phase of demobilization of about 60,000 soldiers; (b) provision of reinsertion
support to the Demobilized Soldiers; and (c) the support in phases of the social and
economic reintegration of the Demobilized Soldiers over a period of 3 to 4 years; and (d)
the mobilization and strengthening of the capacities of the Borrower#s ministries,
departments, private sector firms, community organizations, and other local agencies and
entities participating in the implementation of the Project in order to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of services to Demobilized Soldiers.

      1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Project was initiated to assist the Government of Eritrea (GoE) to respond to
the devastation caused by the 1998-2000 war waged between Eritrea and Ethiopia, which
was triggered by a territorial dispute along the border dividing both countries. The
conflict ended with a comprehensive Peace Accord adopted in December 2000. The war
caused considerable loss of human life, widespread suffering and social dislocation, and
large-scale destruction of the economic base. The Peace Agreement contained provision
of a peacekeeping force which would be deployed along the border between the two
countries until the border was to be demarcated by a neutral boundary commission. The
UN Security Council authorized the establishment of the UN Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea (UNMEE) in July 2000. A peacekeeping force constituted of up to 4,200
personnel was deployed along the 25-km wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) by March
2001.

2.      The humanitarian impact of the two-year-long war had been severe. Towards the
end of the conflict, more than a million people were internally displaced. In the conflict
areas, which normally contributed about 70% of the country's grain production ­
including Gash-bark and Debub Zones, 70% of the people had to relocate. In addition,
the sub-region suffered a drought in 2000 and an estimated 75,000 Eritreans and
Ethiopians of Eritrean origin were deported from Ethiopia to Eritrea. In 2001, about 1.76
million people living in the rural area were dependent on food assistance. The
establishment of the TSZ allowed the return of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to
areas within the TSZ, where they could resume their normal economic activities.

3.      The war had caused economic problems, including: physical destruction of
productive sector, the displacement of people, increased military spending and the
mobilization of 200,000 able bodied men and women, decline in private sector activities,
and loss of port revenues. In 2000, the GDP had a negative growth of -10.9%. Inflation
rate in 2000 reached 19.9%. While the budget deficit had increased from 5.6% of GDP
in 1997 to 48.1% in 2000. Per capita income stood at only USD 200.

4.      Following the Security Council authorization to establish UNMEE peace keeping
force in July 2000, the Government announced its intention to launch a demobilization
and reintegration program building its design on the Government's previous program,
international experiences and best practice. In November 2000, the Government
requested the Bank to provide technical assistance in the preparation of a comprehensive
demobilization and reintegration program in collaboration with other development
partners. The Government's Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Program
(EDRP) henceforth referred to as Program objectives were to: (i) demobilize 200,000
troops phased over the period of 18-24 months; (ii) support the social and economic
reintegration of the demobilized soldiers into their respective communities in a period of
3-4 years, including strengthening of institutional capacities of relevant government and




                                            1
local implementing partners within a two-year time frame; and (iii) support macro-
economic stability.

5.      At the request of the GoE, the IDA established and administered a Multi Donor-
Trust Fund (MDTF) with the objective of raising grant funds from the donor community
to support activities in the second and third phases of the Program. Accordingly, the
EDRP was funded by the IDA and the Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The external
assistance was essential in making resources available to invest in the conversion process,
which in turn would produce a peace dividend and indicate the Government's
commitment to implementation of the Peace Agreement. The estimated cost of the
Government's overall program was US$ 197,243,000 (see Table 1), and the financing
plan in the amount of US$197 million (see Table 2). Under the MDTF US$ 38.9 million
were mobilized at the inception of the Program, while the balances were never made
available by the donors who pledged. In addition, the pledges from the World Food
Program never materialized. According to the WFP policy, their pledge could not be
made available in the form of money as per GoE's request. The IDA made available a
credit of US$60 million representing (30%) of the total Program cost, which was
earmarked for funding the Program's first phase.

6.       There are inconsistencies in the wording of the Project Development Objectives
(PDOs) between the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and the Memorandum and
Recommendation of the President (MOP). The PDO as outlined in the Technical Annex
was for the entire Government Program. The differently worded PDOs have been
included under Section 1.2. These discrepancies in the PDO wording between the DCA
and the Technical Annex should have been explained when the DCA was amended after
the MTR in 2005. In addition, the PDOs were high level as they included macroeconomic
stability objectives for which attribution could not be clearly established. The
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) covers the IDA contribution (the
Project) to the Program activities based on the DCA. However, the assessment does
exclude the objective of macroeconomic stabilization. Consequently, the ICR uses the
PDO as spelt out in the DCA. Tables 1 to 4 are presented in order to distinguish between
the Program and the Project. In the subsequent sections, the ICR concentrates on the
Project achievements.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The Technical Annex described the PDO of the Government Program as: "The
overall development objectives of the Governments Demobilization and Reintegration
Program are to: (i) demobilize and provide reinsertion support to about 200,000 soldiers
in three phases; (ii) support the social and economic reintegration of demobilized soldiers,
including strengthening of institutional capacities of relevant government and local
implementing partners; and (iii) support macro-economic stability". The DCA wording
of the project PDO is : "The objective of the Project was to re-establish and consolidate
macroeconomic stability in the Borrower's territory and contribute to the economic
recovery in the country through: (i) complete first phase of demobilization of about
60,000 soldiers; (ii) provision of reinsertion support aimed at Demobilized Soldiers; and


                                             4
(iii) provision of support for subsequent activities, namely the social and economic
reintegration of the Demobilized Soldiers over a period of 3 to 4 years; and (iv) the
mobilization and strengthening of the capacities of the Borrower's ministries,
departments, private sector firms, community organizations, and other local agencies and
entities participating in the implementation of the Project in order to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of services to Demobilized Soldiers".

9.       The MOP described the Program PDO as follows: "The overall development
objectives of the Governments Demobilization and Reintegration Program are to: (i)
demobilize and provide reinsertion support to about 200,000- in three phases; (ii) support
the social and economic reintegration of demobilized soldiers including strengthening of
institutional capacities of relevant government and local implementing partners; and
support macro-economic stability." The Credit was to finance the demobilization of
60,000 soldiers which constituted the first phase of the USD 197 million overall Program.
The primary benefit of the Project (first phase of the Program) was the return of 60,000
demobilized soldiers to their communities to resume their economic life. The secondary
benefit was the re-allocation of resources from defense expenditures towards social and
economic investments. Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in Table 4 indicates the
evolution of the indicators at the Project design and as revised at the Mid Term Review
(MTR). This ICR has used PDO as articulated in the DCA as discussed in paragraph 6.
The ICR has also used the indicators as revised at MTR as per Table 4 below.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

Although the PDO remained the same (i.e. not revised), the indicators were revised at
Midterm Review (MTR) in 2005 as per column 3 in Table 4 above.




                                            6
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The Project primary target beneficiary group was a group of 60,000 Demobilized
Soldiers (DS) who were provided support to rebuild their livelihoods and resume
productive economic activities. The other beneficiaries included various government
ministries, departments and other agencies that participated in implementing the project.
These entities were to benefit through resource transfer and capacity building. The
project's reintegration component also targeted members of the wider community in the
form of micro credit programs and cash for work and employment programs.

1.5 Original Components

11.     The four Project components were: (i) Demobilization, (ii) Reinsertion; (iii)
Social and Economic Reintegration, and (iv) Operating Costs/Technical Assistance. The
Operating Cost/Technical Assistance component is not listed as the fourth component, in
the DCA and MOP, however, in the table of financing by component it is listed and
allocated US$2 million, hence the ICR has included it among the component and
evaluated it on the basis of its contribution to the institutional development.

Component 1: Demobilization (US$1 million)

12.      The component was aimed to provide support to reduce the number of military
personnel through funding: (i) the initial demobilization on pilot basis of about 5, 000
soldiers to test the applicability of the demobilization procedures and processes; (ii) the
preparation by the Ministry of Defense (MOD) of a clear and transparent demobilization
criteria; and through the Ministry's Demobilization Task Force (DTF), preparation of a
logistics plan to ensure the smooth processing of demobilization; (iii) preparation of an
information package to provide relevant information to soldiers selected for
demobilization; (iv) the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism within
MOD to determine appeals relating to demobilization; (v) the development of a non-
transferable identification card system capable of ensuring that only eligible DSs have
access to demobilization benefits; (vi) the implementation of pre-discharge orientation
and preparation information materials to prepare the DSs for return to civilian life; (vii)
the implementation of medical screening and voluntary testing for HIV/AIDS; and (viii)
the transportation of the DSs to designated regions (zobas) in which they would take
residence for registration purposes. The component also supported the collection of
social economic data on soldiers slated for demobilization for use during Project
implementation.

Component 2: Reinsertion (US$42 million)

13.     The component was to support the Transitional Safety Net (TSN) allowance
valued at US$600 per capita that was to enable the demobilized soldiers (DSs) to meet
their personal or family's basic material needs. The TSN, paid in three installments, was
defined as the cash equivalent of a basket of goods and services, such as household
expenditure, with clothing, cooking utensils, and children's education. The TSN was to



                                            7
be provided over a period of twelve months. As part of the TSN, the World Food
Program was to provide 12 months of supplementary food support to vulnerable DSs.
The TSN had two subcomponents: the Basic Transition Support, and the Enhanced
Support to vulnerable groups.

Component 3: Social and Economic Reintegration (US$12 million)

14.     This component was to support the social and economic reintegration of the DS
through provision of social and economic opportunities. In addition, it also included
targeted assistance to other war-affected citizens such as displaced persons and deportees.
It was envisaged that the component's activities would promote community cohesion and
economic recovery. There were special considerations for the female soldiers, disabled
DSs and those with HIV/AIDS. The specific activities to be financed under social
reintegration were: (i) improved access to information and raising awareness; (ii) first-
line counseling; (iii) outreach and community support training of first line counselors;
and (iv) strengthening capacities of second-line counselors. Under economic reintegration
the following activities would be financed: (i) provision of referral services for
employment and training; (ii) provision of skills development and training opportunities;
(iii) access to micro enterprise support schemes; (iv) support for small scale rural
development activities; and (v) employment promotion and training in construction trades.

Component 4: Operating Costs/Technical Assistance (US$2.00 million)

15.    The aim of this component was to support program management in the
implementation of the Project in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
delivery of services to Demobilized Soldiers.

1.6 Revised Components

16.     The EDRP originally financed through the IDA Credit and the MDTF support,
comprised three major components namely: demobilization, reinsertion, and reintegration
of demobilized soldiers. At the time of the Mid Term Review (MTR), significant
progress had been made with the implementation of the demobilization and reinsertion
components of the first and second phases of the Program, with financing from the IDA
Credit and part of the donor contributions to the MDTF. The Program overall had
demobilized a total of 104,400 soldiers, of which 60,000 were demobilized under IDA
funding and 44,400 under the MDTF, against the original program target of 200,000. The
MDTF had also provided the lower band of transitional safety net (TSN) payments,
including clothing and transport allowances covering 100% of the demobilized soldiers;
the TSN transfers were made in three installment payments. However, due to a period of
uncertainty of the conflict--which led to the `no war no peace' stance with Ethiopia,
there was a stalemate in the demobilization process. However, all development partners,
including those who did not directly contribute to the MDTF, agreed with the MTR's
recommendation for the Program to strengthen support for social and economic
reintegration activities. Of the funds that were made available, (US$38.9 million), about
US$19.4 was cancelled, although the GOE officially requested for the extension of the



                                            8
closing date of the MDTF in time (August 1, 2005). Of the funds that were made
available, (US$38.9 million), about US$19.4 was cancelled, as Government was not able
to request for the extension of the closing date of the MDTF in time. Under the Credit,
cost savings were identified under Categories 1B, 1-C and Works which were reallocated
to the social and economic reintegration component in line with the new realities.

17.     In line with MTR recommendations, the Social and Economic Reintegration
component was strengthened as per the amended DCA in order to reintegrate the DSs that
were already demobilized and contribute towards the achievement of the project PDO. A
results based action plan was developed and agreed upon putting more emphasis and
prominence to reintegration activities and resources were re-allocated accordingly.
Social reintegration continued to focus on: (i) supporting the most vulnerable DS; (ii)
mobilizing and supporting communities and the families of the vulnerable DS; (iii)
strengthening policy coherence and synergies between social integration initiatives.
Economic reintegration continued to emphasize; (i) community based rural development
programs- including cash for work activities; (ii) vocational training and; (iii) micro-
credit and business development services.

18.     The revisions made enabled the project to ensure that the target beneficiaries were
adequately supported throughout the project's envisaged implementation processes. The
Project component technical changes were approved by the Regional Vice President in
line with the IDA guidelines.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.    As already indicated in 1.6, the DCA was amended after MTR. The amendments
included: (i) refocusing and enhancing components' activities in line with the evolving realities
on the ground, (ii) enhancing the outcome indicators; and (iii) improving performance of
implementing partners through adoption of the Results based Action framework. The DCA was
amended four times on the following dates: February 24, 2005, extending the closing date;
December 23, 2005 DCA amendment to reflect MTR recommendations; December 17, 2007,
extension of closing date; and December 11, 2008 in order to reallocate resources among
Categories of Expenditure..

20.     The initial financing plan for the Demobilization and Reintegration Program was
US$197 million of which the IDA provided US$60 million for the EDR Project activities. By
the close of the Project, the IDA funding was in the amount of US$70.71 million due to
exchange rate gains against the SDR. The amount of US$10.71 million were used to meet the
scaled up activities under the Social and Economic Reintegration component as the balance of
the pledges under the MDTF were no longer available as discussed under Sections 1.6. A total
of SDR 64,345.14 was not used by the Project closing date and was therefore cancelled.

       2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.     The Government was committed to the peace process denoted by; (i) signing the
peace agreement; (ii) undertaking all the actions immediately prior to and subsequent to
the credit Negotiations and meeting the conditions agreed with the IDA; and (iii) the
establishment of the National Commission for the Demobilization and Reintegration
Program (NCDRP) by Proclamation No. 113, 2001 of April 10, 2001.

22.     Key recommendations from previous Bank operations were taken on board
including the following: (i) the need for full transition from demobilization to reinsertion
and reintegration in order to achieve the primary project objectives; (ii) the need to
provide a short term safety net to demobilized soldiers in order to facilitate a sustainable
reintegration; (iii) the need to use existing implementation structures; (iv) the creation of
viable long-term employment being closely linked to a conducive macroeconomic
environment and restoration of the private sector confidence; (v) the importance of
inclusion of psychosocial support services, awareness raising and sensitization about
HIV/AIDS; (vi) the need for collection of social economic data of each individual DS;
and (vii) inclusiveness of reintegration subprojects at community level being seen as vital
for engendering community cohesion.

23.     The EDRP design was deemed sound as a result of the following factors: (i) the
Government had some experience in demobilization in the mid-1990s, following the
liberation war; (ii) international best practice was available as the Bank had implemented
similar projects in other countries; and (iii) there was a pilot phase within the project
which allowed for a random testing of the systems and procedures put in place prior to
scaling up the demobilization process. In addition, the main components of the Project
were considered well designed and reasonably aligned to the PDO.

24.      The design identified critical risks and mapped out minimization measures. The
main external risk was the resumption of hostilities, for which the Bank had included a
remedy in the legal agreement. This risk was initially considered minimal, or at least
reduced by virtue of the signed peace agreement by both Eritrea and Ethiopia, and the full
deployment of the UN peace- keeping forces. At the Project level, risk mitigation
measures were internalized into the project, these included: (i) recruitment of highly
competent staff for the National Commission for the Demobilization and Reintegration
Program (NCDRP) to strengthen the human resource capacity gap found in the country,
(ii) capacity building inputs for other implementing partners; (iii) mainstreaming project
implementation activities within the line ministries and other existing specialized
agencies; and (iv) built-in safeguards for financial management, disbursement, and
procurement in the project documents as a preventive measure against possible
misappropriation or abuse of project funds for military spending, and to monitor directly
uses of project resources. Additionally, regarding misappropriation or uses of funds for
other purposes, Government expenditures were to be monitored by the IMF as part of the
consultations with Eritrea and the IDA in the context of assistance. A Management



                                             10
Information System (MIS) was developed and put in use, that increased the monitoring
capacity of the NCDRP, as attested to by the Institution and Technical Assessment of the
NCDRP and Implementing Partners' Report (December 2008).

25.      The main weakness in the design of Project was that outcomes indicators were not
initially articulated. This was corrected at MTR. In addition there were no baseline data
as this was an emergency project and most of the outcomes were only captured during
implementation through the beneficiary assessments and tracer studies.

2.2 Implementation

26.     Favorable Factors. A two-phased MTR was conducted in 2005 and it was
informed by the MTR Issues Paper and the Independent Evaluation Report (August 2005).
The MTR recommendations led to DCA amendment in order to address the operational
impediments that were constraining implementation of the social and economic
reintegration component. The main issues identified included: (i) capacity constraints of
relevant implementing partners, such as the case of the Ministry of Education; (ii)
constraints in the preparation of smaller subprojects for training and attachment of DSs;
and the related appraisals; and (iii) delays in processing subprojects led to slowing down
disbursements which also meant that the benefits at the receiving end by DSs was at a
slow pace. The key recommendations made at MTR and following the Independent
Evaluation (2005) was for the adoption of the community-based approach to the process
of reintegration, in order to engender community cohesion and broader community
economic gains. Another recommendation adopted at the restructuring process was the
results-based action framework to guide the implementation of agreed activities with
Government. The framework introduced service delivery standards, a measure which all
other implementing partners (IP) had adhered as a way to attain greater efficiency.
Strengthening of public works in Agriculture, and other sector program activities such as
fisheries, community based rehabilitation; in the rural development sub-component was
another factor that contributed to increasing the project's impact.

26.     The Government's decision in March of 2007 to appoint the Director in the Office
of the President to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project was
instrumental to improving the implementation rate of the Project. This action enhanced
the NCDRP's institutional backing and support. The change in institutional arrangement
resulted in faster decision making processes, the implementing partners being fully
mobilized, and demonstrating renewed commitment for the project to achieve the
development objectives.

27      Unfavorable Factors. The main unfavorable implementation issues included: (i)
the `no war, no peace' situation prevailing for most of the project's implementation,
affecting the efficiency with which the project was implemented. (ii) The gradual pull out
of the Development Partners from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Following the stalemate
in the implementation of the border demarcation, it had become clear that it was unlikely
that demobilization could have a positive impact as envisaged during the program design.
The development partners began to gradually disengage. The MDTF development



                                           11
partners were not an exception. In the course of implementation, other donors rolled
back on their pledged funding for the MDTF, as the demobilization program was
discontinued. This led, at MTR, to scaling down of EDRP activities of demobilization
and reinsertion hence only 104,400 against the planned 200,000 DSs were achieved; and
refocusing the remaining Project resources to conclude the reinsertion of the already
demobilized soldiers and enhancing reintegration support activities. The Bank's position
to refocus was plausible as it took care of the raised expectations of the already
demobilized soldiers by reallocating resources to reintegration activities. (iii) The drought
in the 2005, during the growing season and the economic difficulties in the country have
affected the positive impacts of the reintegration interventions insofar as the benefits that
DSs and community members accrued from the project through the micro­credit
activities have been largely eroded by the adverse effects of the crisis (source:
Beneficiary Assessment December 2008).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28.     The project's key performance Indicators (KPIs) were refined after MTR to
include PDO outcome indicators. This was important for the measurement of the
program outcomes and determining whether or not the Project development objectives
have been achieved. During implementation, the NCDRP commissioned two beneficiary
assessments, one in 2005, and in 2008; and an institutional assessment in 2008. These
studies captured some of the Project development impacts, and informed decisions at the
MTR and the ICR.

29.     The overall performance of the M&E during supervision was rated moderately
satisfactory, particularly in monitoring the processes and outputs as summarized by the
KPI Table 4 of this document. The project's MIS was instrumental for monitoring of the
DS activities at all levels, and played a valuable role in making socioeconomic data
available for management decisions. However, there were some weaknesses noted in
terms of the timely relaying of M&E data from decentralized project offices to the center,
and from sub-project implementing agencies to the NCDRP. This affected timely
reporting of the project activities.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

30.     Safeguards. Overall, the project had no reported safeguards policy issues; hence it
was rated satisfactory throughout the implementation stages. The project was rated as
category B at the design stage mainly due to its planned support to the DSs reintegration
activities that included income generating activities and the public works. The EDRP
built on the Environmental Assessment (EA) that was completed in October 2001 for the
Bank supported Emergency Reconstruction Program, while the EDRP's own EA was
completed six months after Project effectiveness. During the implementation there were
no environmental and social issues identified, as most of the mitigation measures had
been mainstreamed into the subproject cycle process.




                                             12
31.      Fiduciary. At the design stage, measures were adopted to mitigate the risk that
funds would be fungible and abused as discussed in Section 2.1. Therefore qualified
financial management staff were recruited and hired. Audit reports were received with
unqualified opinions throughout project implementation. At design, the overall
Procurement risk rating assessment was fair due to the previous experience of
implementing other Bank operations in the country and the effective collaborative
linkages established between the NCDRP, ECDF, ERP and HAMSET. During
implementation, Procurement was generally satisfactory, except in a case where IDA
could not grant a "No Objection" for pesticide inputs--as these were not in line with
Africa Region Pesticide Stockpile initiative. The Africa Region Pesticide Stockpile
initiative provides standard guidelines on the type of pesticides allowed for acquisition
and to be warehoused in bulk for future use. The Project had requested for a "No-
objection" to procure pesticide in bulk for the planned agricultural activities in support of
the farmer DSs and other community members. The negative effect of this was that the
project was not able to provide the required input to the beneficiaries, thus negatively
affecting the farm outputs. Annual post procurement reviews were carried out and
recommended actions followed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

32.     The NCDRP was a well functioning organization. At the time of the ICR Mission
in January 2009, its mandate was about to expire. Relevant staff, systems and equipment
of the NCDRP had been reduced, and were earmarked to be absorbed in other
government institutions, such as the Department of Social Welfare in the Ministry of
Labor and Human Welfare and Ministry of Agriculture. The Government's capacity has
been enhanced through the implementation of this project because it specifically had an
objective to build capacity of the implementing entities.

       3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

33.      Relevance of the objectives is considered substantial. The objectives of the
Project were still relevant to the country's development priorities as espoused in the
Government's Draft Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (draft I-PRSP) of April
2004 particularly in the section: Pillar II: Creating Income Generating Opportunities for
the poor. The IDA's Interim Strategy Note for the State of Eritrea (Report No. 42930-
ER) of May 15, 2008 which brought to the fore the following institutional development
priorities: (i) support to Human Development; and (ii) support basic infrastructure was in
line with the recommendations contained in the Draft I-PRSP. Through demobilization,
the purpose of the project was to alleviate manpower constraints faced by government
and private sector and in that way contribute to a resumption of critical economic activity.




                                             13
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

34.     The overall rating for the development outcomes is Moderately Satisfactory.
The ICR used the MOP PDO. The MOP described the program PDO and clearly
articulated the project objectives as follows: The overall development objectives of the
Governments Demobilization and Reintegration Program are to: (i) demobilize and
provide reinsertion support to about 200,000- in three phases; (ii) support the social and
economic reintegration of demobilized soldiers including strengthening of institutional
capacities of relevant government and local implementing partners; and support macro-
economic stability. The credit was to finance the demobilization of 60,000 soldiers
which constituted the first phase of the USD 197 million overall Program. The primary
benefit of the project (first phase of the program) was the return of 60,000 demobilized
soldiers to their communities to resume their economic life. The secondary benefit was
the re-allocation of resources from defense expenditures towards social and economic
investments. The amended DCA indicators were also used.


PDO 1: Demobilize 60,000 Soldiers by August 2005.
Rating: Satisfactory.

35.    The IDA supported Project effectively to demobilize the targeted 60,000 soldiers.
The MIS data indicates that the complete demobilization cycle with the issuance of
individual Identity Cards, and orientation provided at the pre-discharge medical and
HIV/AIDS procedures took an average of five days to complete a case out of the planned
ten days. There are no indications that any of those specific individuals that have been
demobilized under the Project have been remobilized.

PDO 2: Provision of Reinsertion Support to the Demobilized Soldiers.
Rating: Satisfactory.

36.     The rating is satisfactory because the Reinsertion TSN payments were seen to be
successfully managed; with 100% of the DSs receiving their due payments within the
scheduled timeframe (source: Independent Evaluation 2005). The TSN payments were to
be paid within the Band of US$300 ­ US$600 over a period of three months. The DSs
were paid at the lower band, ie US$300. A survey on the utilization of the reinsertion
cash payments indicated that 69% was used for sustaining households basic needs, 9%
for helping family and 6% on children's education, paying house rent 3%, dwelling
improvements 2%, and 1% for each category: savings in bank accounts, given to
spouse/partner, given to parents, meet costs for getting married, 2% for other uses, and
0% was squandered. Five percent was used for investment, pointing to the fact that the
social and economic reintegration objective was important to spur the DSs economic
investments. Thus the DSs were not left to destitution, the reinsertion payments were
efficiently executed, as demonstrated by the percentage of error at 0.004% against the
target of <4% according to the MIS data. The TSN payments clearly played an important
role in the DSs' resettlement process. The reinsertion payments accorded the DSs ability
to choose where to settle either in their original home location or elsewhere. According to


                                            14
the Beneficiary Survey (2008), 45% of sample DSs were staying in their places of origin
where they were taking active part in community development activities, including taking
up leadership positions. This demonstrates acceptance of the DSs and cohesion within the
community.

PDO 3: Social and Economic Reintegration.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

37.     At the close of the project, 85% of the DSs were employed; 52% of those
employed were self-employed. 87% (3,668) of the disabled DSs were employed while
2,270 62% of the disabled DSs were self employed (Beneficiary Assessment (BA) of
December 2008 and MIS data). The Project created 320,000 social and economic
reintegration opportunities of which 36% were taken up by the DSs, and the rest by
community members. These opportunities were reintegration projects that DSs could
choose to access, funded by the EDRP through implementing partners. The opportunities
included, training, micro credits employment programs and cash for work activities. The
opportunities were also available to communities at large. The BA found that the DSs
were at par with the counterpart community members in terms of economic status, while
the female DSs and disabled DSs were economically better-off than the average person in
the community. In part it is due to the DSs' access to training facilities which enabled
them to be absorbed by the job market and/or to establish themselves as self-employed,
others were enabled to access credits and became self employed. The status of the DSs
who settled in rural areas also changed in the positive direction as they had access to
productive land and were economically active. Close to 80% of the DSs indicated that
their self sufficiency had improved compared to 66% of the community members in the
same target areas who had also accessed the opportunities under the EDRP. Yet against
the backdrop of success, the BA found that about a third of the sample of DSs in the
survey indicated that their income levels were insufficient for achieving their desired
quality life as they were not able to meet their nutritional needs. Sixty four percent of the
DSs were involved in social community activities demonstrating that the transition and
the reintegration had been effective.

PDO 4: Mobilization and strengthening of the capacities of the Borrower's
implementing agencies.
Rating: Moderately satisfactory:

38.     This is more of an intermediate outcome. The Institutional Assessment
(December 2008) indicated that the capacities of implementing agencies were improved.
The performance based agreements with implementing partners were fully executed as
planned, while timely submission of reports was achieved in 93% of cases. Alignment of
the NCDRP activities with sector policies through mainstreaming of project
implementation into sector Ministries' work plans, and adherence to the business
standards agreed upon with the performance based action framework, brought about
efficiency. This notwithstanding, adherence also came about due to the Proclamation No.
113/2001, April 10 2001 establishing the NCDRP, which stated that public sector
organizations were required to cooperate in the implementation of the EDRP. These



                                             15
achievements notwithstanding, there were some weaknesses. Quarterly reports submitted
to the Bank more often than not required improvements in data quality and content. IDA
reviews indicated that the reports did not regularly capture outcomes of implementing
agencies achievements. In addition, the NCDRP did not adequately provide feedback to
the agencies based on their submitted reports. On balance, the objective of strengthening
the Borrower's agencies capacities was achieved.

3.3 Efficiency

39.    Not applicable for emergency operations.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

40.     The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. The project had substantial
relevance and impact and satisfactory efficacy. On the whole, the design of the PDOs
was relevant and responded sufficiently well to the emergency situation at hand as
discussed in Section 3.1. The project target of demobilizing 60,000 DS was achieved, the
reinsertion component was implemented with the required efficiency and the
reintegration component surpassed its overall targets. However, project implementation
took three more years to be completed after its initial closing date, a long delay for an
emergency project. There were shortcomings in the design of the M&E which were
effectively corrected after MTR.

       3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a).   Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

41.    The following are the impacts on:
       (a).   Poverty:
               Provision of a range of support activities aimed at economic
                 empowerment benefited an estimated 320,000 DSs and other
                 community members mainly through the provision of employment
                 opportunities, public works and general access to micro credits for
                 income generating. The public works sub-projects enhanced and
                 increased the stock of public goods and community assets. The project
                 also contributed to agricultural and environmental enhancement in the
                 communities through conservation subprojects.
               The project injected significant amounts of targeted cash into the urban
                 and rural economies at a critical time through the project activities it
                 financed, especially the TSN payments.
               Through the TSN the project provided support food security not only
                 for the DSs, but also to those that sold their wares/products to the DSs.
       (b). The figures on access to employment by the DSs indicate that of male DSs,
       91% were employed and that of all female DSs 74% were in employment (source:
       BA December 2008) which in overall is a significant achievement.


                                           16
       (c).    Social Development: The project contributed to enhance cohesion
       between the DSs and the community at large; this was due to the way the
       Reintegration component was revised to include the community based approach.
       Other noteworthy social achievements of the project are related to promotion of
       inclusiveness of the vulnerable DSs, i.e. HIV/AIDS infected, the disabled, the
       elderly and female household heads, as beneficiaries of the Project and their
       reintegration within their respective communities. For example, the project
       equipped the national orthopedic workshop and provided orthopedic support to
       3,150 of disabled DS and community beneficiaries. The psycho-social counseling
       engendered smooth reintegration of the vulnerable DSs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening


42.     The implementation of the Project was mainstreamed into existing government
structures and other private/public entities. There was specific focus on capacity building
and enhancement, which will remain after the project's life. The skills, proposals and
appraisal templates as provided in the OM will be of benefit to similar future programs
and projects, and will live beyond the life of the NCDRP.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) - None

       3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
       Workshops
       (Optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes

43.   Refer to summary of the Beneficiary Assessment at Annex 5. Also Refer to the
Government's ICR at Annex 7 as it has drawn much from the findings of the Beneficiary
Assessment.

       4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial.

44.    The risk to the development outcomes is considered substantial mainly because of
the factor outside project control. While at community and individual levels the
outcomes could be sustained all factors being equal, at national level it is more of a
challenge. At community level, the involvement of local institutions (village committees)
in the management of the assets created is a positive factor due to the ownership and
social capital that evolved. At individual level, due to the current global economic
challenges, and specific economic problems in Eritrea, it is possible that some of the
project gains can be eroded. This condition is applicable for both the DSs and the
community at large.

45.     Capacity built at the national in the implementing partners and the NCDRP, is
likely to be sustained even in the absence of the project. However, at this level, the



                                            17
challenge is in ensuring sustained financial flows to the implementing partners to in-turn
sustain the gains that have been realized through the Project activities and outcomes.

46.      The other challenge posing a risk to the development outcomes is the continued
"no peace no war" situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Since the cessation of
hostilities in 2000, implementation of the agreements is still at an impasse. It is clear that
should conflict break out the positive impacts of the EDRP will dissipate through likely
remobilization and reduction in expenditures for social services.

       5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Banks performance is rated satisfactory.

47.     The project was consistent and in line with the elements of the Interim Support
Strategy (ISS) and the State of Eritrea's prospects for the war to peace transition. This
reflects a relatively high degree of efficiency in designing a project of this magnitude.
The preparatory team studied the operating environment, articulated the possible risks
and proposed mitigation measures; the design period can be considered relatively short.
On the request of Government, the team mobilized other donors and UN agencies to
participate in the Government program.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


48.     Adequate staff time and resources were spent on supervision. The Bank clearly
guided the implementation and ensured that the DCA was complied with. This is
confirmed through the supervision mission documentation (i.e. Aide Memoires and Back-
to-Office Reports). In addition to regular task team supervision missions in country, the
Project benefited from day-to-day support from team members based in the Bank's
country office in Asmara. Moreover, the Project team included staff and expert
consultants with the full range of specialties related to this Project, including financial
management, procurement, community development and safeguards specialists. Donor
and NGO coordination was emphasized and in some instances supervision and
implementation missions were jointly organized. The Bank team prepared an Issues
Paper and the encouraged the NCDRP to commission the Independent Evaluation. These
two documents informed the MTR effectively and the subsequent restructuring. The
Bank team quickly responded to the emerging issues including those that required the
DCA amendments, budget re-allocations within components. Overall, amidst the difficult
political economy environment, the team provided quality supervision which paid off by
turning around a problem project in the last three years leading to the PDO being rated
Moderately Satisfactory. The above notwithstanding, the Bank team lost a chance at
MTR to reformulated the PDOs to remove the inconsistencies as they appear in the DCA,
the MOP and the Technical Assistance.


                                             18
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

49.     Rating: Overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory in view of
intensive and quick preparation, appropriate guidance during project implementation. The
above notwithstanding, the Bank team lost a chance at MTR to reformulated the PDOs to
remove the inconsistencies as they appear in the DCA, the MOP and the Technical
Assistance


 Borrower Performance
50.     The State of Eritrea prepared the project concept document, requested for the
Bank support, prepared the pre-appraisal/appraisal jointly with the Bank team, negotiated
and fulfilled effectiveness conditions.


(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

51.      There was high level political support for the project. This was evidenced through
briefs to the Minister of National Development (who was then responsible for AID
Coordination in Eritrea); by the preparation and supervision missions; meetings held with
various ministers and director generals and zoba and sub-zoba political leaderships. The
existence of the NCDRP duly staffed with eminent Eritreans that have given policy
guidance, and the appraisal processes supported by zonal and district staff; the
involvement of NGOs and the private sector in the implementation process; and the
provision of all counterpart funds (amidst resource scarcity) though sometimes late; all
attest to good performance of the borrower. However, the policy shift arising out of the
`no war no peace' situation that resulted in the halting of the Demobilization process,
slowed down the zeal of a number of stakeholders even within Government resulting in
prolonged implementation period (from 2002-2008 instead of 2002-2005). Subsequently,
support from implementing line ministries especially for the reintegration component
dwindled. It was not until the Government appointed the Director in the Office of the
President as the Chairman of the Commission and renewed support by Ministries was
reinvigorated. Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

52.     The implementation agency's performance is rated satisfactory. The agency
prepared all the project preparatory documents, facilitated IDA missions and prepared
background papers for discussions. Procedurally, the NCDRP implemented the project to
the satisfaction of all stakeholders. The project outputs targets were surpassed in many
instances and the IDA resources were all disbursed, there were no qualified audit reports
during implementation. This notwithstanding, the NCDRP never officially emitted a
criticism of the implementing agencies whenever the implementing agencies were not
performing according to agreed standard as in the case of the SMCP. As many of the


                                            19
implementation partners (IPs) were government ministries and departments, they were
initially slow in implementation, the NCDRP avoided creating tensions; hence it took the
change in leadership of the NCDRP in February 2007 in order to improve the situation.

53.    The NCDRP complied with the IDA, GoE, Zoba and community guidelines and
technically guided the implementation of the project by providing on the spot answers to
implementation questions. The agency commissioned a number of studies including
MTR and end of project studies undertaken by both international and local consultants. It
also adhered to both environmental and social safeguard policy requirements and
implemented the project according to the DCA requirements. While the agency had an
M&E system, it hardly reached the zoba's and sub-zoba, and could not always produce
good quality consolidated quarterly and annual reports.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

54.     Rating: Overall Borrower's performance is moderately satisfactory based on the
fact that the policy shifts arising out of the `no war no peace' situation that resulted in the
halting of the Demobilization process, negatively affected the project implementation. It
also caused a shift among the donors, which rolled back their initial pledged support and
slowed down the initial zeal of a number of stakeholders even within Government
resulting in prolonged implementation period (from 2002-2008 instead of 2002-2005).

       6. Lessons Learned

55.    The main lessons learned with this Project, can be summarized as follows:

       (a).    Political Economy challenges reduced the effectiveness of the Project.
       The shift in political situation in the country referred to as "no war, no peace"
       prevailing for most of the Project implementation did not allow the GoE to
       demobilize all the 200,000 soldiers as envisaged, leading to the adjustments in the
       Project which were made during the MTR in 2005 to partially reflect the new
       situation. Subsequently, it could no longer be argued that the project assisted the
       GoE in the reduction of people under arms. It should be noted that much of the
       military is dominated by participation in the agriculture sector of the economy.

       (b).    Unrealized funding pledges can affect project implementation and
       results. The funding of the Program partially dependant through a Multi-Donor
       Trust Funds (MDTF) created a situation in which the implementation of some of
       the planned activities had to be cancelled due to the lack of funds. The
       uncertainties over the resolution of the border disputes between Eritrea and
       Ethiopia, which casted doubts about the continuity of the demobilization process,
       largely contributed to this problem.

       (c).   Project management effectiveness is enhanced by support arising
       from highest level of government. A strong sense of ownership and support
       received from the highest levels in Government ­ especially in early and late


                                              20
stages of the project ­ contributed significantly to consistent and effective
management of the Project by the NCDRP, despite difficult overall economic and
political circumstances. The high level support enabled the NCDRP to mobilize
other actors in the country behind common policy goals. The NCDRP was well
organized, well staffed and thus able to initiate and pursue new activities once
agreed upon. The GoE had managed an EDRP before in the 1990s, without much
external support, this added to the strength and confidence of the Commission.


(d).     Timely reinsertion payments effectively delivered immediate benefits
to the demobilized soldiers. The reinsertion support in terms of cash transitional
safety nets (TSN) was implemented in full and on time, and played an important
role in the DS' resettlement process. About 85 percent of the DSs benefitted from
the TSN cash transfer and other services to sustain their immediate livelihoods or
to support family members. This key component of the Project was from the
outset foreseen to absorb more than half of the total Project costs.

(e).    The social reintegration process holds the key for the overall DS
reintegration process. In the initial phases of reintegration process the social
acceptance of those returning from the war into the communities played a major
role, even before any further reintegration support had been provided. Social
reintegration was positive and showed to be essential for the success of the overall
socio-economic reintegration. By the end of the project one quarter of the DSs
have played a leadership role in the community where they lived.

(f).    Targeting reintegration support to the DS in combination with
support to the wider community ­ with a gradual shift towards the latter ­
lead to effective achievement of results. The double-tiered targeting approach
of the project with regard to reintegration support was effective in reaching the
DSs, while not upsetting the other war-affected groups. Following the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) the targeting shifted increasingly from the individual to the
communities. Utilization of existing structures for reintegration support also
resulted in a broader range of project beneficiaries. The effective combination of
individual and community targeting might well be somewhat specific for Eritrea,
since in the initial post-war period a high level of solidarity existed and the GoE
kept possible discontent in later stages under control.

(g.)    Importance of using the institutional structures in place. One of the
strongest pillars in the design of the EDRP was the use of existing institutions in
government, public and private sectors for implementation of program activities.
This led to the development of capacities in the participating institutions; it
allowed for creating strong linkages to existing policies. This notwithstanding, it
was not always easy for the NCDRP to enforce requirements/quality standards
for sub-projects reports since they did not want to stir up tensions with other
ministries.

Rating: Satisfactory: While the Program target was to demobilize 200,000 soldiers, only
104, 000 were actually demobilized, however, for the IDA funded Project, the target was
fully achieved. The project successfully and effectively demobilized 60,000 soldiers by
December, 2004 as part of Phase 1 and 2 of demobilization. Demobilization was


                                          24
preceded by a pilot intervention whereby 5,000 soldiers were demobilized. The pilot was
part of the MDTF supported activities under demobilization policy. The purpose of the
pilot was to test the systems put in place for the demobilization procedures and process.
The component's indicator targets were fully achieved as per the Table 1.1 above. The
processes included:

(a).   Defining demobilization criteria, a logistical plan for transporting the DSs to the
discharge centers;

(b).    Disclosing information to the selected soldiers for demobilization to avoid raising
widespread expectations; setting up an appeals mechanism for use by the selected
soldiers;
(c).    Collection of social economic data while still at their respective the duty stations
in the army. This served as baseline information. It was used for triangulation to avoid
errors in implementing the demobilization process;

(d).    Conducting the discharge process which included: transporting soldiers to the
discharge centre, verification of ID's, discharge formality which entailed handing in the
military ID and obtaining a civilian ID, at which point the person became a DS, a
beneficiary of the EDRP, receiving pre-discharge orientation on topic which included: a
range of project benefits, implementation arrangements, orientation on health issues
including HIV/AIDS, civil rights and duties; medical screening; and transportation to the
community of settlement.

      Rating: Satisfactory.      The component surpassed the target for the error margin
      performing at 0.004% within a target of 4%. This indicates that the process of
      reinsertion was carried out judiciously. Procedures were in place, there was
      transparency during the execution of activities and the implementing staff was
      diligent. This activity had two subcomponents- (i) Basic Transition Support which
      was payment of US$600 equivalence per person, and (ii) Enhanced support to
      Vulnerable Groups. Eligible DS received the minimum of transitional safety net
      payments and transport and clothing allowance as per schedule.

Rating: Satisfactory. The component performance surpassed the initial Project targets.
The component provided social and economic reintegration opportunities to DSs and
non-DSs alike. Of the total number of opportunities that were available, 36% were taken
up by DSs. The communities where DS settled accrued substantial benefits from the
Project even though they were not included according to the initial design of the Project.
Restructuring of project component that took place at MTR, in which the community
based approach to reintegration process was introduced. This approach accorded the
receiving communities and its members as beneficiaries of the Project and at the end
proved to be the right approach to the reintegration process. According to references from
Aide Memoires, this was one of the components that had a slow uptake initially.

             against the original target of 10,000 will be reached beyond the project life since this
             is a service accessed on a needs basis. Large numbers of community based
             rehabilitation workers will remain a vital resource in the community supporting the
             disabled DSs and other community members with tools to cope with life and raise

Rating: Satisfactory. All the set output indicators for the component have been achieved
demonstrating the efficiency with which the project has been executed. To be noted that
MIS provided a strong support for the implementation of the project. The component
excelled on support for female soldiers accessing 65% of the training in business skills.
A total of 44 subprojects were implemented through which the communities and the DS
both accessed the job opportunities, earning a wage that enabled them to acquire basic
needs for their homes, particularly improved food security. Close to 30% of the worker
were DSs. The benefits of the cash for work program were not limited to participant
households or DSs that earned wages, as a subproject it supported soil and water
conservation to the benefit of the wider community.

*In these indicators the words `loans' and `micro-credits' were used interchangeably.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The component has met the set targets. DSs accessed
business development skills and accessed credits. Their repayment rate was quiet high at
90% failing by eight percentage points to reach the industry standard at 98%. The BA
(December 2008), found out that the credit interest at 16% had dissuaded some cautious
and risk averse DSs from accessing the available credit.

Background to Assessment

65.     Following the signing of the Peace Accord in Algiers, on December 12th 2000,
the Government of Eritrea requested the international donor community to launch a
multi-donor assessment mission in order to prepare a comprehensive demobilization and
reintegration program. The mission was supported by the World Bank, UNDP, USAID,
the Embassies of Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and funds from the Consultant
Trust Funds from Belgium and Switzerland. The mission worked with the State of Eritrea
to prepare the Eritrea Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Program (EDRP).
The overall development objectives of the Program were to:

       (a).    Demobilize and provide reinsertion support to up to 200,000 soldiers, in
       three phases, over a period of 18-24 months;
       (b).   Support the social and economic reintegration of demobilized soldiers into
       communities including strengthening of institutional capacities of relevant
       government and local implementing partners; and
       (c). Support the macro-economic stability.

66.     The Program comprised of three main components: (i) demobilization; (ii)
reinsertion support in the form of a transitional safety net; and (iii) social and economic
reintegration. In November 2004, as part of the midterm review process, an Independent
Evaluation was commissioned after the Government and Development Partners agreed on
its merit. This evaluation noted that despite the considerable and high standard of
preparatory activities and capacity building supported by the Technical Assistance
Program, two years after the start of Phase I demobilization, reintegration service
delivery to DS had not begun, and the reintegration budget remained largely unspent. In
light of this situation and continued tension along the border region with Ethiopia the Mid
Term Review recommended a change of focus within the EDRP from demobilization to
social and economic reintegration.

67.     In order to provide a clear outline of how reintegration support would be provided
in line with both national priorities and the social and economic reintegration pillars
identified for the program, a results based action framework was developed. This
identified a series of cross cutting objectives as well as subdividing reintegration
activities into three cluster areas:

       a.    Rural reintegration cluster, which included a cash for work scheme, an
       income generating assistance scheme, and agricultural support scheme;




                                            34
       b.      Vulnerable groups reintegration cluster, which included a community
       based rehabilitation program, a medical assistance scheme and an HIV/AIDS
       scheme; and
       c.      A business (non-agricultural) reintegration cluster, which included a
       training program scheme.

68.      Key Result Areas and Performance Indicators for prioritized sub-projects were
identified for each cluster. The framework was based on realistic schedules and budget
projections within the deadline of the extended program completion date and reallocated
global budgets. The Development Credit Agreement was also amended to reflect the new
realities and Key Performance Indicators were refined. Implementing partners were then
invited to apply to conduct projects aimed at meeting these objectives, while remaining in
line with national priorities. The revised approach shifted reintegration processes from
the individual to the community. This shift was seen as essential to re-establish and
strengthen community based structures that would ensure effective DS reintegration, and
the sustainability of the communities into which they returned.

69.     To date, 44 reintegration sub-projects have been developed, the majority of which
have been fully completed by implementing partners. Through these reintegration sub-
projects, over 251,989 demobilized soldiers and other community members, have been
assisted, and benefited from a range of reintegration opportunities.

Assessment Objectives

70.     The current Beneficiary Assessment was commissioned by the NCDRP to
identify the impact of the program's activities on these beneficiaries, to assess the social
and economic status of the demobilized soldier population vis-à-vis community members
of a similar demographic strata and to determine the extent to which relevant project Key
performance indicators as outlined in the Development Credit Agreement have been met.
In addition, the study sought to gain a comprehensive picture of the current status of DS
and the communities in which they live across Eritrea. In addition, gathering information
on the impact that different programs and projects supported through the DRP have had
on recipient DS and communities as well as their indirect impacts on those that have not
been targeted by project. Moreover, the Assessment enhanced the understanding of the
processes through which project components have been implemented, including the
methodology behind processes of targeting and implementation.

Assessment Findings

71.     Economic Reintegration The assessment found that DS are no longer
economically more vulnerable than others in the community and that the NCDRP has
certainly contributed to this situation. Furthermore, specifically targeted groups such as
female and disabled DS were found to be economically better off than the average
Eritrean of the same class and category. The NCDRP has therefore met its economic
reintegration objective. Economic participation rates are high with employment levels of
DS measured at 85% (91.2% of males and 74.4% of females), which is10% higher than



                                            35
that of the other members of the communities within which they live. In addition, this
level of employment is five percent higher than that measured in the 2005 assessment.
Employment levels of female DS, targeted as a vulnerable group by the Program, were
measured at 73.4% that is higher than that for other women. Likewise, employment of
disabled DS was extraordinarily high being just a couple of percentage points lower than
the one for able-bodied DS. Furthermore, employment was also measured as being
relatively stable with three quarters of employed DS remaining in the same job since their
demobilization.

72.     Amongst male DS, types of employment were divided evenly across those who
were employees, self-employed in non-agriculture sectors, with level of self-employment
in agriculture being relatively slightly lower. As for the female DS, most of which
worked either as employees or were self-employed in non-agriculture sectors. Across all
DS, those in younger age cohorts were more likely to be in formal employment as
employees or self-employed in non-agriculture sectors as opposed to older DS who were
most likely to be working in the agricultural sector.

73.      A little over four in five male and nine in ten female DS worked only in one job
and claimed that this provided a sufficient income to live on or was the best they could
achieve. However, a little under one third of all DS claimed that their income levels were
insufficient to provide a quality of life that they would like. More perturbing revelation is
that a little over half of DS claimed that their nutritional levels deteriorated over the past
two years and one in five claimed they rarely have sufficient food for a balanced diet.
These DS were drawn across all age cohorts and were not gender differentiated, although
older male DS were more likely to fall in these categories. These figures however were
not DS specific with 65% of non-DS households identifying deteriorations in nutritional
levels over the same period of time. It is thus important that those members of the
community both DS and non-DS that are sliding towards malnutrition due to conditions
of food insecurity are supported.

74.     Social Reintegration. With regards to social reintegration, the assessment found
that all of the NCDRP supported interventions assisted DS in achieving this goal. DS
increasingly belong to more social groups and socialize more than three years ago, with
one in four playing some kind of active leadership role. In addition, the overwhelming
majority trusts in the rest of the community and in turn are trusted by their fellow
citizens; DS are encouraged and committed to working with others for societal benefits;
and feel a sense of togetherness and closeness within their communities which is
reciprocated by members of the communities. Three quarter of DS also feel happy and in
control of their own development, which they link closely to community development.
Almost all feel valued by their communities for the contributions they make towards
community development, which is reflected in community's expressed feelings about
them. These positive trends are slightly higher amongst the younger DS of both genders
and consistent across the urban rural divide and the entire country.




                                             36
75.     Some social challenges remain salient as far as women and disabled DS are
concerned, but this is not attributed to the fact that they are DS, but to societal
perceptions and cultural prejudices, which are accorded to other similar members in
society. Nevertheless, the assessment found that female and disabled DS were, when
viewed relative to individuals of similar characteristics in the community, socially well
integrated, a factor many attributed to improved economic opportunities and predicated
on personal material realization. The NCDRP has therefore met its targeted social
reintegration objective.

Program Effectiveness, Efficiency and Relevance

76.     The program was effective in meeting beneficiary needs by offering a package of
essential services to support DS and thus prevent this social group from becoming a
vulnerable category within society. Overall, the program was also relevant and efficient
in meeting DS beneficiary basic needs. It is also worth noting that in addition to the
benefits accrued to the receiving communities those where the DS reside, there were
other direct beneficiaries within the program's implementation structures namely: the
Community Based Rehabilitation Workers who received skills training, credit and loan
officers who found employment and NCDRP staff who were able to build their own
capacities as well as those with whom they worked. Furthermore, community structures
such as Village Committees also enhanced their social capital and development skills
honed by the process and remain valuable entities with potentials to drive further
development agenda in the beneficiary communities. With regard to efficiency, the
deployment of implementing partners and community structures working together,
strengthened by a well-thought working procedures, has enabled the program to reach a
wider circle of beneficiaries.

Concluding Comments

77.     The NCDRP's success with the DS social and economic re-integration can be
attributed to the following factors: (a) it had at the outset a clear vision and mission
statement; (b) a solid institutional structure set up; (c) a competent and committed staff;
(d) an effective program implementation structure; (e) regular and systematic monitoring
and evaluation of each of the components; and (f) a rich data-base supplemented by
regular commissioning of relevant studies.

78.     In addition, the success of the Program lies in the fact that the NCDRP fitted well
into the priorities of sector ministries and zobas while engaging jointly in their efforts.
NCDRP was able to raise additional resources whenever these were made available to
them, enabled them to accelerate socio-economic reintegration of the DS and to reach
wider circle of beneficiaries through community empowerment. By building upon the
existing structures and a network of implementing partners, no parallel Project structures
were created, hence costs were reduced and the sustainability of interventions was clearly
increased.




                                            37
79.     In conclusion, it is important to highlight that the success of the Program was
predicated on the use of a Community Based approach to Program implementation whose
various interventions and support schemes were mutually supportive providing synergies
to a series of benefits that reinforced one another. These benefits have not only facilitated
the reintegration of DS into their communities and allowed most to be self-reliant but
have also acted as both a social safety net (e.g. through the program activities: CFW,
CBR, medical support, HIV/AIDS support) enabled to detect those falling into poverty
and a social cargo net (e.g. through training, IGA) on which individuals can prevent entry
to negative mobility spiral or begin to climb out of poverty and/or build sustainable
futures.

80.     It can thus be concluded that the complex operation supported by the NCDRP
have been able to provide essential support to DS and prevent them from becoming a
vulnerable category within society. Vulnerable groups however still exist in these
communities and thus it is recommended that the experience gained from the
implementation of EDRP may serve as a concrete reference on how to develop a holistic
package of assistance with opportunities to other vulnerable groups within Eritrean
society in the future.

SUMMARY

81.    Following the signing of the Peace Accord in Algiers, on December 12, 2000, the
Government of Eritrea (GOE) requested the international donor community to launch a multi-
donor assessment mission in the second half of January 2001 in order to prepare a
comprehensive Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Program (EDRP). The World
Bank (WB), UNDP, USAID, the Embassies of Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and
Consultant Trust Funds from Belgium and Switzerland supported this mission. The Mission
worked with the State of Eritrea to prepare the Eritrean Emergency Demobilization and
Reintegration Program and the National Commission for Demobilization and Reintegration
(NCDRP) was established by proclamation No. 113 of April 10, 2001, mandated to coordinate
the program.

82.     The Program development objectives were to (i) Demobilize and provide reinsertion
support to up to 200,000 soldiers in three phases, over a period of 18-24 months; (ii) Support
social and economic reintegration of demobilized soldiers into communities including
strengthening of institutional capabilities of relevant government and local implementing
partners; and (iii)Contribute to Marco-economic stability. The project had three main
components: (i) Demobilization, (ii) Reinsertion and (iii) Reintegration. The total number of
DSs covered through the program was 104,400 out of the planned 200,000. Of the 104,000,
there were 5,000 who were demobilized during the pilot, while 60,000 were demobilized
through the Project supported by the IDA. All DSs including the disabled DSs were reinserted
and fully reintegrated into their respective communities by December 2008 when the project
closed.

83.     The implementation arrangements, particularly for the reintegration were mainstreamed
into the existing structures in the GoE sector ministries and departments, the private sector and
Non-governmental organizations in order to build capacity and enhance the implementing
partners (IPs) operational skills. The IPs included the Ministry of Health, Ministry of
Agriculture, Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare, Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Tourism,
the National Union of Eritrean Women (NUEW), the Seghen Construction Company and the
Eritrean Communications and Development Institute. By the end of the project, the IPs had
significantly improved in their capacity and skills through the performance based action
framework that was adopted during the Project implementation phase.

84.      The project implemented a total of 44 reintegration subprojects creating 353,649
reintegration opportunities in the communities of which, 127,438 were taken up by the DSs.
Some DSs obtained loans for income generating activities; while 973 accessed training which
later enabled them to be employed in the relevant fields. Through the vulnerable cluster
activities, disabled DSs and other HIV/AIDS affected persons received specialized support that
helped them to gain confidence. Apart from the psychosocial support, the project rehabilitated
the orthopedic centre which was accessed by 3,150 persons by the close of the project, (these
included the DSs and the community members at large). Apart from these benefits accruing to




                                           40
individuals, the project through the Soil and Water Conservation has positively contributed to
arresting further environmental degradation.

85.    The GoE ICR is positive on all counts of the assessment of the design and
implementation of the Project, including the Program. The ratings assigned by the GoE ICR are
highly satisfactory for demobilization, reinsertion reintegration and the PDO is also upgraded to
highly satisfactory based on the findings of the BA.
86.       Lessons Learnt. The following are listed as some of the Borrower's lessons learnt:
      (a). Strong Government commitment in mobilizing key national actors behind common
      policy goals was a necessary pre-condition to the success of the EDRP.
      (b). Conducting socio-economic profile of the DSs in the early planning stages is
      important to design sub-projects and services that are responsive to the specific needs and
      characteristics of those being demobilized.
      (c). Improved selection criteria and appropriate training provided--based on needs and
      capacity of DSs, enabled the attainment of cost effective interventions.
      (d). Joint supervision and progress monitoring by all stakeholders was very important in
      implementing subprojects resulting in the subprojects' sustainability.
      (e). The set of subprojects, comprised of community based rehabilitation, Soil and Water
      Conservation and Income Generating Activities were complementary to national and sector
      development plans, strategies and activities as these were mainstreamed.
      (f). Targeting of women soldiers was consistent with Government policies, and took into
      account the diversity among women, with respect to their vulnerabilities, age and capacities.

87       Sustainability. The following are the aspects of sustainability for the project
      (a). Most EDRP subprojects were implemented by line ministries, and these were
      integrated into existing sector programs without creating parallel structures.
      (b). The inclusive criteria for access to the DRP reintegration programs, i.e. the inclusion
      of IDPs, returnees, deportees and other war affected persons at the community level,
      promoted community cohesion as an integral part of the broader post-war economic
      recovery process.
      (c). Capacity was enhanced in IPs and the transfer of professional manpower and expertise
      following the closure of the NCDRP will also contribute to the sustainability of the social
      and economic reintegration program. Investment in capacity building promoted added value
      and sustainability beyond the scope of the program.
