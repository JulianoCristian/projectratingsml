2) support the social and economic reintegration of\n            demobilized soldiers, including strengthening of\n            institutional capacities of relevant government and local\n            implementing partners; and 3) support macroeconomic\n            stability. This Credit , constituting the first phase of the\n            Program finances the demobilization of 60,000 soldiers.\n            There are three project components: demobilization,\n            reinsertion support in the form of a transitional safety net\n            (TSN); and social and economic reintegration. Activities\n            under the first component include: assembly; identification;\n            collection of socioeconomic data; pre-discharge orientation;\n            and transport to communities of return. With the second\n            component, demobilized soldiers will receive allowances to\n            cover his/her personal or family's basic material\n            needs. Additional support will be provided to demobilized\n            soldiers with severe or moderate disability and those with\n            severe chronic illness. The third component focuses\n            attention on these vulnerable groups: female soldiers, those\n            who were disabled because of war, and HIV positive soldiers.\n            Activities include information and sensitization, social and\n            economic information and referral services, counseling, and\n            strengthening of social capital. Economic activities are\n            designed to develop financial self-sufficiency"}, "docdt": "2002-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
