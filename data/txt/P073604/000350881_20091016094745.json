           Program Project for Eritrea had a moderately satisfactory\n            outcome and a substantial risk to development outcome. Both\n            the Bank and the borrower performances were moderately\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned include: (1)\n            Political economy challenges reduced the effectiveness of\n            the project. The shift in political situation in the country\n            prevailing for most of the project implementation did not\n            allow the Government of Eritrea to demobilize all the\n            200,000 soldiers as envisaged, leading to the adjustments in\n            the project which were made during the MTR in 2005 to\n            partially reflect the new situation. (2) Unrealized funding\n            pledges can affect project implementation and results. (3)\n            Project management effectiveness is enhanced by support\n            arising from highest level of the Government. The high level\n            support enabled the NCDRP to mobilize other actors in the\n            country behind common policy goals. (4) Timely reinsertion\n            payments effectively delivered immediate benefits to the\n            demobilized soldiers (DS). (5) The social reintegration\n            process holds the key for the overall DS reintegration\n            process. (6) Targeting reintegration support to the DS in\n            combination with support to the wider community with a\n            gradual shift towards the latter lead to effective\n            achievement of results. (7) Importance of using the\n            institutional structures in place."}, "docdt": "2009-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
