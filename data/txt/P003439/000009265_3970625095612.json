A\n            technical assistance component is included to effectively\n            implement the project and to strengthen the operations of\n            ABC. At full development, the value of the incremental\n            output from the project would be about US$140 million p.a.\n            The project would benefit directly some 16,000 families from\n            increased production and incomes, and generate additional\n            employment equivalent to 61,000 full time jobs."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
