providing finance for the\n            purchase of an earthmoving unit for the construction and\n            maintenance of 250 km of earth roads, the construction of\n            bridges and culverts for these earth roads, and the\n            construction of about 60 km of all-weather roads; (c)\n            provide schooling facilities for farmers' children\n            through the construction of 26 primary schools providing\n            some 102 classrooms; (d) make available better health\n            facilities by constructing and equipping two health centers\n            and by financing the purchase of equipment for an already\n            built health center; and (e) encourage community development\n            by constructing three community centers."}, "docdt":
