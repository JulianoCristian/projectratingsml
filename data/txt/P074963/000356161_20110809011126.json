were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible; the Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was also\n            highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: setting\n            up a strong institutional basis for coordinated planning and\n            regulation is critical to the success of urban transport\n            projects. Interactions with the borrower and beneficiaries\n            should take place in a context of their choosing. The impact\n            of ongoing changes in policy, governance, and institutional\n            frameworks in countries like Nigeria should not be\n            underestimated. Allow a measure of flexibility in the design\n            and set reasonable targets. A good project monitoring system\n            is necessary for effective management-close monitoring\n            combined with extensive consultations allows for timely\n            adjustments. Implementation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a\n            big challenge and requires considerable up front discussions\n            and consensus building. Use transportation planning to sort\n            out BRT and other alternatives."}, "docdt": "2011-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
