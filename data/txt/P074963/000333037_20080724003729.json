      patterns, and the flow of traffic in the metropolitan area.\n            While little if any land will be acquired under the project,\n            some land acquisition will be necessary in the later years\n            of implementation, and resettlement of increasing numbers of\n            traders, and transporters will be necessary over the life of\n            the project. Moreover, many areas within the right-of-way\n            have been occupied by market, and itinerant vendors, stall\n            holders, private transport providers, and street dwellers.\n            Therefore, this resettlement action plan (RAP) is presented\n            following the Laws of Nigeria, and Bank requirements on\n            involuntary resettlement, to minimize the extent of land\n            acquisition, and resettlement, providing compensation to\n            displaced people, and allowing a share in project benefits.\n            Compensation will be provided to displaced people for land\n            or income losses, household or residential plots losses,\n            including lost access to properties as a result of the\n            project construction. Vendor, or other business fees will\n            also be compensated, while a census will be conducted to\n            verify the occupancy status of displaced people, as a matter\n            of principle, and practical necessity, to avoid\n            opportunistic encroachment. Land replacement will be\n            stipulated as per the Land Use Act, and local or state\n            governments will be responsible for such replacement, and\n            associated costs, including transfer costs. Compensation\n            will be paid based on the value of assets, be it for\n            buildings and structures, crops, or even future rents costs.\n            Grievance mechanisms, based on a consultative process, will\n            provide opportunities to redress complaints, and, monitoring\n            arrangements shall ensure adequate resettlement activities."}, "docdt": "2008-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
