executive summary 
Introduction 
The Lagos State Government (LASG), through the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport 
Authority (LAMATA) under the Lagos Urban Transport Project (LUTP) plans to upgrade and 
improve the road network and traffic facilities at specific locations within the metropolis. 
Lagos State is the smallest by landmass of the 36 states in Nigeria but has the second 
highest population next to Kano state (by the yet to be made official recent national 
population census of 2006). This is over five percent of the national estimate. Based on a 
UN study and the State’s Regional Master Plan, the State is estimated to have about 15 
million inhabitants, and this population is expected to increase to 25 million by the year 
2015 at the current growth rate of 6% (World Urbanization Prospects, 2003 revision). The 
state contains the largest manufacturing sector and provides employment to over 45% of 
the skilled manpower in the country. 
 
Part of the cardinal objective of the LUTP is to undertake traffic management activities 
towards ensuring efficient and effective movement of traffic in metropolitan Lagos. In line 
with these objectives LAMATA have decided to improve the Traffic Management System 
(TSM) of four (4) junctions within Lagos metropolis referred to as group B and D 
junctions.  
 
TSM Group B and D roads and Junctions programme is initiated to improve the problem of 
traffic congestion in some selected junctions and roads within Lagos metropolis. It is 
aimed at alleviating the perennial traffic congestion problems experienced in Lagos on a 
daily basis, which is occasioned by indecent traffic management especially by commercial 
bus operators, narrowness of the roads and junctions or indiscriminate street trading on 
road sidewalks and drainages.  These junctions are: 
 
Group B Junctions: 
¾\03
Lawanson Bus Stop (both sides with adjoining streets) 
¾\03
Dopemu road (both sides with adjoining streets) 
While the Group D junctions are: 
¾\03
Old Iyana Ipaja rd/Pen Cinema 
¾\03
Fagba junction (Fagba/Iju rd) 
Based on the foregoing, LAMATA secured an assistance of the Word Bank to conduct 
studies of the likely persons to be affected by the proposed project and prepare a 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the four Junctions. 
 
The objective of the RAP is to clarify the principles and procedures that will govern the 
mitigation of adverse social impacts induced by project operations. Specifically, the RAP is 
designed to ensure:

· 
All types of losses are identified, clearly defined and properly categorized to 
reflect the nature of the loss.  
· 
A standard or measure for defining eligibility and entitlement in order to have a 
fair basis for assessing compensation for the loss or impact suffered.  
· 
Compliance with provisions of Nigerian Laws and World Bank Operational 
Policies (OP 4.12, paragraph 2(b)): that resettlement activity would be 
conceived and executed as development programs, providing sufficient 
investment resources to enable the PAPs to share in project benefits. 
· 
Displaced persons will be compensated for their losses at full replacement cost 
and provided assistance for disturbance prior to the beginning of civil works.  
· 
A comprehensive database, based on which values will be assessed, validated in 
the event of disputes and more importantly serve as the database for 
monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement instrument.  
The project affected persons would be consulted and given the chance of participating in 
the design, implementation and monitoring of the resettlement.

The four junctions covered in this study are located within five local government areas of 
Lagos state. The local governments include Agege, Alimosho, Ifako/Ijaye, Mushin and 
Surulere LGAs. Of all the four classified study locations, only one (Fagba Junction) is strictly 
located within one local government area of Ifako Ijaye. The others are caught between 
two local Government areas.  Dopemu Road project area is caught between Alimosho and 
Agege Local Government Areas; Lawanson Bus Stop project area is between Surulere and 
Mushin Local Government Areas, while Old Iyana Ipaja/Pen Cinema project area is located 
within Agege and Ifako-Ijaye local Government areas. The major challenges to traffic 
within the locations are mainly illegal road users, which varies from street trading, trading 
on the drainage, inadequate traffic management system etc. 
 
/DQG\03$FTXLVLWLRQ\035HVHWWOHPHQW\033ODQ\032EMHFWLYH\03
The resettlement action plan for the TSM Group B and D project is driven by the 
objectives of the World Bank OP 4.12 to avoid involuntary resettlement where feasible, or 
minimise, explore all viable alternative project design. There will be no land acquisition at 
the junctions and roads as all developments will be restricted to the existing setbacks. 
LAMATA is not planning any major road expansion works for any of the four roads and 
junctions and no structure shall be demolished.  
 
Artisans, itinerant traders, food vendors etc have encroached upon some portions of 
the setbacks and drainages on the individual roads and junctions. The level of 
encroachment is particularly immense at Lawanson and Pen cinema areas. However, 
it is important to mention here that most of the encroachments result from small 
business owners such as vendors and traders. Apart from a particular street at 
Lawanson, where some few permanent structures are on the drainage, most of the 
businesses are carried out with movable materials such as wooden tables. In addition, 
houses, markets etc are beyond the setbacks. It is pertinent to mention that the state 
government acquired the setbacks during the construction of the roads and junctions 
for expansionary purposes and by law no individual person is supposed to trespass.

Nevertheless, the World Bank principles that govern involuntary resettlement will not 
be compromised, regardless of the status of the trespassers.

Prior to the commencement of the RAP study, consultations and public disclosure was 
undertaken to disseminate to the people the intentions of state government through 
LAMATA towards the actualization of the road and junctions improvement project. Key 
stakeholders that were consulted include: 
 
· 
Alimosho, Agege, Ifako/Ijaye, Surulere and Mushin Local Government  
· 
NURTW (Agege and Lawanson branches) 
· 
Market Association  
· 
Traditional leaders 
· 
Keke NAPEP Association 
 
 
The consultations carried out prior to the RAP study is a follow-up to the continuous 
consultations that LAMATA has been doing since the conceptualization stage of this 
project. The Safeguards and Transport units of LAMATA has been very consistent with this 
approach to ensure that all stakeholders are adequately informed of the project and their 
suggestions and inputs are included in the project design.

Enumeration of vendors and properties on the entire set backs of the roads and junctions 
was carried out and vendors were categorized based on the type of structures used viz: 
wooden table with or without sun screen, open wooden stalls, closed wooden/steel stores, 
hawkers with wheel barrows etc. The highest number of vendors was enumerated at Pen 
cinema/Old Iyana Ipaja junction followed by Lawanson road/junction then Dopemu road. 
Fagba junction presented the least number of vendors.

The project-affected persons are those vendors that are located within the setbacks 
(including roads and ontop of the drainage) of the roads and junctions.
 
From the table 
below, there are no fully affected persons. However, only four (4) wooden lock up shops 
built directly on the drainage at Abati George Street in Lawanson may have to be

relocated to the nearby market at the end of the street.
 
The absence of fully affected 
persons is because of the fact that there were no permanent structures that will be 
demolished. A number of the project-affected persons will be required to shift backwards 
to some vacant space behind the drainage.  Of the 1049 project affected persons in the 
Group B and D roads and junction, only 435 (comprising of 6 PAPs at Fagba junction, 254 
at Pen cinema/Old Iyana Ipaja junctions, 87 at Dopemu road and 85 at Lawanson bus 
stop area) will require one form of supplemenetary assistance or another. It is also 
important to note that about 54% of people requiring supplementary assistance will be 
relocated to available space at nearby markets, while about 44% will be required to shift 
backwards.

Given that no new land will be acquired for this project and the fact that most of the 
vendors will not be relocated, LAMATA shall provide assistance for all project-affected 
persons. About 237 PAPs will be provided with resettlement assistance that covers 
relocation to another shop within nearby market, transportation allowance, labour cost 
and loss of income allowance.

1.  TSM Group B and D roads and Junctions RAP Socio-Economic Survey covered four 
(4) specific locations (Dopemu road, Pen Cinema/Old Iyana Ipaja junctions, Fagba 
junction and Lawanson Bus stop. A total number of 1,049 respondents were 
enumerated across the four designated study locations. 464 of these were 
enumerated in Pen cinema/Old Iyana Ipaja, 309 in Lawanson, 244 in Dopemu, and 
32 at Fagba Junction. 
 
2.  A minimum of about 75% of those interviewed/enumerated in all the locations was 
owners of their respective businesses. A greater proportion of the vendors are 
those within the middle age bracket of between 25 and 40 years with a dominance 
of female over male. 
 
3.  The educational background of the respondents varied, with the largest proportion 
of the respondents in all locations having secondary education. 
 
4.  Various types of structures such as vendor tables, vendor stalls, the vendors in all 
the locations use artisan tables, store shops, workshops, etc. The structures were 
made of diverse materials with the majority being made of wood/plywood. The 
movable vendor’s table constitute the highest percentage of business structures in 
all locations.  
 
5.  Depending on who occupies or makes use of the stall, shop or space, both owners 
and non-owners pay some rent to various individuals, associations, and State 
agencies. 
 
6.  The study also showed that the vendors operated relatively long hours on a daily 
basis, working virtually every day of the week.  The largest percentage of the 
respondents earns a net daily income of less than N500.

7.  Major items sold by the respondents interviewed varied from fruits, food, soft 
drinks and snacks; fish; palm wine and other liquor, stationery materials, kitchen 
and household wares. In some other locations such as Lawanson, Dopemu and 
Pen Cinema, items such as electronics, telephone/GSM accessories, jewelries, 
cosmetics, fabrics and textiles, foot wears, provisions and confectioneries were 
sold by relatively few of the respondents. In addition, services such as vulcanising, 
shoe repair and other artisanal occupation abound in the study areas. 
 
8.  A number of the vendors have occupied their present space for a minimum of 2 
years. A large proportion of the respondent took occupancy of their spaces within 
the last 6 months. 
 
9.  The Vendors expressed various concerns about the implications of possible 
relocation. Most of these concerns varied from economic or social such as fear of 
losing sales and patronage from long standing customers. A number of the 
respondents have preference of where they would be relocated. Most vendors 
preferred to be given either financial assistance or other form of assistance in kind.

There are three types of project-affected persons: 
 
1.  Those that would lose their business premises (land). 
2.   Those that will have to shift backwards 
3.   Transporters who will be required to use diversionary routes and the single 
available lane during construction activities at the junctions and roads. 
 
Irrespective of the above, LAMATA shall provide adequate assistance to all affected 
persons as presented in the entitlement and compensation matrix

Monitoring and Valuation 
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) procedures establish the effectiveness of all land and asset acquisition and 
resettlement activities, in addition to the measures designed to mitigate adverse social impacts. The World Bank 
Operational Policy (OP 4.12) states that the project sponsor is responsible for adequate M&E of the activities set forth in 
the resettlement instrument. Monitoring will provide both a warning system for the project sponsor and a channel for the 
affected persons to make known their needs and their reactions to resettlement execution. The RAP monitoring 
framework covers: 
 
• Internal monitoring by LAMATA; 
• Impact monitoring commissioned to specialized firms; and 
• RAP implementation Audit

CHAPTER ONE 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 Introduction 
The Lagos State Government (LASG), through the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport 
Authority (LAMATA
2
) under the Lagos Urban Transport Project (LUTP
3
) plans to upgrade 
and improve the road network and traffic facilities at specific locations within the 
metropolis. This is part of LUTP global objective of improving the overall transport system 
in Lagos state. 
Lagos State is the smallest by land mass of the 36 states in Nigeria (Figure 1.1) but has the second 
highest population next to Kano state (by the yet to be made official recent national population census 
of 2006). The population of Lagos is over five percent of the national estimate.  According to the 1991 
national census, the State had a population of 5,725,116 out of a national estimate of 88,992,220. 
However, based on a UN study and the State’s Regional Master Plan, the State is estimated to have 
about 15 million inhabitants, and this population is expected to increase to 25 million by the year 2015 
at the current growth rate of 6% (World Urbanization Prospects, 2003 revision). The state contains the 
largest manufacturing sector and provides employment to over 45% of the skilled manpower in the 
country. 
Part of the cardinal objective of the LUTP is to undertake traffic management activities 
towards ensuring efficient and effective movement of traffic in metropolitan Lagos. It is in 
line with these objectives that LAMATA, have decided to improve the Traffic Management 
System (TSM) of fourteen (14) major junctions in Lagos. These junctions are classified 
under Groups B and D. However, in carrying out the set objectives of four (4) junctions’ 
improvementthe out of the fourteen (14) earmarked for improvement have resettlement 
issues. 
 
 
TSM Group B and D roads and Junctions programme is initiated to improve the problem of 
traffic congestion in some selected junctions and roads within Lagos metropolis. It is 
aimed at alleviating the perennial traffic congestion problems experienced in Lagos on a 
daily basis, which is characterised by indecent traffic management especially by 
commercial bus operators, narrowness of the roads and junctions or indiscriminate street 
trading on road sidewalks.  The LASG has designated the LUTP to facilitate sustainable 
and effective integrated transport system for the Lagos Metropolis and to achieve this 
objectives, the State Government established LAMATA with collaboration from the World 
Bank to provide technical advice and direct financial assistance specifically towards the 
implementation of LUTP.  
 
Among the five major components of LUTP is the introduction of Traffic System 
Management (TSM) measures in some junctions and road improvement plan developed to 
establish; an effective traffic management system, discourage street trading and 
decongest affected roads and junctions for easy flow of traffic. The goal is to ensure that a

 LAMATA was created by an Act of the Lagos State Government on the 13
th
 of January, 2002.

 The concept of the LUPT started back as 1978, the project was approved by the World Bank in April 2001

                                                                           March 2008

minimum time as much as possible is spent on these hitherto problematic roads and 
junctions thereby reducing lost man-hours on roads in Lagos metropolis. These junctions 
are: 
 
Group B Junctions: 
¾\03
Lawanson Bus Stop (both sides with adjoining streets) 
¾\03
Dopemu road (both sides with adjoining streets) 
While the Group D junctions are: 
¾\03
Old Iyana Ipaja rd/Pen Cinema 
¾\03
Fagba junction (Fagba/Iju rd) 
Based on the foregoing, LAMATA secured an assistance of the World Bank to conduct 
studies of the likely persons to be affected by the proposed project and prepare a 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the four Junctions. 
 
1.2 Objectives of the Study 
The objective of the RAP is to clarify the principles and procedures that will govern the 
mitigation of adverse social impacts induced by project operations. Specifically, the RAP is 
designed to ensure: 
· 
All types of losses are identified, clearly defined and properly categorized to 
reflect the nature of the loss.  
· 
A standard or measure for defining eligibility and entitlement in order to have a 
fair basis for assessing compensation for the loss or impact suffered.  
· 
Compliance with provisions of Nigerian Laws and World Bank Operational 
Policies (OP 4.12, paragraph 2(b)): that resettlement activity would be 
conceived and executed as development programs, providing sufficient 
investment resources to enable the PAPs to share in project benefits. 
· 
Displaced persons will be compensated for their losses at full replacement cost 
and provided assistance for disturbance prior to the beginning of civil works.  
· 
A comprehensive database, based on which values will be assessed, validated in 
the event of disputes and more importantly serve as the database for 
monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement instrument.  
· 
The project affected persons would be consulted and given the chance of 
participating in the design, implementation and monitoring of the resettlement.
  
 
1.3 Study Area 
The four junctions covered in this study are located within five local government areas of 
Lagos state. The local governments include Agege, Alimosho, Ifako/Ijaye, Mushin and 
Surulere LGAs (Map 1.1). Of all the four classified study locations, only one (Fagba 
Junction) is strictly located within one local government area of Ifako Ijaye. The others are 
caught in between two local Government areas.  Dopemu Bridge/Shasha Road/Akowonjo 
Road project area is caught in between Alimosho and Agege Local Government Areas; Itire

                                                                           March 2008

Road/Lawanson Bus Stop project area is between Surulere and Mushin Local Government 
Areas, while Old Iyana Ipaja Road at Pen Cinema project area is located within Agege and 
Ifako-Ijaye local Government areas. The major challenges to traffic within the locations are 
mainly illegal road users, street trading, inadequate traffic management paraphernalia, like 
traffic lights, road signs, etc. 
 
1.4  Overview of Road Transport Situation in Lagos State 
Lagos state is the premier manufacturing city in Western Africa, most important sea port, 
node for telecommunications with the largest concentration of multinationals, and home to 
250 of Nigeria’s financial institutions. More than 60% of Nigeria’s non-oil economy is 
located in Lagos. Despite its dominant position in Nigeria’s non-oil economy, Lagos 
remains a “poor city” with an annual budget of about US$650 million
4
.  
 
The state is characterized by chronic traffic congestion due to inadequate traffic 
management, indiscipline on the part of road users, increasing number of illegal road 
users, rapidly worsening air quality among others.  The addition of another almost four 
million people over the next 10 years will no-doubt make conditions even more difficult. 
Another unfortunate characteristic of transport in Lagos is that women, the aged people 
and children have very poor access to bus facilities due to extreme overcrowding.  
 
Several millions of Man-hours are being lost daily in Lagos city, owing to traffic challenges, 
apart from the obvious fact that the teeming population of vehicles in the state is 
becoming overbearing for existing facilities; the proliferation of illegal road users has 
become a major contributor. These illegal road users which include; hawkers, vendors, 
commercial motorcycle and tricycle operators, on-the-drain stall operators, shop owner’s 
displaying their wares on and beyond the drainage, etc. The coupling effect of lack of 
adequate traffic facilities in road encroachment by illegal occupants has become one of the 
major challenges of the traffic management and aesthetics of the roads in the 
metropolitan city of Lagos.

By contrast, Delhi with a population of 13.8 million people has a budget of US$ 2.6 billion; and Jakarta with a population of 11 million, 
has a budget of US$ 1.0 billion.

Lawanson bus stop is located in Surulere local Government area of Lagos state along 
Lawanson/Itire Road west of Ojuelegba terminal. But because the scope of this study 
includes adjoining streets 
to either sides of Lawanson 
Bus Stop, certain sections 
of the study area (to the 
east of Lawanson road) fall 
into Mushin Local 
Government Area. This is 
because Lawanson/Itire 
Road serves as the 
boundary between 
Surulere and Mushin L.Gs. 
(see Map 1.2). Lawanson 
road is a dual carriageway 
with a rather narrow 
median and the 
continuation of this road from Lawanson bus stop is Itire road, which has the same 
characteristics and features. 
 
 
Lawanson is very busy because 
it marks the terminal points for 
commuter buses going to 
Lawanson en route Itire road 
and has poor linking roads and 
Traffic System Management 
(TSM). Commercial bus 
operators make use of the 
outer lanes on both sides of 
the road as their public 
transport terminal. In addition, 
bus operators board and alight 
passengers along this lane 
thereby leaving only one lane free in most cases to service several other road users.

Although the road is particularly in a good condition, many street traders dealing in all kinds of 
wares ranging from fruits and vegetables to fairly use electronic appliances operate along the 
road. Most times the traffic at this junction is jammed due to the fact that the street traders and 
other vendors compel commercial bus and motorcycle operators to be scrambling for space along 
the road. Coupled with this is the fact that traders and other artisans on the road in most cases 
occupy the drainage slabs meant to serve as sidewalks for their businesses. The pavements along 
the Lawanson/Itire road are in good condition but the same cannot be said of adjacent portion to 
Jubril Martins, Abati and Aborishade streets. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commercial cab operators also operate along the road, using the outer lane as park. 
Some of these operators use vehicles with non-distinguishable colours characteristics 
of intra-city commercial vehicle operators. The implication of this is that at these 
sections of the road, other road users have just one lane (which at times is blocked) 
available to them. There are also commercial motorcycles (Okada) and Tricycles (Keke 
NAPEP) operators along the road; these constitute the problem of traffic congestion in 
Lawanson area.

In view of the proposed improvements at this bus stop, the RAP study interviewed 
various classes of PAPs such as commercial vehicle and motorcycle operators, street 
traders, vendors, artisans, etc. who mainly occupy the drainage covers and those that 
exhibit their goods well into the road in the area (see appendix 5). The traffic problem 
at Lawanson is also further exercebated by the deplorable conditions of adjoining 
streets and road networks that would have sufficed as alternate routes to 
Itire/Lawanson Road. Some of these adjoining streets and their problems are 
highlighted below: 
 
Jubril Martins Street  
Jubril Martins Street is to the south of Lawanson Bus stop and is key to the efficiency 
of traffic management within the Lawanson Bus stop area.  Commercial bus operators 
use the street as link route to Lawanson Bus stop while driving through Olufemi Street 
instead of linking the Itire/Lawanson Road from Ogunlana drive. But currently, the 
deplorable state of the street has marred this access opportunity meant to ease off 
traffic on Lawanson bus stop. As at the time of field survey for this report, the road 
surface at this street was almost completely worn out. The volume of street trading 
on this street has resulted to the siltation of the drainage system. In some cases, the 
vendors occupy the silted portion of the drainage. In spite of the presence of a well-
planned market along the road (on the west side), some of vendors still find it 
comfortable to display their wares on the drainage and even beyond.

Over a half of the road at the north end 
of the street where it links Lawanson road 
has been taken over by commercial 
vehicle operators. The vehicle operators’ 
park and board passengers making it very 
difficult for vehicles that ventures to make 
use of the street as an alternative route. 
The operations of the commercial bus 
business and street traders especially 
towards the north end of the street are 
major contributors to traffic congestion at 
Lawanson bust
 
stop. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Also at some point west of the Jubril Martins Street, commercial bus operators make 
u-turns thereby causing serious hindrances to traffic flow. There is no walkway 
created at the junction. However, covered drains serve as walkways for pedestrians, 
although a number of the drain covers were no longer in place. 
 
Abati George Street 
This street is located on the northern 
side of Itire Road opposite Texaco 
petrol station. Further in; about 140 
meters, the Adedoyin Street links it to 
the 
east.  The road through the street is in 
no 
better condition than that of Jubril 
Martins Street. Its deplorable state is 
marked with worn out surface, which

The drainage system on this road has almost failed. The drains are either completely 
silted, with collapsed embankments, and filled with all sorts of solid and domestic 
wastes. Street traders and artisans 
operate indiscriminately on the 
drainage and position their structures 
way beyond the drainage into the road.  
The fact that the street leads to a 
market (daily) that also houses an 
abattoir makes the street a busy one. 
Vehicles supposedly owned by visitors 
to the market are observed parked on 
either sides of the street. The fact that 
the road towards the market is in bad 
condition may have also contributed to 
the street side parkings by visitors to the market. 
 
The width of the road has been greatly reduced by several street traders, artisans and 
vehicles that are parked on the either sides of the road. There is not much use of this 
road by commercial bus operators. This may be due to the fact that, it is difficult for 
them to negotiate turnings from the road. It could be reasoned that this street can be 
upgraded and put to use so as to ease traffic congestion along Itire/Lawanson road 
especially at Lawanson Bus stop.  
 
Absence of a well planned vehicle garage for the market also adds to the busy nature 
of the road. It was observed during field survey that vehicles bringing market items to 
traders in the market also park in an unorganized manner to offload their goods. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The field survey showed that the street traders along Abati George street, have no 
regard for the drainage system. The drainage system is almost completely used for 
Failed end of the Road, close to the

trading of all sorts and artisans activities. It is imperative therefore, that a first step in 
upgrading this road is to relocate these small business operators from the drainage. It 
was also observed that at several locations along the street there are actually 
available spaces for the traders behind the drainage system but for one reason or 
another, they operate just well on the drainage and even to the road. 
 
Aborishade Street
 
This street adjoins to the north-west of Lawanson/Itire road and continues inwards to 
densely built-up areas. The street is busy one, with several small scale business 
activities and street trading. Commercial buses were scanty along this road as at the 
time of field survey. However, there were several private vehicles plying and parked 
along the busy street. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The general condition of Aborishade Street can be said to be fair; with few potholes and existing 
drainage system silted at some points, all that the road would require is resurfacing and upgrading 
of the drainage system. Street traders and small business operators encroach over the drainage 
into the road at some points along the road. However, it was observed that there are spaces 
behind the drains for these business operators to move to without encroaching into the road. 
 
  
High Tension Line “Street”
 
The high-tension line street veers off 
towards the eastern part of Abroishade 
Street. This is not supposed to be a 
bona fide street as it is actually the 
Right of Way for the PHCN high-tension 
line from Egbin power station to the 
southern parts of Lagos state. Under an 
ideal situation, this land strip is not to 
be inhabited considering both health 
and safety risks inherent in such high 
voltage transmitter. As it were the high-

tension line serves as a road for people occupying the adjoining sides of the line.  
Under it present purpose of serving as a road, the high tension line is completely 
dilapidated, the road is untarred, lacked drainage system, and is traversed almost all 
through by potholes that are pooled with water during the raining season. Not much 
business activities go on along this line but for very few food dealers and artisans. 
 
Down the line is a mechanic workshop which contributes to the amount of vehicles plying the 
line apart from those of the inhabitants. Some commercial vehicles also use this line as 
parking lot.  The line is actually built-up on either side by residential apartments.   
 
Towards the North end, the High Tension line 
ended to a canal, across which is Idi Araba 
part of Lagos. At this north end, there is a 
local market, which considering the small size 
is intended to meet the domestic need of the 
inhabitants of the area. 
 
Considering the strategic location of this high 
tension line street with regards to Lawanson 
Bus stop, and given the fact that a number of 
commercial bus operators use it as parking 
space, it becomes very imperative to capture 
the supposed street as alternative effort to 
ensure the judicious use of the parks by the 
bus operators will go a long way towards easing off the traffic situation at the Lawanson bus stop 
area. 
 
Though the street is in bad shape, it is not advisable to upgrade it is not supposed to be inhabited 
for any reason for any reason. Upgrading it will be viewed by the Federal and state authorities as 
condoning illegality, which is not what LAMATA stands for.

Dopemu/Shasha Road is a dual carriage road stretch located within Alimosho and 
Agege local government areas of 
Lagos state (see Map 1.3). The road 
covered a distance of about 
450metres, starting from a T-
junction linking Akowonjo road to the 
south of Shasha Road, across the 
round about linking Bada street and 
Ladipo Road up to the base of the 
overhead bridge across the 
Lagos/Abeokuta expressway. The 
road is relatively clear of illegal 
occupants along the ROW, this 
perhaps is because most of the 
buildings either side of the road are

well as residential buildings and lock-up shops. 
 
Traffic volume on this road is fed by 
both private and commercial vehicle 
as well as motorcycles (popularly 
known as 
2NDGD
) and Tricycles 
(popularly known as 
.HNH
), both 
from adjoining streets and linking 
major roads. The major volume of 
traffic is from Shasha and Akowonjo 
roads. After this T junction, some 
volume of vehicles from residential 
buildings, shopping malls, corporate 
buildings (mainly Banks), also add to the road just before the round about linking 
Williams Layout and Ladipo road.  After this round about, some volumes still are 
added to the road from the Ladipo road and also from Bank and shopping complexes 
just before the overhead bridge. Down the bridge on Dopemu road, some further 
volumes are added to the road from; the aluminum village, residences shopping 
complexes and banks.

On the other side of the road stretch, 
traffic volumes are mainly from vehicles 
going due south from Dopemu road, and 
then from built-up residential areas, 
schools and shops just before the Shasha 
Road round about. At the point of the 
round about, the volume  increases 
further from Bada Street and from several 
residential buildings, corporate buildings 
(mainly Banks), schools and shopping 
malls up to a Petrol Filling station (Oando) 
at the Akowonjo link end of the road.

Apart from the high volume of vehicles on this road especially during the morning and 
evening hours, the field survey 
revealed that other causes of 
traffic congestion along the road 
are traders on the roadside market 
along the road using tables and 
other forms of shade to exhibit 
their commercial wares which 
range from fresh fish to seasonal 
fruits and vegetables. Another 
source of concern to this road are 
shop owners whose shops are 
actually well off the RoW  but who 
still display their wares up to the 
drainage line. Others include 
commercial motorcycle operators 
who board and have their passengers alighted indiscriminately. There are about seven 
banks along the project area and these banks do not seem to have adequate parking 
lot for their numerous customers thereby having them park along the road which 
contributes to the traffic problems on the road. 
 
It was also observed that from about 
14:30 hour (Nigerian time), the 
commercial tricycle operators (
.HNH
) 
begin operations along the road. 
Because there is no specific park for 
their operations, these operators park 
along the road to board and alight 
passengers, which also contribute to 
traffic congestion. Apart from the 
.HNH\03
operators, there are also, other road 
users who come out during the later 
hours of the day that contribute to 
traffic congestion on the road. These 
include; additional market women (into the street market), hawkers and vendors who 
sell their goods to motorist along the road. 
 
Pedestrians also give some cause for worry along the road. The absence of walkways 
leaves them with no option other than walking along the road. 
 
The general condition of the road could be said to be good but for isolated silted 
drains along the road. There are also some damaged median islands and sand 
accumulations near the median islands on the road.

This junction is located along Pen 
Cinema-Iju (waterworks) road within 
Ifako/Ijaye LGA at the north-eastern part 
of Lagos State (see Map 1.4). It is a T-
junction where vehicles from Ikeja, 
Agege/Pen Cinema, Abule Egba, Oke-Oba 
and Iju-Ishaga link up.  
 
The road is a dual carriage way with a 
narrow median. It could be said to be in a 
good condition but for minor surface 
failures along the road with few interspersed potholes.  
Map 1.4: Fagba Junction Project Area 
 
 
Free traffic flow along and within this 
junction is reduced mainly by; vendor traders 
who operate mainly at late hours (15:00hrs – 
21:00hrs), commercial motorcycle operators

 who board and alight their passengers indiscriminately, commercial tricycle 
operators (Keke
\031$3(3
) who also operate mainly later in the day.  Although the 
2NDGD\03
operators made some effort to make a shade for themselves while awaiting the 
client, the space is not big and good enough to accommodate them such that, they 
can board and alight passengers within, without causing any form of obstruction to 
traffic flow. The accumulation of these 
2NDGD
 operators, along the road (near their 
shade) which is actually at the neck of the junction causes obstruction to traffic. 
Some medium to large scale commercial operators also operate along the road 
especially along the Iju water works 
road near the junction, while most of 
these business operators have enough 
space behind the drainage, they still 
display their wares on and at times 
beyond the drains there by occupying 
what should have been the walkway 
for pedestrians. This act actually push 
pedestrians further into the road and 
hence contributing to traffic 
congestions, let alone the safety of 
the pedestrians. There is a pile of 
wooden electric pole beyond the drainage along the Iju water works road. The Abule-
Egba Road link to Fagba Junction is relatively less occupied by street traders; most of 
the traders on this road operate beyond the drains off the road, nonetheless, there 
are still a few that tend to display their wares on the drainage. The drainage along 
this road are not covered, so traders and vendors who operate on the drainage use 
some items like wood or metal to cover the drainage over the area they are operating. 
Small business along this road include; food vendors, GSM operators, Fairly-used 
fabric dealers, book sellers, commercial motorcycle operators, fruit and vegetable 
dealers, groceries, etc. 
 
During the morning to early afternoon, the main challenge to traffic at Fagba junction 
emanating from Abule-Egba Road is from commercial motorcycle operators (
2NDGD
). 
From about 14:30 hours (Nigerain time), commercial tricycle operators (
.HNH
) begin 
operation along the Abule-Egba axis of the junction. From about this time too, some 
other vendors who do not operate in the early hours start operation. All these 
combine to cause traffic problems at the Junction.

This area could better be referred to as an axis, as it covers two junctions (with their 
adjoining streets) across a road stretch (old Iyana-Ipaja/ Pencinema Road). It is 
located within Ifako-Ijaye and Agege Local Government areas, north-east of Lagos 
state (Map 1.5).  Most part of this project area is located within Ifako-Ijaye and this 
part starts from the Pencinema junction linking the Iju, Balogun and Ogba Roads and 
continues along Pencinema road up to the railway line to the west. The Agege Local 
Government section starts from the western side of railway line up till the Christ 
Church Road about 150 meters northwards.  
 
Map 1.5: Old Iyana Ipaja/Pen cinema Project Area 
 
The junction at the Pen cinema links up to Iju/Ishaga road to the north, to Balogun 
Road leading to Ikeja area to the south, while to the east, the junction is linked to the 
Ogunji road leading to Ogba and then stretched Old Iyana-Ipaja Road on the western 
axis. There is a bus terminus at the Balogun/Ogunji intercession at the south-east 
corner of the junction. About 200m to the west, there is a double lane rail line 
crossing over Pen cinema road.  Few meters after the rail line is a junction 
interspersing the Old Abeokuta Motorway. This junction is a very busy one because of

About 250m down southwest of the 
junction is another major junction that 
links traffic from Old Abeokuta Motor 
Road and Ijaye to old Iyana-Ipaja road. 
This junction adds considerably to 
traffic congestion in the area.  
 
Apart from the traffic load, due to the 
volume of vehicles plying these 
junctions, obstruction free traffic flow is 
caused by a range of factors peculiar to 
the various sections of this project area. 
 
At the Pen cinema junction end of the axis is a commercial vehicle park at the 
southwest arc (between Ogba 
Road and Iju Road) of the round 
about. This park is not big 
enough to accommodate all the 
vehicles that are serviced by the 
park, hence, there is out fluxing 
of excess vehicles into the road 
and contributing to traffic 
congestion. Apart from the 
vehicle park at this section, there 
is a very high level of small 
business activities going on along 
the road. These business

operators encroach over the drainage and into the road there by reducing the road 
width available to vehicles. At the Balogun/Pencinema arc of the round about is a fast 
foods eatery (Tastee Fried Chicken) whose compound is just very close to the 
drainage along both Roads. Many street traders and vendors including itinerants 
occupy over the drainage very close to this compound and even encroach further into 
the roads and contributing to the traffic congestion. Down the Balogun Road are also 
several street traders and vendors including vendor vans selling bread and other 
snacks.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the Iju Road by Ogba Road arc of the pencinema junction, is a market as well as a 
Taxi park and both the out fluxing cabs and market people (buyers and sellers) 
contribute a great deal to traffic emanating from this section of the junction. The taxi 
park was observed to be big enough for the cabs but due to the market operations 
and several other street traders and vendors that the cab drivers had to maneuver 
around before getting into their park, free flow of traffic is hampered to some extent. 
Further down Iju Road on the eastern side, street trading is not particularly 
pronounced during the day, but tends to increase at the later hours of the day when 
additional vendors occupy the road for their businesses. 
 
The Iju Road by Pen cinema Road arc is particularly busy with open stalls and few 
store shops dealing in various items. There are also commercial motorcycle and 
tricycle operators operating at the eastern side of the Iju Road; while the motorcycles 
operates throughout the day, the tricycle operators starts around late afternoon. 
There are also several itinerant vendors as well as stall owners who display their 
wares beyond the drainage and into the road.

Along the pencinema road on both sides are several store shops, open stalls, vendor 
table, artisans and itinerant traders. Apart from some vendor table owners and open 
space small business, who has no space behind the drains off the road, a large 
number of store shop and stall owners resort to displaying their wares on and beyond 
the drainage into the road thereby causing obstruction to traffic. Just before the 
railway, on the southern side of the pencinema road is a street (Lewi Street) that is 
equally commercialized. Apart from small business owners and street traders 
operating on the street, inter-state commercial vehicles also board their passengers 
there. As at the time of this field survey, passengers were boarding vehicles traveling 
to Ibadan (Oyo State). These vehicles encroach into the road futher congesting the 
traffic at the junction. 
 
 
Small business operators heavily congest the railway line to the north and south of 
Pen cinema road. Most of these operators are vendor table dealers, a good number 
too display their items on the floor near and into the rail line. These small business 
operators encroach well into the road and cause serious obstruction to traffic. 
 
The rail line by Old Abeokuta 
motor way arc of this junction 
is occupied by street traders 
(mainly dealing on ready-to-
wear clothes) to the extent that 
a few of them encroach over 
the drainage and into the road 
in isolated instances. On the

-
Ipaja Road
 
On the other side (west) of the old Abeokuta motorway, obstruction to traffic is 
caused mainly by street traders and vendors as well as commercial tricycle operators 
(trying to turn-around the round about to the opposite side of the road. 
 
Within the arc of the Old Iyana-Ipaja Road by Old Abeokuta motor Road are also 
several street trading going on. Encroachment onto and even beyond the drainage is 
pronounced here. Further on down to 
old Iyana-Ipaja road before the canal, 
several vendor table and open stall 
operators also operate over the 
drainage and into the road. After the 
canal and further down to Church 
Street, the road is relatively free of 
street business operators. At the 
south-western arch of the Old Iyana-
ipaja Road by Old Abeokuta motor 
Road, street business, itinerant 
traders, vendor table operators and 
stall owners who display their wares 
on to the road also abound.  To the south along the Old Abeokuta motorway, on 
either side, street shop and stall owners do display their goods on the drainage and 
into the street thereby contributing to traffic congestion on this line.  
 
 
Along the southern side of the Pen cinema road, several street traders, shop owners 
and open space small business operators align the road on and over the drainage. 
After Lewis Street, there is Union Bank and due to lack of enough space within the 
bank premises, visitors to the bank park their vehicles on the road adjacent to the 
bank. These parking contribute to traffic congestion by reducing the road width 
available to other users.  After the Bank, the story of street traders and small scale 
business encroaching into the road continues up to the fast food eatery (Tastee Fried 
Chicken) at the Pencinema round about. 
 
Diurnal variation in traffic challenges is a major factor along the Old Iyana-Ipaja by 
Pencinema Junctions because; while 
some traders that operate during the 
morning to early afternoon do not 
operate afterwards while several many 
others who do not operate in the 
earlier hours of the day add to the 
volume of street business operators 
later in the day. 
 
The field survey revealed that the most 
critical periods along this axis is 
Union Bank along Penc
inema Road

In upgrading this road, while many of the shop and stall owners who diplay their 
wares on and beyond the drainage will be required to move backwards, very few 
(mainly vendor Table owners and itinerants) will be relocated. The commercial

1.6 Land Acquisition Resettlement Plan Objective 
The resettlement action plan for the TSM Group B and D project is driven by the 
objectives of the World Bank OP 4.12 to avoid involuntary resettlement where 
feasible, or minimise, explore all viable alternative project design. Land acquisition at 
the junctions and roads will be minimal and restricted to the existing set backs. 
LAMATA shall not acquire new land and acquisition will not extend beyond the 
required space in the set backs. Small portions of land may be acquired at specific 
locations within the set backs for the construction of lay bys and drainages. LAMATA 
is not planning any major road expansion works for any of the four roads and 
junctions and no structure shall be demolished.  
 
Although the total land that will be required for infrastructure development will be 
very minimal, given that some road sidewalks vendors will either be completely or 
partially displaced from their business premises, it is pertinent therefore that 
adequate resettlement plan is put in place by LAMATA. At the moment, traders, food 
vendors and antisans have encroached into some portions of the Group B and D 
roads and junctions set backs and sidewalks.  However, houses, businesses, and 
permanent structures including the markets are all located beyond the sidewalks. 
 
 
Eligible people for resettlement and assistance are the Project Affected Person
5
 (PAP) 
identified in locations where infrastructures will be constructed. Permanently displaced 
persons
6
 shall be relocated to other vacant spaces or markets within the project area, 
while temporary displaced persons
7
 will be requested to shift backwards. At moment, 
it is not likely that there will be any permanently displaced person that will not be 
accommodated within the available open spaces and markets. However, the chairmen 
of the LGAs, NURTW and management of LAMATA have identified possible areas 
where permanently displaced PAP’s if the need arises will be resettled.  
 
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) aims at developing resettlement and 
compensation criteria as well as institutional arrangements to meet the requirements 
of the people who may be affected by the proposed project.  The anticipated impacts 
on people include land acquisition, loss of physical structures, loss of access to 
livelihood and loss of access to economic resources.  The RAP is prepared to the 
standards and specifications of relevant legislations of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 
the LASG, and the operational policy of the World Bank, OP 4.12. The RAP will assess 
(quantify and qualify) the presumed adverse impacts of its road improvement 
operations and suggest mitigation measures including budget to address the issues.

 A PAP is defined as any person who, as a result of the implementation of a project, loses the right to own, use, or 
otherwise benefit from a built structure, land (residential, agricultural, or pasture), annual or perennial crops and 
trees, or any other fixed or moveable asset, either in full or in part, permanently or temporarily.

CHAPTER TWO 
Institutional responsibilities for RESETTLEMENT 
2.1     
Introduction 
There are various institutions that are involved either in development or 
implementation of transportation policies in Lagos State. Such institutions include the 
Ministry of Transport, Lagos State Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), 
Lagos State Transport Management Authority (LASTMA), Local Government Councils 
and the NURTW. The aforementioned institutions including Ministry of Land, Ministry 
of Housing, Physical Planning and Urban Development and Ministry of Environment 
have been identified as some of the institutions for resettlement. Most of the 
institutions are related in function and some other cases have overlapping functions 
but are duly recognised by law or customary norms of Lagos state. While most of 
them do not have direct links with resettlement, some of them, by operation or 
functions, have related responsibilities with resettlement. 
2.2 Implementation 
Roles 
and 
Responsibilities 
The roles and responsibilities of LAMATA and other agencies with regard to RAP 
implementation are detailed below.  
ffl\11ffl\11fi\03

This Agency was established by law in 2002 as Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport 
Authority, 2001. Statutorily, the functions of the agency include: 
 
· 
Coordinate the transport policies programmes and actions of all transport 
related agencies in Lagos State. 
· 
Plan and coordinate the supply of adequate and effective public transport 
within metropolitan Lagos. 
 
In the discharge of its functions, the authority has the power to construct, re-
construct, maintain and manage transport infrastructure and facilities and all other 
buildings and works necessary for the discharge of the functions of the Authority. 
 
Responsibilities for commitments proposed in the RAP exist within LAMATA and are 
delegated internally to other units in the agency as well as other government 
agencies. Perfect understanding of the proposed project exists in the agency as all 
units and staff assigned to specific roles associated with resettlement, including 
impact minimization, inventory preparation and confirmation, consultation and 
feedback, compensations, monitoring and reporting.

CHAPTER THREE 
PROJECT AFFECTED PERSONS AND PROPERTIES 
3.1 Introduction 
As indicated in an earlier section of this report, the TSM group B and D junction 
project is designed to improve urban transportation in Lagos State through efficient 
traffic management. As part of the plan, a census survey was conducted to 
inventorize the different categories of vendors within the four various roads/junctions 
set back where infrastructures relating to the project (such as junction expansion, lay 
bys, etc) will be located. The enumeration exercise was to identify project affected 
people (PAP) that will require resettlement, compensation and other forms of 
assistance as a consequence of the impacts of the proposed project on the livelihoods 
of the people. The idea was, given the traditional and social concern of the World 
Bank for poverty alleviation, persons affected by the project would be assisted to 
resettle in new locations and to continue their normal lives in their new locations with 
minimal or no difficulties.  Against this backdrop, it was considered necessary to 
undertake a survey of the respective project areas (Dopemu road and adjoining 
streets, Pen cinema/Old Iyana Ipaja Junctions, Fagba Junction and Lawanson Bus 
stop) to determine the number of the PAPs in each of these areas, ascertain their 
socio-economic characteristics, types of structures and businesses where applicable, 
that would be affected by the road enhancement and traffic management project.  
3.2 Inventory of Vendors and Properties in TSM Group B and D Junctions 
Enumeration of vendors and properties on each of the set back of the respective 
roads/junctions in these areas is presented in Table 3-1. The table shows the different 
categories of vendors based on the type of structures used. It was observed that 
population of vendors has a direct relationship with the kind of socio-economic 
activities in each area. For instance population of vendors are high at existing bus 
terminus, round abouts, market locations, road intersections and residential and 
business enterprises close to the roads. Such locations are; Lawanson bus stop, pen 
cinema junction, Old Iyana road junction and Dopemu road about. The least number 
of vendors were enumerated at Fagba junction. In addition, a number of structures 
that extend to the road exist at certain locations such as at Jubril Martins Street in 
Lawanson. These structures will be required to move back at least to a comfortable 
point for the road improvement activities. 
 
It is worth mentioning that table vendors and umbrella vendors (mostly phone call 
service providers and vegetable sellers) do take their wares home and in most cases 
the tables are removed at the close of each day.   
 
Those vendors classified as others hawk with wheelbarrows and carts from one 
location to the other (itinerant). In some cases during peak periods, they migrate to

numbers recorded at Pen cinema and Lawanson was not surprising as these locations 
are very close to the market in each of these locations.

3.3 Project 
Affected 
Persons 
The project affected persons are those vendors that will be physically displaced from 
their business locations as a result of the proposed road and junction improvement in 
the four locations. This means that the vendors directly located within the portions of 
land designated for road enhancement/widening and walkway etc shall be entitled to 
assistance or compensation. These categories of project affected persons are 
presented in Table 3.2.

In ensuring the project impacts are minimised as much as possible, demolition of 
structures either residential or commercial within each of the roads and junctions set 
back will be avoided. LAMATA is not considering demolition of permanent structures 
except at Abati George Street where only four (4) wooden shop structures directly on 
the drainage may be relocated to allow for improvement on the road and drainage.

Because of the closeness of a market few metres away on the street, these four fully 
affected persons will be assisted to relocate to available shops at the market. 
ffi\11ffi\11ffl\03 3DUWLDOO\\03$IIHFWHG\033HUVRQV\03\03
The partially affected persons are the physically displaced vendors on each of the 
roads and junctions set backs. Significant numbers of this category are those groups 
of vendors with tables and umbrellas, itinerant (hawkers using wheel barrows), 
artisans, kiosk and open stall. A total of 237 vendors will either be resettled within the 
nearby markets or at vacant spaces within each of the roads and junctions setbacks. 
From the 194 vendors that have been identified for shifting backwards, 6 vendors are 
located at Fagba junction, 94 at Pen cinema/old Iyana Ipaja junction, 43 at Dopemu 
road and 51 at Lawanson bus stop area.  
ffi\11ffi\11ffi\03 3HUVRQV\03WKDW\03ZLOO\03QRW\03EH\035H\10ORFDWHG\03
This group of vendors are those that are not within the locations where enhancement 
and infrastructures will be carried out and sited as such they are not affected by the 
project activities. The relatively high number recorded at Pencinema/Old Iyana Ipaja 
junctions and Lawanson bus stop (210 and 221 respectively) was due to the proximity 
of the market to these locations. About 26 and 157 at Fagba and Dopemu respectively 
are either outside the area of interest or are not within the designated locations for 
significant improvement and infrastructures. 
 
In addition, the transporters who hitherto make use of the affected roads and 
junctions will be affected but will not be relocated as LAMATA has already put in place 
programs with LASTMA to open up alternative diversionary route and ensure efficient 
traffic management on the single lane that will be made available during construction 
period.

In line with World Bank Involuntary Resettlement Policy 
23\03ff\11fiffl
 supplementary 
assistance is support provided to people who are physically displaced by a project, 
which may include transportation, food, shelter, and social services that are provided 
to affected people during their relocation (Table 3-3). Assistance may also include 
cash allowances that compensate affected people for the inconvenience associated 
with resettlement and defray the expenses of a transition to a new locale, such as 
moving expenses and lost market days. The affected vendors that will be entitled for 
supplementary assistance includes: 
 
· 
Open stall, lock-up wooden and steel shops that will be relocated  
· 
Affected vendors (open stall, lock-up and steel shops) that will not be 
relocated but will be required to shift backwards  
 
The supplementary assistance will vary from: cost of transportation, cost of labour, 
and allowance for income losses. In doing this, priority will be given to the vulnerable

where transportation and labour are required, LAMATA shall specifically assist to get 
such vehicle/driver and labour respectively. In addition, for loss of income, they shall 
be given prompt compensation before any other PAP.

3.4 Socio-economic 
Survey 
ffi\11ff\11fi\03 ,QWURGXFWLRQ\03
This report presents the findings of the survey that was conducted for the project. 
The Socio-economic survey was conducted for the purpose of identifying: 
 
· 
 
Current occupants of the right-of-way; 
· 
 
Standard characteristics of displaced persons (baseline information on 
livelihood, economic and social information, etc); 
· 
 
The magnitude of the expected loss (total or partial); 
· 
 
Information on vulnerable groups or persons (for whom special provision 
may have to be made); 
· 
Provisions to update information on the displaced peoples’ livelihoods and 
standards of living at regular intervals so that the latest information is 
available at the time of their displacement; 
· 
 
Land tenure and transfer systems (where applicable); 
· 
 
The patterns of social interaction in the affected communities, including 
social networks and social support systems, and how they will be affected by 
the project; 
· 
 
Public infrastructure and social services that will be affected and  
· 
 
Social and cultural characteristics of displaced communities in terms of 
gender, migrants and settled; professions and described to the extent feasible, 
their preferences as regards to assisted resettlement or self-resettlement. 
ffi\11ff\11ffl\03 5HVHDUFK\030HWKRGRORJ\\03
Research information was collected using the census method which entailed 
interviewing all persons living or operating within the set back along the roads and 
junctions of the project areas. A 49-item standardized interview schedule was used for 
the study. The client’s approval of the survey instrument was obtained before being 
used for the fieldwork.

A total of
 
21-field enumerators comprising of 12 males 9 
female were mobilized for the project. The project enumerators were carefully 
selected, taking into consideration educational qualification, gender and 
research experience, as well as language proficiency for effective 
communication with the vendors (see Appendix 1 for list of enumerators and 
supervors).

A one-day training programme was organized for the 
field staff prior to the fieldwork, using the survey instrument and study design. 
The purpose of the training was to ensure a common understanding of the 
objectives of the study and the content of the survey instrument, as well as to 
enhance the capacity of the researchers to conduct the fieldwork, with a view 
to ensuring uniform administration of the research instruments. In addition to 
the training, a rapid assessment was conducted and test questionnaires were

The largest proportion of the interviews (48.0%) 
was conducted in Yoruba language, another 22.0% in Pidgin (broken) English, 
and 27.0% in English. Furthermore, 2.0% of the interviews were conducted in 
Igbo, while about 1.0% was conducted in some other languages.

 In order to ensure the integrity of the data, all project 
activities were conducted under close supervision. Appointed field supervisors 
provided round-the-clock supervision for the fieldwork and conducted spot-
checks on the interviewers. Completed interview schedules were first screened 
by the supervisors and subjected to a second level of screening in the office, 
prior to data capture.

Fieldwork Challenges
 
Generally, the fieldwork was conducted smoothly with the few hitches encountered. 
The smooth execise was largely because there was full consultation with the 
stakeholders, including community and trade/business leaders in the study area 
before and throughout the process of the fieldwork. The few problems that were 
encountered were resolved with the support of the contact trade leaders. The NURTW 
played a major role in ensuring that vendors cooperated in providing information to 
the enumerators. Despite the union involvement, some of the vendors did not 
cooperate with the team as much as they should. Our major challenges include: 
· 
Non-disclosure of information such as correct names, age, income, etc. 
However, based on our experience, we developed an approach to get 
information on income from the vendors. 
· 
Outright avoidance, as some of the vendors would not want to talk to us for 
fear of being sanctioned by the market leader. In most cases we approached 
these leaders and a delegate was appointed to accompany the enumerators.

Preliminary Consultation/Community Interaction
 
The fieldwork was preceded by sensitization/mobilization visits to the study 
locations. Consultation meetings/discussions were also held with community 
leaders, trade association leaders and local government officials in the study 
locations before the commencement of the fieldwork. The objective of the 
consultation meetings was to brief the leaders about the project and proposed 
fieldwork activities and to solicit their support for the exercise. The leaders were

also enjoined to help to pass on information about the project to their members, 
associates and subjects. These preliminary activities proved to be very useful in 
facilitating the fieldwork.  
 
The preliminary visits were also used for clear identification of the project areas and 
for project reconnaissance activities.  
 
A total number of 1,049 
respondents were enumerated 
across the four designated study 
locations. 464 of these were 
enumerated in Iyana_Ipaja, 309 
in Lawanson, 244 in Dopemu, 
and 32 at Fagba Junction. 
 
3.4.3.1 Dopemu
 
A total of 244 potential project affected persons (PAPs) were identified and 
interviewed in Dopemu. In order to ensure effective communication and 
comprehension of the research questions by the respondents, the interviews were 
conducted in the languages that the respondents were comfortable with. Analysis of 
the language of interview shows that the largest proportion of the interviews in 
Dopemu (49.2%) was conducted in Yoruba language, 27% in English language, and 
21.7% in Pidgin English. Other languages (such as Igbo and Hausa) were used for 
2% of the interviews.

The largest proportion (36.5%) of 
the respondents in Dopemu were in 
the age category of 31 - 40 years, 
followed by those in the age 
category of 21 – 30 (33.2%), and 
those in the age category 41 – 50 
years (20.1%). Respondents aged 
51 – 60 years accounted for 5.7%, 
while other age categories 
accounted for less than five per cent each. This finding indicates that virtually all the 
respondents were in the active working age group.

Females constituted the majority 
(65.2%) of the potential project 
affected persons in Dopemu, while 
males accounted for about one-third 
(34.8%). This is in line with various 
studies that have shown a predominance of women in the informal trading, sales and 
marketing business/micro-enterprise. The implication of this finding is that more 
women will be affected by the project than men.

Majority (60.2%) of the potential PAPs were of Yoruba origin, followed by Igbo 
(29.1%), while Hausa constituted 1.6%. However, 9 per cent of the respondents did 
not specify their ethnic backgrounds. The predominance of Yorubas among the 
respondents can be attributed to the fact that Lagos is a Yoruba city.

The type of premises used by the project 
affected persons (PAPs) is indicative of the 
scale of operation and relative easy or 
difficulty of relocation, and consequently, 
the burden of compensation that may have 
to be made. The lock-up shops are 
fixed/immovable cement block structures, 
while containers are relatively big, but 
movable metal structures. Kiosks are 
smaller structures often made of wooden 
materials and are relatively movable. All 
other structures are not fixed and can be 
easily moved as necessary.  
 
Analysis of the findings showed that the respondents use various types of premises, 
which includes: vendor table (used by 27.9%), open stall (23.8%), kiosk (16.8%), 
and open space (13.9%). Furthermore, 9% of the respondents used lock-up shops, 
and 5.7% artisan tables. The remaining respondents (2.8%) used other types of 
premises such as containers and wheelbarrows.

On the type of 
materials used 
for the 
construction of 
the premises 
occupied by the 
respondents, the 
study finds 
wooden materials were used for most (70.5%) of the premises, followed by metals 
(18.4%), and plastic materials (5.3%), while concrete materials such as blocks were 
used for 1.6% of the premises. Various other materials were used for the remaining 
premises.

The study also sought 
information about other people 
(employees) who may be 
affected by possible relocation. 
Analysis showed that most 
(55.7%) of the PAPs in Dopemu 
do not have any assistant or 
employee, while 22.5% have salaried assistants/employees, while 21.7 have non-
salaried assistant/employees.  This is also indicative of the scale of business 
operations.

On 
the daily income from business 
activities among PAPs in 
Dopemu, the gross daily 
income for about four-fifths 
(79.5%) of the respondents 
was 
below N5000 (defined as “small 
scale”, while 13.1% had daily 
gross 
income of N5000 - N10, 000 
(defined as 
“medium scale”), and 7.4% with 
daily gross income above N10, 000 (defined as “large scale”).  
1HW\03'DLO\\03,QFRPH\03\0b1DLUD\0c
\03
Analysis of the net daily income of the 
potential PAPs showed that the net daily 
income varied from as low as below N500, 
to as high as over N5,000. However, half 
(50.4%) of the PAPs had net daily 
incomes below N500, while 40.6% had 
daily net incomes from N500 to N2,000,  
and 6.1% earned N2,000 to N5,000 daily. 
 
Only 2.9% of the PAPs reported daily net incomes above N5, 000. This again gives an 
idea about the possible burden of compensation for loss of income due to temporary 
dislocation that the PAPs may suffer.  This also makes it imperative to compensate 
them for relocation, for this not to have serious negative impact on their lives.

Only one-quarter (25%) of the PAPs owned 
the premises from which they operated, 
while all others were tenants to other 
individuals, groups or agencies.  
 
The analysis also showed that the Local 
Government owns the largest proportion 
(46.3%) of the business premises used by 
the PAPs, followed by individual landlords 
(10.7%), state government (3.3%) and 
family members (2.9%). Other agencies such 
as the National Union of Road Transport

The premises owners were further 
asked about the cost of acquiring the 
premises. Analysis showed that the cost 
of acquiring the premises varied, but 
less than N5,000 in many cases (25%), 
while 10.7% of the respondents said 
they spent N6,000 – N10,000; 9.4% 
spent N11,000 – N20,000; 5.7% spent 
N21,000 – N30,000; and 4.5% spent 
N31,000 – N50,000. Furthermore, 3.7% 
said they spent N51, 000 – N100, 000, 
1.2% spent (N101, 000 – N200, 000; 
and only one respondent (0.4%) claimed spending over N200, 000 to secure the 
premises. This gives an idea about the burden of compensation in the case of 
relocation, although there is still need for specific individual valuation.

Analysis of the net daily income 
showed that majority (53.1%) of 
the PAPs in Fagba had net 
incomes less than N500 per day, 
while 40.6% had net incomes 
between N500 and N2, 000; and 
6.3% between N2,001 and N5, 000. This also gives an idea about the scale of the 
business operations in the location, and the potential burden of compensation for 
PAPs who may have to be relocated. This makes it imperative to compensate them for 
relocation, for this not to have serious negative impact on their lives.

sales/customers, while 25% expressed concerns about the distance from their homes 
to the new location and the implications of this for the cost of transportation. 
Furthermore, two respondents (6.3%) expressed what may be described as fear of 
the unknown (apprehension about what they may meet in the new place), while 
another two respondents expressed concerns about being able to sustain their 
families after relocation. However, one respondent said there was no fear whatsoever

interviewed in old Iyana Ipaja road. In order to ensure effective communication and 
comprehension of the research questions by the respondents, the interviews were

incomes below N5,000 (defined as 
“small scale”), while 18.1% had gross 
daily incomes of N5,000 to N10,000 
(defined as “medium scale”); and 10.6% 
above N10,000 per day (defined as 
“large scale). Just as with other project areas, this indicates that majority of the PAPs 
have small-scale business operations.

The net daily income of the

(50%$) of them making net daily 
income below N500, while 41.6% 
made N500 – N2,000; 6.9% 
between N2,001 – N5,000. Only 
1.5% reported net daily income above N5,000. Again, this indicates that majority of 
the PAPs are relatively low income people. This also gives an idea about the potential 
burden of compensation for PAPs who may have to be relocated. This makes it 
imperative to compensate them for relocation, for this not to have serious negative 
impact on their lives.

Furthermore, the modal net daily 
income among the PAPs is N500 –

Moreover, 6.1% of the PAPs

whle3.2% said they earned over

about the scale of the business 
operations in the location, and the 
potential burden of compensation 
for PAPs who may have to be relocated. This makes it imperative to compensate them 
for relocation, for this not to have serious negative impact on their lives.

Many Vendors also expressed concerns about missing some benefits presently 
enjoyed in their locations, problems about getting another reliable society to 
join/difficulty in establishing trust with new societies, loss of contact with friends, 
neighbours, etc. Further interaction with the Vendors revealed that many considered 
the holding of executive positions in associations to be very important as this is often 
associated with some executive power, prestige and influence. Many go to great 
extents and expend so much money, time, and effort to get elected. 
 
Furthermore, some Vendors also expressed concerns about difficulties in adapting to new 
environment; distance from residence to new business locations; “starting all over again”, high 
rent for accommodation and business premises; insecurity; cost of relocation, and the impact of 
relocation on their children’s education if they have to change residence. 
3.6 Ameliorative Measures 
The field observation showed that the negative impacts of dislocation/relocation will 
be minimal because majority of the Vendors use temporary, movable structures which 
can be simply removed from their present locations where infrastructures will be 
constructed. Since such materials are reusable, LAMATA will only provide cost of 
labour and transportation for such vendors.  
 
Furthermore, it was observed that there are spaces behind the present locations of 
the stalls/shops and operating tables. This would make it easy for the Vendors to 
simply move back some steps to be clear of the right of way. This should also help to 
minimize the cost of relocation. This was affirmed by many of the Vendors, some of 
whom requested to be allowed to move back a bit. 
 
Interaction with the Vendors also revealed that in some of the locations, especially 
Pen cinema and Lawanson, a number of the Vendors have shops in the market where 
they can locate to but opt to remain by the roadside because of the desire to be close 
to the customers and make quick sales rather than waiting for patronage inside the 
markets. This can also be said to be a reflection of the level of keen competition for 
customers. Furthermore, those inside the markets believe that the traders on the road 
would have “hijacked” the customers before they get inside the market. The 
outrageous cost of renting lock-up/open shops could be another inhibiting factor to 
remaining inside the market. 
In terms of relocation preferences, many of the Vendors expressed the desire to be relocated 
within their present locations. This may not be unconnected with issues about their social and 
business/trade associations and affiliations as earlier analysed above. Many of them wished to be 
relocated near the road where they can have easy access to customers rather than being 
relocated to “hidden” places. In this regard, many expressed their interest to be allowed to move 
their stalls back beyond the “right of way”. Field observation showed that many of the Vendors 
could simply be required to move some steps back off the right of way. This would probably be 
mutually satisfactory, as the project would have succeeded in moving the Vendors away from the 
right of way, while the Vendors would also be satisfied with the minimum dislocation. In economic 
terms, this would also reduce the burden of relocation and compensation as most of the people 
would not need to be paid any financial compensation, and would entail little or no disruption to 
daily economic activities.

Many expressed the desire to be relocated before the project commences, and being given 
adequate notice, while others emphasized the need for justice and fairness in the relocation 
process. 
3.7 Consultations and Public Disclosure 
Prior to the commencement of the RAP study, detailed consultations and public 
disclosure was undertaken to disseminate to the people the intentions of state 
government through LAMATA towards the implementation of the road improvement 
project. Key stakeholders that were consulted for this RAP are: 
· 
Alimosho, Agege, Ifako/Ijaiye, Surulere and Mushin Local Governments 
· 
NURTW (Agege and Lawanson branches) 
· 
Market Association  
· 
Traditional leaders 
· 
keke NAPEP Association 
 
The consultations carried out prior to the RAP study is a follow-up to the continuous 
consultations that LAMATA has been carrying out since the conceptualization stage of 
this project. The safeguard, transport and external affairs unit of LAMATA has been 
very consistent with this approach to ensure that all stakeholders are adequately 
briefed about the project and their suggestions and inputs are included in total project 
design. This approach further strengthened the sustainability of the project. Key 
stakeholder that LAMATA has consulted includes: 
 
· 
National Road Transport Employers Association 
· 
Lagos State House of Assembly Committee members on Transportation 
· 
Lagos State House of Assembly members representing the relevant local 
government area Federal Constituency  
· 
Lagos State Ministry of Transportation 
· 
Lagos State Ministry of the Environment

The RAP team and members from the transport and safeguard units of LAMATA 
carried out consultations with aforementioned stakeholders.  Summary of the 
consultations is presented below: 
 
1.  The NURTW is one of the major stakeholders of the proposed road and junction 
project areas. The union was very pleased as it will have positive impact on their 
business. This they agreed will ease free flow of traffic thereby leading to increase 
in their revenue generation. The union also agreed to ensure that LAMATA traffic 
management system is strictly adhered to by all the commercial vehicle operators 
by ensuring that the designated motor parks and bus stops are used efficiently for 
the purpose of decogesting traffic on the roads and junctions. 
 
2.  Alimosho and Agege local governments were consulted. The local government 
managers where very pleased with the intention of LAMATA to improve traffic

management system in their dormain. They alluded to the fact that the respective 
roads and junctions have been causing serious traffic problem in form of 
congestion within the areas. They promised to provide all the necessary support 
whenever called upon to ensure the success of the project. They also 
acknowledged that this is the first project in Nigeria that compensation is being 
considered for affected people considering the fact that the set back was illegally 
occupied by the vendors in the first instance. He commended the World Bank for 
this initiative and hoped that the Nigerian government will borrow a leaf from the 
World Bank when executing roads and other infrastructure projects involving 
involuntary reseeltlemnt in Nigeria. 
 
3.  The market leaders were also consulted to ascertain the legality of vendor’s 
occupation of the setback. The vendors do not have any legal permit from the 
LASG or the LGA to use the setback as business premises. They informed the RAP 
team that occasional fees are paid to representative of the LGA and NURTW while 
every vendor pays daily fees to the market association. The leaders of the market 
association also agreed that this is one of the few projects that people’s opinion is 
sought and resettlement issues taken seriously. The usual procedure is for the 
state to give them short notice and use the law enforcement to displace them from 
the setbacks. They were very happy that the World Bank is changing government 
idea about project implementation to include considerations for affected people. 
They request that ample notice be given to the vendors located in the affected 
areas to vacate.  
 
4.  The RAP team paid a short visit to the traditional head of Lawanson to intimate 
him of LAMATA’s intention and objectives. He pledged his full support for the 
project and that he will ensure that he passed the information to the relevant 
stakeholders within his dormain. He requested that adequate time should be given 
to the vendors to vacate the setback.  
3.7.2 RAP Disclosure 
The following process will be used to disclose the RAP: 
 
· 
LAMATA will place the RAP in designated places and at least through the 
construction phase. In Nigeria, these will consist of Alimosho, Agege, 
Ifako/Ijaiye, Surulere and Mushin LGA, LASG secretariat, LAMATA office and 
any other public place as directed by the World Bank. 
· 
LAMATA will run public advertisement in the electronic media on the 
availability of the RAP report in designated places. 
· 
LAMATA will advise its public relations and legal units to maintain contact with 
the relevant Ministries, other public agencies, local representatives and 
communities. 
 
Furthermore, during project implementation, RAP consultant and the project director 
will prepare and conduct information and stakeholders program in the Project areas. 
The main objectives are to:

1.  inform and explain the entitlement policy and various options to the affected 
people (APs) prior to financial assistance;  
2.  socially prepare the affected persons for relocation; 
3.  help counter rumors and prevent unnecessary distress; 
4.  bring clarity on issues that might be raised by the affected persons about their 
entitlements and benefits through question-and-answer sessions; 
5.  solicit help from the local government, NURTW and others and encourage their 
participation in RP implementation  and 
6.  attempt to ensure that vulnerable groups understand the process and their 
needs are specifically taken into consideration. 
 
Finally, participation of project-affected people is also ensured through their 
involvement in various local committees such as Resettlement Advisory Committees 
and Grievances Redress Committees. LAMATA will establish and continuously maintain 
an ongoing interaction with the APs to identify problems and undertake 
remedial/correctional actions. 
 
The World Bank requires that the RAP be submitted for their review. Once approved 
for public disclosure purposes, the RAP will be made available via the World Bank Info 
Shop. In addition, short brochures will be printed and distributed to inform people of 
the RAP implementation arrangements.

CHAPTER FOUR 
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
The legal framework provides the basis for three key elements of the Resettlement 
Action Plan (RAP). 
 
1.  Establishing rates for compensation; 
2.  Determining eligibity for compensation and resettlement assistance, including 
development initiatives aimed at improving the social and economic well-being 
of affected populations; 
3.  Establishing mechanisms to resolve grievances among affected populations 
related to compensation and eligibility. 
 
Land ownership in Nigeria is subject to a range of diverse cultural and traditional 
practices and customs. Land can be classified according to the following broad 
categories: 
 
&RPPXQLW\\03ODQG
:
 or land commonly referred to as ancestral land, is owned by all the 
people. 
&RPPXQDO\03ODQG\1d
 
consists mostly of under-developed forests and is owned by nobody. 
Those who clear it first claim ownership. 
&ODQ\03RU\03IDPLO\\03ODQG\1d
 is owned by clans and families, as the name suggests. 
,QVWLWXWLRQDO\03ODQG\1d
 
land allocated to traditional institutions such as traditional 
authorities and chiefs. 
,QGLYLGXDO\03ODQG\1d
 land acquired by an individual, which may be inherited by the 
immediate family, depending on customary practices 
 
The legal framework for land acquisition and resettlement in Nigeria is the Land Use 
Act (LUA) of 1978, reviewed under Cap 202, 1990. The relevant Bank policy (OP) 4.12 
was adopted in 2001. The differences between the Land Use Act and the Bank’s OP 
mostly concern rehabilitation measures, which are neither proscribed nor mandated in 
the Act.  
4.1 
World Bank Resettlement Guidelines 
This RAP is in accordance with the World Bank Policy OP 4.12 
9
 on Involuntary 
Resettlement
10
 as an effective and sustainable means of restoring the livelihoods of 
people affected by the implementation of the project. Where there are gaps between 
the Nigerian legislative norms and the World Bank Policy in regard to compensation 
for land, the OP 4.12 will apply. In this regard, the OP 4.12 specifies that resettlement

World Bank Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement

 Resettlement is involuntary when it occurs without the informed consent of the displaced persons or if they give their consent 
without having the power to refuse resettlement.

compensation
11
 and assistance be offered to all displaced persons regardless of the 
total number affected, the severity of impact, and whether or not they have legal title 
to the land. In particular, the OP 4.12 indicates that compensation should be made to 
the following three categories of affected population: 
 
· 
Those who have formal rights to land, including customary and traditional 
rights recognized under the local laws 
· 
Those who do not have formal rights to land at the time the census began but 
have a claim to such lands or assets, and 
· 
Those who have no recognisable legal right or claim on land they are 
occupying. 
 
OP 4.12 aims to ensure that the following key principles of resettlement are in place: 
 
· 
 
The Project Affected Persons
12
 (PAP) are offered choices including 
alternative resettlement options that are technically and economically feasible 
to them and are culturally appropriate. 
· 
 
When the impacts require physical relocation, the resettlement 
measures must include provision of assistance during relocation (moving 
allowance), residential housing or housing sites that are at least equivalent to 
the old site in terms of productive potential and locational advantages. 
· 
 
Preferences are given to land-based resettlement strategies of the 
displaced people whose livelihoods are land-based and are indigenous. Such 
strategies must be compatible with their cultural preferences and should be 
prepared in consultations with them. 
· 
 
The affected people should also be provided with development 
assistance for losses incurred. 
· 
 
Particular attention should be paid to the needs and concerns of the 
poor and vulnerable groups including the landless, women, and children 
including the elderly, ethnic minorities, and indigenous compensation. 
· 
 
Resettlement should include measures to ensure that the affected 
people are offered support for a reasonable transition period based on the 
estimate of time required to restore the original level of their livelihoods and 
standards of living. 
· 
 
Compensations must be made in cash or in-kind depending on the 
preferences made by the affected people. They should be made promptly, in 
form of a single payment and shall be at a market value agreed to between 
willing buyers and sellers, which shall be considered as full replacement cost
13
 
for the lost assets. 
                                                
 
11
 Payment in cash or in kind for an asset or a resource that is acquired or affected by a project at the time the asset 
needs to be replaced. 
12
 Any person who, as a result of the implementation of a project, loses the right to own, use, or otherwise benefit 
from a built structure, land (residential, agricultural, or pasture), annual or perennial crops and trees, or any other 
fixed or moveable asset, either in full or in part, permanently or temporarily. 
 
13
 
The rate of compensation for lost assets (with regard to land and structures) must be calculated at full 
replacement cost, that is, the market value of the assets plus transaction costs.

· 
 
Cash compensation for lost assets may be appropriate under the 
following circumstances: 
i. 
Where the livelihoods are land based, but the land acquired by the 
project is a small fraction of the affected asset and the residual is 
economically viable. 
ii. 
Where there is a sufficient supply of land, housing and labour which can 
be used by the displaced person; and 
iii. 
Where the livelihoods are not land based. 
 
In regard to public consultation and disclosure, the OP 4.12 indicates that: 
 
· 
The affected people should be identified and informed about their options and 
rights in regard to resettlement and should be given the opportunity to 
participate in planning, implementing, and monitoring of the resettlement 
activities. 
· 
A census of the affected population and broad consultations in the affected 
communities should be undertaken in order not to only identify those to be 
affected, but also to discourage inflow of people not eligible for assistance. 
· 
Participants in the consultations must include community leaders, NGOs, CBOs 
and other interest groups active in the project area. 
 
4.2 
Land Use Act of 1978 and Resettlement Procedures 
The Land Use Act Cap 202, 1990 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria is the key 
legislation that has direct relevance to this project. Relevant Sections of these laws as 
may relate to this project with respect to land ownership and property rights, 
resettlement and compensation are summarised in this section. 
 
The Land Use Act is the applicable law regarding ownership, transfer, acquisition and 
all such dealings on Land. The provisions of the Act vest every Parcel of Land in every 
State of the Federation in the Executive Governor of the State. He holds such parcel 
of land in trust for the people and government of the State. The Act categorized the 
land in a state to urban and non-urban or local areas. The administration of the urban 
land is vested in the Governor, while the later is vested in the Local Government 
Councils. At any rate, all land irrespective of the category belongs to the State while 
individuals only enjoy a right of occupancy as contained in the certificate of 
occupancy, or where the grants are “deemed”. 
 
The concept of ownership of land as known in the western context is varied by the 
Act. The Governor administers the land for the common good and benefits of all 
Nigerians. The law makes it lawful for the Governor to grant statutory rights of 
occupancy for all purposes; grant easements appurtenant to statutory rights of 
occupancy and to demand rent. The Statutory rights of Occupancy are for a definite 
time (the limit is 99 years) and may be granted subject to the terms of any contract 
made between the state Governor and the Holder.

The Local Government Councils may grant customary rights of Occupancy for 
agricultural (including grazing and ancillary activities), residential and other purposes. 
But the limit of such grant is 500 hectares for agricultural purpose and 5,000 for 
grazing except with the consent of the Governor. The local Government, under the 
Act is allowed to enter, use and occupy for public purposes any land within its 
jurisdiction that does not fall within an area compulsorily acquired by the Government 
of the Federation or of relevant State; or subject to any laws relating to minerals or 
mineral oils. 
 
The State is required to establish an administrative system for the revocation of the 
rights of occupancy, and payment of compensation for the affected parties. So, the 
Land Use Act provides for the establishment of a Land Use and Allocation Committee 
in each State that determines disputes as to compensation payable for improvements 
on the land. (Section 2 (2) (c). 
 
In addition, each State is required to set up a Land Allocation Advisory Committee, to 
advise the Local Government on matters related to the management of land. The 
holder or occupier of such revoked land is to be entitled to the value of the 
unexhausted development as at the date of revocation. (Section 6) (5). Where land 
subject to customary right of Occupancy and used for agricultural purposes is revoked 
under the Land Use Act, the local government can allocate alternative land for the 
same purpose (section 6) (6). 
 
If Local Government refuses or neglects within a reasonable time to pay 
compensation to a holder or occupier, the Governor may proceed to effect 
assessment under section 29 and direct the Local Government to pay the amount of 
such compensation to the holder or occupier. (Section 6) (7). 
 
Where a right of occupancy is revoked on the ground either that the land is required 
by the Local, State or Federal Government for public purpose or for the extraction of 
building materials, the holder and the occupier shall be entitled to compensation for 
the value at the date of revocation of their unexhausted improvements. Unexhausted 
improvement has been defined by the Act as:

It follows from the foregoing that compensation is not payable on vacant land on 
which there exist no physical improvements resulting from the expenditure of capital 
or labour. The compensation payable is the estimated value of the unexhausted 
improvements at the date of revocation. 
 
Payment of such compensation to the holder and the occupier as suggested by the 
Act is confusing. Does it refer to holder in physical occupation of the land or two 
different persons entitled to compensation perhaps in equal shares? The correct view 
appears to follow from the general tenor of the Act. First, the presumption is more 
likely to be the owner of such unexhausted improvements. Secondly, the provision of 
section 6(5)
 of the Act, which makes compensation payable to the holder and the 
occupier according to their respective interests, gives a pre-emptory directive as to 
who shall be entitled to what.  
 
Again the Act provides in 
section 30
 that where there arises any dispute as to the 
amount of compensation calculated in accordance with the provisions of 
section 29, 
such dispute shall be referred to the appropriate Land Use and Allocation Committee. 
It is clear from 
section 47 (2) 
of the Act that no further appeal will lie from the 
decision of such a committee. If this is so, then the provision is not only retrospective 
but also conflicts with the fundamental principle of natural justice, which requires that 
a person shall not be a judge in his own cause. The Act must, in making this 
provision, have proceeded on the basis that the committee is a distinct body quite 
different from the Governor or the Local Government. It is submitted, however, that it 
will be difficult to persuade the public that this is so since the members of the 
committee are all appointees of the Governor. 
 
Where a right of occupancy is revoked for public purposes within the state of the 
Federation; or on the ground of requirement of the land for the extraction of building 
materials, the quantum of compensation shall be as follows:

Where the right of occupancy revoked is in respect of a part of a larger portion of 
land, compensation shall be computed in respect of the whole land for an amount 
equal in rent, if any, paid by the occupier during the year in which the right of 
occupancy was revoked less a proportionate amount calculated in relation to the area 
not affected by the revocation; and any interest payable shall be assessed and 
computed in the like manner. Where there is any building installation or improvement 
or crops on the portion revoked, the quantum of compensation shall follow that 
outlined in paragraph (ii) above and any interest payable shall be computed in like 
manner. 
4.3 
Comparison between Land Use Act and Bank OP 4.12 
Whereas the law relating to land administration in Nigeria is wide and varied, 
entitlements for payment of compensation are essentially based on right of 
ownership. The Bank's OP4.12 is fundamentally different from this and states that 
affected persons are entitled to some form of compensation whether or not they have 
legal title if they occupy the land by a cut -off date.  
 
The TSM Group B and D Junction project is a Bank funded project. Therefore, the 
principles of OP 4.12 are not negotiable and must be strictly adhered to. As a result, 
all land to be acquired by the government for this project would be so acquired 
subject to the Laws of Nigeria and the Bank OP4.12. Where, there is conflict, the Bank 
OP 4.12 must take precedence. Table 4-1 presents the comparison between the Land 
use act of 1978 and Work Bank Operational Policy OP 4.12 as it relates to 
compensation.

4.3 Project Compliance with World Bank Policy Objectives 
Although the local legislation, including those regulating the right of way for use of set 
backs belonging to the state does not require application of measures similar to those 
required by OP 4.12 to acquire land, LAMATA has fulfilled the requirements of the 
Involuntary Resettlement Policy as follows: 
 
· 
Census survey of all affected persons has been carried out and RAP identity 
cards have been issued to all affected vendors. 
· 
Extensive consultations with the vendors and union have been carried out. 
· 
Socioeconomic surveys of affected person in each of the road and junction set 
backs has been undertaken. 
· 
Agreed to pay adequate compensation (cash and kind) to both legal and illegal 
vendors within the acquired portions of the set back.  
· 
LAMATA has agreed to set-up a RAP implementation teams that consist of the 
NURTW, government agencies and representative of market women 
association to participate in the resettlement and compensation of affected 
persons. 
4.4 Resettlement/Compensation 
Procedures 
So far, there is no specific policy on resettlement in Nigeria. The Land Acquisition Act 
of 1978 deals with all aspects of land acquisition, and resettlement issues are 
addressed on project-by-project basis. In the absence of a formal policy to assist non-
titled persons, a project specific set of resettlement principles consistent with World 
Bank Policy requirements, has been adopted in this Project. In other to ensure that 
the interests of displaced persons are fully protected in accordance with both the Land 
Use Act and World Bank OP 4.12, LAMATA will: 
 
The basic resettlement principles and guidelines include the following:  
 
1.  The affected persons are defined as those who stand to lose land where they 
conduct their business and income. 
2.  All affected persons are equally eligible for compensation and rehabilitation 
assistance, irrespective of land ownership status, to ensure that those affected

by the project shall be at least as well off, if not better off than they would 
have been without the Project. 
3.  The compensation packages shall reflect replacement costs for all losses where 
appropriate 
4.  Compensation and resettlement will be satisfactorily completed before the 
commencement of civil works. 
5.  Affected persons will be systematically informed and consulted about the 
project. 
6.  The consultative process shall include not only those affected, but also the 
NURTW, Local government, community leaders etc. 
7.  A number of affected persons shall be relocated to nearby opens space hebind 
the drainage/set backs of each of these roads and junctions, while others will 
be relocated to markets. 
 
As designed, LUTP requires little or no land acquisition for the rehabilitation of the 
transport system, so there is no immediate requirement for the Agency to establish a 
special account with the Ministry of Finance for the compensation of displaced persons 
because of involuntary land acquisition.  This would be done only in the instance that 
occupancy certificates unavoidably had to be revoked and the persons so displaced 
were therefore entitled to legal compensation and rehabilitation. This is not applicable 
to the proposed project as none of the vendors have any legal right of occupation. 
LAMATA will nonetheless establish a resettlement fund, managed by the Safeguards 
Unit, to facilitate, when necessary, relocation of street vendors and transporters to 
locations near their present premises.  LAMATA will reserve adequate sum from the 
Transport Fund (TF), at the outset of the project, for the conduct of such activities by 
the social section of the Safeguards Unit. 
4.5 Grievance Redress Mechanisms 
Given the enormity of the challenges associated with grievance redress, LAMATA 
Safeguards in conjunction with an NGO to be a part of grievance redress. Grievance 
redress committee will be set-up to address complaints from RAP implementation. 
This committee will be directly under the project director and its members will include 
legal, accounts, representative of NURTW, Local government, Market Association and 
Ministry of Transport. The legal expert from LAMATA shall be the secretary of the 
committee and they shall meet twice every week to address pertinent issues raised. 
The functions of the Grievance Redress Committee are: 
 
· 
Provide support to affected persons on problems arising from loss of business 
area and/or eviction from the setbacks; 
· 
Record the grievance of the affected persons, categorize and prioritize the 
grievances that need to be resolved by the Committee; and 
· 
Report to the aggrieved parties about the developments regarding their 
grievances and the decision of the Project authorities.

The main objective of the grievance redress procedure will be to provide a mechanism 
to mediate conflict and cut down on lengthy litigation, which often delay such 
infrastructure projects. It will also provide people who might have objections or 
concerns about their assistance, a public forum to raise their objections and through 
conflict resolution, address these issues adequately. The committee will undertake a 
highly consultative process for transport rehabilitation and re-routing of the 
commercial vehicle operators to other feeder roads. In addition, the committee will 
also encourage the commercial vehicle operators to strictly adhere to traffic 
management system of LAMATA. The committee will provide ample opportunity to 
redress complaints informally, in addition to the existing formal administrative and 
legal procedures.  However, the major grievances that might require mitigations 
include: 
 
1. Affected persons not enlisted; 
2. Losses not correctly identified; 
3. Inadequate assistance or not in line with entitlement matrix; 
4. Dispute about ownership; 
5. Delay in disbursement of assistance; and 
6. Improper distribution of assistance. 
 
It is the responsibility of the grievance redress committee to satisfactorily address all 
complaints brought by the project-affected persons. On the condition that an affected 
person is not satisfied with the decisions of the committee, such person has an 
opportunity to seek the intervention of the Managing Director of LAMATA to address 
his/her grievance.

CHAPTER FIVE 
VALUATION AND COMPENSATION FOR STRUCTURES 
5.1 Introduction 
Valuation of assets along the set back on both sides of the Group B and D 
roads/junctions was conducted by a qualified surveyor between 16
th
 and 30
th
 July 
2007 to ascertain individuals whose properties or livelihoods will be directly or 
indirectly affected by the project activities. Since the entire roads and junction set 
back will not be acquired, valuation was conducted at locations of shops 
encroachment to the roads and junctions.   
 
A general principle adopted in the formulation of the compensation valuation is that 
lost income and assets will be valued at their full replacement cost such that the 
project–affected populations should experience no net loss. This is in accordance with 
the LAMATA Resettlement principles and World Bank operational policy on involuntary 
resettlement, OP 4.12. In line with the above principle, LAMATA conducted an all-
encompassing survey and valuation of the assets and loss of income by the Project 
affected persons (PAPs).  
 
Considering the extent of land acquisition within the setbacks and the fact that no 
demolitions of structures will be carried out, there will be no huge monetary 
compensation or replacement of Land or business premises/structures. 
5.2 Eligibility Criteria and Project Entitlement  
The World Bank Resettlement Policy/Guidelines require compensation for the lost 
assets and replacement costs to both titled and non-titled landholders and 
resettlement assistance for lost income and livelihoods. In this Project, the absence of 
formal titles will not constitute a barrier to resettlement assistance and rehabilitation. 
Further, the principles adopted herein contain special measures and assistance for 
vulnerable affected persons, such as female-headed households, disabled persons, 
and the poor. Persons affected by land acquisition, and relocation and/or 
rehabilitation of structures/assets, Small Business Enterprises (SBE) houses, etc.), are 
entitled to a combination of compensation measures and resettlement assistance, 
depending on the nature of ownership rights of lost assets and scope of the impact, 
including social and economic vulnerability of the affected persons. In general terms, 
the affected persons in the project area will be entitled to various types of 
compensation and resettlement assistance that will help in the restoration of their 
livelihoods, at a minimum, to the pre-project standards.  
 
Table 5-1 presents the eligibility matrix for the resettlement plan. The qualified 
vendors that are eligible for compensation and other project assistance include:

Prior to the survey and administration of study questionnaires, LAMATA and officials 
of the RAP team engaged all stakeholders in due consultations in July 2007 to inform 
and educate them on the purpose of the project and the possible associated impacts. 
The consultations involved different groups, such as the National Union of Road

Transport workers (NURTW), Market Women Associations, the Local Government 
Councils etc. 
 
During the consultations, the stakeholders were made to understand the purpose of 
the project. The NURTW is a very organized, influential and strategic organization. 
They are the major operators of commercial vehicles in Lagos metropolis including the 
project areas. In exceptional cases they also allocate trading spaces to vendors within 
the setbacks and in motor parks.  
 
The union, traditional rulers, market association and other stakeholders have been 
veritable partners in this project and adequate consultation has been carried out prior 
to the implementation of the RAP study. During the administration of questionnaire 
and census, useful interation that existed between some of the enumerators and the 
PAPs revealed that they are favourably disposed to the project and will be willing to 
support LAMATA in achieving this laudable objective of ensuring efficient traffic 
management in the group B and D Junctions.  
 
All parties mentioned in this RAP report will be adequately notified before the 
commencement of resettlement and project assistance and it is the desire of LAMATA 
to conclude all the resettlemt issues before PAPs are relocated to alternative locations 
along the set back or nearby markets. 
   
5.2 Value of Land  
Much as LAMATA will give adequate assistance to the PAPs that will be relocated, 
LAMATA is not obliged to make monetary payments as compensation for lands along 
the safety zone of the respective roads and junctions. Therefore, there is no 
justification to make presentation on value for land which the PAPs currently occupy. 
5.3 Valuation of Affected Structures 
As already stated, there will be no demolition of structures hence structures will not 
be valued since PAPs will be allowed to dismantle their structures and reuse them at 
relocated locations. LAMATA will provide supplementary assistance to affected PAPs 
(see section 3.2 for details). Depending on the type of materials used for the 
construction of structures, rates will be considered for cost of labour and 
transportation allowance. Basically two types of materials are prevalent: 
wood/plywood and steel. The rates that were confirmed to us by the vendors will 
apply and these are: 
 
1.  Transportation allowance for moving structures within the corridors 
a.  Kiosk (lock-up wooden shops) =N=5,500 
b.  Open stall (dismantled wooden materials) =N=4,000 
2.  Cost of labour for dismantling and reconstruction 
a.  Lock-up steel shops =N=5,500 
b.  Kiosk (lock-up wooden shops) =N=4,500 
c.  Opens stall =N=2,500

a.  Nails =N=250/kg  
b. Cement =N=1500/bag 
c.  Fuel = N=70/litre 
d.  Roofing sheets =N=450/sheet 
5.4 Modes of Restitution 
All project affected persons have been provided with an identification card that will 
make them eligible for compensation or assistance. The identity cards contain names 
of PAP’s and neighborhood codes for identification purposes. Names of eligible PAP’s 
will be conspicuously displayed in affected areas and copies of the list will also be sent 
to the market associations. The notification for payment will include locations where 
payments will be made, amount to be paid, the time and date of payment.  
 
LAMATA will organize the presentation of this report to the various stakeholders 
(market associations, NURTW, traditional leaders, ministries and other governmental 
agencies). In addition the report will be displayed at strategic public places including 
local government secretariat, government offices and selected libraries. Their 
comments will be incorporated in the final report that will be submitted to the client. 
5.5 Payment of Compensation 
In line with the World Bank operational policy on involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12), 
LAMATA will ensure that the conditions of PAPs are restored to the status that is at 
the minimum commensurate to their pre-project status. List of all PAPs has been 
documented in the PAP register and will be provided to LAMATA. In addition, every 
person affected by the project has been issued an identity card for easy identification 
for possible compensation. These cards among other parameters indicate the name of 
the person, business type, and code number. The identity cards will serve as the 
major identification for restitution.  
 
The RAP implementation will verify the correctness of each PAPs as stated in the 
register and ascertain that every identity card holder is correctly documented in the 
register. On completion of the PAP audit list, the project director will setup a team 
that will carry out payment and compensation. This team will consist of LAMATA’s

CHAPTER SIX 
MONITORING AND VALUATION 
6.1 Objectives 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) procedures establish the effectiveness of all land 
and asset acquisition and resettlement activities, in addition to the measures designed 
to mitigate adverse social impacts. The procedures include internal track keeping 
efforts as well as independent external monitoring. 
 
The purpose of resettlement monitoring for the LAMATA project will be to verify that: 
 
· 
Actions and commitments described in the RAP are implemented; 
· 
Eligible project affected people receive their full compensation prior to the start 
of the rehabilitation activities on the corridor; 
· 
RAP actions and compensation measures have helped the people who sought 
cash compensation in restoring their lost incomes and in sustaining/improving 
pre-project living standards; 
· 
Complaints and grievances lodged by project affected people are followed up 
and, where necessary, appropriate corrective actions are taken;  
· 
If necessary, changes in RAP procedure are made to improve delivery of 
entitlements to project affected people. 
 
The World Bank operational policy (OP 4.12) states that the project sponsor 
(LAMATA) is responsible for adequate M&E of the activities set forth in the 
resettlement instrument. Monitoring will provide both a warning system for the project 
sponsor (LAMATA) and a channel for the affected persons to make known their needs 
and their reactions to resettlement execution. LAMATA’s monitoring and evaluation 
activities and programs would be adequately funded and staffed. In-house monitoring 
may need to be supplemented by independent monitors to ensure complete and 
objective information. Accordingly, the primary responsibility for monitoring rests with 
LAMATA. Interestingly, LAMATA already has an Environmental and Social safeguard 
team, and an implementation-monitoring unit. These different groups, in cooperation 
with each other and with guidance from the External Relations Unit of LAMATA will 
monitor the project.  
6.2 RAP Monitoring Framework 
There are three components of the monitoring framework for the Road and junction 
improvement project: 
 
• Internal monitoring by LAMATA; 
• Impact monitoring commissioned to specialized firms; and 
• RAP Completion Audit

The scope of each type of monitoring is briefly described in the following sections and 
in Table 6-1. The roles and responsibilities for internal and external monitoring are 
discussed along with the reporting, staffing and resources needed for the monitoring 
program.

In order to effectively report on the effectiveness of RAP implementation, LAMATA, as 
the project sponsor, will monitor the following key indicators, in keeping with World 
Bank requirements on involuntary resettlement: 
 
• The timely disbursement of compensation; 
• Compensation disbursement to the correct parties; 
• Public consultation and grievance procedures in place and functioning; and 
• The physical progress of resettlement and rehabilitation, where applicable 
 
LAMATA’s monitoring will provide the RAP management team with feedback on RAP 
implementation and help ensure that adverse impacts on affected people are 
mitigated in a timely manner. M&E will be the main mechanism to alert management 
of any delays and problems and will help LAMATA measure the extent to which the 
main objectives of the resettlement plan have been achieved. RAP monitoring and 
evaluation activities will be adequately funded, implemented by qualified specialists 
and integrated into the overall project management system.

LAMATA’s RAP monitoring and evaluation activities will be supplemented and verified 
by monitoring efforts of an NGO, whose area of intervention is in resettlement 
matters. 
 
The establishment of appropriate indicators in the RAP is essential since what is 
measured is what will be considered important. Indicators will be created for affected 
people as a whole, for key stakeholder groups, and for special categories of affected 
groups such as women. Key performance indicators for monitoring are commonly 
divided into five categories for World Bank financed activities: 
 
•  
Input 
indicators include the resources in terms of people, equipment and 
materials that go into the RAP. Examples of input indicators in the RAP are the 
sources and amounts of funding for various RAP activities. 
 
•  
Output 
indicators concern the activities and services, which are produced 
with the inputs. Examples of output indicators in the RAP include (i) a 
database for tracking individual compensation; and (ii) the payment of 
compensation for loss of assets. 
 
•  
Process 
indicators represent the change in the quality and quantity of access 
and coverage of the activities and services. Examples of process indicators in 
the RAP include: 
1.  The creation of grievance mechanisms; 
2.  The establishment of stakeholder channels so that they can participate 
in RAP   implementation; and 
3. Information dissemination activities. 
 
•  
Outcome 
indicators include the delivery of compensation and other mitigation 
to avoid economic and physical displacement caused by the Project. They 
measure whether compensation is paid and received, whether the affected 
populations who preferred cash compensation to in-kind resettlement 
assistance offered to them was able to use compensation payment for 
sustained income. 
 
The most important indicators for the RAP in the near term concern outputs, 
processes and outcomes since they define whether the planned level of effort is being 
made and whether early implementation experience is being used to modify/redesign 
RAP features. Over the medium to long term, outcome and impact indicators are 
critical since they are the ultimate measure of the RAP’s effectiveness in restoring 
people’s livelihoods. 
 
Monitoring indicators may have to be defined or re-defined during the course of 
project in response to changes to project-related conditions. Consequently, 
implementation and mitigation measures may have to be adopted to incorporate 
these changes into the M&E plan.

RAP monitoring reports will be prepared in accordance with World Bank guidelines. 
Progress will be reported for the following tasks: 
• Internal monitoring; 
• Expert monitoring; 
• Completion audit and; 
• Compensation; 
 
LAMATA will use a device such as a bar chart/Gantt chart or MS Project table to 
assess and present information on progress of time bound actions. 
caron\11ffl\11ffl\03 6WDII\03DQG\030RQLWRULQJ\03
The LAMATA RAP management team will oversee all aspects of monitoring and 
evaluation, and will provide high-level review of internal performance and impact 
monitoring and associated reports. Staff with appropriate skills to carry out will 
supplement the management team: 
· 
RAP project resettlement requirements as defined by this RAP; 
· 
Gathering and presentation of monitoring indicators to be used; 
· 
Design and implementation of basic techniques to be used for collecting 
information and feedback from project affected people; and 
· 
Reporting requirements and formats. 
6.3 Internal Performance Monitoring 
Performance monitoring is an internal management function that will allow LAMATA to 
measure physical progress against milestone input, process, output and outcome 
indicators established in the RAP. To ensure independence of internal monitoring 
arrangements within the RAP Management Team are made so that the roles of the 
monitoring staff are separated from the other roles.

Performance monitoring of the RAP will be integrated into the overall project 
management to ensure that RAP activities are synchronized with all project 
implementation activities. Various methods will be used to monitor progress against 
the milestones established in the RAP, such as: 
 
· 
Interviews of random sample of affected people, using open-ended discussions 
to assess their knowledge and concerns regarding the displacement, their 
entitlement and rehabilitation measures; 
· 
Up-date of baseline survey within 18 months of displacement; 
· 
Case studies of grievances. 
 
Information will be collected and compiled in the quarterly narrative status and 
compensation disbursement reports.

Performance monitoring reports for the LAMATA RAP management team will be 
prepared at regular intervals (weekly), beginning with the commencement of any 
activities related to resettlement, including income restoration. These reports will 
summarize information that is collected and compiled in the quarterly narrative status 
and compensation disbursement reports and highlight key issues that have arisen. As 
a result of the monitoring of inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes of RAP 
activities, project management will be advised of necessary improvements in the 
implementation of the RAP. 
6.4 Impact 
Monitoring 
Impact monitoring gauges the effectiveness of the RAP and its implementation in 
meeting the needs of the affected population. LAMATA will commission social and 
economic impact monitoring studies in consultation with the external and independent 
Panel of Experts. Results will be reviewed by LAMATA RAP management team as well 
as by the Panel. The results of impact studies as well as internal monitoring efforts 
will be available through the regular information outlets of LAMATA. Impact 
monitoring will enable LAMATA to do the following: 
 
· 
Verify internal performance monitoring; and 
· 
Identify adjustments in the implementation of the RAP, as required. 
 
LAMATA will include the affected persons in all phases of impact monitoring, including 
the identification and measurement of baseline indicators. One baseline has already 
been established through the preliminary socio-economic studies of the population 
and area affected by the project. Impact monitoring will also review consultation and 
grievance mechanism outputs such as the types of grievances identified and the 
outcomes. 
caron\11ff\11fi\03
7\SH\03RI\03,QIRUPDWLRQ\12'DWD\03&ROOHFWHG\03
In order to measure the project impact and to assess the effectiveness of project 
impact mitigation measures LAMATA will evaluate various categories of quantitative 
economic, public health and social indicators at the individual level, as appropriate.  
 
In addition to quantitative indicators, impact monitoring will be supplemented by the 
use of qualitative indicators to assess client satisfaction and the satisfaction of the 
affected people with the choices that they have made in re-establishing themselves. 
Tracking this data will allow LAMATA to determine the following types of information:

CHAPTER SEVEN 
resettlement budget and financing 
The project has made the necessary budget provisions to ensure that the mitigation 
commitments, including compensation and the monitoring programs can be fully 
implemented. Full supplementary assistance will be provided by LAMATA. There is 
also a provision for contingencies and inflation that may result from delays. This is 
about 10% of total budget. LAMATA shall make direct payments to all project affected 
persons and this will be done after an audit of eligible PAPs would have been 
completed. The overall budget for the resettlement action plan is presented in Table 
7-1.

CHAPTER EIGHT 
schedule for rap implementation  
8.1 Introduction 
 
The implementation schedule for this RAP covers the periods from the preparation of 
the RAP to the conclusion of the TSM group B and D roads/junctions rehabilitation to 
the completion and the time that the raods/junctions will be fully available to full use. 
It should be noted that the procedure in the schedule starting from notification of the 
PAPs before their displacement through compensation and resettlement will be done 
in phases to synchronize with the various phases of the project. The RAP 
Implementation schedule defines the duration and timing of the key milestones and 
tasks. The major component tasks for the schedule include: 
 
· 
Preparation of RAP 
· 
Consultation and Disclosure of RAP 
· 
Final Investment Decision 
· 
Consultations with the PAPs to tidy compensation procedures 
· 
Notification of PAPs prior to the activities that will affect them 
· 
Space Acquisition, Compensation and/or Supplementary assistance. 
· 
Commencement of project operations. 
· 
Monitoring and evaluation, including baseline update 
 
Table 8-1 shows the implementation schedule, this however will be developed in 
further details and timeline after the World Bank Review and Final Investment 
Decision. 
8.2 Plan Preparation 
Development of the formal RAP began in July 2007 with socio-economic surveys in the 
field. It was completed in August 2007. Prior to the survey, LAMATA had consultation 
with the relevant stakeholders of project areas to inform them of the project and its 
purpose and profits. Public disclosure of the final document and restitution will be 
concluded in October 2007 subsequent to review by World Bank authorities before the 
final investment decision. 
8.3 Consultation and Disclosure 
Consultations with stakeholders, was initiated very early with preliminary meetings 
with local government chairman and union leaders. To date, LAMATA have conducted 
series of consultations.  
 
Broad ranges of stakeholders, including state and local authorities, traditional ruling 
authorities, non-governmental organizations, Community Based Organizations, youth

organizations and trade unions in the project areas have been contacted. The 
consultations were aimed at identifying the best ways to mitigate the impacts the 
project is likely to have on the affected people. 
 
In each area, LAMATA along side the RAP consultant and the valuation experts 
conducted open forums with the traders to inform them about the proposed 
road/junction improvement and the need for some of them to either shift or get 
relocated away from the Right Of Way (RoW) in each of the four areas. 
 
Disclosure of the RAP continues the public consultation process by communicating the 
plan for implementation of ROW acquisition and relocation assistance, as well as 
monitoring and evaluation of the mitigation measures.

8.4 RoW Acquisition and Construction 
RoW acquisition activities will be synchronized with the project construction. Specific RoW 
acquisition negotiations and contract preparation began in December 2006 following the 
survey of the quantity of RoW occupied and their valuation. The estate survey report was 
completed in August 2007. 
 
As part of the negotiations it will be stressed that the acquisition of properties (including 
appropriate assistance mechanisms) will be aligned with the construction schedule. Though 
the final schedule for construction is not yet in place, however, it is envisaged that site work 
will commence in January 2008 after payment of assistance and/or compensation. The 
commencement date of the schedule for the project is dependent on the final investment 
decision (FID). Rehabilitation and construction activities are expected to occur over a 3-

Glossary of key terms 
Cut-of Date 
– 
refers to a day on and beyond which any person who occupies land required for 
project use, would not be eligible for compensation. The date is often the day when the assessment 
of persons and their property in the project area commences. 
 
Market rate 
–
 is defined as the highest rate over the last three to five years. 
 
Project Affected Person(s)
 
– are persons affected by the land use or acquisition needs of the Local 
Governments supported activities that lead to these person(s) being required to (or not necessarily 
required to) be physically displaced or relocated due to loss of shelter and or lose, denied or restricted 
access and or to economic assets, or lose income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the 
person(s) must move to another location.   
 
Resettlement and Compensation Plan (RAP)
, 
is also known as a Resettlement Action Plan or 
Resettlement Plan – is a resettlement instrument (document) to be prepared when sub project activities 
are identified 
that require land acquisition that leads to physical displacement of persons, and/or loss 
of shelter, and/or loss of livelihoods and/or loss, denial or restriction of access to economic resources. 
The RAP is prepared by the party impacting people and livelihoods in this manner and contains 
specific and legal binding requirements to be taken by that party to resettle and compensate the 
affected party before sub project activities causing this adverse impact are implemented. 
  
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
is also resettlement instrument that is prepared by the 
borrower (in this case by the State Government) when project activities that require land require land 
acquisition that leads to physical displacement of persons, and/or loss of shelter, and or loss of 
livelihoods and/or the project preparation stage. The RPF is therefore prepared before the proposed 
project is appraised setting out the resettlement and compensation principles, organizational 
arrangements and design criteria to be applied to meet the needs of the people who may be affected by 
the sub project, when sub project activities are identified. The RAP is prepared consistent with the 
provisions of the RPF. 
 
Expanded Resettlement Policy Framework (ERPF) 
is a framework incorporating the legal 
background, methodology, rules for eligibility, compensation, values, and other basic elements upon 
which specific Resettlement Plans (RPs) will be designed.

A.   Description of the Project 
Lagos Urban Transport Project (LUTP) is the first five-year investment in a planned multi-phased 
program designed to improve the transport infrastructure, transport patterns, and the flow of traffic in 
metropolitan Lagos, Nigeria, over the coming decades. LUTP consists of five components: capacity 
building for Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority (LAMATA), a coordinating agency that will also 
prepare phase 11 follow-
on activities; maintenance and rehabilitation of 625 Kms of ‘declared’ road, 
including overpasses and bridges; bus service enhancement; water transport promotion; and rail mass 
transit planning. 
 
The basic aim of LUTP is to rehabilitate a deteriorated system of main roads that already exists. About 
40 percent of the road network under LAMATA is in good condition and requires only routine 
maintenance. Most of the rest of the road network under LAMATA supervision requires repaving and 
improvements for easier traffic flow (e.g., traffic lights, lane markings). As planned, no land 
acquisition and no resettlement will be required at the initial stage because road maintenance takes 
place entirely within the existing road corridor of the major arteries selected for upgrading. However, 
land acquisition may be necessary in later years, and resettlement of increasing numbers of traders and 
transporter will certainly be necessary over the life of the project. 
 
Rehabilitation of infrastructure for the proposed Pilot bus franchise scheme (Iyana-Ipaja to Ikotun) 
may require some land acquisition, especially at the terminals and depots. The major displacement that 
can be anticipated in this scheme would likely be vendors and traders. LAMATA will attempt to re-
arrange existing bus depots for maximum efficiency. Rehabilitation and judicious addition to existing 
ferry terminals might entail land acquisition for small ferry landings. 
 
An urban rail line is in principle, to be built within the existing 100-foot right-of-way (ROW) of the 
National Rail Corporation (NRC). Even if no additional land other than the existing ROW is required 
for the light rail initiative, involuntary resettlement will arise because the rail corridor is occupied both 
by structures ceded through a right of occupancy by the NRC and by traders and vendors who ply their 
trades in major urban markets along the rail line and even on the rails. The acquisition of land to widen 
the ROW between Ebute Metta and Iddo or to create commuter access from Iddo to Lagos Island 
would entail further resettlement. 
 
 
Therefore, the immediate category of displaced persons under LUTP as presently conceived comprises 
artisans (motor mechanics, tyre vulcanizers etc.) and street vendors who will be required to shift off 
the sidewalks in order to allow pedestrians foot traffic, which now must use the road as a walkway, 
and buses whose passenger pick-up spots and bus parks now use the major arteries and service roads.

LAMATA resettlement policy recognizes two categories of vendors: those with official permit to 
conduct their businesses in that place, and those without. Official permit connotes payment of market, 
vendor or other business fees, whether formal or informal, for the right to continue in that space. 
Those vendors with official sanction have, prima facie, an established and recognized right to occupy 
and use that space, and are eligible for resettlement assistance. Those without official permit, such as 
opportunistic encroachers who arrive expressly to claim project assistance, have no such recognized 
right under the law. Nonetheless, such occupants may have moral claims to their occupancy that will 
qualify them for compensatory measures of the same or different nature as those with sanctioned 
occupancy. 
 
According to LAMATA designs, there are some 200 major intersections along the planned 625 km. of 
declared road schedule for maintenance or rehabilitation over the next six years. Some 20 percent of 
the intersections are busy, and have, on average, a total of 50 sidewalk vendors at each intersection. 
These vendors are usually distributed evenly on the four or more corners of the intersection. Most 
junctions 
– approximately three-fifths of the major junctions – have moderate traffic flow, and attract 
20 to 30 vendors at the intersection. Another 20 percent of the junctions have relatively low traffic 
volumes, and attract only 5 to 10 vendors each. 
 
In addition, in market areas along the service roads to the expressway, there are often small bus parks 
and markets. In these places, the bus park typically extends onto the sidewalk, which forces 
pedestrians onto the service road, impeding traffic there. LAMATA Safeguards unit will coordinate 
with local authorities to improve local transport facilities and market areas in a manner that eliminates 
traffic hazards in these areas. 
 
B. Principles and objectives governing resettlement 
This Resettlement Policy document describes the principles and approach to be followed in 
minimizing and mitigating negative social and economic impacts caused by the project. The objectives 
of the Bank’s policy on the involuntary resettlement are the following: 
Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring all viable 
alternative project designs. 
Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be conceived and executed 
as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment resources to enable the persons 
displaced by the project to share in the project benefits. Displaced persons should be meaningfully 
consulted and should have opportunities to participate in planning and implementing resettlement 
programs. 
Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards or at 
least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to levels prevailing prior to the 
beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher. 
The policy provides the basis for a detailed and time-bound Resettlement Action Plan, which will be 
prepared for the project.  The full Action Plan will contain the details of census and baseline socio-
economic surveys of the potentially affected population undertaken in preparation of the project.  It 
will also contain the institutional and organizational mechanisms required to undertake the 
resettlement program. 
 
C.  Process for Preparing and Approving Resettlement Plans 
The Safeguards unit of Lamata is staffed with Environmental and Social Specialists whose job 
schedules among others is to develop and review environmental and social impact management plans,

166
 
and to contribute environmental and social perspectives to the development of general transport 
planning for metropolitan Lagos. 
 
Thereafter, the Safeguards unit will develop resettlement plans on the basis of the LUTP Resettlement 
Policy Framework and the Bank’s operational policies OP 4.12 on involuntary resettlement to guide 
the preparation of subsequent yearly work programs. The resettlement action plans (RAP) will be 
submitted to the World Bank for non-objection. The RAPs will serve as a guide to implementation, 
and may be revised as needed upon mutual agreement, with all revisions and their justifications 
recorded in the project files. 
 
 
D. Census and Socio-economic Surveys 
The census of people affected by the project is a key initial stage in the preparation of the RAP. The 
census serves five important and interrelated functions: 
 
enumerating and collecting basic information on the affected population; 
registering the affected population by residence or locality; 
establishing a list of legitimate beneficiaries before the project’s onset that counters spurious claims 
from those moving into the project area solely in anticipation of benefits; 
laying a framework for subsequent socio-economic research needed to establish fair compensation 
rates and to design, monitor; and evaluate sustainable income restoration or development 
interventions; and 
providing a baseline for monitoring and evaluation. 
 
Resettlement planners must give particular attention to vulnerable groups living in the project area. 
These groups may include households headed by women or children, people with disabilities, the 
extremely poor, the elderly, and groups that suffer social and economic discrimination. This 
information provides a number of baseline indicators, including mortality and fertility; children in 
school by age and sex; household size; incidence of disease; and key economic activities of household 
members. Data must be collected for all household members, including those who may not be resident 
at the time of the census.  
 
In summary, the census consolidates information that: 
· 
provides initial information on the scale of resettlement to be undertaken; 
· 
gives an indication of further socioeconomic research needed to quantify losses to be 
compensated and, if required, to design appropriate development interventions; and  
· 
establishes indicators that can be measured at a later date during monitoring and 
evaluation. 
 
 
Inventory of Affected Assets 
Lamata would undertake a detailed survey of all losses that will result for each household, enterprise, 
or community affected by the project. The survey should account for land acquisition and loss of 
physical assets as well as loss of income__either temporary or permanent__resulting from 
displacement of household members from employment or income-generating resources (for instance 
such as market women organizations, molue operators association, danfo operators associations etc.) 
 
The socioeconomic studies should be linked closely with the census and inventory of assets to provide 
comprehensive information on household economic resources, including common property resources.

167
 
The census and inventory of assets should have already identified the basic social unit of production or 
economic organization. Typically, this unit is the household, which functions as a single economic unit 
(a household may consist of a nuclear family, extended family or a unit including non-related 
members). 
 
Depending on the size of the affected population, it may be possible to conduct a socioeconomic 
survey of the entire population on a house-by household basis. Where the population exceeds a size 
suitable for an individual household survey, a survey of a sample of the population may suffice. 
However, resettlement planners must follow appropriate survey methodologies to ensure that a 
statistically valid representative sample of all strata of the affected population__including women and 
other vulnerable groups__is included in the survey. It is important for survey designers to recognize 
that a given community may not be homogenous. 
 
Analysis of Surveys and Studies 
Surveys and studies would be carried out on the basis of informed consultation with affected 
communities about realistic livelihood restoration and development strategies. 
 
Consultation with Affected People Concerning Assistance Benefits and Development Opportunities 
With the information provided by the surveys and studies, Lamata would engage in informed and 
constructive consultations with the affected community regarding the RAP strategy for livelihood 
restoration. A committee of community representatives can serve as a focal point for consultations on 
the types of assistance proposed by Lamata as well as for subsequent participation of the community 
in RAP implementation. Where host communities are affected by resettlement decisions, 
representatives of these communities should be included in these consultations. 
 
 
E. Eligibility Criteria 
Although LUTP requires little or no additional land, many petty vendors will be affected. Moreover, 
future initiatives such as the Pilot Bus franchising scheme and the light rail project may entail 
significant resettlement in congested commercial areas that encroach seriously upon the road network, 
as well as land acquisition and resettlement. 
 
The Bank’s OP 4.12 suggests the following three criterion for eligibility for compensation and 
rehabilitation in all Banks’ projects: 
 
if their land or income source will be removed due to land acquisition of the project; 
if their houses or residential plots will be demolished or partly damaged due to land acquisition; or 
if their other properties or access to those properties will be damaged due to land acquisition or 
construction of the project. 
 
Determining the cut-off dates 
As a matter of principle, and of practical necessity to avoid opportunistic encroachment, LAMATA 
will verify the occupancy status of each displaced person in each area under its supervision. To this 
end, LAMATA will conduct a census of all displaced persons at each site to determine the number of 
displaced and their occupancy status. The date of the census determines the cut-off date for eligibility: 
those persons customarily occupying the site on the day of census qualify for resettlement assistance if 
they have established occupancy rights formally or informally. LAMATA may, at its discretion, issue 
photo identification cards to displaced persons in order to certify their status in each subproject. Those

persons who arrive after the cut-off date established by the LAMATA census will be considered 
opportunistic encroachers, and will receive no resettlement assistance under LUTP. 
 
F. Legal Framework and Bank Policy 
The legal framework lays the foundation for three key elements of the Resettlement Action Plan 
(RAP). 
establishing rates of compensation; 
determining eligibity for compensation and resettlement assistance, including development initiatives 
aimed at improving the social and economic well-being of affected populations; 
establishing mechanisms to resolve grievances among affected populations related to compensation 
and eligibility. 
 
The legal framework for land acquisition and resettlement in Nigeria is the 
Land Use Act (LUA) of 
1978
. The relevant Bank policy (OP) 4.12 was adopted in 2001. The differences between the Land Use 
Act and the Bank’s OP4.12 mostly concern rehabilitation measures, which are neither proscribed nor 
mandated in the Act.  
 
In Nigeria, all land, whether urban or rural, belongs to the state, and is ceded to individuals through 
certificates of occupancy. 
Section 2 (1)(a)
 of the Land Use Act provides that “all land in urban areas 
shall be under the control and management of the Governor of each State” 
 
Section 2 (2)
 of the LUA provides that there shall be established in each state a body to be known as 
the ‘the Land Use and Allocation Committee’ which shall have responsibility for  
advising the Governor on any matter connected with the management of land… 
advising the Governor on any matter connected with the resettlement of persons affected by the 
revocation of rights of occupancy on the ground of overriding public interest…; and  
determining disputes as to the amount of compensation payable under this Act for improvements on 
the land
 
 
In addition, 
Sections 2-5
 provides that: 
There shall also be established for each Local Government a body to be known as ‘the Land 
Allocation Advisory Committee’ which shall consist of such persons as may be determined by the 
Governor acting after consultation with the Local Government and shall have responsibility for 
advising the Local Government on any matter connected with the management of land 
with respect to 
resettlement of persons affected by the revocation of occupancy rights. 
 
In another breath, land acquisition requires approval of the Governor. 
Section 28 (1)
 provides that 
it 
shall be lawful for the Governor to revoke a right of occupancy for overriding public interest.
 
 
When the state requires land for public purposes, 
the holder and the occupier shall be entitled to 
compensation for the value at the date of revocation of their unexhausted improvements
 (
Section 29 
(1).
 Compensation is paid for future rents paid, crops, and buildings and installations. In the latter 
instance, 
the amount of the replacement cost of the building, installation or improvement, that is to 
say, such cost as may be assessed on the basis of the prescribed method as determined by the 
appropriate officer less any depreciation, together with the interest at the bank rate for delayed 
payment of compensation…
 
Section 29 (4) (b)
 
 
Alternatively, 
where a right of occupancy in respect of any developed land on which residential 
building has been erected is revoked under this Act, the Governor or the Local Government, as the

case may be, may in his or its discretion offer in lieu of compensation payable in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act, resettlement in any other place or area by way of a reasonable alternative 
accommodation (if appropriate in the circumstances)
 
Section 33 (1).
 
 
Whereas the law relating to Land administration in Nigeria is wide and varied. Entitlements for 
payment of compensation are essentially based on right of ownership. The Bank OP 4.12 is 
fundamentally different from this and states that affected persons are entitled to some form of 
compensation whether or not they have legal title if they occupy the land by a cut-off date. 
 
Notwithstanding, as this is a bank-funded project and the principles of OP 4.12 are not negotiable, the 
Bank OP 4.12 must be adhered to. As a result, all land to be acquired by LAMATA for this project 
would be so acquired subject to the Land Use Act and the Bank OP 4.12. Where, there is conflict, the 
Bank OP 4. 12 must take precedence if the Bank is to fund this project. 
The displaced persons will choose alternative sites with the agreement of the concerned agency to 
bear, any costs for the selection of new sites and physical transfer. In addition, LAMATA will ensure 
that any required resettlement assistance stipulated in this policy framework will be provided to 
displaced persons, individually or collectively, as appropriate. 
 
Entitlement policies for each category of impact 
In some informal sectors it is not easy to determine exactly who is affected or what the long-term 
impacts are likely to be. Many markets and ‘squatter businesses’, such as roadside kiosks and small 
workshops, are not formally organized and have few, if any, records of ownership, tenancy, income, or 
length of occupancy.  
 
A related problem is that the benefits of compensatory and mitigative measures may not go to those 
most affected and in need, especially if alternative facilities are of a higher quality than those lost and 
these become attractive to other more influential groups in the community.    
 
The survey team would look for signs of recent invaders who may have moved into the area once it 
has become public knowledge that some assistance with improved conditions may be available. 
Relevant trade and professional associations such as market women organizations, 
molue
 operators 
association, 
danfo
 operators associations (as represented by the local branches of the National Union 
of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Road Transport Employers Association (RTEAN) and 
long-distance lorry/bus operators associations and other interested non-governmental agencies can 
frequently be enlisted to help prevent such invasions. 
 
In view of the complexity of the situation, LAMATA in its first year of operations developed an 
Expanded Resettlement Policy Framework (ERPF) in order to fully define the policy details; the ERPF 
will govern the work in the subsequent years.  The document will provide for compensation and 
rehabilitation for all displaced persons affected by LAMATA under the following conditions: 
 
if their land or income source will be removed due to land acquisition of the project (economic 
displacement); 
if their houses or residential plots will be demolished or partly damaged due to land acquisition 
(physical displacement); or 
if their other properties or access to those properties will be removed or damaged due to land 
acquisition or construction of the project .(economic and physical displacement)

A note of caution need to be sounded here, that lack of legal documents for customary rights of 
occupancy under the Land Use Act shall not be an obstacle for obtaining compensation or relocation 
assistance. In effect, all displaced persons, regardless of their legal status, will be rehabilitated based 
on the ERPF to be adopted by LAMATA 
  
G. Valuation procedures and resettlement measures  
The methodology to be used in valuing losses to determine their replacement cost; and a description of 
the proposed types and levels of compensation under local law and such supplementary measures as 
are necessary to achieve replacement cost for lost assets. 
In Nigeria, the Land Use Act establishes the general principle for the calculation of the value of assets 
to be taken when occupancy rights are revoked.  Compensation is paid for future rents paid, crops, and 
buildings and installations.  The appropriate officials refund rents already paid for use after revocation 
of the occupancy certificate. For structural improvements on the land, 
the amount of the replacement 
cost of the building, installation or improvement, that is to say, such cost as may be assessed on the 
basis of the prescribed method of assessment as determined by the appropriate officer less any 
depreciation, together with int
erest at the bank rate for delayed payment of compensation…
(Section 
29 4(b).
 
These principles are complemented by implementation regulations that provide detailed compensation 
rates determined by the State Government. Such rates are adjusted periodically by the State to reflect 
changing construction costs. 
In order to ensure that during the project implementation any person displaced by land acquisition will 
be provided full replacement cost of lost structures and are able to rebuild or replace their houses 
without difficulties. LAMATA will estimate building compensation rates based on full replacement 
cost without depreciation. LAMATA will also be responsible for providing (or arranging to provide) 
alternative residential plots to the displaced persons. Once individual project impacts are identified and 
valuation of individual structures are completed, detailed compensation rates for different structures 
will be included in the resettlement plan or abbreviated resettlement plan, and the plan will be 
submitted and reviewed for a no-objection by the World Bank prior to implementation of the 
subproject component. 
 
H. The Entitlement Matrix

I. Institutional Framework for implementation
  
The findings of an analysis of the institutional framework covering: 
1. 
The identification of agencies responsible for resettlement activities and NGOs that may 
have a role in project implementation; for LAMATA the relevant NGOs are local 
government council authorities, market women organizations, molue operators 
association, danfo operators association, okada operator association, taxi operators 
associations, and long-distance lorry/bus operators associations. 
2.  An assessment of the institutional capacity of such agencies and NGOs, and 
3.  Any steps that are proposed to enhance the institutional capacity of agencies and NGOs 
responsible for resettlement implementation.  
 
J. Community participation mechanisms 
Public consultation and participation are essential because they afford potential displaced persons the 
opportunity to contribute to both the design and implementation of the project activities and reduce 
possibility of conflict between LAMATA contractors and host communities. At what stage of the 
project is consultation necessary? 
Public consultation will take place at the inception of the planning stages of the resettlement action 
plan. The participation strategy would evolve around the provision of a full opportunity for 
involvement. This process would not be an isolated one because of the very nature of the project, 
which through its implementation and design ensures continuous public participation and involvement 
at the local level. Therefore, as a matter of strategy, public consultation would be an on-going activity 
taking place through out the project cycle. For example, public consultation would also occur during 
the preparation of RAPs in all LAMATA works components, i.e. Roads, Buses, Ferries and Rail in the 
manner briefly described below. 
Roads.
 LAMATA will, as a matter of course, convene meetings with the relevant local, state, and 
federal authorities on the technical design of improvements to be effected in the road network. In each

area, LAMATA will also convene local meetings with local government officials, road users, 
merchants, vendors, displaced persons and others. These meetings will be held in order to ascertain 
local perspectives on the proposed engineering design changes, to solicit local suggestions for 
improvements, and to obtain their support for the implementation of the changes, including any 
relocation of displaced persons. 
Those areas that are seriously encroached by marketers, sellers, and transporters, such as Iyana-Ipaja 
bus terminal, Agege and Oshodi, as well as the rail corridor, require a much more extensive 
consultative process if the vendors and transporters are to be expected to support the transformation of 
these market areas back to declared roads. LAMATA will design a consultative program in these areas 
that includes public announcement of the new transit authority and its prospective program, a census 
of the number and type of vendors and transporters in each area, and a series of consultative meetings, 
such as focus group discussions, with each group of vendors and of transporters, in order to ascertain 
their concerns in their local areas, their suggestions for actions to address their concerns, and, 
ultimately, their contribution to a resettlement plan to transform this areas in a mutually beneficial and 
satisfactory manner. The social section of the LAMATA Safeguards unit will define this process and 
undertake these consultations. 
Buses
  
While buses per se should not cause land acquisition
 
and resettlement
, 
experience has shown that 
motor parks and road set backs where buses line up and take their turns to pick passengers now 
constitute resettlement issue. The community consultations on roads will provide additional 
information on local concern about routes and frequency, as well as community impact. 
Ferries 
Various federal and state agencies have in decades past built ferry landings that today lie mostly 
unused. LAMATA must consult with the agencies that own the landings in order to facilitate their use 
by private-sector companies. LAMATA will also consult with small-ferry operators on their interest in 
developing further ferry transport. And, LAMATA will consult with local communities on the 
redesign, positioning, and use of existing ferry landings in their areas. Where land must be acquired 
for a new landing, LAMATA will consult with the local population on potential sites for the landing in 
order to minimize any resettlement and optimize local use of the facility. 
Rail 
The proposed urban mass rail transit system will be studied and designed during LUTP. LAMATA 
will use the same consultative approach of local participation that will be followed in the congested 
market areas of the road network for the conduct of these studies. 
 
K. A description of the implementation process, linking Resettlement   implementation to civil 
works. 
Before any project is implemented, PAPs will need to be compensated in accordance with the 
resettlement policy framework and subsequent RAP. For activities involving land acquisition or loss, 
denial or restriction to access, it is required that these measures include provision of resettlement of 
sites with adequate facilities, where required. In particular, the taking of land and related assets may 
take place only after compensation has been paid and, where applicable, resettlement sites and moving 
allowances have been provided to displaced persons. For project activities requiring relocation or loss 
of shelter, the policy further requires that measures to assist the displaced persons are implemented in 
accordance with the individual resettlement plan of action.  
The measures to ensure compliance with this policy directive would be included in the resettlement 
plans that would be prepared for each land involving resettlement or compensation. When LAMATA 
present their resettlement plans for approval, part of the screening process would verify that the 
resettlement plans contain acceptable measures that link resettlement activity to civil works in

compliance with this policy. The timing mechanism of these measures would ensure that no individual 
or affected household would be displaced due to civil works activity before compensation is paid and 
resettlement sites with adequate facilities are prepared and provided for to the individual or household 
affected. Once the local and national authorities approve the resettlement plan, the resettlement plan 
should be sent to the World Bank for final review and approval. 
 
 
L. Grievance Redress Mechanisms 
LAMATA will undertake a highly consultative process for transport rehabilitation that should provide 
ample opportunity to redress complaints informally, in addition to the existing formal administrative 
and legal procedures. 
 
The Land Use Act provides two formal mechanisms for grievance redress, one administrative and one 
legal.  In the first instance, a displaced person with an occupancy certificate may lodge a complaint 
over valuation with the Department of Land Services.  The interested party may even engage an 
independent Valuer to appraise his or her property, and present the independent valuation as part of the 
dossier submitted for administrative departmental review.  If the individual remains dissatisfied with 
the administrative review, he or she has legal recourse to the courts as a last option for resolution of 
the matter.  
 
LAMATA recognizes that formal legal mechanisms for grievance redress tend to be lengthy and 
acrimonious procedures, and will establish an informal grievance redress mechanism through its 
Safeguard Unit.  The social section of the Safeguard Unit will be charged with coordinating with local 
government and community groups, as well as with informal committees of market vendors and 
transporters, to determine the design and the implementation timetable of subprojects. Such local 
coordination and consultation serves various purposes.  In the first instance, it helps inform the 
community of possible improvements in the transport network in their local area.  These consultations 
also provide a forum to ascertain general opinions about the initiatives and to solicit both local 
concerns and their suggestions for alternative solutions, including how to avoid or reduce to a 
minimum all displacement.  In the instance of vendors and transporters, such consultations help enlist 
their collaboration and cooperation, and contribute importantly to subproject planning and 
implementation. 
 
Third, where displacement is unavoidable and displaced people are dissatisfied with the compensation 
and rehabilitation, LAMATA will establish an informal forum for the presentation and consideration 
of individual complaints.  The informal forum will include local government, the transport agency, and 
other concerned responsible parties, as deemed appropriate by LAMATA.  The existence, location, 
purpose and composition of this forum will be publicized, so that displaced persons are knowledgeable 
about the availability of this forum for resolving any grievance.  If a grievance cannot be resolved in 
these informal venues, the complainant may take recourse to the administrative and legal systems for 
satisfaction.

ONITORING ARRANGEMENTS
 
 
The social section of the LAMATA Safeguard Unit will perform periodic monitoring of all 
resettlement activities in the Agency's portfolio. LAMATA will consult and coordinate with the 
appropriate Federal and State agencies (e.g., FME, LASEPA) on social and environmental monitoring.

For those areas with minor resettlement, defined here as relocation of marketers and sidewalk sellers, 
as well as transport operators, to nearby locations without land acquisition, the LAMATA social 
section will report at least quarterly on the: 
Implementation schedule 
Extent of community involvement  
Delivery and usage of any resettlement compensation 
Relocation of marketers and transporters, and their pre- and post-move sales 
Efficiency of resettlement agencies in fulfilling their obligations. 
 
For those areas where a resettlement plan or an abbreviated resettlement plan is required because of 
land acquisition or significant numbers of displaced persons, LAMATA, through its social section in 
the Safeguards Unit, will provide a quarterly progress report on resettlement activities.  The report 
will provide detailed explanation of resettlement progress, fund allocation, and issues and problems 
arising, as well as solutions devised, during implementation.  In addition, the report will present in 
tabular format comparisons on: the estimated and actual extent of compensation delivered, the 
number of structures demolished; the number of new homes, shops, market stalls and other required 
structures built; and all other matters deemed pertinent for facilitating resettlement and project 
progress. 
 
For major resettlement, LAMATA will engage an independent firm or organization to conduct 
periodic external assessments of resettlement progress.  LAMATA will develop a detailed monitoring 
work plan for the terms of reference, based on the resettlement plan submitted to and approved by the 
World Bank.  LAMATA will select an organization or firm that has extensive experience in social 
survey and resettlement monitoring for this work.  LAMATA will review and approve the 
questionnaires and inventory forms developed by the contractor, as well as the research methods, 
analytic techniques, and reporting formats proposed by the contractor.  The aim of this independent 
monitoring is to provide verification of key concerns in resettlement, such as compliance with 
resettlement policies, implementation progress, the extent of effective consultation and participation of 
local populations, and the direction and extent of changes of income and livelihood among displaced 
persons.  Careful attention to monitoring matters such as these will help ensure that rehabilitation of 
the Lagos urban transport system equitably benefits everyone--displaced persons, and traders and 
transporters, as well as private-sector agencies, motorists, and bus and rail passengers.
