objectives will be achieved by the end of the project. Most of the targets set for the project have
been met or exceeded.

3.     The extension of Credit Closing Date of the project will allow the project to utilize the

              May 21, 2010 and the design is expected to be completed by November 30, 2010.

revised closing date of June 30, 2009. The Borrower then requested an extension of the project
from June 30, 2009 to August 31, 2010 in order to complete the implementation of ongoing
activities.

5.     The team confirms that the requirements of OP/BP 13.30 relating to the extension of
closing dates have been met. The project objectives continue to be achievable and the
performance of the borrower and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory. The
