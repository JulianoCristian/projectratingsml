Introducing effective competition and independent\n            regulatory bodies working with consumers associations is\n            necessary to allay these fear. A public-private partnership\n            information center or network will facilitate information\n            dissemination. It was clear from the project that\n            sub-projects with an enthusiastic and influential supporter\n            within the government were much more likely to proceed to\n            the physical implementation of infrastructure development.\n            These champions can help to overcome government and public\n            resistance to private sector participation (PSP) policy.\n            There is a need to strengthen and deepen financial markets.\n            Continued support for development of the PSP framework is\n            needed. Demonstration projects are essential."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
