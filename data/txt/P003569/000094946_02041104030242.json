project objectives were substantially met and\n            achievement of the project objectives was assessed as\n            satisfactory. It is likely that the benefits generated and\n            those expected to be generated are sustainable over the life\n            of the project. Overall World Bank and Borrower performances\n            were rated satisfactory. Lessons learned included the\n            following: The successful outcome was due to the stable\n            partnership in the transport sector between Bank staff and\n            the Borrower. The project team was well committed and\n            proactive in dealing with all implementation issues. The\n            Bank uses its procurement policy is an important instrument\n            The Bank was forced to declare a misprocurement for the\n            first phase of the Road Safety Program and cancel that part\n            of the loan. The ensuing dialogue between the Bank and its\n            development partners demonstrated the Bank's concerns\n            about quality, and these concerns appear to have been well\n            received. The factors affecting traffic flow patterns must\n            be determined by a thorough study of the experience of the\n            completed expressways. The results of such a study would\n            provide strong basis for predicting traffic diversion rates.\n            Such a study would be critical to improve the assessments of\n            the economic and financial viability of new projects at\n            appraisal. Establishing the Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd. to\n            mobilize private capital through asset securitization was innovative."}, "docdt": "2002-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
