Shanshai-langzhou Expressway Project (Zhejiang Section)
Executive Suzmary of Environment Impact Assessment
In Nay 1990. the State Environment Protection Bureau Authorized
Zhejiang  Provincial  Research Institute   of  Environment  Protection
(ZPRIEP) to perform EXA for the whole alignment of the project in
accordance with the TOR of EIA for Zheiiang Section (Bangzhou-
Fensjing) of Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway project.
ZPRIEP has made detail site surveying of background conditions and
forecasting to three alternative alignments of the expressway over a
length of about 103 km between Hangzhou and Fengjing from view point
of environment protection combined with engineering and economic
regards and put forward the opinion that the selected alignment has
the least adverse impacts on land occupation, populated towns and
villages, background water quality and cultural/historic heritases,
and submitted the " Environment Impact Statement for Zhejiang Section
(Iangzhou-Fengjing) of Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway ProJect m in
February. 1991. According to the " Environment Protection Law of PRC n
and the " Measures of Environment Protection Management of Transport
Construction Projects ', and the like environment regulations, ZPRIEP
has Conducted following activities:
1) To study the present environmental conditions along the proposed
expressway and the environmentaI impact of vehicle volume of existing
roads.
2)   To  identify the distribution features of human landscapes  and
historic antiquities, as well as probable influences on these by the
new expressway to be built.
3) To forecast the environmental impacts in the construction phase
of the expressway.
4) To forecast the ranse of the pollutants and the concentrations
in case of maximum traffic during the operation of the expressway.
5) To forecast adverse environmental impact of accident emission
of pollutant sources.
A. Outline of the Environmental Conditions
1. Geographic Condition:
The  alignment of Sbanshai-hangzhou Expressway is located  in   the
fangzhou-Jiaxing-Ruzhou   river  network plain in the  north  bank  of
Qiantansjians River which is the southern end of the Changjiang delta,
featured by flat terrain, networked rivers and numerous lakes to
assume  miro-seomorphic  landforus.  The  expressway  passes   throush
Nangzhou-Jinxing-Iuzhou from south west to north east with Many  paddy
fields and mulberry hills alons the alignment, descending at this way
with an heisht of about 6-7u.
1



2. Hydrolosical and meteorological Conditions
The region of the ROW belongs to subtropical monsoon climate zone,
having moist temperature, demarcated season and abundant rainfall with
the average atmospheric temperature per year of about 16-17 c, the
average   humidity   per  year  of  about  80-822  and   the   average
precipitation per year of about 1000-1200 e, experiencing plum rains
in spring and summer, and occasional typhoon strikes in autumn and
summer. The surface run-off are conversed to river network through
criss-cross channel and empties into Qia.tangjing River and Hangzhou
Bay by way of Huangpu River water system and four mainstreams for
draining flooded fields.
The water system in this region constitutes a water transport
network and formulates various channels capable of carrying
ships from 10 to 100 ton capacity.
3. Population
The resion of the ROW, includins Yuhang county(Linsping), Raining
city (Chansan and Xiashi). Tonsxians city. Jiaxins city and Jiashan
county  (Weitons).  has  a  population  of  3.65  million  along   the
alignment, passing throush 24 townships and 84 villages with a averase
population density of 600-900 persons per sq.km and up to 4000-15000
persons per sq.kn in towns of which Xiashi is the nost concentrated
one crowded with 55000 persons in 3.5 sq.km.
4. kgriculture
The region has always enjoyed the reputation of being a ' Land of
Rice and Fish and Home of Silk " with a high land utilization ratio.
The six counties and cities along the alignment have paddy fields of
196.47 sq.km mixed up with mulberry fields and tea plantations.
producing rice of 2.2958 million ton per year accounting for 15
percent of the total output of the province and silkworm cocoons of
1.32 million dan accounting for 30.5 percent of the province.
5. Transportation
Nowadays the hishway traffic from Hangzhou to Shanghai is carried by
National   Road   320   (Rangzhou-Fensjios   highway).   After   being
reconstructed and widened in 1989. the highway tends to saturation
operation with a daily mixed traffic volume of 14083 in 1990 and the
increasing of the traffic volume is very fast. Nearby the starting
section of the expressway, there are Qiaosi marshaling station and
Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway. the expressway and the railway will be
parallel to each other to trend towards the east. The railway operates
overload, the road appears quite congest and the capability is far
from adapting the transport requirement, leading the traffic often
janmed under a low level service and accidents mfrequently occurred".
these constitute the main reason to construct the expressway.
2



6. Historic/Cultural Heritages
Hangzhou and Jiaxing are two main cities along the alignment. Fos
and Rain Pavilion at South Lake has been ranked as national key
protected cultural relics. Hangzhou, as a tourist center. is well
known at home and abroad. The construction of the expressway will
create better conditions for developing the tourist business and
carrying forward historic/cultural heritases.
B. Environmental Quality
1. Noise
Along the alisnment, there are 84 relatively populated villases, but
the scattered density of houses is not hish. Villases located on the
both sides of the alignment are mostly long and narrow in shape and
less buildinss are affected by noise. After monitoring the selected
representative spots such as villages. schools, road crossings and
wilder fields. the average noise levels are 43-51.2 dB(A) in day time
and 32.2-37.6 dB(A) in night; the noise background value in where
close to railways and highways is somewhat increased. Using monitoring
data of Yufeng village of Pensbu town in the east suburban of Hangzhou
as a representative, the average noise level is 48 dB(A) in day tine
and 34 dBCA) in night, the existing noise quality is generally good.
2. Air Quality
In the selected typical resident areas, wilder fields, existing road
crossinss and the areas mixed by residence, commerce and transport
oct. along the proposed expressway, CO. NOx. S02. TSP and T1C have
been monitored and analyzed according to the specifications. The EIS
based on the monitorins indicated that the comprehensive quality
indexes of sample points are within the extent of 0.33-1.10, of which,
six points are clean, five points are in normal condition and one
point is generally polluted. Referred to the air quality along the
whole alisnment, among the pollutants, the THC bas the lowest
concentration and the CO, NOx and TSP come next. The alignment of the
expressway avoids bis cities and towns and passes through the wilder
agricultural regions, so the air quality is relatively good and could
maintain the class I or II state standard.
3. Water Quality
By sampling and analyzing the water body of uajor rivers and
cultivation ponds for aquatic products along the alignment, it is
confirmed that the reason for the water body being polluted is mainly
caused by the orsanic pollutant factors from fairly little rivers and
cultivation  ponds and the run-off from agricultural  fields.  leading
3



CODnn to exceed the water quality standard and one or two BOD5 and COD
to exceed the standard. The value of Pb, SS and Dil in the water body
near the existing roads is far higher than the monitoring value of
that near the proposed expressway. For an example. the value of Pb in
the cultivation pond at Rlanzhusha is 0.009 m9/I, of SS is 249 mg/i and
of Oil is 0.35 mg/I. So, the water quality conditions basically meet
the standard of cateSory IV.
C. Environment Impact Evaluation
1. In environmental impact evaluation, the environmental issues in the
implementation phase of the expressway project are divided into 3
catesories i.e. air quality chansins, noise impact and water quality
impact. These categories of environmental issues are further divided
into  transient impact in construction phase and environmental  issues
in   operation  phase,  these  potential  environsental   issues   are
summarized as follows:
Item                                       Predicted impact degree
1) Resettlement                         Land to be acquired for the  ROW
totaled 208 ha saking up 3.6S of
total   paddy   fields   in   this
region. Although the per capita
area of cultivated land in this
resion is 839 sq.n hisher than
that   in  other  resion  in   the
province. the decreasing of it
will impact agricultural economy
and  it  is  evaluated  that   the
annual   agricultural   production
wil lose by 8260 ton.
2)  Soil Erosion                        In  construction period  of  the
project,   earth    cutting    and
filling.  abandonins soil  and the
construction    of      subsrade,
bridges   and   culverts  will  be
liable to cause erosion of soil
and  loss  of   water,   the  soil
erosion   in  the   cutting   and
filling sections is 695 kg/sq.z
per year.
3)   Visual  Impact                        The  greater  part   of   the
expressway  passes  through   flat
regions, being 3-4 a above ground
level to swell the smooth earth's
surface as a hillock not only to
4



hamper person walking but also to
impair visual field.
4)  Social Activities                   Some section of the  expressway
and Historic Relics                cut through villases,  influencins
liaison between villages and the
convenience of farmer's production
and   life .      Nowadays ,  the
construction   location   of   the
expressway don't impact on'history
antiquities, but new antiquities
will be probably discovered during
the construction period, so, in
the   places  identified  by   the
antiquity     department      after
investigating, the cutting should
be done with cautions in order to
reduce the damage to antiquities
to be discovered.
5)  Flooding Drainase                   There are waterlossed  land  of
20   sq.ku  and  the   irrigation
department has desisned four main
canals used for drainins flooding
and waterlogging into Qiantangjing
River     and    Hanszhou      Bay.
Waterlogging and flooding may be
occurred in local region if the
bridges   and  culverts  are   not
desisned     to    satisfy      the
requirement for flooding drainage
or if the layouts of road drainase
are improper.
6)  Environment and                     Noise from construction  plant,
Construction   Related            material   loss   from   transport
Impacts                      vehicles    and    spillage      of
construction   materials,    fumes
generated  by asphalt beating  and
mixing and pollutant emoision-'and
flyins   dust  from   construction
plants.
7) Environment and                     Noise from vehicles (ensine  and
Operation Related                   type); Air pollution resulted from
Impact                          vehicle     exhaust      emissions.
includins Pb. NOs, CO and S02;
Uncontrolled discharse of fuel and
waste oil resulted from improper
manasement of petrol station and
vehicle accidents, water quality
change   of  nearby   water   body
resulted from the surface run-off.
5



2. Construction Impact
The  EA  indicated  that  the  essential  environmental  impact   in
construction phase is dust from vehicle and storase, noise mobilized
by construction equipments and fumes generated by asphalt mixing plant
and heating process harmful to health. The EA has proposed detail
precausions to the temporary environmental impacts.
By contrasting the in-site surveying data with the standard data, it
is indicated that the construction noise would not exceed the standard
during construction period of subgrade works and could meet the limit
of the equivalent noise standard in construction site, but the
construction activities in nisht or the construction of driving piles
will interference the quite of residential areas.
3. Operation Impacts
The EA focusly forecasted the environmental impacts in noise air and
water quality chanses occurred in operation phase of the expressway.
Because this is not temporary, to pay attention to these impacts is
just the measure to be taken for enviroment protection in order to
protect and improve the ecological environment.
Noise pollution mainly comes from driving system of vehicles and
tires moving on the road and will give ispacts to resident's life and
production on both sides of the expressway, especially to schools,
this has been forecasted in EIS and some protective mitigation
measures also have been proposed in EAP for reducing the same to an
acceptable level.
In EIS, air pollution impacts are believed that the ranse of
exceeding the standard of communication mainlines is minimal, not
influencing on silkworm business along the alignment. The standard
exceeding ranse of the NOx factor in Pengbu-Chansan section will
increase in certain degree in adverse meteorological conditions. When
the vehicle volume decreased in the night, this phenomenon will not
appear; the lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions referred to
in EIS is a pollution that can not be neslected. to which certain
concerns should be given and some precautions should be taken.
The EIS indicated that the moving vehicle has little impact to the
nearly water bodies. but more attention should be paid to the water
pollution  caused  by  surface  run-off  near  the  road.  for   which
controlling the water pollution near the road caused from petrol
stations, machine repairins factories and fuel storages along the
route is essential.

1. INTRODUCTION
Shanghai-Hangzhou region is located on the Yangtse delta, with dense
population and highly economic development. In recent years, accompanied
by rapid industrial and agricultural growtli, transportation on land and
water way is seriously overloaded, poor traffic condition has become a
obstruction to the regional development, construction of new traffic
facilities is in great need. To solve this problem, the Planning Economic
Commission of Shanghai Municipality has submitted an applicatiorn report of
"Project Proposal on Construction of Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway,
Shanghai Section" to the Planning Commission of the State Council, in Nov.
1989, and "Additional Report of Project Proposal on Construction of
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway" in July 1992. In October 1992, the Ministry
of Transportation of the State Council submitted the review document of the
project to the Planning Committee of the State Council, to approve this
project.
In 1992 and 1993, the Planning Commission and Ministry of Finance has
replied and approved the construction of the project.
The length of Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway is 131km, among which 48km
is in Shanghai region, and 20.5km (from Xinzhuang to Songjiang section)
has been constructed, another 27km (Songjiang to Fengjing) to be built will
be as the study area of this EIA report.
Shanghai-Hangzhou expressway is one of the 12 national main expressways.
It is started from Shanghai, going through Songjiang, Jinshan (both in
Shanghai region), Jiashan, Jiaxing, Tongxiang, and Yuhang to Hangzhou, and
will be further extended to Jiangxi province, and terminated to Wanting,
Yunnan Province-the western boundary of China. The route of Shanghai-
Hangzhou-Ningbo expressway and Shanghai-Nanjiang expressway will
connect with most of the important cities on Yangtse Delta together by
means of modernizing traffic facilities, greatly stimulate the economic
development in Shanghai municipality, and drive rapid economic growth in
the vast inland region.
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Three route-the east, west and central route have been studied as route
selection. The central route possesses a smooth line, will be of benefit to
more cities, easy to construction, higher in ground surface level, better in
geological condition, and thus to be selected as the proposed route.
1



The expressway was designed as four lanes (predesigned six lane) in both
directions full access controlled expressway. The width of road shoulder is
33.5m, the width of the right-of-the-way is 55m. The road surface is 4m
above the ground level. The designed traffic speed is 120 km/hr, the
designed target year is 2018. The designed traffic volume in the year of
2000 is 32,276 vehicles/day (PCU), 78,909 vehcles/day (PCU) in the year of
2018.
The vicinity area along the Shanghai section is dense in population and
flourishing in economic development, and is in a dense water network
region. Titere are 32 bridges, 2 interchanges, 16 times crossing the local
roads, one time crossing the railway, 6 times crossing farm road, and
adding passing for pedestrians, tractors and vehicles with arches of bridge
and 38 culverts will be constructed. The total earth work of roadbed is
3,230,000 Ma3, 2,548 Mu of land requisition, and 31,880 M^2 of building will
be demolished. The total cost will be 2.2 billion RMB (63 million US$). It is
scheduled to be constructed in the end of 1994, and ended in 1998.
The expressway of Shanghai section will enter into Zhejiang Province at
Fengjing, Jinshan county of Shanghai city, connect with the expressway of
Zhejiang portion, and cross with the Shanghai suburban traffic network in
Dagang. The expressway will also connect with the Shanghai Inner-ring
Route and enter into the municipal area.
3. ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARD
3.1 Noise Standard
Noise from construction should be in compliance with "Noise Limit of

3.2 Air Quality Standard
The background air quality is rather good ale-ng the Shanghai-Hangzhou
expressway. Because this express way avoid county and town centers and
across through wide countryside, so only minor impact by air pollution
exists.
Air quality within lOOm along the highway should in compliance with 'Air
Quality Standard" 3rd class standard, outside lOOm the 2nd class standard
should be implemented.

and a small part at Jinshan county, on the lower land of Taihu Basin, the
ground surface is 1.5-Z.Om above the sea level, and is easy to attack by
flooding. The soil along the expressway is majorly as bule-violet mud or
blue-yellow mud, the soil is wet and heavy, and poor in loading capacity.
The intensity of earthquake i6 grade 6, and will be taken as grade 7 in
engineering design.
The expressway, Shanghai section is passing through the water network of
the upper reach of Huangpu River, part of the water way qualified as
water resource preservation zone of Huangpu River. The water level in
these rivers is influenced by tide, the highest water level is 3.87m, the
lowest water level is 0.56m, the average water level is 2.4m. Most of water
ways,  including   Xietang,  Dazhenggang,  Shenjingtang,  Youdungang,
Guputang, Xiangtanggang, Xinzhoutang etc, are important navigation
courses. The ground water level is 0.3-1.Om.

4.2 Existing Environmental Quality
According to survey of main water ways along the proposed expressway in
January 9,1993, water quality in study area are poor, qualified as grade 3-
4 of national water quality standard, few parameter up to grade 5. (grade
2-3 is qualified as water resource of drinking, grade 4-5 is polluted or
heavily polluted). Organic substances are the major pollutants, such as
BOD5, COD, NH3-N and oil etc. Toxic contamination is in low level, qualified
as grade 1-2 (shown in Table 4-2).

According to the survey of existing sound environment in January, 1993,
sound environment is also good, noise level in day time is 47-55 dB(A), and
42-47 dB(A) in night time, qualified to Class A mixed zone noise standard,
except higher noise level near the railway and traffic line.
4.3 Ecological Environment
Ecological environment of study area is majorly as artificial agricultural
ecological system. Major crops is rice, wheat, cotton, oil seed, vegetable,
and , fruit, etc, The study area is also flourishing in animal husbandry,
such as raise of swine poultry etc.
5. ENVERONMENTAL PREDICTION
5.1 Impact on Socio-economic Development and Quality of Life
5.1.1 Promoting Local Socio-economic Development
The construction of Shanghai-Hangzhou expressway will be greatly
convenienced  to the vicinity road  side with Shanghai or Hangzhou, even
with anl the country in terms of traffic, speed up the communication of
8



substance and information, further promote local economic development, and
raise the li-ving standard of local people. Thus it will be benefit to all the
people along the expressway.
5.1.2 Impact on Land Use Pattern and Population Distribution
The  socio-economic  development along  the  road  corridor will greatly
influence the local land use pattern and population distribution. It is
predicted that soon after the expressway open to traffic, an economic
development belt will be formed along the road side, land use pattern will
be changed from farm land to industrial estate. More population will be
migrated to this area, a belt shape area will be gradually formed.
5.1.3 Loss of Farmland
The permanent land requisition of expressway construction will be 2,548 Mu,
which may be the biggest farmland loss in a area of land shortage. Traffic
construction land requisition has been occupied about 20X of total land
area. Thus land requisition along the expressway alignment wiLl cause
significant impact on the local economic pattern.
5.1.4 Resettlement of Local People
Approximately 2,000 people will lose their farm land, most of them will
change life style from farmers to urban inhabitants, but resettlement may
not be required. 31,880 M-2 of house will be demolished by expressway
construction, or about 600 people should be resettled, most of them will be
resettled to township, these people will leave their homeland forever, and
leave the land they have lived for generations permanently. The changes of
life style for these people is another major impact on the local people.
5.1.5 Soil Contamination During Expressway Construction
What is more important is temporary obstruction to existing traffic in land
or water way, due to the fact that this expressway will cross roads,
railways, farm road, and pedestrian lanes, totalled 29 times, cross through a
variety of rivers, totalled 61 times. If unappropriate protection, serious loss
of water and erosion of soil will be caused. 323 Mu farmland will be
temporary borrowed as construction site, during construction stage, these
land may be contaminated by leaking, spilling, or spreading, such as
cement, gravel, oil, and other construction garbage on the soil, causing
unable to be cultivated and further loss of farmland resource.
9



5.1.6 Other Environmental Impacts
A.   After the expressway construction, many existing farmland will be
segmented into small parts, caused inconvenient for farming. Some of the
existing communities will also be separated, causing difficult for people to
visit with their relatives or friends, or pupils and workers who are lived in
this side of expressway and needed to go to the other side for school, go
to farming or go to work. People should spend a long way round going
through the underpass to the other side, causing a lot of inconvenient
work or daily life. In the area where the expressway crossing the railway,
two narrow closed areas will be formed, in that area both sides are
obstructed either by railway or expressway. It is even more difficult for
people in external communication, field drainage and irrigation and
arrangement of daily life.
B.   The expressway will cross 232 field ditches and 26 fish ponds. This
construction will cause adverse impact on local irrigation system and
fishery production.
C.   There are none important historical relics or habitation ror rare or
endanger species extinction along the  road  side. There will be less
significant impact on these field.
5.2 Impact on Atmospheric Environment
5.2.1 Construction Stage
There are a lot of earth work excavated and filled again during the
construction. A lot of material and equipment need to be transported.
stored, and used. To transport this equipment and earth work will cause
air pollution.
5.2.2 Highway Operation Stage
The EIA report has predicted atmospheric environmental impact during
different years, different traffic volume, different intervals (daytime, rush
hour and night) and different climate conditions.
CO: During all predicted year, all intervals and all kinds of climate
conditions, CO which emitted from exhaust gas of vehicles will not exceed
the Class II national ambient air quality standard in down wind of variety
of wind direction.
HC: In the same condition as above, HC will not exceed the late USSR

5.3 Noise Impact Prediction
5.3.1 Construction Stage
Local noise pollution will be caused by transporting material and operating
equipment in the construction.

5.4 Ground Surface Vibration Prediction
5.4.1 In all prediction year in day or night time, ground surface vibration
caused by traffic flow will not exceed standard.
5.4.2 In rush hour in the year of 2018, the area exceeded vibration
standard will be within 5m from the line of the right-of-way.
6. MITIGATING MEASURES
6.1 Mitigating Measures of Rational Route Selection During Design and
Planning Stage
Thorough study has been done in route selection and road structure
during project planning and design stage, in order to achieve the maximum
socio-economic benefit and minimum environmental impact. The proposed
central route in general meet the requirement. It will be a great help, to
reduce  adverse  environmental  impact and  easier  to  solve  environmental
protection matters.
6.2 Protection of Land Resource
Comparatively, land resource  is shortage  in this area due  to lower ground
12



level and dense population, for about 40 years, average farm land per
farmer has been reduced from 2.3 Mu in 1949 to 1.04 now, expressway
construction will require large amount of precious farmland, strong
mitigation measure should be made in protecting the farmland.
6.2.1 Minimum Temporary Land Requisition During Road Construction
During  expressway  construction,  borrowed  farmland  temporarily  as
construction site should keep a minimum level and avoid to borrow too
much fertile farmland and too scattered, protection the soil not to be
contaminated by  construction  materials or construction  garbage. After
completion of the construction, garbage in borrowed land should be
appropriately cleaned, and returned only if meeting the requirement of
cultivation. In cases when can not return borrowed land on schedule, or if
soil contamination has been occurred, compensation should be paid in
accordance with the degree of soil contamination.
6.2.2 Utilizing Coal Ash as Roadbed Felling Material
Coal ash should be greatly developed to use as roadbed filling
material.According to calculating, using 800 tons of coal ash can save one
mu of farmland. A lot of benefit were existed when using coal ash instead
of soil, such as: light in dead weight of roadbed, Little settlement in
roadbed easier to be constructed during rainy days, etc. In the utilization
of coal ash, Shanghai has achieved abundant experience. The only
disadvantage of using coal ash is the cost, which is 3-10 RMB higher than
that of using soil per cubic meter as roadbed consturction material. or
corresponding to 2,000-8,000 RMB the additional benefit of selling soil than
using coal ash Mu of farmland, the additional benefit is too few In
comparison with the permanent loss of farmland. The cost problem of coal
ash can be solved or partial solved by means of adjusting price policy,
special compensation from cost of coal ash landfall, improviLng transportation
facilities. About 4 million tons of coal ash will be produced annually, among
most of coal ash has not been utilized, and huge amount of land and capital
are required for storage the waste. The fees as transport, build storage,
occupied land are completely used to compensate the construction of
expressway. Thus the cost of coal ash can be further, reduced. The report
strongly recommended the use of coal ash as roadbed filling material, so as
to reduce the damage of farmland.
6.2.3 Rational Utilization of Damaged Farmland as Fish Ponds
Planning should be made when ponds are formed due to soil excavation tihe
13



soil excavation site, depth and extent of excavation, and shape of pond
after excavation should be studied, so as to reduce the loss of fertilized
land, and to make the pond easier to be constructed as fish ponds, speed
up the period of land use transformation, reduce the cost of secondary
input, and increase the land use benefit.
6.3 Appropriate Arrangement of Resettlement
627 farmers are needed to be resettled, and more people will be lost their
lands, their life styles are needed to be changed. To these people,
appropriate arrangement is necessary, adequate compensation should be
made to cover their properties loss, appropriate arrangement should be
made in their re-employment, instruction and professional training are
required for their re-employment, so as not to reduce their quality of life
after the resettlement.
6.4 Appropriate Solution of Disturbance of Road and Waterway Traffic
The expressway construction will cross numerous rivers and roads, and
many bridges are needed to be constructed. During bridge construction,
fully attention should be paid in satisfying navigation of traffic
requirement. The construction cycle should be speed up, so as to reduce
the obstacle of traffic to minimum. There is a culvert for vehicles and
pedestrians every  SOOm  in  average. That is to  fully  consider for
pedestrians and vehicles to cross the expressway in two sides.
6.5 Appropriate Solution to impact on Irrigation System
About 200 local irrigation ditches will be, cut by expressway construction,
causing impact on irrigation to a certain extent. New arrangement is needed
to local irrigation and drainage system, and appropriate compensation
should be considered.
6.6 Prevention of loss of water and soil Erosion
The expressway is located in a area with plenty of rain. Serious loss of
water and soil erosion will be occurred when appropriate prevention
measures are not to be taken. Soil erosion will decrease the efficiency of
construction activities, increase the engineering cost, block water way,
result in the degradation of water quality, and thus influence on aquatic
ecology and fishery production by siltation. So, serious attention should be
paid to prevent this problem and possess appropriate arrangement during
14



design, construction and operation stage.
6.7 Re-arrangement of Land Use and Crops Production
In view of air pollution and noise problem caused by expressway traffic, it
is suggested that within 100m along the expressway, no hospitals, schools,
communities and other environmental sensitive target could be constructed.
6.8 Prevention of Air Pollution and Noise
This problem majorly relies on improvement of character of vehicles, and
un-engineering management measures.
6.9 Traffic Accident Prevention During Unfavourable Climate
Forecasting and stipulation should be established for preventing traffic
accident during unfavourable climate, such as Typhoon, thunderstorm,
flooding,fog, snow, or road surface frost. The expressway should be closed
to traffic if necessary, so as to ensure traffic safety.
6.10 Prevention of Toxic Chemical Spilling Incident
In order to reduce hazardous and toxic chemical spilling incident, avoid
economic damage and environment degradation, appropriate stipulation
should be made for handling of hazardous and toxic chemical materials,
such as establishment of toxic material identification system, label system,
reporting system, license system, or escorting system etc, providing
necessary communication add urgent responsible facilities, and equipping
necessary communication and treating and curing implements.
7. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
During EIA performance period, the study team conducted public
participation program in porder to collect questions and requirement from
the local people who are directly influenced by expressway construction.
Persons who are being visited by study team including township officials,
representatives of people's congress, members of political negotiation
committee, village cadres, and mostly farmers, totally 50 persons. Some
major ideas from public participation are:
15



7.1 Welcome the Construction of Expressway
To most local people especially local cadres or township enterprise owners,
they are highly appropriate the expressway construction, they believe that
the expressway construction will be greatly helpful to improve local
environment, which will benefit to the development of local economy.
7.2 Understanding and Acceptance of Resettlement Arrangement
Most being visited people who will be resettled showing that they
understand and accept the arrangement of resettlement, they are
satisfactory to compensation and believe that it is enough to cover their
properties. They believe that they will get a better life when they are
resettled from village to township. They prefer the life style change.
7.3 Re-organizing Local Administration and Economic Development
The expressway construction will make society and natural environment
divided into two parts, cut communication among blocks and communities
which are as a whole. The local administrative structure and economic
development are needed to be reorganized, and re-planned to develop in
the future.
7.4 The Borrowed Land of Construction Site Should Not Be Too Separated
During expressway construction, the temporarily borrowed land should be
appropriately used and protected, Before returned, these land must meet
the requirement suitable to be re-cultivated. The local people hope that the
temporarily borrowed land as construction site should not be too separated.
The borrowed land should be returned on time. Compensation should be
paid to any damage of soil and neighbouring environment.
7.5 Additional Ramps
The local people expresses that there are not enough ramps and they wish
appropriately/ to add same ramps in this expressway, so as to pass this
road more conveniently. If insufficient in budget, local may finance the
additional ramps construction.
7.6 Ideas Against the Expressway Construction
16



Few people, mostly who are pure farmers showing that they don't like the
expressway construction, they think that the expressway construction will
bring more inconvenience than benefit to their daily life. Even they get
enough  compensation  for their loss, but they  ha,! to  pay  more energy  to
gain a stable life again. The soil excavation has formed many ponds which
may be good for fish production. Experience has been shown in other
expressway construction that too much fish will break fish market balance,
result in decreasing fish price, and hurt the existing people who raise fish
as major production activities. So it is necessary to develop fishery market
before developing fishery production.
7.7 No Idea To Expressway Construction
Quite a number of people show no idea to expressway construction, they
think that things has been decided already, it is no use to say agree or
not  agree.  The   reason   is  that  local  people  Lack   of  experience   in
participation  of public  affairs, they  have  less opportunity  in  participating
such important development project, so lack of participating  awareness.

9. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
It is proposed that environmental monitoring program should be conducted
in both period during expressway construction and operation. And
according to the result of monitoring to improve environmental protection
planning the major monitoring program are:
J
*    Follow up investigation on local socio-economic development during
expressway construction and operation periods.
*    Continuously monitor on air quality, noise and soil lead pollution
during expressway construction and operation periods.
*    The monitoring program  can be done by local EPB, financially
supported by construction proponent.
*    Office is  needed  to  be  established  under  Shanghai Highway
Department, Municipal Construction Bureau of Shanghai, specially for
charge of environmental protection affairs for all highways (including
expressways) of Shanghai region.
Monitoring budget is approximately 200,000 RMB annually.
10. CONCLUSION
Corresponding with the rapid socio-economic growth of Shanghai,
traffic conditions of the Yangtse Delta are over-loading either in
water way or in roadway, which became the major problem to hinder
the further regional development. The Shanghai-Hangzhou expressway
construction is in great necessity and will provide more opportunities
to the socio-economic development of Shanghai city, and make benefit
to the whole YangLse Delta and the vast inland area.
Thorough study has been made in route and type selection, both type
and route of the proposed expressway are rational.
*    The major environmental impact by expressway construction is charge
of land use pattern, resettlement of local people, land borrowed and
*                contaminated, soil excavation causing the damage of land during road
construction, the stimulating of local socio-economic development is
also a major impact Strong measures should be taken to mitigate loss
and damage of land resource.
Attention should  be paid  for in reducing  soil erosion  during
19



expressway construction and operation stage.
*    Limited impact will be occurred on air pollution and noise pollution,
the distance which exceeded environmental standard will be 50-lOOm
away from the line of the right-of-way.
*    The construction of expressway itself is in good economic benefiL
From the view of regional or national development, the construction
of Shanghai-Hangzhou expressway is necessary in economic
development, feasible in engineering, and rational in environmental
protection.
