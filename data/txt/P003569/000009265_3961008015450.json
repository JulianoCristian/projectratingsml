Project are: 1) to increase highway capacity in the\n            Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor in order to relieve existing\n            congestion and promote economic development; 2) to improve\n            road safety in northern Zhejiang; and 3) to develop highway\n            sector institutional capability in Shanghai and Zhejiang.\n            The project consists of four main components: (1) the\n            construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, a 130 km\n            divided four-lane access-controlled highway, including\n            service facilities and the supply and installation of\n            electrical, electronic and mechanical equipment for tolling,\n            traffic monitoring, telecommunication and lighting, and the\n            upgrading and construction of 56 km of crossroads at\n            interchange locations in Zhejiang Province to improve access\n            to the new expressway; (2) construction supervision of the\n            Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway; (3), the Road Safety Program,\n            a pilot program in northern Zhejiang to improve safety on\n            highways in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor after opening of\n            the new expressway, including: the upgrading of 86km of\n            National Route and technical assistance, training, and\n            equipment; (4) institutional strengthening of highway\n            agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang, comprising: a) a staff\n            training program covering highway planning, management,\n            design, construction, and maintenance; and b) strengthening\n            of technical capacity through the addition of equipment."}, "docdt": "1995-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
