assessment study are to: 1) study the present\n            environmental conditions along the proposed expressway and\n            the environmental impact of vehicle volume of existing\n            roads; 2) identify the distribution features of human\n            landscapes and historic antiquities, as well as probable\n            influences on these by the new expressway to be built; 3)\n            forecast the environmental impacts in the construction phase\n            of the expressway; 4) forecast the range of the pollutants\n            and the concentrations in case of maximum traffic during the\n            operation of the expressway; and 5) forecast adverse\n            environmental impact of accident emission of pollutant\n            sources.  The enviromental issues in the implementation\n            phase of the expressway project are divided into three\n            categories: air quality changing, noise impact and water\n            quality impact.  These categories of environmental issues\n            are futher divided into: 1) resettlement; 2) soil erosion;\n            3) visual impact; 4) social activities and historic relics;\n            5) flooding drainage; 6) environment and construction\n            related impacts; and 7) environment and operation related\n            impact.  This study covers each of these impacts for the\n            operating phase and also analyzes the impacts during the\n            construction and the operation phases."}, "docdt": "1993-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
