MALI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BA.CKGROUND
A. Urbari Development
1.01      Mali, one of the world's poorest (1977 GNP per capita US$114) and
most rural countries, faces accelerating urban growth. Nearly 14% of its 1978
population of 6.6 million was urban, up from 9% in 1960. By the year 2000,
Mali is expected to nearly double the relative size of its urban sector.
Whereas Mali's population is increasing at 2.5% per year, its urban population
is growing at 4.5% annually. Bamako, the capital of the country, now has
about 470,000 residents, or about half of the country's urban population, and
has been growing at about 8.7% per year since 1965. Bamako could reach 2
million by the year 2000, nearly 5 times its present size.
1.02      Growth in Mali's secondary centers is also rapid.  While small
relative to Bamako, several of these cities could play an important role in
enhancing the productivity of regions with good agricultural potential. Six
urban areas with populations over 30,000 are growing at 4.5% annually: Segou
(72,000), Mopti (62,000), Sikasso (52,000), Kayes (50,000), Gao (33,000), and
Koutiala (30,000) (see Map 1). Urbanization trends indicate that these cities
will at least double their populations by the year 2000. Of the six cities,
Government is particularly concerned about the role of Mopti, Kayes and Gao in
national economic development and about the basic urban problems they face
and has requested that these cities be included, along with Bamako, in the
first urban development project.
1.03      While the key to growth in Mali's economy lies in improved agricul-
tural productivity, urbanization wiLl be fueled by heavy migration; roughly
half of the urban growth will be attributable to migrants from rural areas,
who will aggravate severe pressures for scarce employment opportunities and
other urban services. Heretofore Government's response has been to increase
expenditures in the capital without adequate attention to the role of the
urban sector in the country's longer term agricultural development strategy
and consequent rural/urban interrelationships, and the implications of
unchecked urban growth in a national context of scarce resources. These
issues are discussed more fully in a World Bank working paper on an opera-
tional strategy for urban development in the Sahel (WP 315).
1.04      The World Bank paper proposes the following objectives for an urban
development policy in the Sahelian countries: (a) controlling growth of the
capital cities and developing econoinic and institutional links between the
urban and rural sectors, (b) developing alternative methods of providing
low-cost urban services, (c) recovering investment and recurrent costs to
permit financial replicability, (d) strengthening national and municipal
institutions to perform urban management functions, and (e) stimulating
community participation in urban development programs. The proposed project
addresses these issues.

Bamako: The Historical and Spatial Setting
1.05      For several centuries, Bamako was a major commercial center in
sub-Saharan Africa, situated at the crossroads of two old major commercial
routes: North-South, linking Senegal and Mauritania with the Ivory Coast,
Nigeria and Ghana, and West-East providing access to the then strategically
located and ancient city of Timbuctu and to Guinea. Located on the banks of
the Niger River, Bamako's growth was enhanced as a principal outpost for the
many exploratory parties which travelled the River in the 1800's. Transfer
of the Government seat from Kayes to Bamako in 1908, coupled with the con-
struction of a railway link to Dakar and the opening of navigation services
to Gao marked a period of renewed commercial growth and physical expansion.
Despite Abidjan's increasing attraction as a commercial site, Bamako continued
to develop following independence in 1960, due primarily to the concentration
of administrative infrastructure and public sector employment. Today, Bamako
is Mali's primary urban center and, with its hinterland, constitutes the
second most populous region in the country after Mopti (see Map 1).
1.06      Growth was initially confined to the north bank, wedged between the
Mandingue cliffs and the Niger River, but expanded rapidly to the south bank
with the construction of the bridge over the Niger in 1960. Today, Bamako
District occupies 7,000 ha, 3,000 of which are urbanized (see Map 2). Popu-
lation density is about 150 inhab./ha throughout the city, with the exception
of the central zone, which ranges from 80 inhab./ha in the high income and
administrative areas, to 400 inhab./ha in Bozola, the city's oldest commercial
district.  In the absence of a development policy and adequate infrastructure
and housing investments, Bamako has witnessed the rapid proliferation of
squatter settlements on its periphery, mainly on the south bank, and often as
far as 10 km from the city center. By 1976, squatters represented about 25%
of the total population, a figure which could reach 50% during the next
decade.
B. Bamako: The Urban Environment
1.07      Bamako's rapid population growth has occurred in the absence of
a viable institutional framework. This is reflected in the low level of
services and, in some instances, abandonment of maintenance of past invest-
ments. Consequently, urban population growth has not been matched by a
corresponding increase in housing and services. Prior to 1960, the Government
responded to the pressures of urban expansion by the ad hoc designation of new
neighborhoods on each side of the city center. A schematic master plan was
drawn up in 1963 and revised in 1968. The 1968 plan was never updated,
creating serious difficulties in guiding and coordinating growth. A new
preliminary master plan was elaborated in 1978 during project preparation; it
sets the framework for this project. The proposed project provides financing
for completion of the plan.



- 3 -
1.08       Long concerned with rural development priorities, the Government
now faces a number of problems in the provision of services to its rapidly
expanding urban population. These include efficient lancl use and land
allocation, the provision of shelter and infrastructure services and the
generation of employment. The absence of a coherent land management policy,
in particular, has helped set the stage for the current difficulties. Tra-
ditionally, various agencies, ranging from the District to the Ministry of
Agriculture, have distributed and sold public land in the Bamako region for
uses and at prices which reflected narrow sectoral interests. In recent
years, about 1,500 plots were annually distributed ad hoc in the Bamako
District raising serious questions of ownership. These events were compli-
cated by an outdated tenure system which fails to resolve, among other
questions, the delicate issue of customary rights. Moreover, some 18,000
lots about 15 km from the city center were sold to finance the construction
of new Government buildings in Koulikouro proper. This situation has aggra-
vated the low-density scattered speculative development pattern of Bamako,
making it increasingly problematic for the Government to mobilize financial
resources and to provide even minimal urban services to its residents.
Hous ing
1.09       Weak institutions and financial constraints have also prevented the
Malian Government from intervening in the housing sector. No public housing
program exists, except for 400 units built during the 1960's by a state-owned
development agency and which were designed for the highe-r income group.
Nearly 80% of the dwellings in Bamako are simple mudbrick structures.
Private investment in new housing has been constrained by the very low
incomes of the population and the absence of credit facilities.
1.10       Although the shortage of housing affects all income levels, the
burden of the shortfall is on the poorer residents. Privately built housing
in the formal sector is only affordable by the higher income groups, and is
not built in sufficient numbers to meet the demand, intensifying speculation,
especially on the city limits. The high cost of imported building materials,
particularly cement and corrugated roofing, are additional deterrents to
increasing the private housing stock. Recently, the Government has sought to
remedy the situation by promoting the use of improved local building materials.
Infrastructure Services
1.11       The deficiency of services in Bamako is described in detail in a
1973 WHO/UNDP study (Balfour) which provided the basic framework for the
proposed IDA Project. The inefficient provision of services is a major
problem in all of Mali's urban areas. Whereas living conditions vary markedly
between higher income residential neighborhoods and other areas in Bamako,
the majority of urban residents have very low levels of services, if any at
all. The resultant environment is one of deteriorated quality and a serious
health risk.
1.12       Bamako's residents are poorly served by the water supply system.
In 1978 about 50% of the population had access to piped water through 7,000



-4 -
individual connections, and from 125 standpipes located in the more central
neighborhoods. In contrast, the remainder of Bamako's residents, over-
whelmingly poor and living mainly in the peripheral areas, have no access to
a potable water supply, relying instead on wells and gullies with water of
poor and often dangerous quality. The sewer system services less than 10% of
the population, mainly the high income residential neighborhoods and the
administrative center. The rest of the population uses pit latrines. The
virtual absence of communal sanitation facilities throughout the city is a
serious problem. Their lack in many schools and market areas constitute a
worrisome environmental health hazard.
1.13       Solid waste collection is also a serious problem.  Whereas Bamako's
population produces about 270,000 m  of solid waste yearly, the DistSict's
maintenance office has a solid waste collection capacity of 90,000 m per
year. It serves mainly the higher income areas. Uncollected waste is dumped
either into the streets or in the drainage ditches, accumulating into mounds
of garbage, breeding a host of diseases. The disposal of garbage close to
food stalls in the market areas is an especially serious threat to public
health. In addition, with few exceptions all roads in Bamako are in very
poor condition, which hampers even the minimal collection of garbage.
1.14       Storm water drainage is provided for by a well-conceived but poorly
maintained network of lateral open ditches in the older section of the city;
the new areas are not served at all. The hazardous condition of the system,
coupled with the water disposal problem, are major factors in the deteriorated
and declining quality of the urban environment. Ditches are often used for
the disposal of sewage and solid wastes, clogging drains and causing water
stagnation. One result is a high incidence of malaria, which is the major
cause of death among children under five.
1.15      The production and distribution of electricity is not adequate.
The construction of the Selingue dam, 100 km away from Bamako, and the pre-
paration of a forthcoming IDA electricity-water supply project will greatly
improve the situation.
Health and Education Services
1.16      Although per capita expenditures on health and education are higher
in Bamako than in the rural areas, the level of service provided is often as
inadequate. Several international agencies are preparing projects in this
sector. More recently, the Government has requested IDA assistance in the
health sector; IDA is currently examining the feasibility of a first health
project. The provision of educational facilities and personnel is not much
better. Primary schools are overcrowded and poorly equipped. The level of
service varies greatly within the city, from 1 classroom per 1,000 inhabitants
in the peripheral areas to 4 classrooms per 1,000 inhabitants in the higher
income areas.

Urban Poverty/Employment
1.17      The urban poverty threshcld estimated for Mali is MF30,250 (US$69)
per household per month. Although data is both scarce and imprecise, it
indicates Ahat approximately 40% of Bamako's households have incomes below
this level. Government service and employment in various state enterprises
dominate the urban employment base. But the Government payroll is already
severely burdened, and it is unlilkely that public sector employment will
increase rapidly enough to absorb the growing numbers seeking income-earning
opportunities. In the absence of a sizeable and vigorous formal private
sector, the informal sector, accounting for nearly 50% of total employment,
represents a potentially attractive, albeit limited area for employment growth.
Access to credit and technical assistance offer some opportunity for small
scale businesses to expand their operations. In this perspective, the German
Government (KFW) has financed thr,ee lines of credit for medium-scale enter-
prises. A recently appraised IDA project will address the problems of small
and middle size enterprises and smnall contractors. Little attention however
has yet been paid to the artisanal sector.
District Administration
1.18      At the local level, the District is responsible for (a) maintenance
of streets and drainage canals and social service facilities, including
schools and clinics; (b) environmental sanitation, such as garbage collection,
insecticide spraying, and waste disposal; (c) fire prevention; and (d) regu-
lation of land development and housing construction. However, these have not
been performed effectively, if not abandoned altogether because of meager
budgetary resources (see on-going Administrative Reform para 4.01).
C. Other Project Cities: Mopti, Kayes and Gao
1.19      As Mali's secondary centers expand, there will be a corresponding
increase in the demand for employmemt, housing and urban services. However,
given the severe manpower and financial constraints, a first effort to
develop a strategy to manage urban growth must necessarily be focussed on the
capital. Nonetheless, the centers selected for limited intervention in the
proposed IDA project signal Government's recognition of their emerging role in
the promotion of productive growth in their respective regions and the Govern-
ment's concern with the most basic problems faced by these towns.
Mopti
1.20      With a population of 62,000, Mopti is located on the north bank of
the Bani River close to its junction with the Niger River, approximately in
the center of the country (see Map 1). Environmental sanitation is the
most urgent problem facing Mopti, in a context of extreme poverty and limited
Government resources. The storm drainage network serves only about 30% of
the city, contributing to severe flooding in the rainy season. When the
Bani's water level rises, the old and the new parts of the city become two
islands connected by a road strip. Solid waste is not collected except in
the commercial zone, forcing most of the population to dispose of its



-6-
garbage outside the city limits or in the low-lying areas of the city,
posing serious health problems when there is flooding. There is no water-
borne sewerage system, with most of the modern buildings relying on septic
tanks which are periodically but infrequently emptied by the Municipal
Sanitation Service. The rest of the mud-brick houses use pit latrines.
Kayes
1.21      Kayes, Mali's third largest town with 50,000 residents, is located
at the very western end of the country on the Bamako-Dakar railway (see
Map 1). An inadequate water supply is a particularly serious problem,
which was aggravated by the recent breakdown of the intake works. Nearly
15% of the town's population lies in the rapidly growing Kayes-Ndi area,
which has no access to potable water, a situation which the Government is
anxious to remedy.
Gao
1.22      Gao, the old capital of the Songhai Empire and now the capital of
the 7th region, Mali's most arid area (see Map 1), also faces serious water
supply problems. These are related to the production as well as the distribu-
tion of water, problems which are heightened by the large influx of temporary
residents and cattle which come to town during the dry season. This temporary
migration doubles the town's population of 33,000. Only about 1/3 of the
residents have access to a piped water supply, which is intermittent at best.
The remaining population has no access at all and is forced to seek water at
the few available wells in the town.
D. Government Responses to Urban Needs
1.23      Given the projected level of urban growth and extreme poverty, and
the few opportunities to reverse these trends in the short term, Government
faces a major dilemma in responding to the needs of its urban population.
Within this perspective, Government has shown a growing understanding that the
urban sector cannot compete for scarce resources but must support and promote
productive growth in the rural areas. Thus, it is now willing to examine the
issues of cost recovery, standards and the capacity to pay of its urban house-
holds. As a first step, this project will explore low-cost, replicable solu-
tions to the provision of urban services. Government has also acknowledged
that its institutions responsible for providing urban services face serious
financial and manpower problems, which must be reduced if they are to be
effectively responsive to the increasing demand. To strengthen these institu-
tions, an institutional reform is currently being implemented (see para 4.01).
1.24      With regard to shelter and to fill the urban policy vacuum, Govern-
ment is undertaking several actions which will assist the District of Bamako
in meeting its responsibilities. These include: (a) further elaboration and
completion of a schematic structural plan for the Bamako area; (b) revision



-7-
of tenure legisiation and elaboration of a land management policy; and
(c) a detailed review of the institutions in the sector. With regard to
urban services, project identification and preparation efforts are underway
for urban roads, water supply and electricity, and Government has requested
financing from several bilateral agebncies and IDA. Studies -f financial
issues in this sector have been initiated. In this regard KFW is financing
a water tariff study.
1.25      The proposed project was prepared by consultants financed by IDA,
through an advance from the Project Preparation Facility, in close collabora-
tion with all agencies concerned, especially the Directorate of Habitat.  In a
country where experience and resources are extremely limited, the impact of
this first investment effort has been carefully considered, with particular
attention paid to the Sahelian operational development strategy referred to
in paragraph 1.04. The objectives of this project are modest and aim to
support Government's initial steps to (a) improve sanitary conditions city-
wide, (b) demonstrate an affordable and replicable solution to the provision
of shelter services, and (c) strengthen the institutional framework to perform
urban management functions.
Il. PROJECT COMPONENTS AND COSTS
A. The Project
Objectives
2.01      The main objective of the project is to assist the Government in
providing affordable urban services, particularly shelter, water supply,
garbage collection, drainage, schools and health care, to low-income urban
residents. To ensure replicability and maintenance of project components,
cost recovery will be a major goal, especially for shelter and municipal
services, for which costs have traditionally not been adequately recovered.
2.02      The specific objectives of the project will be to (a) provide
shelter services and related commurnity facilities to meet about half of the
growth in demand for low income groups in Bamako, (b) improve health and
sanitary conditions in Bamako, (c) stimulate productive employment through
financial assistance to the informal sector and the promotion of local
building materials, (d) provide essential water and sanitation services to
secondary cities, and (e) establish and strengthen institutions in the urban
sector, particularly the Bamako regional Directorates of Habitat and Taxes,
the Land Management Agency and the District Housing Bureau and Technical
Services Department.
Main Features
2.03      To achieve the above objectives the project would comprise:

2.04      The project would introduce low-cost solutions to improve the
delivery of urban services in Bamako and the three secondary cities. The
upgrading and sites and services components of the project will demonstrate
the feasibility of these approaches to improving the living conditions of
the urban poor. Assistance to the informal sector will help to create per-
manent employment for small traders and artisans in the site-specific areas
and is complementary to the wider assistance to small enterprises and artisans
proposed under the forthcoming IDF project. The development of local building
materials and training of craftsmen in the building sector would be integrated
with the provision of housing and community facilities, thereby reducing the
cost of these components. Finally, the strengthening of institutions will
assist project implementation in the short term and will help increase the
capacity to deliver a replicable low-cost urban development program.
B. Detailed Description
(a) Shelter Services, Bamako
(i) Upgrading Magnambougou
2.05      This squatter settlement, which began to develop in 1965, is
situated on the south bank of the Nliger River in one of the most rapidly
expanding peripheral areas of Bamako (see Map 2). Selection of this site
was determined after analysis of the population characteristics, services
and location relative to primary infrastructure and employment opportunities.
The average income of the neighborhood is about 40% lower than that of the
city as a whole and there is no security of tenure. The contiguity of the
sites and services and upgrading areas will also simplify design and project
implementation, reduce costs of providing off-site infrastructure, and mini-
mize disruption to the small number of households in the upgrading area who
will require relocation (see para 3.14).
2.06      The 1976 population was 9,061 inhabitants and the number of
houseVolds was approximately 1,725, living on 1,550 lots of a median size of
375 m .  There are now some 12,000 people on this site on 1,700 lots and the
population is expected to reach 22,900 by the end of the project period. Lot
sizes range from about 100 to 600 mi . The settlement extends over approxi-
mately 100 ha on a gentle slope (2%,) towards the Niger River. The settlers
have built banco (mud brick) houses on laterite ground along narrow streets
(see pictures in Annex 7).
2.07      Design standards for on-site infrastructure are minimal, reflecting
the severe affordability constraints. The improvements represent a first
phase of upgrading which can be progressively improved as incomes permit.
The design standards are partly determined by constraints such as the off-site
availability of water supply and eLectricity, and also by the low income level
of the settlement. About 80% of the gross area is subdivided into lots with
perimeter walls. Infill plots were not provided because of complicated

readjustment procedures, social customs and compensation difficulties. House-
holds are expected to rent rooms or subdivide their lots for their extended
family, for example. The following improvements are proposed (see Maps 3, 4
and 5):
On-site roads. Simple clearing or grading of 6 km of tertiary
roads (existing right-of-way, 5 m levelling); 2 km of laterite gravelled
secondary roads (12 m right-of-way, 7 m gravel), and 850 m of paved access
roads to the market (20 m right-of-way, 7 m carriageway).
On-site water supply. Construction of a distribution network,
with pipe diameters ranging from 80 mm to 200 mm, including provision of 16
public standpipes to provide water within 200 m of all plots (one tap for
about 80 households).
On-site drainage.  Construction of earth drainage ditches and
masonry drainage ditches with culverts where necessary.
On-site electricity. Provision of overhead lines fed by one 160
KVA transformer. Initially, electricity will be limited to street lighting
on main street and connections to community facilities.
Community facilities. Provision of 12 classrooms and a retail
market, built with improved local building materials (see para 2.23). The
design principles for community facilities and services provided would be
similar to those for the sites and services scheme. During negotiations
assurances were obtained that a sufficient number of teachers will be
allocated to the new schools without creating a negative effect on the
availability of teachers elsewhere.
Home improvement loans of US$125 each (at 12% interest over 20
years) will be available to all plotholders. Technical assistance for
improved construction with local building materials will also be provided
(see para 2.23).
Security of tenure. The land in the Magnambougou area belongs
to the State of Mali. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
it will be transferred to the District of Bamako before lots are allocated.
Residents will be given long-term (20 years) lease-purchase agreements.
(ii) Sites and Services
2.08      Sites and services will be provided at Magnambougou on a site
adjacent to the area being upgraded, covering about 100 ha. The projected
1983 population is 22,000 persons (2,600 households). The site is close
to employment opportunities and soil conditions are suitable for residential
development. Site layout has been designed to ensure effective use of land and
infrastructure (see Maps 3, 4 and 5). Land use is shown in Table II-2 below.

2.09  2   Bînefici¢ries will Vave the possibility of acquiring lots type A
(320 m ), A (160 m ), B 374 m ) and C (500 m ).  Those who choose type A lots
will be allowed to resell half of th4ir lot if2they cannot afford their pay-
ments.  Lot sizes ranging from 160n m  to 500 m  and service levels have been
determined by analysis of the trade-offs between varying levels of population
density and infrastructure costs in relation to their affordability by the
target population. The alternative solutions were discussed with Government
and the proposed standards agreed upon as representing levels of service that
would be affordable to the lowest income groups on the sinallest lots, with a
mix of larger lots to allow for development of a balanced community.  During
negotiations assurances were obtained that lot sizes and service standards
will be as described above.
2.10      Service standards would provide for public standpipes, drainage
facilities, street lighting and mainly unpaved roads. Ail lots will be
within 200 m of a public standpipe or one tap for every 80 households. Sewage
disposal will be via pit latrines. No private electricity connections will be
provided except for the community facilities, with street lighting on primary
and secondary roads.  Paved access will be provided to the market and community
facilities only to allow for public transport and garbage collection. Second-
ary roads will be gravelled with laterite while tertiary roads will be simply
cleared or graded. Most lots would be provided with simple cleared pedestrian
access ouly.  Community facilities including 12 classrooms, one health center



- 12 -
and a retail market will also be provided. Construction loans ranging from
US$590 to US$1,640 will be providSd to all plotholders of the lease-purchase
lots. Beneficiaries of the 500 m freehold lots sold at market prices will
not be eligible for any loans (see details in Table V-1, page 35).
2.11      Total project cost per household (1983 population) for all improve-
ments averages US$710 in the upgrading area, and US$1,110 for the sites and
services area.  Per capita costs are US$88 and US$138 respectively.
2.12      Land in the sites and services area is owned by jhe State and
will be transferred to the District of Bamako. Plots A, A and B will be
leased to beneficiaries with lease-purchase agreements (maximum 20 years);
C lots, will be sold freehold. Lots will be differentially priced according
to location, size and tenure (see para 5.04).
(iii) Off-site infrastructure
2.13      Off-site infrastructure necessary for the upgrading and sites and
services areas includes:
-  1,550 m of 7 m wide paved access roads;
-  1,500 m of earth and masonry drainage ditches;
-  2,000 m of medium tension electric wires; and
-  3,500 m of 300 mm water supply mains.
This infrastructure, especially the water mains, will also be utilized for
adjacent development not included in this project.
(b)  Improvements in Municipal Sanitary Conditions in the Bamako District
2.14      This component aims at improving health and hygiene conditions in
the District by repairing and programming maintenance of existing works in
garbage collection, drainage, public standpipes and public toilets, and the
construction of new facilities. The total expenditure for these sub-components
amounts to about US$5 per capita, based on the city's current population.
The objectives of these project elements are to ensure:
-  regular collection of household refuse with fixed points of
disposal throughout the entire city;
-  better storm water drainage; and
-  improved utilization and increased access to the standpipe
network.
2.15      Garbage collection:  The deteriorated environment, created in part
by garbage collection difficulties, poses a serious threat to public health
and impedes the effective operation of the storm water drainage system. The



- 13 -
project will provide for the purchase of 9 skip trucks (unit cost US$60,000)
and 85 skips. The Municipal maintenance services will be reorganized,
maintenance operations programmed (para 4.15) and three points of disposal
designated. The project also inclucles start-up costs (fuel and spare parts)
necessary fo this program for the first two years of operation until the new
municipal taxes yield sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses including
replacements (see para 5.10). During negotiations assurances were obtained
that the amount corresponding to the depreciation of vehicles and material
will be put in a special account.
2.16      Clearing and repair of drainage ditches.  This sub-component is
closely linked to the garbage collection and public standpipes sub-components.
The project will consist of cleaning and repairing the 250 km of existing
drainage ditches, followed by a regular annual maintenance program. This
program will also include the concrete lining of about 25 km of the bottoms
of the ditches which drain away the waste water from standpipes. Funds are
provided for four trucks, 30 wheel-barrows, picks and shovels, as well as
cement, sand and gravel for lining clitches. Start-up costs for the first two
years of operation are also includeci in the project.
2.17      Public standpipes.  This sub-component aims to serve the majority
of the population of Bamako with fresh water within an acceptable radius of
200 m. The project will provide for 20 new standpipes (unit cost $511,
including connection, meter, concrete slab, etc.), repair of 98 existing
standpipes and the realignment of 22 standpipes on cement-lined drainage
ditches. Most of these standpipes are in the central area because of the
density of population and because oi the limited capacity of the distribution
system. The standpipes will be placed on a 3 m x 3 m concrete slab to
permit easy access and to ensure that containers can be filled under hygienic
conditions, as well as to permit ancl expedite the run-off of waste water.
Where necessary, some standpipes wil have two or three taps.
2.18      Public toilets.  The project provides for ten public toilet blocks
(unit cost $26,000 including building, water connection, etc.). These toilets
will operate on the "acqua privy" principle. They will be located in the
main retail markets and in some schools.  The District maintenance service
will be responsible for their maintenance.
2.19      Main drainage outlets Niarela/Bozola.  This component is comple-
mentary to the cleaning and repair of drainage ditches mentioned in para
2.16 above, and aims to prevent the flooding and the stagnation of storm
water in the ditches of the low lying areas of the densely populated central
neighborhoods. It is expected that these measures would considerably improve
health conditions in Bozola and Niarela (among the densest neighborhoods
of the city). The project will provide for the cleaning, repair and con-
struction of 1,000 m of masonry ditches and the opening of a 2.3 km trench in
the direction of the Niger River (see Map 2).
2.20      Premises for the TechnicaL Services Directorate (Voirie«.  The
project will provide for the corstruction of new premises (850 m for repair
shops and   warehouse, and 150 m  for office space) to the Directorate which



- 14 -
will implement agd maintain the above sub-components. The project will also
include 2,500 m of parking space for existing and new vehicles, tools,
materials and equipment for the maintenance/repair shops, as well as a
training program for personnel. Assistance from a mechanic and a municipal
engineer is also included (see para 2.27).
(c) Assistance to the Informal Sector
2.21      The project will provide physical facilities, credit and assistance
to the informal sector as follows:
Four retail market facilities, one in the area to be upgraded, one
in the sites and services area, and two in existing market locations in the
city without any facilities (Bako-Djikoroni and Sogoninko - see Map 2). Each
market will accommodate from 120 to 480 stalls on a paved area, 10 to 30 shops
(partition walls and roofs only), and 5 to 10 lots for artisans' workshops.
Each market will also have a public standpipe, a public lavatory and garbage
collection facilities. Shopkeepers and artisans would rent their facilities
from the District.
2.22      Credit to Artisans.  The project would provide for two types of
loans to artisans who are beneficiaries of lots: (i) 50 workshop construction
loans, up to a maximum of US$625 each, for the artisans renting lots in the
markets to be constructed under the project, and (ii) 400 smail equipment/
materials loans, of US$125 each, for the artisans located in the sites and
services and upgrading areas. Both types of loans would be administered by
the Housing Bureau which would already have a file on the applicants. The
linking of applicants for lots with an application for credit is expected to
greatly reduce the risk involved in recovery, since the applicant will have
already gone through a selection process. Thus the artisans' credit program
would act as a type of character loan mechanism, with the lot serving as
collateral.
2.23      Local building materials.  The project also includes a program to
promote and develop the use of improved local building materials (mainly
stone and stabilized mud brick construction) in the project areas. The objec-
tives of this component are: (a) to provide improved local building materials
affordable by the low-income population; (b) reduce imports of cement (cur-
rently subsidized by Government); and (c) familiarize and train local artisans
and contractors with appropriate techniques. Specifically, the project will
provide for (i) technical assistance (one local building materials expert for
two years), he will be part of the Project Unit; (ii) training of Malian
counterparts; and (iii) equipment and material. The Directorate of Habitat
of the Ministry of Public Works will utilize the resources of the existing
laboratory in the Ministry of Public Works and will focus on providing assist-
ance to the beneficiaries of the sites and services and upgrading areas
building their houses, and to the contractors for the community facilities
being constructed under the project.

(d) Secondary Cities
2.24      In the secondary cities, the project would provide only for urgent
measures as described below. More comprehensive studies and investments are
envisaged in the identification/preparation of a proposed Bank-financed
water supply project. This is considered as a first step in an effort to
evaluate the role of these towns relative to the agricultural potential of
their respective regions. In Mopti, the European Development Fund (FED) has
recently financed a complete water supply system for Mopti-Sevare (produc-
tion, storage, distribution). The proposed project would address the city's
sewage and garbage collection problems by providing for (i) 2 garbage trucks
and 18 cement-lined garbage collection points; (ii) 2 vacuum trucks for
the collection of sewage; and (iii) construction of a toilet block.
2.25      In Gao, the Community of Western African States (CEAO) has recently
provided a grant to repair and improve wells and the pumping station. The
proposed project would provide for extension of the water distribution network
(about 12 km of water pipes ranging from 50 mm to 150 mm in diameter).
2.26      In Kayes, the project would address the inadequate water supply
of the city by providing for (i) replacement of the temporary water intake
and associated pipe wor~; (ii) purchase of pumps and equipment with a
total capacity of 300 m /h; (iii) construction of a 200 mm water main across
the Senegal River to the Kayes-Ndi neighborhood; and (iv) extension of the
water distribution network (about 1 km of pipes with diameters ranging from
80 mm to 250 mm).
(e) Advisory Services for Project Implementation
2.27      Consultant and advisory services will be provided for the follow-
ing purposes. Detailed draft terms of reference acceptable to IDA and the
Government have been prepared for services (i) and (ii).
(i) Project design and implementation advice to assist the Project
Unit - with project coordination, management and design. Six experts (a
project leader-administrator, one municipal engineer, a mechanic, a systems
analyst, a municipal management expert and a local building materials
expert) (para 2.23) to assist the departtments concerned with project execu-
tion will be financed under the project. Total costs are estimated at $2.4
million at approximately $11,000 per person-month.
(ii) Aerial surveys of the District of Bamako necessary for preparati.n
of the cadastral survey for a new municipal tax system (US$170,000) (see para
5.10).
(iii) Audit. The Project Unit will be responsible for coordinating the
audit which will be included under the project (US$100,000).



- 16 -
(f) Studies
2.28      Studies include:  (i) the feasibility study for the proposed project
(IDA, PPF advance made in 1977). The work was undertaken by consultants
"Groupe Huit" (Tunisia), in collaboration with the Directorate of Habitat of
the Ministry-of Public Works (US$320,000); (ii) preparation of a short/medium
term investment programming study for the District of Bamako, including the
completion of a schematic structural plan for the city (US$250,000); and
(iii) preparation study of a second urban project (US$375,000). Unit cost per
person-month averages US$11,000 for these studies.
(g) Assistance to Institutions
2.29      A Project Unit will be established within the Ministry of Interior
to assist, coordinate, supervise and monitor project implementation with the
help of technical assistance (see para 2.27). For this unit, the project will
provide for 3 vehicles and their operating costs, office materials, supplies
and equipment, and recurrent-costs for the office (US$240,000).
2.30      The Bamako Land Management Agency (CAFOBA) will be set up to
accelerate provision of state-owned land for housing and other purposes. It
will be an administrative agency under the tutelage of the Ministry of Finance
with sole power to distribute state-owned land in the Bamako region and to
receive payment for it in accordance with the Government's land management
policy. The agency would be established in stages as described in para 4.11.
The project will provide for office facilities, vehicles, and office material
and equipment for the start-up of the new agency.
III. COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING PLAN AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Cost Estimates
3.01      The total project cost including contingencies is estimated at
MF 6.7 billion (US$15.3 million) with a foreign exchange component of MF 3.2
billion (US$7.3 million) or 47% of total project costs. Summary cost esti-
mates are given in Table III-1 and detailed cost estimates in Annex 1. The
value of land to be provided by the Government, MF 420 million (US$950,000),
is included in the project cost. Base cost estimates are in June 1979 prices
and are based on (a) preliminary engineering design for civil works, (b)
suppliers quotes for equipment, and (c) current experience on other projects
in Mali for consulting services (rate US$11,000 per person month). Physical
contingencies have been calculated at 15% for civil works and at 10% for
buildings, equipment and consulting services. No physical contingencies have
been included for improvement loans or artisans' credits. Price contingencies
are based on the latest IDA guidelines for equipment (6.0% in 1979 and there-
after) and on mission estimates of future inflation in the construction sector
for civil works (10% in 1979 and thereafter).
B. Financing Plan
3.02      The proposed IDA credit of US$12.0 million (MF 5,280 million) will
finance 80% of total project costs, or 85% of project costs excluding taxes.

The credit would cover 100% of estimated foreign exchange costs (US$7.3 mil-
lion) and 78% of local costs excluding taxes and land. The Government of Mali
would provide the balance of US$3.3 million or 20% of the total costs. The
financing plan is summarized in Table III-2 below.

3.03      The Government of Mali would make the proceeds of the IDA credit
and its own contribution available to the various executing agencies as loans
or budget allocations (grants), as shown in the Project Budget Plan in Table
III-3.  Budgetary grants are allocated for elements for which there is tra-
ditionally no direct cost recovery. In addition to the Project Agreement
between the District of Bamako, the Municipality of Mopti, and IDA, sub-
sidiary loan agreements would be entered into between the Government, the
District of Bamako and the Municipality of Mopti. Terms of the subsidiary
loans will be 7.5% interest rate repayable over 23 years with a 3-year grace
period. The subsidiary loan agreement with the District will cover all funds
on-lent by the Government which relate mainly to the sites and services and
upgrading components and to the improvement of municipal services, the costs
of which are to be recovered from the sources indicated in para 5.02. The
balance of project costs, which relates to items for which costs are not
normally recovered directly from beneficiaries, e.g., technical assistance,
studies, primary infrastructure, health and educational facilities and water
supply in Gao and Kayes, would be granted to executing agencies by budgetary
allocation, except for a MF 105 million loan (at 7.5% over 23 years) to the
Municipality of Mopti for purchase of garbage collection equipment.
3.04      To ensure prompt availability of counterpart funds it is proposed
that the Government of Mali should establish a revolving fund of US$230,000
at the beginning of the project. This is proposed as a condition of effec-
tiveness. During negotiations assurances were obtained that these funds
will be deposited in a special project account (in the BDM) as a condition
of effectiveness.

C. Procurement and Disbursement
3.05      Contracts for a total value of about US$4.7 million will be let on
the basis of international competitive bidding, in accordance with IDA guide-
lines for the procurement of:
(a) equipment and vehicles for (i) improvement of municipal
services in Bamako (US$1.5 million), (ii) municipal
services in Mopti (US$0.2 million), (iii) water supply
in Kayes (US$0.1 million), and
(b) civil works for major contracts for (i) on-site in-
frastructure for Magnambougou sites and services (US$1.4
million), (ii) on-site infrastructure for Magnambougou
upgrading (US$1.0 million), (iii) off-site water supply
for Magnambougou (US$0.5 million).
A margin of preference of 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is
lower, will be applied to domestic bidders offering domestically manufactured
goods. Local contractors will be given a preference of 7.5% in the evaluation
of tenders for civil works.
3.06      A large number of small contracts (totalling about US$2.5 million),
which would not be attractive to foreign suppliers or contractors, are
envisaged for the municipal services, community facilities, and secondary
cities components. These contracts would be procured on the basis of local
competitive bidding procedures. The appraisal mission reviewed the proce-
dures to be used and found them satisfactory. Labor for the clearing/repair
of drainage ditches and repair of standpipes (US$200,000) will be provided
by the technical services of the District whose labor force is under-employed
at present. Small equipment items costing less than US$50,000 each, which
will not in the aggregate total more than US$800,000 will be purchased after
solicitation of quotations from at least three suppliers. Building materials
and artisans loans worth US$1.5 million will be made in cash. Consultant
services (totalling about US$4.7 million) would be procured according to IDA
Guidelines.
3.07      Disbursements of the proceeds of the IDA credit will be made on
the following basis:
(a) 70% of expenditures for civil works,
(b) 100% of expenditures for equipment, vehicles and materials,
(c) 100% of expenditures on loans to beneficiaries for
construction and on credits to artisans, and
(d) 100% of expenditures for consultant and advisory
services.



-- 21 -
3.08      Disbursements will be ful]y documented, except for loans to bene-
ficiaries under (c) where disbursements will be against a certified statement
of expenditures for which the documentation will be retained by the executing
agency. These expenditures will be reflected in separate accounts which will
be audited b  independent auditors acceptable to the Association and sent to
the Bank within six months of the erid of each fiscal year. These arrangements
were agreed upon at negotiations. An advance of US$240,000 from the Project
Preparation Facility was made to prepare the Project during 1978 and a further
advance of US$240,000 has been made to continue project preparation for the
rest of 1978 and in 1979.
3.09      To maintain the momentum of project preparation, Government has
requested approval of retroactive financing to cover project related expendi-
tures totalling US$450,000 for technical assistance, vehicles and equipment
for the Project Unit necessary for project implementation before credit
effectiveness; these will be procured in accordance with project requirements.
3.10      A schedule of estimated disbursements of the IDA credits is pre-
sented in Table III-4. Any undisbursed balance at the end of the project
implementation period will be cance]led.

D. Implementation Schedule
3.11      Overall project implementation will take about four years (see
Chart III-1). Preliminary engineering including bill of quantities was
completed before appraisal. Detailed design and engineering will begin in
the third quarter of 1979. Housing consolidation by beneficiaries will be an
on-going activity following lot allocation. Disbursements will be made over
the period up to mid-1983 and the Closing Date will be December 30, 1983.
E. Selected Topics in Project Execution
Allocation Procedures
3.12       For the sites and services area the îligibility criteria for lots
and for loans are that applicants of lots A, A , and B:
(a) be a head of household residing in the city;
(b) own no other lot in the Bamako area (freehold or occupancy
permit);
(c) provide assurances to live on the lot; and
(d) earn no less than MF 15,000 ($34) and no more than
MF 55,000 (US$125) per household and per month in 1979
prices. These amounts will be reviewed periodically.
These criteria will be published in an official notice by the office of the
District of Bamako. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that
eligibility criteria will be as above. Lots will be allocated by a lottery
system. For type C lots, notice of sale will be publicly advertised.
3.13      Land tenure, lot transfers and eviction.  The District's Housing-
Directorate will give long-tery lease-purchase agreements to the beneficiaries
of residential lots types A, A and B and freehold titles to owners of C type
lots. Stalls and plots in markets will be rented to users. Lots for com-
munity facilities will be held by the District. Beneficiaries in the sites
and services and upgrading areas will be required to reside on their lots, but
may rent rooms. The lease will require that a house be erected on the lots
and will specify the period within which it should be built (one year) and
that the beneficiary live on the lot. Beneficiaries wishing to sell or
transfer lots in the sites and services areas within the lease period of
lot occupancy will return the lots to the Housing Directorate and receive
compensation for improvements made (cost of material plus an imputed cost

for labor). This condition will not apply to existing households in the
upgrading area. A clause enabling the Housing Directorate repossess the lots
and buildings in case of default will be written into housing loan agreements.
3.14      A few households in the upgrading area will need to be resettled
to make room for rights-of-way for new roads and community facilities. The
exact number will not be known until detailed design and engineering have
been completed, but it is not expected to exceed 5% of existing households.
The affected households will be compensated by Government for their structures
and will be given priority in the allocation of sites and services lots.
3.15      Community participation.  The final detailed engineering and design
for the upgrading area, including the precise alignment of roads and location
of infrastructure and community facilities, will be discussed with the site's
current residents. The neighborhood association and its chief will also be
consulted in the development of procedures for recovery of plot charges.
3.16      Because of the new features of this project in Mali, lot allocation
and transfer will be closely monitored by the Project Unit.
F. Accounts, Audits, Monitoring and Supervision
3.17      Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that each
executing agency will maintain separate project accounts and that the Project
Unit will compile consolidated project accounts. Assurances have also been
obtained that not later than six months after the close of each financial
year, suitable financial statements including cash flow statements and balance
sheets as of the year end reflecting the financial operations and position
of the principal project entities will be made available to IDA. These
financial statements will be audited by an auditor acceptable to IDA and a
report on the accounts and statements of each entity will be made available
to IDA no later than eight months after the close of each financial year by
an auditor acceptable to IDA.
3.18      The project will be monitored by the Project Unit to:  (a) test
whether the various project components are replicable and affordable for
intended beneficiaries, and (b) suggest ways of correcting observed weak-
nesses during implementation of the project.
3.19      Supervision.  About 96 man-weeks of Bank project supervision will
have to be programmed for the four year project implementation period (24
man-weeks per year). Supervision of the components in the secondary cities
will be minimal because the project provides only for purchase of equipment
for Mopti, and also because Western Africa Projects, Energy and Water Supply
Division (WAPEW) will assist in the supervision during preparation of its
project.

IV. EXECUTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
A. Administrative Reform
4.01      Mali is divided into eight regions.  Each region is headed by a
Governor who is the permanent representative of the Government in the region
and the leader of all civil servants in the region. The Bamako District was
given the status of a region in August 1978. In addition, responsibilities of
the Governors have been substantially increased by Government's recent deci-
sion to decentralize and regionalize the technical ministries. Whilst the
national services will retain their planning and programming functions, the
regional staff, under the authority of the Governors, will be responsible for
implementing projects. A result of this reform is that the Governor has now
both the District services and the regional departments under his authority.
- B. Execution
4.02      Overall responsibility for project execution within Bamako will
lie with the Governor of the District of Bamako who, as Governor of the
Region, is empowered to direct all regional Government services as well
as District services. A project agreement will be entered into between
the District, the Municipality of Mopti and IDA. A Project Unit will be
established within the Ministry of Interior to coordinate and supervise
all technical aspects of project implementation. The Project Director will
report directly to the Minister and will lead a team working in the regional
Government services and in the DistriLct services.
4.03      The Governor of Bamako wilL therefore be the focal point of all
project implementation work taking place in Bamako.
4.04      Implementation of the secondary cities components amounting to 5%
of total project costs, will also be coordinated by the Project Unit.
4.05      Virtually all works will be done by contractors and supervised by
the executing agencies mentioned below. Responsibilities for individual
project components are summarized below:

4.06      The proposed institutional framework has been tailored to fit the
recent administrative changes. The mission believes that these institutions
will be able, with help from the Project Unit technical assistance, to imple-
ment the proposed project.
C. The District of Bamako
4.07      The District is managed by a District Council chaired by the Gov-
ernor.  Its responsibilities are defined in the law of August 1978 and con-
cern inter alia: street maintenance, garbage collection, drainage/sewerage,
public lighting, water supply, public transport, taxes, land management and
retail markets. The Governor of the District is nominated by the Council of
Ministers. He is the permanent representative of the Chief of State and of
the Government and has under his authority (a) the regional services of
the ministries, and (b) the services of the District itself. Project compo-
nents in the Bamako District fall urider both services and will therefore be
under the Governor's authority.
D. The E'roject Unit
4.08      The Project Unit will report directly to the Minister of interior.
Its Director, has been appointed and has participated in negotiations. In
addition to local administrative staff consisting of engineers (2), accountants
(2), draftsmen (2), and secretaries (2), the Director will be assisted by six
experts (the project leader-administrator, a systems analyst, a municipal
management expert, a municipal engineer, a mechanic and a local building
materials expert) provided under the technical assistance program. The task
descriptions and personal profiles of these experts were reviewed at appraisal
and agreed with the Government.
4.09      The tasks of the Project IJnit will be to assist the services respon-
sible for project execution. Specifically, the Project Unit will (a) plan,
coordinate and supervise project implementation; (b) manage the legal and
financial aspects of the project (contracts, requests for disbursements); and
(c) monitor the performance of project elements.
E. Regional Government Services
Regional Directorate of Habitat
4.10      Under the administrative reform described in 4.01, a Regional
Directorate of Habitat has been established within the Governorate of the
District of Bamako with experienced staff, many of whom have worked with



- 28 -
the consultants on project preparation, drawn from the existing National
Directorate of Habitat in the Ministry of Public Works and the Municipal
Planning Office. It will have the responsibility, with technical assistance
from the Project Unit, for supervision of works on the upgrading and sites
and services components. With the technical assistance provided under the
project, it is considered that the Regional Directorate will be capable of
carrying out the tasks assigned to it under the project.
Regional Directorate of Taxes and Domain
4.11      The Regional Directorate of Taxes and Domain has been formed from
the existing National Directorate of Taxes in the Ministry of Finance. Its
functions include assessment of taxes and land registration.  It will be
responsible for preparation of the new municipal tax register, for which
aerial surveys were commissioned in May 1979. These elements will form the
basis of a cadastral survey of the city which is to be undertaken with the
help of technical assistance provided under the project.
Bamako Land Management Agency (CAFOBA)
4.12      As part of the strengthening of institutions in the shelter sector,
the Bamako Land Management Agency would be set up to manage all state owned
land in the Bamako region. The Regional Directorate of Taxes and Domain will
also have prime responsibility for the establishment of the Land Management
Agency (see para 2.30) which will be carried out in phases during project
execution, as follows:
(a)  First Phase (to be completed by June 30, 1980):  The
Regional Directorate of Taxes and Domain would establish
a project land registration unit within its Section of
Domain, with responsibility for registering land in the
project areas and establishing titles of ownership and
rights of occupation in the names of the beneficiaries.
During this period the National Directorate of Habitat will
complete and publish an outline structure plan for the
development of Bamako by December 1979 which will form the
basis of land policy within the District and will establish
preliminary guidelines for land use.
(b) Second Phase (to be completed by June 30, 1981): The
Regional Directorate of Taxes and Domain will extend the
procedures developed by the project land registration unit
to apply to the allocation of land throughout the District,
while the National Directorate of Habitat will commission
the Investment Programming Study envisaged under the project,
the results of which will provide a detailed land use and
development plan for the urban area, with administrative
procedures and draft decrees for the establishment of
CAFOBA.



- 29 -
(c) Third Phase (to be completed by June 30, 1982): estab-
lishment of CAFOBA as an autonomous agency under the
tutelage of the Ministry of Finance with sole powers of
land management within the District.
4.13      The phased establishment of CAFOBA will be monitored by the Project
Unit, which will provide technical assistance to the services concerned.
Regional Directorate of Water Resources and Energy
4.14      The Directorate of Water Resources and Energy (DHE) in the Ministry
of Industry is responsible for the major infrastructure works relating to
water and electricity. The Regional Directorate of DHE will supervise
execution of the off-site water, electricity and drainage components of the
project and the main drainage outlets in Niarela.
F. Services of the District
Technical Services Directorate (Voirie)
4.15      The District Maintenance Office (Voirie) which is responsible for
the provision and maintenance of urban services, has not been able to carry
out its functions effectively for many years, with the result that essential
services are seriously neglected and hygiene standards have deteriorated to
the point where they represent a health hazard in many areas of the city. In
part this is due to shortage of equipment and vehicle maintenance facilities,
but also to the rigidity of the existing organizational structure which
discourages delegation of authoritv and the acceptance of responsibility by
subordinates. To redress these problems the Voirie would be reorganized and
strengthened by the addition of suitable vehicle maintenance facilities,
improved operating procedures and training programs for technical staff.
The Department would be organized into three principal sections:
(a)  Studies, planning and control;
(b) Operations, subdivided into: (i) garbage collection and
cleaning of public areas; (ii) sanitation; (iii) street
maintenance; and (iv) building maintenance; and
(c) Maintèenance and workshops, subdivided into: (i) vehicle
maintenance; (ii) general mechanical maintenance; and
(iii) carpentry.
It will also be provided with a small administrative unit. The Directorate
would deal almost exclusively with operational and maintenance activities
rather than the execution of new works which would be entrusted to local
enterprises. An estimated total of 470 persons, which corresponds approxi-
mately to the present number employed by the Municipal Maintenance Office,
would be sufficient to staff the Directorate.



- 30 -
4.16      The reorganization, which would be carried out with the assistance
of the municipal engineer and supervising mechanic provided under the project,
would take place during the first year of project execution in order that the
new organization and facilities will be operating effectively before delivery
of new equipment for garbage collection and clearing of drainage ditches
(planned to take place at the end of 1980). During negotiations assurances
were obtained that the reorganization will be completed by June 30, 1980;
that suitable staff training programs will be instituted on a regular basis
thereafter and that a replacement fund will be established within the District
to ensure that replacement of vehicles and material will be financed.
Revenue Collection Services
4.17      This service will be responsible for collecting the new municipal
taxes (see para 5.10) on the basis of the tax register (rolls) to be prepared
by the Regional Directorate of Taxes and Domain (see para 4.11). The revenue
collection record in the District is not good; only about 60% of taxes
assessed have been collected on time in recent years. To improve this record
the service will be helped by the technical assistance provided under the
project, which will advise on collection procedures, staffing requirements
and training programs for tax collectors. Equipment and material necessary
to carry out these tasks will be included under the project.
District Housing Directorate
4.18      The Housing Directorate will be strengthened and staffed with a
manager, accounting staff (7) and collectors (4) and provided with technical
assistance to enable it to carry out its tasks under the project. It will
have a separate accounting system for resources and expenditures relating to
the project. The Housing Directorate will be responsible for: (a) compiling
and maintaining the individual files on applicants and beneficiaries of lots
in the upgraded and sites and services areas, as well as shopkeepers and
artisans of the market facilities; (b) pre-selection of beneficiaries on the
basis of eligibility criteria outlined in para 3.12; (c) administration of
the building loan program; (d) collection, with the assistance of the Revenue
Collection Service, of the lot charges and building loan repayments of the
sites and services and upgrading components as well as of the artisans credit
component.
4.19      The Directorate will grant loans and allocate lots by reference to
the decision of the Lot Allocation Committee to which it shall be responsible
for providing necessary data. The Directorate will liaise with the Regional
Directorate of Taxes and Domain (para 4.11) on matters relating to the estab-
lishment of land titles and recognition of occupation rights, which the Bureau
will transfer to beneficiaries as leaseholds at the time of signature of the
contracts. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the financial
surpluses of the Housing Directorate will be paid into a special account, the
use of which will be reviewed yearly by Government and IDA.

G. Other 'Services
4.20      Planning and programming functions are centralized in the Ministries.
Thus, the National Directorate of Habitat will be in charge of the investment
programming study for Bamako and for the preparation study for the second
project. It will also be responsible Eor the promotion of local building
materials (para 2.23).
4.21      The Regional Directorates of Water Resources and Energy of Kayes
and Gao will be under the administrative responsibility of the Governors of
these regions. They will be responsible for the water supply components
provided under the project (para 2.25 and 2.26). They will be assisted by
the municipal engineer provided under the project (para 2.27).
4.22      The Municipality of Mopti has a Municipal Maintenance Office which
is responsible for construction and maintenance of municipal buildings, as
well as maintenance of the streets. There is also a Sanitation Service
responsible for garbage and sewage collection. This service will be in
charge of the garbage and sewage component provided under the project.
4.23      With the technical assistance provided under the project, it is the
mission's judgment that these services, reinforced as described above, should
be capable of carrying out the tasks assigned to them.
V. COST RECOVERY AND REPLICABILITY
A. Cost Recovery
5.01      The following principles of cost recovery are to be applied for the
various elements of the project:
(a) those costs which are ordinarily recovered by public
authorities through user charges or tariffs will be
similarly recovered (e.g., primary infrastructure for
water, electricity, markets);
(b) urban services provided by the District will be recovered
via special taxes (e.g., garbage collection, street
cleaning, water from standpipes); and
(c) all site development-related costs, comprising on-site
infrastructure, building loans, design, engineering and
supervision will be borne directly by beneficiaries.

5.03      Under the project the level of cost recovery will be much higher
than previously attained in the Districlt's earlier land developemnt efforts.
All allocable costs of the upgrading and sites and services components will
be recovered directly from project beneficiaries. This means 60% of total
project costs will be directly recovered through lot charges and loan repay-
ments from beneficiaries, user charges and the new garbage collection and
municipal maintenance taxes. Unrecovered costs represent mainly technical
assistance and studies (30%) and primary infrastructure and community
facilities (10%).
5.04      Lot charges in the sites and services area will be differentiated
to take into account location, lot accessibility, size of lot and the form
of tenure (freehold/lease-purchase) applicable to2different lois.  Fou5 price
categories have been distinguished: (i) A (320 m ) lots and A (160 m ) are
the sm~llest and will be leased at prices about 10% below cost; (ii)   lots
(375 m ) will be leased about 15% above cost; and (iii) C lots (500 m ) will
be sold freehold at market prices. The net sales proceeds of the larger lots
which have been estimated by reference to current market prices prevailing in
the city, will be used to reduce the prices of the smallest lots which will
be available to the lowest income groups of the target population. Actions
to be taken under the project, namely the development of the sites and ser-
vices area and the establishment of the Land Management Agency, will greatly
increase the supply of land for housing and thereby lower prices.
5.05      A downpayment of 10% of the total price will be required for
leasehold lots on the sites and services area. Payment of the downpayment
will also entitle the beneficiary to a construction loan, the amount of
which would vary according to the beneficiary's ability to pay the combined
monthly payments for the lot and construction loan, but which will, in any
event, be limited to a ceiling of MF 165,000, adequate to purchase materials
to construct two rooms in banco. No downpayments will be required in
upgrading areas. The loan balance for both lot and building materials will
be paid through monthly installments at 12% per annum over a maximum of 20
years. The financial charge of 12% covers the on-lending rate of 7.5% plus
a 2% charge for a risk reserve and a 2.5% charge to cover administrative
expenses.
5.06      The proposed charge to beneficiaries is positive in real terms when
related to past and expected future rates of inflation, which average 10% per
annum. There is now no regular source of housing finance in Mali, since in
1976 BDM terminated its subsidized program to upper income groups (terms were
6% per annum interest, repayable over Up to 20 years). The commercial banks
lend short term at rates currently varying between 10% and 12%. The proposed
rate is acceptable to Government.



- 34 -
5.07      Recovery of the costs of retail markets will be through stall
fees for the covered stalls in the marketplace, and rents for the shops and
artisans' lots alongside the market. Stall fees are based on current market
rates, which like shop and lot rentals, are sufficient to recover costs over
ten years at 12% interest rate. Loans to artisans for construction of work-
shops on the 50 artisans' lots located beside the markets will be made avail-
able under the project to a maximum of MF 275,000 (US$625) per lot, which
is sufficient to build a workshop on a lot. An additional 400 loans of up
to MF 55,000 (US$125) will be available to artisans to finance purchases of
materials or small equipment and tools. Terms of the loans to artisans, which
Government has agreed should be similar to terms currently available from com-
mercial banks, will be at 12% interest, repayable over a maximum of ten years,
for construction loans, and over a maximum three years for materials and tools.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that terms and conditions of
cost recovery from beneficiaries will be as above.
B.  Affordability and Income Distribution
5.08      In the sites and services area the minimum lot option plus a con-
struction loan sufficient to self-build two rooms in banco (adobe) would be
affordable to about 85% of the population of Bamako. The target population,
lot options and affordability are shown in Table V-1. Income distribution is
based on two socio-economic surveys.  Only regular and fixed incomes have
been taken into account, representing a conservative estimate of income in
Bamako. Half of the beneficiaries would be selected from households whose
incomes are between the 15th and 35th percentiles of income in Bamako, and
85% of the beneficiaries would have incomes below the median city income.
For the lowest income groups no more than 18% of income would need to be
allocated for housing. One of the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries
(see para 3.12) will be that their income falls within the percentile ranges
shown in Table V-1.
5.09      Lot charges and affordability in the upgrading area are shown in
Table V-2.  Monthly payments would amount to about 7% of income, or 8% if a
house improvement loan is included. Charges for improving the smallest lot
will be affordable by the 5th percentile.

C.  Municipal Taxes
5.10      The municipal tax system derives its revenue mainly (65%) from
taxes on comi-ercial activities. It is proposed that costs of the improve-
ments to municipal services be recovered through the introduction of mainten-
ance and garbage collection taxes assessed on rental values of properties on
a city-wide basis, covering some 50,,000 residential properties and about
1,000 commercial and industrial properties. The new taxes would be progres-
sive, distinguishing between categories of type and size of house and between
three city zones, peripheral areas being assessed at a lower rate than
central areas due to the lower level of services in the former. Tax rates
would be 2% of rental values of residential and commercial properties for the
maintenance tax and 3% of rental values of residential properties for the
garbage collection tax. The phased introduction of these taxes would take
place over a three year period, commencing with aerial photography in 1979,
followed by the establishment of property registers and rental assessments
leading to tax recovery in 1981. During negotiations assurances have been
obtained that new taxes will be introduced and enforced as described above.
5.11       The revenue yield from the! new taxes would cover the debt servicing
and operating costs of the improvements in municipal services financed under
the project if a recovery factor of only 60% were to be achieved. This is
the level currently attained within the District and has been assumed for the
first year of recovery in 1981. Thereafter the recovery factor is expected
to increase.
D. Project Replicability
5.12       The cost recovery mechanisms described in the preceding paragraphs
would generate surpluses to the District Housing Directorate (cumulative total
US$1 million by 1985). This will serve as the basis for an expanded basic ser-
vices program by the District. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that Government will transmit any new housing program to the Bank for comments.
In 1978, the Region of Bamako had a population of 470,000, growing at approx-
irnately 9% per year, about 40,000 persons or about 5,000 families per year.
If a shelter program were to address the needs of families below the poverty
threshold (40% of the population), t:hen approximately 1,500 lots per year
would lhave to be provided. In addition to these needs, an infrastructure
program must also upgrade living conditions for the estimated 25% of the
population currently living in squatter areas. This could be financed through
a variety of sources including the surpluses of the Housing Directorate, the
size of which will depend on full cost recovery from beneficiaries. The
balance could come from other goverrimental resources such as the National
Fund for Housing, or from additional external aid. While this analysis is
very tentative it does provide an indication that the Government could make
a sizeable impact on the housing plight of the lower income groups without
putting undue strain on the national budget.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
6.01      The project would have an important demonstration effect, particu-
larly with regard to the policies that it introduces in: (i) cost recovery
for most elements of the project; (ii) least cost solutions for services
provided; (iii) encouragement of the use of indigenous building materials;
and (iv) improvement of the tax base of the city. The appropriateness of
project design is shown by the fact that 75% of project costs would benefit
households with incomes below the poverty threshold.
6.02      The direct benefits of the proposed project would be seen in:
(a) the provision of low cost essential services in the sites and services
and upgrading areas to benefit a population of about 45,000 persons, some 70%
of whom have incomes below the urban poverty threshold; (b) the improvement
of sanitary conditions in the city of Bamako affecting the whole population,
but mainly directed towards the poorer sections of the community; (c) the
employment generated by the artisan credit and local building materials
components; and (d) the provision of improved water supply and sanitary
conditions in secondary cities.
6.03       In the longer term, benefits would also arise from the institu-
tional developments proposed under the project, particularly: (a) the
establishment of a Land Management Agency to facilitate the provision of
land for urban development; (b) the extension of progressive property taxes
throughout the city to recover the costs of improved urban services and
augment the resources of the city of Bamako; and (c) the strengthening of
the services of the District, particularly housing and technical services.
6.04      The emphasis placed on affordability and on cost recovery would
enable the project to demonstrate the replicability of providing essential
urban services.
6.05      The economic rate of return for the sites and services and upgrad-
ing components, which represent 42% of project cost, is estimated at 22%
(paras 6.06-6.08). Rates of return were not computed for other project
components due to difficulties in quantifying their benefits. Alternative
indicators of the economic merits of these components are discussed in paras
6.09 to 6.12 below.
Sites and Services and Upgrading
6.06      The valuation of benefits in the sites and services and upgrading
areas is based upon estimates of increases in property values brought about
by the improvements made under the project. Rental values in the project
area and in areas with similar location characteristics were based on surveys
carried out during project preparation. The following estimates of rental
values were used for calculation of benefits:

Sites and services, Magnambougou          Not applicable              3,100
Upgrading, Magnambougou                          625                  3,100
6.07      The following project costs were included in the analysis:
(a)  site development costs including survey and design costs,
on-site infrastructure costs, the share of off-site infra-
structure costs allocable to project sites, supervision
costs and physical contingencies;
(b) the cost of building materials and the estimated cost of
labor for housing construction and improvements; and
(c)  annual operation and maintenance cost estimated at 3% of
total development cost.
6.08      The sites and services component would yield an estimated economic
rate of return of 19% and the upgrading component 26%.  The combined economic
rate of return of both components would be 22%. Sensitivity analysis shows
that an increase of 10% in benefits or a decrease of 10% in costs increases
the rates of return by two and three percentage points for sites and services
and upgrading, respectively. A 10% decrease in benefits 1/ or increase in
costs, decreases the rates of return by two percentage points for sites and
services and by three percentage points for upgrading.
Assistance to the Informal Sector
6.09      A total of about 900 jobs are expected to be generated in the
project areas by this component. The average incremental cost per job is
estimated at about US$760. This cost is below the urban poverty capital/labor
threshold for Mali (US$900).
District Services
6.10      The quality of the environlrLent in the city would be significantly
improved by the garbage collection, drainage, water supply and public
sanitation components of the project, while the municipality's ability to
maintain these services will be greatly increased by the reorganization and
re-equipment of the technical services departments. The proposed solutions
have been selected after comparison with more capital intensive alternatives,
and the least cost solutions have been adopted.  Whilst this component will

result of the increase in supply brought about directly by the
upgrading and sites and services components of the project if the
elasticity of demand is unity.

benefit the whole of the city's population by improving health conditions,
it will mainly benefit the poorer sections of the community since the pro-
posed extension of service will be located mainly in lower income neighbor-
hoods.
Secondary Cities
6.11      The proposed measures would improve sanitary conditions and essen-
tial water supplies in these cities, which, particularly in the dry season,
will help to reduce mortality of people and livestock.
Urban Poverty Impact
6.12      The upgrading and sites and services components of the project will
benefit about 32,000 of the estimated 100,000 of the urban poor in need of
shelter services in Bamako. Approximately 80% of beneficiaries in the sites
and services area, and 60% of beneficiaries in the upgrading area, are below
the poverty level for urban households (estimated at MF 30,250 per month per
household in 1979, corresponding to the 39th percentile in the Bamako household
income distribution) (See Annex 4, p.2). In addition, the improvement in
municipal services will have a broad impact on the urban poor, who represent
about 50% of the beneficiaries from this component. An estimated 75% of the
total project cost would directly benefit the urban poverty group in terms of
goods and services. Of the credit amount of US$12 million, the urban poverty
lending is 75%, or US$9 million.
Project Risks
6.13      As the first urban development project in Mali, the project has a
number of new features which are subject to risk, although Government has
expressed its commitment to these initiatives which it sees as being closely
aligned with the administrative reforms being carried out within the country
(para. 4.01). Three main areas of risk can be identified: (a) the institu-
tional arrangements for project execution, (b) cost recovery, and (c) con-
formity of the ultimate beneficiaries to the initial target population,
which are discussed in paras 6.14-6.16. Other areas of potential risk have
been minimized through detailed discussion and agreement with Government
and other parties affected by the project. Design standards for sites and
services and upgrading have been determined after detailed analysis of a
range of alternatives and are officially acceptable, affordable by the
beneficiaries and conform to the expressed needs of the target population
groups derived from surveys in the field.
6.14      Regarding the institutional arrangements, the complexity and multi-
sectoral nature of the project will require efficient management and close
coordination among the different executing agencies. The transfer of staff
from the central Government services to the regionalized services is gradually
taking place. To help ensure efficient management, the project provides for
a Project Unit reporting directly to the Minister of Interior and supported
by appropriate technical assistance to strengthen and develop the institutions
involved in project execution.



- 41 -
6.15      Two of these institutions, the District revenue collection services
and the Housing Directorate, are essential to cost recovery, and failure on
their part to operate effectively would affect replicability. The Land
Management Agency, although not critical to the project itself, is also
essential to its replicability through increasing the supply of land. It
is therefore extremely important for the Government to devote continued
attention to these institutions.
6.16      The replicability of the project depends upon the effective intro-
duction of the cost recovery mechanisms described in Chapter V. The intro-
duction of lot charges and building 'Loan repayments is relatively new to the
sectors of the population to be served by the sites and services and upgrad-
ing components. Surveys and discussions with project communities indicate,
however, that beneficiaries are prepared to pay for security of tenure and
the provision of essential services. The Housing DÎrectorate will have to
work closely with the local community to ensure recovery of costs. Where
District services are concerned, faiLure to collect the taxes proposed will
result in lower standards of-service, inability to meet debt repayment obli-
gations and a need for subsidy from the central Government.  The importance
attached to the rapid introduction of the new taxes cannot therefore be
overemphasized.  However, the risk is considered worth taking in view of
the expressed willingness to pay for improved services and the opportunity
that the new taxes provide for reducing state subsidies to the urban sector.
6.17      As regards conformity of the ultimate beneficiaries to the initial
target population for the sites and services component, project design reduces
risks to an acceptable level by both (a) short-, and (b) long-term measures:
(a) In the short run, (i) site location (both social and spatial), lot
size, level of services and type of tenure, would be designed to respond to
needs of the low-income population and are not expected to be taken up by
higher income groups; (ii) the proposed project will itself satisfy about
half of new land demand arising during execution; (b) In the long run, the
institution building component proposed under the project will greatly assist
the Government in increasing the supply of urbanized land.

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the following assurances and confirmation of
agreements were obtained:
(a)  transfer of the land for the sites and services and
upgrading areas from the State to the District of Bamako
(paras 2.07 and 2.12) before lots are allocated;
(b)  creation of the Land Management Agency CAFOBA, during
project execution, with procedures, powers and respon-
sibilities satisfactory to IDA (para 4.12);
(c)  the proceeds of the credit will be on-lent to the District
of Bamako and the Municipality of Mopti on terms satisfac-
tory to IDA (para 3.03);
(d)  adequate budgetary provisions and staffing will be made
available to the schools and health facilities provided
under the project (para 2.07);
(e)  lot sizes and service standards will be as described in this
report (paras 2.07-2.10);
(f)  (i) each executing agency will maintain separate project
accounts and the Project Unit will prepare consolidated
project accounts, (ii) financial statements and audit
reports for each executing agency will be submitted to
IDA not later than eight months after the close of each
financial year, and all executing agencies will be audited
by auditors acceptable to IDA (para 3.17);
(g)  any new housing program financed by the Government will
be transmitted to the Bank for comments (para 5.12);
(h)  establishment of household selection, lot allocation cri-
teria, and terms and conditions of lot sales satisfactory
to IDA and will be organized as follows:
(i) a system of monthly charges for infrastructure
improvements and housing loans will be instituted
(para 5.04 and 5.05);
(ii)  surpluses from District Housing Directorate accounts
will be deposited in a separate account (para 4.19);
and
(iii)  garbage collection and improvements in municipal sanitary
conditions will be recovered through a new municipal
property tax (para 5.10).



- 43 -
(i)  establishment of a replacement fund within the District to
ensure that replacement of vehicles and materials will be
financed (para 2.15).
7.02      As a condition of effectiveness it is proposed that the subsidiary
credit agreement between the Government and the District of Bamako should be
signed (para 3.03) and that the Government should deposit part of the Mali
counterpart fund in a revolving fund (para 3.04).
7.03      Subject to the above assurances, the project is suitable for an IDA
credit of US$12 million to the Governnent of Mali.
