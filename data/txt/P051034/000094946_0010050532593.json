satisfactory, with\n            sustainability likely. The credit played a critical role in\n            assisting the government to implement the structural reforms\n            covered by the Second Structural Adjustment Credit Project\n            (report no. P7165), most notably in the financial, energy,\n            and health sectors. It was, however, less effective in other\n            areas. Overall, both World Bank and Borrower performances\n            were rated satisfactory. Lessons learned concern: designing\n            appropriate capacity indicators to reflect some future\n            desirable level of performance; aptly gauging the pace of\n            change when using a technical assistance credit to finance\n            institutional reform; avoiding having the International\n            Development Association finance a daily newspaper as an\n            attempt make government policies more palatable to the\n            public; keeping better records for lending operations to\n            maintain institutional memory; and engaging the government\n            early in order to gradually transfer direct project\n            implementation to government units."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
