Reform\n            expectations in this case were unrealistically high given\n            the relatively short period of project implementation, and\n            even more so relative to the Bank's limited\n            contribution to the utility's overall investment\n            program. Second, assessments of \"reform readiness\"\n            and \"political commitment\" are necessary, but not\n            sufficient to guarantee implementation of complex reforms. A\n            possible response is to require more upfront reform actions\n            before commencing the project. Another approach relates to\n            the first lesson cited above: a more appropriate link\n            between the reform objectives, and the lending instrument\n            would help avoid the inconsistency, and tension between\n            reform implementation and implementation of physical\n            investments, inherent in operations structured along the\n            lines of this project. It is appropriate to note the\n            consultations held between the Bank, the Government, and\n            reforming states in 2003 on lessons from early reform\n            experiences. The consultations, which have been reflected in\n            the new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), focused on how to\n            identify key prerequisites for reform; how to design reform\n            processes with credible approaches to inevitable political\n            issues; and, how the Bank might rethink its rules of\n            engagement to maximize the value of its support to India.\n            While, in a sense, these lessons have already been learned,\n            they were significantly informed by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) experience."}, "docdt": "2005-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
