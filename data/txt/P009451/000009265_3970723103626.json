objectives would\n            be to expand and reinforce the transmission and distribution\n            system of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) to\n            meet forecast demand at least cost; to stabilize system\n            voltage; to increase system reliability; to reduce power\n            losses in transmission and distribution; and to strengthen\n            BPDB's financial operations. The project would comprise\n            erection of 582 km (kilometers) of 132-kV (kilovolt) lines;\n            extension of sixteen 132-kV substations; extension of\n            low-voltage distribution networks in fourteen towns;\n            installation of meters and metering equipment; and technical\n            assistance to the BPDB."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
