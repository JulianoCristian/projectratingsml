for Regional\n            Integration Project for Grenada received a moderately\n            satisfactory outcome rating with a moderate risk to\n            development. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            moderately satisfactory performance ratings. There were two\n            restructurings that took place throughout this project. The\n            results of the restructuring are as follows: the project\u0092s\n            indicators were modified to align them with the project\u0092s\n            outcomes and outputs, an extension of the closing date of\n            credit agreements for Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia to\n            align them with St. Vincent and accommodate the closing date\n            to the completion of activities for the two projects. The\n            project was then restructured again to extend the closing\n            date of all credits by six months and extend the closing\n            date of all credits by six months. There are several lessons\n            learned from this project and are as follows: (1) Too broad\n            a design risks to diminish/distort the focus of a project\n            during implementation. (2) Adequate project preparation time\n            versus other considerations must be explicit. (3) A regional\n            approach for Information and Communications Technologies\n            (ICT) projects for small island states shows strengths and\n            weaknesses to be considered at the time of design. (4)\n            Importance of establishing mechanisms to generate and\n            maintain countries\u0092 commitment to the Project, throughout\n            the project. (5) Good project management is key. (6)\n            Importance of providing training to successfully achieve the\n            PDO. Training of stakeholders is key to ensure that Project\n            activities are implemented and outcomes are achieved during\n            the life of the Project. (7) Continuous training and\n            awareness building is crucial to successfully implement\n            legislation, after the Project\u0092s completion. (8) Governance\n            arrangements can significantly contribute to successful\n            implementation: Finding the appropriate institution to\n            champion a reform or a new system can be critical to its\n            rapid success. (9) Need for implementation of the national\n            ICT policies in order to support E-Government for Regional\n            Integration Project outcomes. (10) Project coordination\n            affects implementation. The existence of competing projects\n            required extensive consultations and slowed implementation\n            down. (11) A programmatic approach should be considered to\n            support ICT projects."}, "docdt": "2014-12-29T15:50:05Z"}
