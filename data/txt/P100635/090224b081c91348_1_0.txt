                         government applications that apply economies of scale.

                         Note: this ISR also covers P117087 (EGRIP-SVG, APL2 for St. Vincent and the Grenadines).

                         This ISR is filed to document the implementation support mission in January 2013 and subsequent discussions with the OECS Secretariat and the Regional E-Government Unit
                         (REGU), primarily regarding an extension and restructuring for EGRIP.

                         The project, whose current closing date is August 31st, 2013, is in full implementation mode. There has been a good acceleration of implementation, with disbursements increasing
                         from 32% in September 2012 to 66% in May 2013 (65% for P100365 and 68% for P111087). The commitment rate has reached 98%. This improvement is due to the strong work of
                         the project team on the ground, as well as progress in line with the nature of eGovernment projects, which are front-loaded with lower-cost consultancies and back-loaded with

                         higher-cost ICT applications.

                         Three main eGovernment systems are slated to be implemented in the coming months: (a) a jointly procured eTax filing system to allow businesses and citizens to file their taxes
                         online; (b) a regional eTendering system for Pharmaceuticals to automate EGRIP countries’ joint procurement of medications; and (c) a Multi-Purpose ID system that would provide
                         the citizens in EGRIP countries with a unique personal identifier across the region. The latter is particularly relevant in view of the economic union in the Eastern Caribbean.
