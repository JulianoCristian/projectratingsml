                         Note: this ISR also covers P117087 (EGRIP-SVG, APL2 for St. Vincent and the Grenadines).

                         This ISR is filed to document the (1) implementation support mission undertaken in December 2013 via VC and (2) the joint implementation support and implementation completion
                         mission in St. Lucia during January 16 - 22, 2014. It is the last ISR for this project, which is slated to close on February 28th, 2014.

                         The project was restructured in June 2013 to extend the closing date by 6 months and cancel activities to reallocate funds to prioritized eGovernment systems. It is currently
                         undertaking the last deliverables and activities, and gearing down its implementation for closure at the end of February 2014. Disbursement rates have reached high 99th percentiles.
                         The Procurement Plan is completed.

                         The project will close effectively fully disbursed, having implemented, among other deliverables, an eTax Filing system through which citizens and businesses in the four countries
                         can file their taxes online, a regionally harmonized multi-purpose e-ID system, with which persons in the four countries receive a regionally unique ID number, a regional procurement
                         system for pharmaceuticals, which allows all OECS countries to electronically procure pharmaceuticals together, and a harmonized suite of eGovernment legislation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) process to evaluate the outputs and outcomes of the project has begun with the January 2014 mission to St. Lucia. The contracts,
                         warranties and maintenance agreements for the eGovernment systems are being handed over to the Governments of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica and
                         Grenada, as well as to the OECS Secretariat. The Secretariat intends to bring on board an eGovernment Specialist who will be tasked with following up on eGovernment activities
                         emanating out of EGRIP.
