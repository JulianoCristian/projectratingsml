                         This ISR is filed as a result of the mid-term review mission that took place from October 10-17, 2011 with a follow up visit on December 1-2, 2011. The e-Government for Regional
                         Integration Project (EGRIP) has transitioned to full implementation mode. Work is ongoing for the development of e-government applications to be implemented under most of the
                         sub-components of the project, as well as activities related to legal and regulatory framework and project monitoring and evaluation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Discussions are underway on the possible alignment of project closing dates for the four participating countries. EGRIP is financed as a horizontal APL with two projects: 1) P100635,
                         for Dominica, Grenada and St. Lucia, with a closing date of June 30, 2012; and 2) P117087, for St. Vincent and the Grenadines under P117087, with a closing date of August 31,
                         2013. The vast majority of activities is pooled and implemented as a single project with contracts split among the four participating countries.

                         Amendment and simplification of the monitoring and evaluation framework. Several indicators in the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework devised for EGRIP during project
                         preparation in 2007 are not reflective of project outputs and outcomes in 2011 and in some instances the data are too difficult to collect. A revised M&E framework is being proposed
                         to facilitate collection of baseline data and updates of indicators at the country level.
