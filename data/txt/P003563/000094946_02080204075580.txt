3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Project's original objectives, as set out in the SAR, were to develop China's feed sector by (a) the
alleviation of supply constraints of critical feed ingredients, (b) improving and expanding the utilization of
agro-industrial byproducts for use as high-quality livestock feeds, (c) improving the organizational
efficiency of the feed sector through specialization and integration, and (d) the restructuring of project
enterprises to effect greater corporate efficiency and commercialization. These objectives were based on the
findings of a major study on the animal feed sector that preceded project identification. The study was
conducted and sponsored by the World Bank and the National Feed Industry Office (NFIO), the agency
responsible for providing policy and investment guidance to the feed sector, under the Ministry of
Agriculture (MoA).
3 2 Revised Objective:
The original project objectives remained unchanged during project implementation despite the change of the
implementing agency. However, during the MTR, the project activities were broadened in response to
changing feed sector developments. In particular, the project scope was expanded to finance not only feed
production but also procurement of livestock by vertically integrating project enterprises. As a result,
vertically integrating project enterprises could now be financed under the project to link livestock
production, processing and marketing. At project completion, five out of the fourteen enterprises were
adopting vertical integration (see Annex 9).
Assessment of Objectives:
The original objectives were clear and continues to be responsive to the China's feed and livestock sectors'
circumstances and the country's development priorities. In China, the average per capita consumption of
meats and other livestock products continues to increase at a rapid clip, and so does the demand for animal
feed. However, the project had overestimated the demand for high-quality livestock feeds by the livestock
sector. At the time of the study of the animal feed sector and even at the onset of project preparation,
modernization was expected to be based on Ministry of Agriculture initiatives. At appraisal, however, the
path of feed sector modernization depended more on private sector judgments on demand for their output,
and needed to be reflected in the loan size. The Asian financial crisis and its negative effect on Chinese
livestock exports and price of feed imports exacerbated the demand situation. The revision in project scope
at MTR addressed some of the needs of the growing private modem feed enterprises in China, for example,
their need to be more vertically integrated because of input standardization issues.
3.3 Original Components:
The seven components in the SAR included: (a) Integrated Feed and Livestock Production, (b) Feed
Additives Manufacture, (c) Feed Processing Equipment, (d) Enhanced-Protein Feed Product Synthesis, (e).
Integrated Protein Feed Crop Production, (f) Feed Commodity Wholesale Marketing, and (g) Feed-sector
Strengthening. The first six components comprised a number of subprojects (financial intermediation of
non-SOE enterprises  in the six areas), while the last component supported the establishment of the
Ministry of Agriculture Feed Industry Center (MAFIC) which was termed China Feed Industry Center in
the SAR (see Annex 10). The China Agricultural Development Trust and Investment Company (CADTIC)
was the financial intermediary.
China Animal Feed Sector Study (Grey Cover Report No 19022-CHA), World Bank, June 24, 1993.
The term non-SOE enterprises means companies which have a mmonty-state ownership. At the time of approval, there were few fully pnvate
companies m the feed sector.
-2 -



3.4 Revised Components:
In January 1998, the State Council disbanded CADTIC for its "weak financial positions" (see MOF letter
on file). However, at the time no project funds had been disbursed. A replacement financial intermediary,
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), was identified by the Bank and GOC, and the project was renegotiated
in 1998. ABC developed a list of project enterprises, which was agreed with the Bank. The total project
cost was re-estimated at US$60.7 million (see Annex 2, Table 2a.). The fourteen project enterprises were
grouped into 3 components, namely (i) Vertically Integrated Feed and Livestock Production; (ii) Protein
Concentrate Milling; and (iii) Feed Additives and Feed Mineral Production.
Assessment of Design:
Most importantly, the project design ushered private sector participation in the animal feed sector in China.
This was a desirable path to bring innovation and sector modernization without burdening the government
with capital investments and risks. A feed sector study that provided a set of priority investment guidelines
for feed sector development indicated the priority areas under the project, and was technically appropriate.
The enterprises financed under the project were to provide a leadership role in these priority areas.
However, the project institutional aspects were developed in a hurry. Only at the project appraisal review,
Bank management had instructed the Task Team to redesign the project from a directed-loan operation to a
demand-driven financing operation, aimed at supporting non-SOE enterprises. This appropriately made it
easier to focus project resources on viable units and help the industry become more commercially oriented.
Rapid changes in institutional aspects were undertaken changing the implementing agency, the components,
and the subproject pipeline, but many other features of the project, such as the loan size and review process
of sub-borrower selection, were left unchanged. These weakened the project. What was appropriate for a
directed-loan operation was possibly inadequate for a private sector development type of operation. The
financial intermediary plays a central role in such an operation and the choice of CADTIC was
unfortunate, because it was relatively new and possibly did not have the depth of resources required for
such an innovative role in the sector. In 1998, many of these issues were redressed with ABC taking over
as the financial intermediary. Its deeper understanding of the sector led to the support of those areas where
commercial enterprises could flourish, and sub-borrowers who could benefit from dollar-denominated loan
fmancing.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry is rated unsatisfactory. The project did not receive a QAG review. As mentioned above, the
technical aspects of the project were well prepared, and based on a feed sector study that provided a set of
priority investment guidelines for feed sector development. However, the structure of the livestock sector,
its pace of development, and, consequently, its demand for high-quality feed (particularly from the many
individual/small scale entities) were not fully taken into account into the design at appraisal. In addition,
because of the last minute changes, due diligence was inadequate in the choice of the financial intermediary
jointly selected by the Bank and the GOC to implement the project. The switch from a directed loan
operation by MOA to a financial intermediation operation by a relatively new institution CADTIC brought
a different level of risky-ness to the operation. The loan size did not reflect the lack of demand for
high-quality feed nor the risky-ness from switching to a financial intermediation operation. The market for
the modem feed producers developed slowly and they found little reason to borrow dollar-denominated
loans. The preparation effort failed to anticipate either of the developments. In 1998, the project
institutional aspects were entirely recast. The new financial intermediary, ABC, appreciated the risk and
chose sub-borrowers wisely reflecting both the demand and cost-of-financing (dollar versus local currency
loans).  Lastly, the institutional strengthening component, which supported the establishment of a
self-financed feed sector development center, MAFIC, although not directly financed by the Bank, was well
designed.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project outcome is rated satisfactory, despite the disbursement of only 15 percent of the original IBRD
loan at SAR, and a much smaller project output than originally anticipated. The rating of the achievement
of objective is based on the project achieving the SAR qualitative objective of sector modernization and the
quantitative targets made at MTR, which led to among other things partial loan cancellation.
The project addressed priority objectives for the feed sector, as outlined in the SAR and followed
throughout implementation, namely, (a) vertically integrated feed and livestock production, (b) protein
concentrate and compound feed production, and (c) feed additives and feed mineral production, (d)
enhanced-protein feed synthesis, and, (e) specialty (aquatic) feed production. The enterprises financed
under the project are providing a leadership role in these project objectives.
As envisaged in the SAR, the project ushered private sector participation in the animal feed sector in China.
All project enterprises are privately-owned; operate under market-oriented corporate management; own
state-of-the-art production equipment and facilities; practice stringent quality control; and have been
developing strong marketing programs and demonstrated financial and economic viability except
enterprises still under start-up production (see Sections 4.3 and 4.4). Several enterprises are preparing for
ISO-9000 accreditation.
In parallel with the qualitative structural change in the sector, the project has mainly achieved its output
targets revised at MTR, based on the reduced project scope and investment plan. Apart from the financial
intermediation targets, other targets achieved include: the incorporation of innovative technologies (135
percent of target), feed industry information exchange through MOA (145 percent of target), degree of
vertical integration by project enterprise (54 percent of target), and feed production capacity building (91
percent of target). See detailed information in Annex 1.
The project facilitated the development of regulatory and policy framework for the feed sector at the
central level, and provided technical support to the sector through the national feed industry center. The
project preparation contributed greatly to the priority of the sector investment needs. The project objectives
were in line with the Fourth and Fifth 5-Year Plans (1990-1995 and 1996-2000) for livestock and feed
sector development. Though no Bank loan was provided for the establishment of the Ministry of
Agriculture Feed Industry Center (MAFIC), support was provided in the planning of MAFIC's as a
financially sustainable agency, and arranging for bilateral assistance. MAFIC has developed intro an
important animal feed sector support institution, providing technical services and training to the feed
industry in China (See Annex 10).
The project achieved significant benefits for both borrowing feed mills and farmers. The project directly
benefited project enterprises by increasing and upgrading their output capacity, but also indirectly benefited
livestock owners' access to improved feeds for livestock and aquaculture production. Furthermore, the
project also contributed to poverty reduction. Although not a specific project objective, most of project
enterprises are in poverty-designated county areas and contributing to rural poverty alleviation by means of
rural employment generation through contract farming and feed mill employment of local workers. The
project had provided 2,410 new job opportunities to the local farmers.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The project has been generally successful in achieving its design capacities and expected output targets
assigned during the MTR. The total incremental design capacity from project supported enterprises is at
- 4 -



some 908,000 tpa (equivalent to 1% of the current national feed production), that comprised 529,000 tpa
of protein concentrates, 275,000 tpa of compound and pelleted feeds, and 104,000 tpa of feed additives,
and has been fully achieved at the project completion. Of the 14 project enterprises, 11 were at various
stages of production by the project closing date of December 31, 2001, with three enterprises still under
start-up production. The total incremental feed production from 14 enterprises was about 633,580 tpa at
project completion, that had reached 70 percent of the designed capacity.
Vertically Integrated Feed and Livestock Production (3 enterprises, total investment cost US$11.23
million, 21% of the total project costs). This component comprises vertically integrated enterprises engaged
in compound and pelleted feed milling using fully automated feed formulation equipment. The enterprises
are at various stages of vertical integration. Some units use their own products to feed enterprise-owned
livestock (pigs, poultry, dairy cattle) for extra value-added. Others contract farmers living in the vicinity to
raise their livestock, supported by company production inputs and services. This component reached 79
percent of capacity utilization at project closing date, that is well above the national average feed mill
capacity utilization rate of 47 percent. In addition to above enterprises, two enterprises (Bayu Oil Plant
and Shijiahu Feed Mill) under Protein Concentrates Component are also vertically integrated production.
Protein Concentrate Production (9 subproject enterprises, total investment cost US$25.43 million, 49%
of total project costs). This component is the largest component, and has played an important role in
alleviating supply constraints in protein-rich animal feeds. The component outputs (compound and pelleted
feed) have reached 100 percent design capacity completion and 59 percent capacity utilization. The
end-products are used for poultry, pigs, ruminants and pond fish in the field. Protein concentrate production
had responded to a serious national shortage of animal feed protein resources, and have been widely used
by smaller livestock enterprises and farmers in the field.
Feed Additives Production (2 enterprises, total investment cost US$16.07 million, 30% of the total project
costs). Support was provided for enterprises engaged in micro-mix or premixes production for use in
compound feed milling. Premix production requires micro-blending technology, which is still in its early
stages in China. This component is particularly significant for its large DCP manufacturer, which provides
a superior feed mineral product to the low-quality and often toxic 4 Tri-calcium phosphate (TCP),
commonly used in livestock feeding in China. With a total design capacity of 104,000 tap, this component
had reached 97 percent capacity utilization by project closing date.
Project enterprises have eased certain critical supply shortages. At the farm-level, the 529,000 tons of
protein concentrates produced by project enterprises are expanded five-fold with corn to make a total of
2.65 million tons of finished feed. This expansion increases the annual project output to a substantial 3
percent of the annual national feed mill output. In the case of DCP feed additive, project support to
Mianzhu enterprise has increased its DCP share of the China market to 45 percent. The project has acted
as a model for other domestic producers in terns of its quality products and corporate management, and
two enterprises have been accredited with ISO-9001 status.
Three subproject enterprises, Sanli Farm, Hengda and Youyou, were operating at low capacity rates at
closing date, through no fault of their own. Hengda began production only one month prior to closing date,
and Sanli Farm is developing 267 ha of ephedrine crops, a slow process that requires nursery development
and seedling transfer. The third subproject, Youyou Biological, had been operating at full capacity since
April 1999, producing enhanced-protein feed by converting regional abattoir wastes. The enterprise had to
stop operations in 2000 due to a precautionary government ban of abattoir waste processing related to Mad
Cow Disease outbreaks in Europe. Youyou is currently restructuring into a different feed product line. The
output indicators are summarized in the table below, with enterprise profiles listed in Annex 9.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The prevailing financial prices of the inputs and outputs of feed mills adequately reflect economic prices,
and in line with the practice of recent Bank projects in China, the Standard Conversion Factor is assumed
to be one(l). The returns for the individual units, before tax and financing, adequately reflect the economic
impact of the project. Separate economic analysis was conducted for all subprojects except Youyou in
Henan Province (closed down due to Mad Cow Disease, see Section 4.2) and the project as a whole. The
NPVs (OCC at 12%) for the 13 subprojects are all positive, with ERR ranging from 14% to 41%. The
ERR for the project as a whole (the cost of Youyou included) is estimated at 28% (NPV at a 12% discount
rate, estimated at Y 369.8 million), indicating the project as economically robust. No economic analysis
was done at ABC's appraisal. Detailed analyses are presented in Annex 3.
4 4 Financial rate of return:
Following the approach adopted at appraisal, the return on capital employed after taxes, which measures
the benefits accrued to the enterprises, is used as the FRR. As with the economic analysis, the financial
analyses were carried out for 13 sub-projects and the project as a whole. The financial rate of return of the
project as a whole is estimated 16% (NPV at a 12% discount rate, estimated at Y 88.4 million), with
FRRs for 13 individual sub-projects ranging from 13% to 21%, indicating that the project is financially
viable. These returns are in general moderately lower than those at ABC appraisal. The main reason for the
generally lower individual FRRs compared with those of ABC's appraisal is the higher capacity utilization
rates assumed at appraisal. Detailed analyses are attached in Annex 3.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project's institutional development impact on China's feed sector has been threefold: (a) facilitating the
incorporation by MoA and NFIO of the main policy and sector investment priorities as outlined in the feed
sector study, (b) contributing to the establishment of the national feed sector development center, MAFIC,
to provide leadership in technical sector development'; and (c) further strengthening of ABC's long-term
loan management, sub-project environmental assessment, and sub-project appraisal skills and risk
mitigation in lending to the private sector. The significance of project impact was borne out by the steadfast
commitment and support by Government and ABC to the objectives of the project.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Two interrelated external factors adversely affected the project during the early years of implementation
and seriously depressed the feed industry's demand for investment and credit. Firstly, the Asian financial
crisis in 1997 reduced the demand and capital investment in China's economy as a whole.
National Feed Industry Office Annual Report, 2000.

TCP, in contrast to DCP, is poorly digestible and can contain up to 1.5% fluoride.
The Center, with autonomous management and operating on a full cost recovery basis, plays an important role in feed sector
strengthening. Although completed without Bank support, the Center was an integral part of project activities (See Section 10
C).
-6 -



The livestock sector and high quality feed production in particular were hard hit. Secondly, in response to
the crisis, the Government instituted a series of interest reductions to stimulate investment demand. In line
with the credit agreement, the variable LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans of the project were
onlent by ABC with a margin of no less than 2.0%, resulting in a loan interest rate well above prevailing
local rates. Moreover, the interest rates of LIBOR-based loans, according to the legal agreement, could be
only adjusted twice a year. In an environment of falling interest rates, this created a situation where the
project funds were more expensive than the local commercial loans of comparative terms and maturity (See
Section 10, Table 10a). In addition, the outbreak of BSE (Mad Cow Disease) in Europe led the government
to close down one sub-project (Youyou) as a precaution against the disease.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The factors under government control were generally positive for the project. The government has given
priority to livestock sector and quality feed production as a means to increase farmers' income. Also, the
market-oriented reform has facilitated the selection of non-SOEs under the project and imposed higher
standards on corporate governance. However, the government, could have, together with the Bank, selected
the right implementing agency earlier in the project design. The changes in the project's implementing
agency, which required two revisions in the selection of units under the project (one during preparation and
one during implementation), caused serious delays in project implementation and loan disbursements.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The following three major factors, all under the control of ABC, have contributed positively to the project:
(a)    The size of the project loans (averaging US$1.6 million) on-lent by ABC to project enterprises
proved to be a major competitive advantage, as such loans were far more responsive to the sub-borrowers'
investment needs, and could be approved and disbursed by ABC more rapidly than domestic loans. Many
project enterprises have confirmed that, in spite of their higher interest rates, Bank loans better met their
financial needs, whereas domestic banks had to set severe limits on the loan amounts lent to borrowers, due
to the prevailing credit crunch. Moreover, domestic loans are often lent only at short or medium maturity,
whereas the project loans issued a long-term maturity.
(b)    ABC's prior experience in implementing four Bank-supported rural credit projects over a period of
10 years has been proven beneficial in terms of long-term loan management, procurement and
disbursement, all of which were effectively carried out well by ABC's Head Office PMO and the provincial
ABC branches; and
(c)    ABC has improved its loan appraisal and management. The sub-borrowers of the rural credit
projects, which were implemented before the onset of enterprise reforms in China, were mainly financially
weak SOEs. Due to their command-driven business operations, many such SOE sub-borrowers faced
difficulties in servicing their loans. In onlending the Animal Feed project loan, ABC selected only
non-SOEs with proven, viable track records.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
In the SAR, total project costs of the original pipeline prepared by CADTIC were estimated at US$310.3
million, including an IBRD loan of US$150 million. When the final implementing agency, ABC, was
selected in 1998, the project was renegotiated. The final pipeline, developed by ABC, was much reduced in
size and scope, due to two loan cancellations totaling US$127.5 million (see Section 10). As per ABC's
appraisal, and further defined at MTR, the total project cost was US$60.7 million including an IBRD loan
of US$25.2 million (see Annex 2). The actual total project cost is estimated at US$52.7 million with
- 7 -



IBRD financing US$22.4 million (43% of the total project cost), ABC and beneficiaries financing US$7.46
million (14% of total cost) and US$22.83 million (43 % of total cost) respectively (see Annex 2).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is likely. The main reason for this rating is that the sub-project enterprises generally
have solid financial and economic viability (see Sections 4.3 and 4.4), supported by sound corporate
management, state-of-art production equipment and facilities, stringent quality control and strong efforts on
brand building and product marketing. Government commitment to the development of the animal feed
sector remains high, and many of the Feed Sector Study's recommendations have been drafted into the
national feed sector development strategy. Government and ABC's commitmnent to promoting free
market-based agribusiness development is very high, as evidenced by the loan portfolio of exclusively
private sector project enterprises.
Marketing has been clearly identified as a priority by all the enterprises, and efforts have focused on
increasing market share through brand development, product promotion, and improving production
efficiencies. In addition to its continued supervision inputs, ABC has provided start-up working capital to
enterprises scaling up existing production. These combined efforts would increase the production capacity
utilization and contribute to the project sustainability.
The institutional strengthening component financed outside the project, but an inherent part of it, will also
be sustainable. The feed sector institute, MAFIC, is financially self-supporting through.advisory, technical
and production activities, and has already proven its sustainability by providing substantial institutional
leadership supported financially by the feed industry (see Annex 10). ABC's central project management
office has also been strengthened by implementation of the project. Skill development of the individual
provincial branches responsible for subproject appraisal and loan management has been especially valuable
to ABC. These skills are being transferred to other, non-project branches.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The transition of project enterprises to post-project operational status is already assured, as these
enterprises, from the beginning, have operated as fully commercial entities. MAFIC, with its integral cost
recovery and shareholding structure and its active support from, and exposure to the feed industry, was
designed from the beginning to operate as an autonomous, commercially sustainable entity.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Lending performance by the Bank is rated unsatisfactory. The Bank could have recognized from the onset
that the project, given its commercial nature, should have been prepared as a demand-driven loan operation,
which would have prevented unnecessary implementation delays (see Section 3.5). However, the
preparation of the Feed Sector Study prior to project identification was instrumental in securing the
Govemment's commitment to the project and its objectives. The appraisal of a subproject pipeline of great
technical variety and complexity, although costly in termns of technical consultant inputs and supervision,
has been well executed, resulting in a good quality lending portfolio.
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision quality is rated satisfactory. Project supervision by the Bank was generally regular and
constructive to project implementation. Most importantly, when extemal factors delayed loan disbursement,
- 8-



the Bank was timely in identifying these constraints, and used the supervision missions to restructure parts
of the project and partially cancel the loan to reflect new realities. Supervision of technically sophisticated
subprojects, such as DCP feed mineral production and protein synthesis, depended heavily on the
participation of highly-specialized consultants, who were not always available when needed. Collaboration
between ABC and NFIO, even though the latter was no longer directly involved in the project, continued
throughout implementation. Given ABC's prior experience with Bank projects, procurement and
disbursement did not pose any problems. The Bank's prior review of the first three NCB pipeline contracts,
as required, was satisfactory, as were ABC's overall project management, its administration of the Special
Account, and overall loan management.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance has generally been satisfactory. The overall project objectives remained clear
and unchanged, and the Government remained supportive of the project throughout its implementation, as
evident from its assistance in resolving the problems associated with the feed sector downturn and the
changes in project implementing agency. The Bank's communications with ABC remained close throughout
implementation so that problems could be identified and resolved at an early stage.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Initial project preparation suffered from borrower's incomplete appreciation for a private sector oriented
operation. But when in 1998, the project institutional aspects were recast, the performance of the borrower
was quite satisfactory. ABC adopted a sustained and positive approach throughout project preparation, and
displayed substantial project ownership, even though ABC was not the project's original sponsoring
agency, and was requested to take over project management from CADTIC. ABC understood that its stake
in developing a well-performing subproject pipeline was high, given the commercial nature of the project,
and took many risk mitigation measures in selecting viable project enterprises.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance is rated satisfactory. The Government's commitment to the
project has remained strong and sustained, in spite of several changes in project implementing agency and
the economic downturn of the feed sector during and following the Asian financial crisis. Government's
continued support for the establishment of MAFIC has been especially strong, and the grounds for MoA's
decline to utilize the project loan earmarked for this purpose were purely financial. The government's
commitment to feed sector development was better focused from the onset by the recommendations made in
the Feed Sector Study that preceded project identification, which clarified the issues involved in
modernizing the sector, and presented clear options for institutional and capacity building. This
commitment ran parallel to the Government's equally strong commitment to the commercialization of the
livestock sector, which depends on quality feed for its improvement.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The selection of a suitable project implementation agency was problematic, and required a shift from
directed onlending to demand-driven lending. The mismatch of NFIO as a suitable implementing agency
should have been recognized early in project identification. The performance of ABC, considering the
extrinsic constraints it faced during implementation, has been satisfactory. ABC's performance in pipeline
development, subproject appraisal, loan management, procurement, disbursement and administrative
procedures has been satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall performance of the Borrower has been satisfactory. The Borrower has been consistently
supportive in assisting the Bank in resolving the issues faced during implementation, recognizing that the
-9-



basic objectives of the project were sound and relevant.
8. Lessons Learned
Lessons learned based on the review by the ICR mission are as follows:
(a)    Use Sector Studies with care: With the usual lag between a sector study and the Appraisal, some
structural or institutional change in the sector is common. It is important to identify clearly sector
constraints, and evaluate the suitability of implementing agency and the selection criteria for participating
enterprises. On the business practice side, the participating enterprises must be willing to innovate, build a
sound management team, and prepare a realistic business plan.
(b)    Evaluate competitiveness of foreign currency denominated loans for sub-borrowers: This is
especially true when the major investment items (equipment and works) are locally available and major
project outputs are destined for domestic market. Under such circumstances, foreign exchange risk and
more competitive local currency loans tend to discourage the use of dollar denominated loans. Moreover,
given the volatility of the financial market, project implementation delays may reduce project viability
drastically.
(c)    Chose the financial intermediary based on their local knowledge and, if developing a
new relationship, do your due-diligence: Due diligence should cover the intermediary's prior
sector and regional experience. If possible, evaluate the quality of the staff in the intermediary
who would be involved in selecting the sub-borrowers. Staff assigned for sub-borrower
development may have excellent understanding in one sector but deficient in a specialized sector
such as the animal feed sector. ABC's prior experience in implementing four Bank-supported
rural credit projects and its improved loan appraisal criteria and risk management skills made the
project viable after a disastrous start.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Comments from ABC
We are satisfied with the ICR assessment of the project, which generally reflects the actual situation of the
project design, implementation and reasonably forecasts the projects' future operation, and we appreciate
very much the efforts made by the ICR team.
We share the view in the ICR that the quality at entry could have been better in terms of project design,
especially the selection of appropriate implementing agency at the early stage of project preparation.
The ICR assessment on the achievement of project objectives and outputs are objective. We particularly
agree with the conclusion that the project has demonstration effects in terms of quality product, state of art
technology and corporate governance. The project has further benefited not only farmers buying feed for
livestock and aquaculture production but also those producing crops as raw materials for feed industry.
We are also satisfied with the assessment on economic and financial rates of return in ICR. The financial
rates of returns of the subprojects are generally lower than those at appraisal and the main reason was, as
clearly identified in the ICR, the different assumptions made on capacity utilization between ICR and
appraisal.
- 10 -



The lessons learned in the ICR are highly relevant and useful for ABC's future feed industry and
agribusiness loan appraisal, as well as for its future cooperation with the World Bank.
(b) Cofinanciers:
There were no co-financiers for this project.
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
No direct partners were involved, although CIDA participated in the institutional strengthening activity by
assisting in the establishment of the feed industry center, MAFIC. However, no project funds were used for
MAFIC.
10. Additional Information
Changes in Project Implementing Agency
Three changes in project implementing agency, from NFIO to CADTIC to ABC, have hampered the timely
implementation of project activities, and caused the project to miss an important window of opportunity
during which the animal feed sector's investment rate in capacity building was high.
The National Feed Industry Office, NFIO, is the national agency under MoA responsible for regulatory
and sector development aspects of China's animal feed sector. NFIO has a network of provincial and
county branch offices, and its connections with the feed industry were primarily directed to SOEs operating
in the feed industry. Privately owned agro-enterprises were somewhat outside NFIO's scope, however.
MoA, the project's original line ministry, assigned NFIO to assist the Bank in preparing the Feed Sector
Study, from which the basic project objectives and investment priorities were identified. The original
subproject pipeline developed by NFIO contained 31 SOE-managed subprojects in six components related
to feed sector capacity building, to be financed with a US$150 million IBRD loan. Given the commercial
nature of the proposed project and its concern with the viability of SOE-led subprojects, Bank management
requested the Task Team at pre-appraisal to prepare an issues paper on how the ongoing enterprise reform
in China would impact on the project. Subject to this paper, Bank management directed the Task Team at
the appraisal review meeting to change the project design from a directed loan operation involving SOEs to
a market-oriented, demand-driven operation with non-SOE enterprises. This change over was effected
during the March 1995 appraisal mission. The identification and appraisal of the project financial
intermediary CADTIC delayed project negotiations for a 10-month period, until February 1996.
The China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Co., CADTIC, was established in 1988 and
was originally under the administrative supervision of the State Planning Commission (SPC), which was
transferred in 1994 to MoA. CADTIC was set up with Bank assistance to serve as a financial intermediary
for channeling rural credit funds to China's rapidly developing TVE subsector. Although CADTIC
reported to the Minister for Agriculture, it operated under autonomous management and was incorporated
as a shareholding Trust and Investment Corporation (TIC). In 1988, CADTIC became the implementing
agency of a long term US$300 million Bank loan allocated for China's Rural Sector Adjustment Credit.
CADTIC also gained operational on-lending experience with ADB loans, and loans from Credit Suisse.
The Task Team appraised CADTIC in June 1995 as the implementing agency for the Animal Feed Project,
with its Intemational Finance Department as the PMO (see CADTIC Appraisal Report in the Project
Files).
The appraisal found CADTIC's in-house loan portfolio and operating procedures satisfactory and
recommended an institutional strengthening program to further bolster its loan management expertise. This
program included, (a) reorganization of on-lending operations from three separate divisions into a single
Credit Department, (b) strengthening risk management by establishing a Credit Review Department, (c)
- 1 1 -



improving the management information system, and (d) providing additional PLO staff training in lending
operations and risk management. These measures were accepted by CADTIC and technical assistance was
identified to oversee and carry out these measures. CADTIC proceeded to identify its own subproject
pipeline, consisting entirely of privately owned agro-enterprises engaged directly or indirectly in the feed
industry. At the early stages of pipeline development, CADTIC did not adhere sufficiently closely to the
project objectives when selecting enterprises, which resulted in an Highly Unsatisfactory project objectives
rating at the November 1996 supervision mission. The rating was upgraded to Satisfactory at the following
supervision. In January 1997, before CADTIC had committed or disbursed any of the project loan, the
State Council closed CADTIC. Bank management decided not to terminate the project in accordance with
Article V (b) of the Loan Agreement (June 1996); a decision based on strong representation by NFIO and
MoA concerning the importance of financing feed sector development. A hiatus of nine months followed,
during which the replacement financial intermediary, ABC, was identified.
The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC). The project was renegotiated with ABC in Beijing in October
1997 and presented to the Board on a No Objection basis in February 1998. An amount of US$200,000 of
the loan was earmarked for ABC project management office strengthening. In March 1998 ABC resumed
project implementation. ABC is China's large state-owned financial institution, with over 2,000 branches
and near 400,000 employees nationwide. Its original agricultural loan portfolio has shifted from agriculture
to other sectors in recent years. When ABC was requested by PBC (the cental bank) to take over the
Animal Feed Project, it had already accumulated substantial experience with Bank projects. Between 1984
and 1990, ABC implemented four rural credit projects for a total amount of US$585 million-equivalent in
blended IBRD/IDA loans/credits. These loans/credits increased in amount from US$50 million IBRD/IDA
(the first project in 1985) to US$275 million IBRD/IDA (the fourth project in 1990). These loans were
principally onlent to SOEs and TVEs, with varying success, given that many such sub-borrowers were
technically, structurally and financially weak. ABC assumed project implementation in the early stages of
the Asian financial crisis, which had begun in mid-1997.
In 1997 and 1998, the Government instituted a series of interest rate reductions to stimulate the economy,
which had slowed as a result of the Asian financial crisis. As a consequence, the Bank loan, onlent by MoF
to ABC in variable LIBOR-based US dollar currency, became increasingly noncompetitive compared to
domestic commercial loans of similar maturity. Two extrinsic factors; depressed capital investment, and the
Bank loan's widening interest rate gap, contributed to a rapidly declining demand for the Bank loan. ABC
had also become extremely cautious in approving sub-loans as the result of tightened banking regulations in
response to deteriorating economic conditions. As a result, ABC faced increasing difficulties in finding
suitable enterprises prepared to take on the project loan, and, in order to reduce its commitment fee
exposure, requested the Bank for two successive loan cancellations; the first in April 2000 of US$95
million, followed by a second cancellation of US$32.5 million in December 2000. This left US$22.5
million of the loan active, or 15 percent of the original US$150 million loan.
During the midterm review mission in October 1999, three measures were taken to make the project more
responsive to prevailing conditions in the feed industry, which had slumped as the result of the Asian
financial crisis. First, a US$10 million working capital facility was earmarked from the project loan to
assist project enterprises with difficulties borrowing sufficient working capital. These loans had a maturity
of 6 months with a 1% interest per month penalty for late repayment. Second, a decision was made to
cancel part of the loan to ease ABC's exposure to the commitment fee. Third, the project objective was
broadened to provide project loans for livestock purchases for enterprises wishing to undertake vertical feed
and livestock integration. Therefore, loans had only been designate for feed-related investments. However,
the extrinsic effect of the widening interest rate gap could not be controlled. With the Loan cancellations,
the project was closed on December 31, 2001, one year before it's scheduled closing date.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
This Annex covers the reassessment of the financial and economic rates of return of the sub-projects
implemented by ABC. The analysis was conducted for all subprojects except Youyou in Henan Province
(only 6% of the total project, which was closed down by Government due to Mad Cow Disease, so that
data are not available for its future operation (Section 4.2 ). Detailed sub-project descriptions are provided
in Main text of ICR (Annex 9).
Major assumptions for financial analysis are: (1) Project life: In line with the prevailing practice in the
animal feed sector, the project life is assumed to be 15 years; (2) Investment costs and residual value of
fixed assets: The investment costs employed in the analysis are based on actual costs incurred, including
procurement and installation of equipment, land acquisition (user rights fees), and training. The residual
value of the fixed assets is estimated at 5 percent of their book value, and is treated as cash in-flow at the
end of the project life; (3) The revenues and operating costs. The revenues are derived from sales generated
from operating capacity achieved from past years and projected values for the future. Detailed data
concerning the amounts and prices of products sold, amounts and costs of raw materials, labor, utilities,
marketing and administrative expenses were provided by each of the 13 factories; (4) Incremental working
capital, depending on the capacity utilization, and management of current assets and liabilities, is projected
by factory management and is included in the analysis separately; (5) Taxes: The feed sector has a
preferential VAT of 13% as against 17% in general, with the amount payable to the supplier's recoverable.
It also enjoys corporate income tax holidays for the first three years of operation, after which the corporate
income tax is 33% of taxable income. The straight-line method was used to calculate the depreciation as
income tax shield; and (6). Capacity utilization: actual capacity utilization for the number of years in
operation, future projections were provided. Direct operating costs vary approximately in proportion to the
plant capacity utilization.
Based on the approach adopted at appraisal, the after tax IRR, which reflects the returns of factory gains,
is treated as the financial IRR of the factories. The cash flow analysis is conducted in 2001 prices (no
inflation adjustment made to the investment costs, given the fact that CPI remained virtually unchanged
during the project implementation). The financial rate of return of the project as a whole is estimated 16%
with IRRs for 13 individual sub-projects ranging from 13% to 21%, indicating that the project is
financially viable. The IRRs by factory at ICR and at appraisal (estimated by ABC) are listed in the
attached table. Detailed cash flow analyses are available from the project files.
The Economic analysis was carried out individually for each project enterprise. The methodology of the
analysis follows that of financial analysis with adjustment of prices and elimination of the impact of the
transfer payment (tax liabilities). In line with the Bank's recent analysis of agricultural projects of similar
nature, a SCF of I has been used in the analysis, which implies that no adjustment is needed in converting
financial prices for non-tradable to economic prices.
As for tradable, parity prices were used as economic prices. However, due to (1) the large number of
diverse end products and raw materials; (2) the uniqueness in certain areas of a certain or raw materials;
and (3) the absence of internationally comparable commodity prices for most of the products and raw
materials; financial prices were used as proxies for economic prices. As such, the IRR before tax and
financing, which measures the return on the total resources engaged, was taken as ERR for the project
enterprise. The NPVs (OCC at 12%) for the 13 subprojects were positive, with ERRs ranging from 14% to
41%. The ERR for the project as whole (derived from the weighted ERR average of all project enterprises,
including the cost of Youyou) is estimated at 28%, indicating the project is economically robust. The
noticeable difference between the ERR and FIRR for each plant is caused mainly by the fairly high tax
liabilities (VAT at 13% and corporate tax at 33%).

Additional Annex 8. ABC's Contribution To The ICR
A. Background
The Animal feed Project (the Project) was originally proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture, and latter
onlent by China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corporation (CADTIC). In January
1997, CADTIC was closed down according to related laws and regulations. Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC) was designated by the Government to take over the implementation of the Project. In March 1998,
after negotiations among the Bank, Ministry and Finance (MoF) and ABC and through necessary legal
procedure, three agreements, namely, Agreement Amending Loan Agreement, Project agreement, and
Project Onlending Agreement, were signed respectively between the Bank and MOF, the Bank and ABC,
MOF and ABC. ABC started to implement the Project as financial intermediary.
B. Project Implementation
Adjustment to the Project
The original IBRD loan amount is US$150 million. Though ABC had made a lot of efforts to facilitate the
Project, selection of subprojects still tumed out to be very difficult under the current market situation,
particularly due to the loss of competition of the Bank's lending rate in contrast to the prevailing domestic
banking rate. Besides, in order to reduce its commitment fee exposure, based on the subprojects pipeline,
ABC requested to cancel US$95 million of the loan in February 2000, and again applied for cancellation of
US$32.5 million in December 2000. With the Bank's approval, the loan amount was reduced to US$22.5
million. Based on the above, ABC determined that the project closing date was advanced to December 31,
2001, one year earlier than the original closing date. By the end of 2001, the project loan has all been
approved by the Bank to be disbursed to the subprojects.
C. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs
Outcome/ Achievement of objective:
The implementation of the subprojects greatly increased the added value of the agricultural products by
utilizing the local resources, and improved the quality of the feed products and promoted the development of
livestock breeding. On the other hand, the Project provided about 2410 new working opportunities to the
local people, which brought about good social effect.
As of December 2001, 11 out of the 14 subprojects were completed and opened to commercial operation,
and the rest 3 has finished civil works construction and equipment installation and will start test-run in
2002. Most of the subprojects performed quite well and has achieved satisfactory financial earning. The
accumulated sales of the 11 subprojects amounted to RMB 1,204 million which profits RMB 98 million. It
is expected that the rest 3 subproject will see good profit when they become operational.
The Loan effectively supplemented ABC's shortage for long-term foreign exchange existed in Midwest
branches. Financed by the loan, ABC had effectively supported a number of good customers.
ABC's fix asset lending capacity was strengthened by adopting international practices through technical
assistance and the Bank-funded project implementation. Leamed from the practices in international banks,
- 25 -



ABC applied the lending processing in its operations, including project identification, appraisal, review,
approval, underwriting, monitoring, collection and post evaluation, which were critical for ABC to improve
its credit policy and project management.
Outputs by Component
Fourteen subprojects were financed by the bank until the loan account was closed on 31 December, 2001,
with total loan disbursement of US$22.42 million. The total actual investment of the 14 subprojects is
RMB 438 million, of which 42% is Bank loan. The 14 subprojects are located in 8 provinces, most of
which in Midwest area. They are Sichuan, Henan, Hunan, Fujian, Anhui, Shaanxi provinces and Ningxia,
Inner Mongolia Municipalities.
Among the 14 subprojects, 4 subprojects are integrated feed and livestock components, 2 are feed additives
and feed mineral production component, 6 are compound, pelleted, concentrated feedmilling components,
and 2 enhanced-protein synthesis components. After the subprojects are all completed, the production
capacity of various feed products will be: compound, concentrated and pelleted feed products 802,000 tons,
DCP I000,000 tons, ephedrine feed 4000 tons. The actual production capacity of each subprojects is almost
same as the appraised.
D. Main Factors Influencing the Projects
The Project was in line with the state sector development plan in increasing the added value of the
agricultural products and improving the deficiency in feed enterprise of small scale, low quality and
backward technology. The subproject got support from local government in many aspects, such as tax
reduction and exemption.
All levels of ABC have done a lot of work in implementation of the Project, including market research,
production design for the enterprise and loan disbursement.
E. Problems and Issues Encountered in Implementation
During the implementation, the central bank adjusted the foreign currency loan interest rates from 7.81% at
January of 1998 to 5.56% at September of 2001. While for the Renminbi long-term (five years above) loan,
the interest rate declined from 10.35% at March, 1998 to 6.21% at June, 1999, then 5.76% at February
2002. The advantages of using the Bank Loan, which were considered as longer, term and lower interests,
were no longer existed. The Bank loan at this regard was less attractive to the borrower, which brought the
inefficient utilization of the funds.
Negatively affected by the Asian Financial Crisis, the exportation of the livestock products sharply
decreased. And the domestic demand for the meat products are also declining, besides, the competition in
local feed market has been very fierce since many new feed mill founded in recent years. All the above
factors led to the demand and the price of feed products decreased.
F. Sustainability of the Project
The project seems likely sustain in the future. As most subprojects put into operation in 2000 and 2001 and
still operated at early stage, they have not yet reached their original production capacity. And some
subprojects have faced fierce competition since they started operation. Both ABC Head Office and branches
cooperated actively with the subprojects to develop the market strategy and make financing plan. The
- 26 -



subproject Youyou, which was allowed to manufacture protein feed grade meat meal, using animal wastes,
is presently restructuring into different feed production lines, and will restart operation in 2002.
Followed the project completion, ABC would continue to concentrate on project monitoring and follow up
management. Special attention would be given to the sub-projects, which did not reach full capacity
utilization, to help and encourage them to take measures to improve the operations, management and
efficiencies to ensure the pay back of the loans and interests.
As agriculture is the most important fundamental sector in China, the government has always put great
attention to its development. With China's entry into WTO, stockbreeding has been framed as the priority
industry, which will bring along the development of the feed industry. The project will see good potential
market in the near future.
G. ABC Performance
Based on the Project Agreement, Amending Loan Agreement, the Bank's Guidelines for Disbursement, and
Procurement and related policies issued, and in order to effectively implement the project, ABC Head
Office developed "The Project Management Regulations for Animal Feed Project" and requested all the
project branches executed the projects in line with the regulation. The regulations included the Project
objectives, loan lending scope, subborrower's qualification, the projects appraisal and approval procedure,
and supervision requirement. All the subprojects should get clearance of the local Environment Protection
Bureau before their submission to ABC for approval.
With the strict supervision by ABC, procurements of equipment under the Project were fully complied with
the Project Agreement and the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. NCB and direct shopping at least with
three suppliers was used for all subproject procurements. Apart from the quality, price, technical functions
of equipment, more attention were paid to the delivery, parts supply, maintenance, and after services in
evaluation and selection of suppliers to ensure that equipment procured was technically advanced,
reasonable for price and convenient to maintain after services.
To ensure that the Bank loan was disbursed in line with the eligible criteria stipulated in the Project
Agreement, all disbursements had been made after careful review of related materials and invoices.
ABC has conducted on-site visits and off-site supervisions for all sub-projects. The monitoring scheduled
covered: project funds resources and its implementation, the implementation of environmental measures,
civil work processing progress, equipment procurement, equipment installation and operations, business
operations after production, borrowers' financial situation, loan repayment schedule, as well as problems
and suggestions.
H. Bank performance
During the Project implementation, to push the Project forward smoothly, the World Bank rendered great
assistance in such aspects as establishing a revolving working capital fund, expanding the lending scope,
etc. The supervision missions provided good advice on project management and technical aspects, which
greatly improved the subborrowers' management.

I. Main Experience and Lessons
The useful experience worthy to be summed up for this project are mainly in the following aspects:
(a)    The local governments attached great importance to all the subprojects.
(b)    ABC's prudent credit principal ensured the qualified project was selected, which brought
satisfactory financial and economic benefit to the subprojects and the local government.
The lessons drawn from the project implementation are mainly in the following aspects:
(a)    Major project investment costs are spent in local currency and major outputs are sold in domestic
market. In this case, the subborrowers was discouraged both by the foreign exchange risk and interest rate
risk.
(b)    During the implementation period, the interest rate of the Bank loan to the subborrower ( after plus
interest rate spread) was much higher than that of the local currency loan, which made the Bank loan less
competitive.
(c)    ABC should reinforce the ability to make market research and forecasting in long-term project
appraisal.

1.    Baotou Oishi Feed Industry Co. is a privately-owned shareholding agro-enterprise, owned by a
parent company engaged in vertically integrated dairy production and milk processing in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region. To provide high quality feed for its diary farm, the project financed Qishi
to construct a new feedmill with a production capacity of 7,000 tpa of concentrated dairy cattle feed, and to
plant 5,000 mu (333 ha) of corn for use as corn silage. The feedmill construction was completed in early
2002. Qishi will operate as an integrated feed and diary production enterprise, with the feed mill company
serving as the nucleus farm, providing feed and services to surrounding dairy smallholders. This subproject
is the result of the broadened project objective, introduced at MTR, to include project support for livestock
production in addition to feedmill capacity building for vertically integrating enterprises. Qishi is located in
a poverty-designated county, thereby providing income generation for local farmers in return for tax
concessions.
2.     Beixu Feedmill is a vertically integrated, privately-owned agro-enterprise in Henan province,
producing compound feeds for pigs and poultry. Its parent company, Beixu Group Co., is located in a
major pig production area in Henan, to which the new project mill will supply compound feed. Beixu
received a project loan to establish a feedmill with a design capacity of 100,000 tpa, producing compound
feeds, formulated from the abundant com and soybean in the area. Construction was completed in July
2001 and will reach full production by end-2002 with a current CU of 65 percent. Management, marketing
and markets are good and the project is highly likely to achieve long-term sustainability. Beixu aims to be a
major pig feed producer and pig producer integrator in Henan province.
3.     Shivang Feedmill Co. is a privately owned, shareholding subsidiary located in Shaanxi province,
belonging to the Shiyang Group. Shiyang Group is a leading oilseed agro-enterprise conglomerate
operating in Northwest China, and owns 14 subsidiary oilseed extraction and feed milling enterprises in
different provinces. The Shiyang Group has eight years of experience in feedmilling, and has diversified
from oilseed extraction into value-added animal feed product milling, utilizing the soybean and oilseed cake
byproducts generated by its oilseed extraction plants. Shiyang Feedmill plans to market 90 percent of its
feeds in Shaanxi province, where only 50% of animal feed is presently mechanically compounded. The
feedmill received a project loan to expand its operation with two fully computerized feed production lines
with a design capacity of 150,000 tpa. The entire equipment package was procured by NCB contract. The
mill began operating the two new feed lines in June 2001. After 10 months of operation, feed output has
reached 90% of planned CU, and comprises over 100 types of compound and pelleted pig, poultry and
cattle feeds. The feedmill operates a large sales force and promotes a life-cycle feeding program, marketing
protein concentrates and fully compounded feeds to smaller and more commercialized clients respectively.
(In addition to above three enterpriese, two enterprises under (Bayu oil plant and Sherjiahu Feed Mill)
protein concentrates component are also integrating)

began in August 2000 and the mill was commissioned in June 2001. By end-2001, the mill was operating at
90% capacity. Full production is projected by end-2002. The new production line's formulation and
cottonseed cake detoxification technologies are advanced. Currently, the mill has a market share of 20 per
cent in Shaanxi Province, and the subproject has good long-term sustainability, as most feed products used
in Shaanxi province are purchased from other provinces at prices higher then local commodities. By
utilizing locally produced commodities, the enterprise is therefore very competitive in terms of price and
product quality.
2.     Danong Science & Technoloev Feedmill Co. Ltd is a privately-owned shareholding company
located in Shaanxi province, owned by its parent company Xijing Co. Ltd. with five years of feed industry
experience, Danong is a leading agro-enterprise in Northwest China. The subproject comprises a fully
automated, computerized state-of-the-art feedmill with a design capacity of 70,000 tpa, constructed under a
turnkey contract awarded by NCB. The enterprise is market oriented, has a good management team and is
in a stable financial position. The new mill has four feed compounding lines with a combined production
output of over 100 types of granulated, pelleted and compound feeds for pigs, poultry, and carp.
Commercial production began in February 2002 and is projected to reach 35,000 tpa (50% capacity
utilization (CU)) by end-2002; and full production in 2-3 years The enterprise has already obtained
ISO-9002 accreditation for operating procedures, and is engaged in a long term scientific exchange
program with Northwestern University in Xian, under which the latter provides feed formulation services
and new product development, in return for use of the feedmill for student training and scientific research in
its crop and animal husbandry programs. Danong's future expansion plans include restructuring into
integrated feed and livestock production.
3.     Linvin-' Agariculture Material Supply and Sales Coop is a collectively-owned limited corporation
with five years of experience in the feed industry in Henan province. The feedmill utilizes local corn and
soybean resources to produce compound feed and protein concentrate for the large pig population in the
area. The enterprise received a project loan to expand its feed production by adding a fully automated feed
production line with a design capacity of 50,000 tpa. The entire equipment package was procured by NCB.
The expanded mill began operations in August 2000 and its current CU is at around 50%. It has embarked
on a strong product promotion program to increase sales and it is expected to reach full capacity in 2005.
4.     Ningxia Xinghuo Feed Companv is a private enterprise with nine years experience in feed
industry. The enterprise has been engaged in the production of feed additives and protein concentrate, and
is the biggest protein concentrate mill in west-northem China. The project established compound
feed/concentrates producti9n line of 50,000 tpa, utilizing feed ingredients from local sources. The
production line is currently running at 55% percent design capacity and, as the result of strong market
competition, is converting into integrated feed and fish production. The feedmill's product quality is high
and a major advantage in increasing its market share. The enterprise has a strong product and sales
promotion staff, which are gradually improving market shares for its products. It is expected to reach
100% CU in 2 - 3 years.
5.     ShuUiiahu Zhengatai Feed Mill is a limited corporation, owned by an integrated feed and livestock
enterprise mainly engaged in farming, feed processing and chicken and pigs breeding. To utilize the corn
and soybeans produced by its own farms, Zhengtai ensures value-added by cycling part of its high quality
feeds through the enterprise's own pig and chicken farms, and marketing the remainder in the provinces of
Shandong, Henan , Jiangsu and Jiangxi. Zhengtai's products include more than 50 types of compound feeds
for fish, pigs and chickens. The enterprise received a project loan to expand it feed output with a fully
automated production line for protein concentrates, with a design capacity of 60,000 tpa, procured by
NCB. In 1999, construction was completed and commissioned. Because of the fierce competition in the
feed market, utilization capacity has reached 50% of design capacity, and the enterprise is strengthening its

marketing networks and concentrate on new product development. The enterprise reaches 70% production
in 200, with full production in 2-3 years.
6.     Zhengxing Zhimi Feed Mill is a private enterprise with seven years of feed industry experience.
The mill used a project loan to meet increased demand by constructing two production lines to increase its
original production capacity from 17,000 tons of compound feed and protein concentrate by an incremental
33,000 tpa, for a projected output of 50,000 tpa. The mill has a long-term scientific exchange relationship
with the feed industry center, MAFIC, which provides feed formulation services, new product development,
and training for mill workers. The mill presently operates at 80% capacity and is performing quite well, as
its products are well received. The negative impact of the Asian financial crisis and the resulting depressed
domestic market, has stimulated the mill's management to develop new feed products and to increase its
product promotion with assistance from MAFIC.
7.     Zhengtai Feed TechnoloLv Co. is a shareholding company located in Hunan province, engaging
mainly in feed and feed additives production. The company has nine years of feed industry experience. The
enterprise received project loan to expand its existed production capacity by 120,000 tpa, from 80,000 tpa
to 200,000 tpa. Construction was completed in 1999. In 2001, the project reached full production. Its
products include compound and protein concentrates for pigs, fish and poultry. The enterprise has achieved
ISO-9002 operating accreditation, and is engaged in a long-term scientific exchange program for new
product development with a local university. In spite of strong competition, Zhengtai has increased its
domestic market and integrated by purchasing a Grain Company in IMAR, to lower its commodity costs
for soybean cake and rapeseed cake. The mill has set up an integrated production chain comprising
commodities, feed processing, and marketing, which has enlarged its business scope through lower product
prices, high-quality products, and improved marketing.
8.     Youvou Biological Engaineering Co. Ltd.. located in Henan province, is a privately owned
shareholding company, established for the purpose of manufacturing high-protein feed grade meat meal,
using animal wastes from regional slaughterhouses, thereby resolving an important waste disposal problem
by converting low value slaughter wastes into high value feed protein. The plant with a design capacity of
14,000 tpa began operations in April 1999 but was closed down in 2000 due to circumstances beyond its
control, when the Government placed a nation-wide ban on the manufacture of livestock feeds using animal
wastes as the result of the outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease) in the
United Kingdom and other European countries. The company is presently restructuring into different
production lines, but has experienced substantial losses.
9.     Hengda Aquatic Feed Mill is a shareholding company located in Anhui province, one of eight
subsidiary feed processing, breeding and beverage plants owned by the Hengda Group Company, an
agro-enterprise with seven years of feed industry experience. The Hengda Group is a leading feed

works were procured by NCB. Construction was completed in the last quarter of 2001, and the mill is
presently operating at 25 percent CU (test runs). Hengda's entry into the aquatic feed market has faced
strong competition, which it aims to overcome with high-quality feed products and marketing. Business
from other subsidiaries will assist final financing and commissioning of the project. The production of
aquatic feeds is highly technical and requires innovative feed formulation and processing.
Component C. Feed Additives and Feed Mineral Production Component
1.    Mianzhu Longman DCP Plant, located in Sichuan province, is a newly constructed, privately
- 31 -



owned shareholding subsidiary of a parent company, Sichuan Longman Group, with 13 years of feed
additives experience, operating eight mineral processing and chemical plants. The project enterprise is
engaged in the extraction and purification of rock phosphate into dicalcium phosphate (DCP), an essential
mineral for livestock feeding. DCP is nutritionally far superior to tricalcium phosphate (TCP), which is
commonly used in China. The enterprise replaces a defunct plant on land owned by the company in
Mianzhu County, with resources of 15 billion tons reserve of rock phosphate. The plant was commissioned
in December 1997 and is at full production at 100,000 tpa of feed grade DCP. A byproduct, 50,000 tpa of
mono-ammonium phosphate fertilizer, is also produced. Plant equipment was procured by NCB. The plant
has received IS09002 operating certification. This subproject, which is engaged in surface mining, received
an environmental A rating, and a comprehensive environmental assessment was carried out. Environmental
certification was issued by the local Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), subject to the
implementation of a comprehensive environmental mitigation plan by the company. The plant is extremely
profitable. A thematic Bank supervision in 2001 found the plant's environmnental mitigation program
satisfactory.
2.     Sanli Farm is a private farm owned by a parent company in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region (IMAR), engaged in agricultural commodity trading. The farm received a project loan to develop a
4000 mu (267 ha) of ephedra plantation, with a planned output of 4000 tpa of Ephedra feed additive. The
product is marketed as an organic metabolic stimulant, for use in feed rations to promote growth rates. This
subproject has an ecological objective is addition to its commercial objective. In its effort to combat
desertification, the IMAR government has recommended Ephedra as the vegetation of choice in large areas
of Inner Mongolia. Ephedra is typically transplanted to the field from nursery seedlings, with onset of
production three years after transplanting. To date, land preparation and civil works have been completed,
and 18 ha nursery is in operation and 60 ha of Ephedra (22% of target) have been planted. Sanli Farm has
engaged a technical specialist to head up the project. Full production is projected for 2004.

programs, and applied research training programs, MAFIC is well on its way to fully achieve its objective
to provide national leadership to China's young, growing feed industry. The Center represented the
Project's Feed Sector Strengthening Component, and was designated for Bank support under Schedule 1,
part B of the Loan Agreement for a loan of US$2.3 million, together with a US$2.4 million bilateral grant
from CIDA, with the balance to be financed by MoA. Because of its institutional nature and longer start-up
phase, the loan's maturity was set at 15 years, including a 5-year grace period. However, the Asian
financial crisis caused the loan's interest rate to become increasingly uncompetitive as compared to
domestic loans of similar maturity. As a consequence, MoA, MAFIC's implementing agency, declined the
Bank loan and arranged for alternative' less costly financing. Nevertheless, MAFIC has more than fulfilled
its role in of animal feed sector strengthening, in substantial part due to the efforts by the Bank and MoA
teams involved in the planning and preparation of MAFIC's physical and human resources, combined with
implementation support from CIDA. CIDA supported seven years of technical assistance to MAFIC in the
form of long term consultancies in feed processing technology, industrial training, extension, research and
agribusiness management, and MAFIC became fully operational in 2000.
MAFIC's objectives are to provide institutional and technical leadership at the national level to China's
growing feed industry, which, in terms of output capacity at 85 million tpa of manufactured feed, has
become the world's second largest after the United States (125 million tpa). The industry began to
commercialize only 20 years ago, and at present between 50-70 percent of China's animal feed is
scientifically formulated in modern mills. The industry's institutional infrastructure is multi-agency and
complex, with much duplication of effort, which has hampered the clarity and timeliness of the sector's
earliest development plans. MAFIC, as the sole national technical institute devoted entirely to the feed
industry, is therefore fulfilling a much needed role in coordinating and implementing feed sector
development objectives, especially where MAFIC is fully industry-supported and has thereby gained
substantial credibility with the animal feed industry.
All of MAFIC's laboratory equipment, office furniture, computers and other internal furnishings were
donated by members of the feed industry; civil works were financed by MoA, and CIDA supported the
technical assistance. The Center operates research and feed analysis laboratories, a large reference library
and information technology unit, an experimental feedmill for research, training and new product
development, and several animal facilities for bioassay of feeds and feed additives; the first such facilities
operational in China. MAFIC also owns a commercial feedmill with a 5,000 tpa output of commercial
premixes, for sale to the feed industry. In 2000, the Center acquired IS09001 operational status; the first
such institute in China to reach this standard. In 2001, MAFIC received accreditation from the State
Commission for Science and Technology as a National Center of Excellence, another first. MAFIC is
financially and managerially fully autonomous and generates its own operating and staffing funds from the
sale of its commercial product sales, contract research and advisory services.
MAFIC is located on the campus of China Agricultural University in Beijing and has six Departments:
Education and Research, Information Technology, Laboratory Services, Commercial Feedmill, Training
and Extension, and International Cooperation. MAFIC has a core scientific staff of 20 persons, and has
scientific exchanges with several countries. It receives sustained financial support from China's feed
industry enterprises in return for contract service work and product development. MAFIC operates two
websites from its Information Technology Department, which, since their beginning in April 2001, have
received 700,000 hits. The Center produces and sells software packages for use in feed fornulation,
feedmill training and management, livestock disease diagnosis, sales and marketing management, and feed

commodity market pricing. Its laboratories harbor a full array of diagnostic and research instrumentation
utilized for applied research, quality control, and product development of feed ingredients and feedstuffs.
Each year, MAFIC conducts hands-on vocational training courses for several hundred feed industry
workers and managers. MAFIC issues an annual report and an annual science report, containing
information on its applied research programs and progress. Animal science and nutrition undergraduate and
graduate students from China Agricultural University take feed formulation technology courses and carry
out graduate research work at the Center.
