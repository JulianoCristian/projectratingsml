impacts. Lessons learned suggest the following.\n            Sector work should be given particular attention, since\n            structural or institutional changes in the sector may occur\n            between the time sector studies are conducted, and the time\n            appraisal takes place, specifically, in identifying sector\n            constraints, and evaluating both the implementing agency\n            capacity, and the selection criteria for participating\n            enterprises. On the business environment, participating\n            enterprises must be willing to innovate, build sound\n            management teams, and prepare a realistic business plan.\n            Likewise, the competitiveness of foreign currency\n            denominated loans for sub-borrowers should be evaluated, in\n            particular when the major investment items - equipment and\n            works - are locally available, and major project outputs are\n            destined for domestic market. Under these circumstances,\n            foreign exchange risks, and more competitive local currency\n            loans tend to discourage the use of dollar denominated\n            loans. Finally, financial intermediaries should be chosen\n            based on their local knowledge, i.e., conducting a thorough\n            research on the intermediary's prior sector, and\n            regional experience."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
