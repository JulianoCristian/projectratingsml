Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance is highly satisfactory. A number of key lessons,\n            both positive and negative, were learned during project\n            implementation: 1) In a rapidly changing business and\n            lending climate, slowness in loan processing could make IBRD\n            loans: (a) less competitive in a fast evolving domestic\n            lending market; and (b) less attractive to effective\n            end-users who strive for efficiency. 2) Greater flexibility\n            in project design and implementation is essential to\n            successful commercial operations. Under the project: (a) the\n            Special Accounts, intended to provide fund liquidity, were\n            not wholly made use of; (b) some Bank procedures such as\n            cattle procurement arrangements for smallholders were\n            unworkable; and (c) the rigid prescriptions in project\n            design of smallholder production models were not responsive\n            to rapidly changing market conditions and farmer demands.\n            However, the Bank showed great flexibility when it adopted\n            more appropriate cattle procurement procedures and updated\n            production models. 3) The government's strong\n            commitment to reforms and continuous support to the\n            integrated cattle breeding, production, processing and\n            marketing system have been the foundation of the project\n            design and the primary force for project implementation as\n            well as the close cooperation between government agencies at\n            various levels. 4) An effective project management\n            structure, committed project staff, and strong emphasis on\n            monitoring and evaluation contributed significantly to\n            successful project preparation and implementation."}, "docdt": "2006-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
