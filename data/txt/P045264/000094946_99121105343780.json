Development\n            Project aims at improving cattle productivity, through an\n            increased efficiency of converted low-value crop residues,\n            into high-value beef, and beef products. It will further\n            promote marketing linkages on cattle profitability,\n            integrating markets, producers, and processors into a\n            demand-oriented marketing system. The project components\n            will: 1) improve cattle breed, suitable for commercial\n            production, while preserving indigenous breeds. It will\n            strengthen the efforts of provincial governments in cattle\n            breed improvement, upgrading beef bull stations, and where\n            necessary, will import bulls for cross-breeding. Artificial\n            insemination will be complemented with new frozen-straw\n            technology, to improve the genetic system. Cattle\n            vitamin-mineral molasses blocks will be produced, through a\n            pilot plant; 2) increase cattle production, as a result of\n            the cattle breed and feed improvements, and, adequate\n            veterinary services, and animal husbandry practices. With\n            forage enhancement technologies available, sub-components\n            will include household cow-calf raising and cattle\n            fattening, and small-scale commercial feedlots; 3) support\n            cattle and beef market development, as well as upgrade\n            slaughtering/processing facilities, for quality assurance\n            participation; 4) assist the government, by strengthening\n            institutional capacity for better international\n            compatibility practices."}, "docdt": "1999-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
