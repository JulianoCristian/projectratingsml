Henan,\n            Shanxi, and Anhui. For each province, this resettlement\n            report includes a resettlement issues matrix, a listing of\n            all project sites and uses, and detailed compensation\n            budgets. The project is designed to maximize the use of land\n            and facilities already in use for cattle production, rather\n            than acquiring new sites or facilities. Since beef cattle\n            raising does not require expensive arable land, most of the\n            land sites have been specifically selected on non-inhabited,\n            non-cultivated waste lands or on land already owned by the\n            sponsoring production units. No persons are scheduled for\n            resettlement. Compensation applies only to compensation for\n            newly acquired land to be occupied for project activities.\n            All other land to be used for project activities is already\n            owned by the project sponsors and does not require\n            compensation. In case that resettlement is necessary, this\n            report covers the resettlement principles and policy to be\n            followed. A land acquisition monitoring structure will be\n            set up as part of the overall project management infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1999-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
