support\n            service systems in China. This report describes the measures\n            planned to mitigate negative environmental impacts\n            associated with this project. Every dust outlet will have a\n            dust absorption cover and pipeline system connected to a\n            dust collector. Installing silencers and noise-proof\n            facilities will reduce noise and establishing regulations\n            will direct the use of protective equipment. In workshop\n            areas and wherever there is a high concentration of ambient\n            dust, dust monitoring and alarm systems will be installed.\n            Fire hazard and control measures include hydrants, fire\n            extinguishers, and pressure equalization openings.\n            Feedlot-discharged wastewater coming from cattle urine, shed\n            washing, cattle cooling, and worker living will be mitigated\n            by daily watering and site cleaning. There will be regular\n            monitoring of groundwater quality and odors, and structures\n            intended to treat sewage, like sedimentation ponds and berm\n            dikes will be installed along with a manure disposal plan.\n            Cattle waste and feed residual can be mixed and piled and\n            used as organic fertilizer. Trees will be planted around the\n            feedlot and the market. Environmental training will be\n            provided to farmers and administrative staff. A resettlement\n            plan will compensate project affected persons."}, "docdt": "1998-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
