The Government and\n            the Bank selected a basic strategy to deal with the problem.\n            First, the need for a detailed study of the sector was\n            clear. This study was to begin as soon as possible and cover\n            the analysis of investment programs, organization and\n            operations, and transport policies. Second, immediate\n            implementation of certain improvements was possible, such as\n            readjustment of rates, elimination of excessive personnel,\n            closing of uneconomic services, and stopping of untimely\n            construction of new facilities. These actions were to form\n            the backbone of a short-term transport policy. Once the\n            studies were completed, new investment projects were to be\n            started and old ones which proved economically feasible were\n            to be continued, and the sector was to be reorganized\n            following the recommendations. The Government and the Bank\n            concurred that this was the best course to follow."}, "docdt": "1976-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
