ZAMBIA
rPLROLEUM SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCrION
1.1          Zambia is a landlocked country in southem central Africa with a land mass of
753,000 km2: i. shares borders with Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
Tanzania, Zaire and Zimbabwe. The closing of Zambia's southern border and the imposition of
economic sanctions on Rhodesia in 1965 constrained the supply of petroleum fuels. To ensure a
steady supply of petroleum products, the construction of the 1710 km Tnzama Pipeline, from Dar-
es-Salaam, Tanzania to Ndola, Zambia, was completed in 1968. The pipeline was onvertea into
crude oil service in 1973 when the Indeni Refinery at Ndola was commissioned. Pipeline leakage
due to external and inte    corrosion became serious in the early 1980s, causing in loss of oil
and serious pollution in Tanzania. The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) iniated
steps in rehabilitating the pipeline as a priority, but this had to be done in stages according to
priorities because of shortage of funds. The first stage with Zambia Industial and Mining
Corporation's (ZIMCO) own financing and the second stage (with European Investment Bank
(EIB) and Italian Government fiancing) are complete: the third stage (with African Development
Bank (ADB) financing) is nearing completion.
1.2          The emergency which caused the initial pipeline and the philosophy of the
Government at that time made it natural for the pipeline and refinery to be publicly owned.
However, Zambia is now committed to using the private sector for business activities, and is
seelng to transfer virtually all parastatals to private ownership. This project seeks to modify
Zambi's policies in the petroleum sector so that all activities can gradually be passed to the
private sector, and supports the completion of the rehabilitation of the Tazama pipeline. It also
supports modification of the national storage facilities and the provision of working capital finance
so that private sector oil companies can take ownership of the oil as soon as it is offloaded at Dar-
es-Salarn. These changes are important as being the means of maximing private sector activity.
Fuil details ar set out in the GRZ's Letter of Petroleum Sector Policy (Annex 1.1).
1.3          To make Zambia's system suitable for major private sector operators, the
rehabilitation of the Tazama pipeline must be completed. The fourth and final stage of this is
under consideration; GRZ has asked IDA for assistance in financing rehabilitation of: O) the
unimproved portions of the Tazama Pipeline; (ii) the facilities for reducing the cost of supply and
distribution of petroleum products; and (iii) technical assistance for improving the managerial
capacity in Tazama and monitoring and regulatory functions in the Ministry of Energy and Water
Development (MEWD). This project will establish a reliable and cost effective system for: (X)
transportation of refinery feedstock or required products; and (ii) supply and distribution of
petroleum produets. To evaluate the scope and to arrive at a comprehensive and least cost
rehabilitation/efficiency improvement program, IDA financed the Tazama Pipeline Engineering
Project (Cr. 1627-ZA) which evaluated the physical condition of the pipeline and associated
facilities, and prepared a comprehensive rehabilitation program Becmase of severe corrosion,
parts of the pipeline required attention even before the engineering study was completed. At the
time the engineering study was completed, IDA had suspended isbu ts o Zambia, and was
unable to proceed. In view of the emergency, Italy, EIB and ADB provided financial assistance
amounting to US$42 million equivalent to implement the emergency rehabilitation repairs in three



-2
stages. The remaining rehabilitation work for the Tazama pipeline would be addressed in the
proposed project.
1.4          Engineering studies, financed under the Indeni Refinery Engineering Loan (Loan
2151-ZA), evaluated several options for modernizing the refinery and conserving energy. These
options included upgrading the refinery through installing visbreakers or hydrocrackers. At the
then differential between crude oil and petroleum product prices, this investment looked
interesting but required capital investments beyond the czpabilities of Zambia and Indeni. Laer
discussions between the Bank and 3RZ reviewed updated data on operating cost, fuel
consumption and losses by Indeni refinery and ZIMOILJ/, and concluded that the refinery
operation was economically marginal, and that moderization could not be justified. In
consultation with GRZ and ZIMCO, the economic viability of shutfing down the refey and
converting the Tazama pipeline into a product pipeline to reduce the cost of bulk transport of
petroleum products was found to be the most promising long-term option which will also
encourage regional exports of products imported from Dar-es-Salaam. However, this cannot be
started until repairs to the Dar-es-Salaam tanks and rehabilitation of the pipeline itself are
completed. This is expected to take between 2 and 3 years. Once the Tazama rehabilitation is
complete, Government will review the economics of using the pipeline for feedstock -nd will then
decide whether to keep the refinery in operation or convert it for the transnort of refined
petroleum products. Facilities for reducing the cost of bulk distribution of petroleum products
within Zambia are included in the proposed project.
1.5          There would be three project beneficiaries: (a) Tazama Pipelines Limited
(Tazama); (b) a Zambia Oil Company (ZOC), a new company to be set up to take over some of
ZIMOIL's activities (para. 3.9); and (c) MEWD. Tazama is a joint venture between the
Governments of Zambia and Tanzania and has been operating for the past 25 years under an
Iernational Convention signed in January 1967. The Government of Tanzania fMlly supports the
project and has reconfirmed its commitment to the 1967 Convention through the life of the
project. Although Zambia would be the sole beneficiary of the proposed project, Tanzania will
be a signatory to the recommendations of the International Development Statutory Committee to
be established pursuant to section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association. Tte Zambia Oil Company will be formed as a parastatal to replace ZIMOIL as the
importer of feedstock and (initially) as the owner of the Ndola storage facilities. The remainig
responsibilities of ZIMOIL, to own the feedstock in the Tazama and Indeni systems, to negotate
agreements with Tazama and Indeni for transport and refining of oil, and to operate the Ndola
storage, will be transferred to a Consortium of Oil Companies.
1.6          Ihe project is estimated to cost about US$48 million equivalent including US$45
million in foreign exchange. The proposed IDA Credit is for US$30 million equivalent out of
which US$2.8 million will be used for technical assistance to MEWD: US$25.1 million will be
onlent to Tazama and US$2.1 million will be onlent to ZOC. The IDA credit would finance 67
percent of the foreign exchange cost; the balance of US$15 million equivalent would be financed
in parallel by EIB. The local currency cost of US$3 million equivalent would be financed by
MEWD, Tazama and ZOC.
I/    ZIMOIL is ZIMCO's division responsible for oil procurement, for storage and ewports to
neigboring countries and for arranging transport and refining of petroleum products.



-3-
1.7          The Tazama Pipeline is the least cost and cnly, potentially reliable mode of
transport of petroleum for Zambia. Over the past ten years lack of maintenance, extera
corrosion due to failure of the pipeline coating and the effect of the low resistivity "black-cotton"
soil, and internal corrosion due to persistent incursion of sea water into the pipeline from the
Single Point Mooring (SPM) system offshore Dar-es-Salaam haroor, have caused seriouxs
deterioration to the pipeline and its associated facilities. The proposed final stage of rehabilitation
will consolidate the benefits of three previous stages of rehabilitation and prevent collapse of the
pipeline system. The cost of rehabilitation is significantly lower than the investment required for
the next best alternative-the Tazara Railway.
1.8          The goal of the Ban:'s strategy for Zambia is to assist the Goverunent to achieve
sustainable economic growth. This translates into a three-pronged strategy of direct assistame
aimed at: (a) supporting policy reform and providing balance of payments support through
adjustment operations; (b) improving the enabling environment for private sector growth through
project investments in infrastructure and human resources; and (c) targeting the poor and
vulnerable groups with programs in agriculture and social services and ensuring that
environmnal issues are addressed promptly. These interventions are mutually supportive and
mutually reinforcing. The Petroleum Rehabilitation Project dird*ty supports improving the
enabling environment for private sector growth, and minimizing environmental problems. It
indirectly supports poverty alleviationobjectives through improving the reliability and efficiency
of petroleum supplies.
1.9          The proposed project is consistent with the Government's focus on rehabilitatg
existng facilities and avoiding large new investments. The project primarily aims to achieve: (a)
the restructring of the oil industry in Zambla (b) the enhanced activity of the private sector in a
commercial manner; and (c) the reform of the pricing system for petroleum products. At the
same tm  it would also address: (i) the issue of least cost petroleum supply in its entirety; (ii)
take remedial measures for the pipeline corrosion and related problems; (iii) deal with the
management and insttiona  aspects to improve efficiency and prevent recurrence of the
problems; (iv) reduce the cost of bulk transportation of products; and (v) increase energy
conservation and reduce costs of internal distribution. The project was appraised in June, 1993.

H. THE ENERGY SECTOR
2.1          Zambia's considerable indigenous energy resources, especially woodfuels,
hydropower and coal satisfy almost 90 percent of the country's energy needs. The energy supply
consists of domestically produced hydropower (12.2%), coal (5.2%), fuelwood and charcoal
(70.1%), and imported petroleum (12.3%). Final domestic energy consumption in 1992 totalled
about 4.6 million tons of oil equivalent (toe), of which household accounts for 62.8%, mining
14.2%, industry and commerce 11.5%, transport 6.8%, agriculture and forestry 2% and
Goverament and services 2.6%2/. Of the total energy consumption, commercial energy
accouned for 1.4 million toe, or about 31.1%, which is high for a low-income country. Per
capita annual commercial energy consumption of about 379 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) in
1991 was the fourth from the highest (602 kgoe for China, 594 kgoe for Egypt and 517 kgoe for
Zimbabwe) among the low income countriesl/. Copper mining is the largest energy consumer,
accounting for 45.7% of total commercial energy demand, followed by transport 22%, industry
and commercial 16.2%, and Government and services 8.5%. The major sources of commercial
energy supply are petroleum (41.7%), electricity (40.9%) and domestic coal (17.4%).
Eleic Power
2.2          Zambia has ample hydropower potential; the reserves at exploitable hydro sites
are estimatd at 4,000 MW. The total installed power-generating capacity is 1,778 MW, of
which 94% is hydro-power. Because of the abundant hydro supply, excess capacity (total demand
of around 1,500 MW) and the well established high voltage grid, the marginal cost of power is
low. Virtualy all electricity is supplied by the Zambia Electricity Supply Company (ZESCO),
which has an istalled capacity of 1,640 MW4/. The Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) operates four gas turbine generators and a waste heat plant in the Copperbelt, which are
on cold standby, and the hydro station which provides electricity for the mines at Kabwe.
ZESCO also transmits and distributes electricity direcdy to consumers through the network which
covers most urban areas. The power system consists of the main grid and the isolated systems.
The main grid comprises the major power stations in the south of the country and the
transmission lines and substations which serve the main load centers in the north. The isolated
system comprises the mini hydro power stations and diesel power stions that serve the rural
areas. The power transmission system comprises 6,100 km at 330, 220, 88 and 66 kV, of which
1,900 km of 330 kV lines connects the major power stations.
2.3          The Zambian power system is interconnected at high voltage with the systems of
Zimbabwe, Zaire and Botswana. Under the axisting power exchange arrangements, Zambia has
reciprocal access to standby capacity from Zimbabwe and Zaire, and exports power to the
2/ The national energy balance for 1992 is provided in Annex 2.1.
I/ Ihe commercial energy consumption per capita in 1965 was the highest among the low-income
countries, at 464 kilograms of oil equivalent. The consumption dropped by about 18 percent from
1965 to 1991.
&1 Out of 1,640 MW, the total insIled capacity of hydro power plants is 1,632 MW: Kafue Gorge
Power Station (900 MW), Kariba North Bank (600 MW), Victoria Falls (108 MW), Lusiwasi (12
MW), Chshimba Falls (6 MW), Musonda Falls (5 MW) and Lunzua (0.75 MW).



.5-
northeastern region of Botswana. Because of the commissioning of a thermal power station in
Zimbabwe, the major importer of power from Zambia, the exports of power have declined since
1982 when 37% of electricity generated was exported. In 1990 total exports declined to 657
GWh, accounting for 11% of total power generated; exports were badly affected by the fire at
Kafue Gorge Power Station. i)uring 1992/93, covering a year of extensive drought, exports
increased to 921.2 GWh.
2.4          In 1992 elecuricity consumption in Zambia reached about 6,163 GWh and the peak
demand on the system was about 993 MW. Annual consumption growth was maitained at 1.7
percent over ten years (1980-1990). Mining demand for electricity accounts for 71%, industry
and commerce 10%, household 9%, government and services 7% and agriculture and forestry
3%.
2.5          In response to the serious drought, ZESCO imposed seven-hour power blackouts
in September 1992 for domestic and agricultural consumers. Industrial and commercial
consumers could choose between a weeldy ration of four days of full supply or a full week of half
day supplies. Hospitals, the maize-milling companies and ZCCM were exempt from the supply
uts. In November when the rain started, the limit for domestic and agricultural consumers was
lifted.

Coal
2.6          Coal production at Maamba Colliery in the mid-Zambezi basin has falen
gradually from a peak of 790,000 tons in 1975 to 377,000 tons in 1990. The decline in
production started around 1980 mainly because of inadequate repair and maintenance of plant and
equipment and poor mine design. Production fell short of domestic demand in FY84 requiring
58,000 tons of coal to be imported from Zimbabwe. A rehabilitation program in FY86 restored
production capacity and increased production by 53,000 tons. Since the rehabilitation, the market
demand for coal has fallen and Maamba has been unab!e to sell the producible capacity. Maamba
Colliery estimates that proved and probable reserves total about 91 million tons of which proved
reserves amount to around 58 million tons of coal with a high ash contend/, and that proved
open pit reserves of saleable coal total at least 13 million tons, sufficient for 25 years production
at a production rate of around 500,000 tons. The major consumers are copper mines, accounting
I/ Ihe calorific value of one ton of Maamba coal is estimated at 0.6 toe.

for about 50% of total domestic coal sales. Coal consumption in the copper mines has declined
rfiecting the shift to fuel oil in the 1970s.
2.7          The cost of producing Coa is high, in part due to lack of foreign exchange to
purchase necessary parts to replace and maintain equipment. The railway system for delivering
coal from the Colliery to the main trunk line and to the copper mines at Ndola is inefficient.
From time to time coal has to rely on road transport, raising costs substantially.

Woodfuels and Charcoal
2.8           The woodlands and forests, covering about 50 million ha (66 percent of Zambia's
total land area), yield over 20 million cubic meters of wood annually, which satisfies 70 percent
of tie nation's total energy needs. About 87 percent of woodfuels are consumed by households;
in rural areas, fuel consumption is in the form of firewood; in urban areas mainly in the form of
chwcoal.
2.9          Charcoal and fdelwood account for more than 95% of household energy
requirments. About 75% of urban households depend totally on charcoal for cooking and water
and space heating, consuming 1,370 kg annually. In 1992, Zambian urban households consumed
about 667,000 tons of charcoal.
2.10         Per capita annual consumption of fuelwood was about 730 kg and of charcoal
about 100 kg. The total national wood consumption is estimated at 15.7 million m3 (11 milion
tons), of which 14.4 million mi is consumed by housebolds as fuelwood and 1.3 million m' as
roundwood and sawnwood.
2.11         The esdmated current sustainable yield of forests and sawn woodlands (19-24
million in) and the current consumption of woodfuels and sawn wood (16-17 million ni) suggest
that wwoodftel demand is not causing general deforestation. However, deforestation locally could
be in prowspect because of Ci) regional imbalances between woodfuel supply and demand, and (ii)
agcultural land clearing. There is localized deforestaion caused by woodfuel gathering along
the line of ran.

Other Renewable Energy
2.12         Involvement with new and renewable sources of energy has been limited. Ihe
potential applications of solar energy (for cooling, water heating and fish and vegetable drying),
wind energy (for water pumping), biomass and geothermal energy have been reviewed. Solar
energy through photovoltaic technology is being used in a small way in remote areas for lighting,
refrigeration and water pumping.
Energ EMcency and Substitution
2.13         The Government seeks to promote energy efficiency and fuel substitution,
specifically a reduction in oil consumption. In 1983 the Department of Energy (DOE) launched
the national energy conservation and management program for the    uc   industry, the
mining industry and the service and commercial industry to identify energy conservation and
substitution opportunities. From the series of energy surveys at 30 industa plants, DOE
concluded that management of the plants could reduce expenditure of energy by between 7 and 33
percent In 1986, Kafue Textiles replaced a fuel oil boiler with an electric boiler at the cost of
US$1.1 million; this reduced annual energy costs by US$869,000. Between 1986 and 1987, at
Kapiri Glass Products, because of low cost energy saving investments, the production rate rose by
50 percent whfle the total energy cost fell by 22 percent.
2.14         The energy audits carried out up to 1990 estimated that about 330 MW of
electricity would be required to substitute for diesel and light fuel oil consumed in non-mining
industries. However, the analysis did not establish the investment required in new electricity
supply facilities to satisfy increased power demand. The ZCCM consumption of fuel oil is
essnial to balance the refinery product slate, and any switch from fuel oil demand will constrain
the refinery's ability to produce white products. ZCCM has looked into the possibility of using
more coal and found it to be uneconomic under the present circumstances.
Sector Organition
2.15         In the energy sector, there are three types of institution: (i) the Central
Govnment; (ii) Public Enterprises; and (iii) a private sector more efficient than the public
sector, but not highly competitive with each other. The Central Government is responsible for
energy policy and plang. In 1991, the new Government consolidated the responsibility for
energy under a single portfolio in the newly-ceted MEWD, which consists of five separate
units: the Zambezi River Authority (jointly-owned by the Zimbabwean Government, 50/50), the
Departmnt of Water Affairs, the Water Board, the National Energy Council (NEC) and the



-8-
Department of Energy (DOE). The energy component is handled by NEC and DOE. NEC acts
as policy adviser to the Ministry and is responsible for integrating the plans of the various sectoral
institutions, while DOE concentrates on technical/administrative advisory services. Both units are
weak in technical and analytical capacities and require recruiting more qualffied candidates and
providing suitable training. MEWD is responsible for providing energy policy guidelines to the
ZIMCO group companies; Indeni, ZIMOIL, Tazama and ZESCO.
2.16         The Hydrocarbon Unit, which regulates exploration activities, is under the
Geological Survey Department of Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development. The Department
is responsible for licensing coal exploration and production. The Departm   of Forestry under
the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is responsible for forestry management
including the availability of woodfuel. Although coal and charcoal are important energy sources
in the country, MEWD is not responsible for the production policy of these fuels.
Za  ian Regulatory Agendes
2.17         During 1994 Zambia will establish a system for regulating prices and performance
of the public utilities. The Government will establish an autonomous Energy Regulatory Board.
Zambia will also establish a Monopolies Commission to monitor and investigate anti-competitive
practices. Until these agencies are established, a separate division within ZIMCO will take care
of the udlities and the operations of the three strategic companies in the petroleum sector, acing
as the initial regulator. Except for their toll services, Tazama and Indeni are likely to be
regulated by contract. Each utility, together with ZIMOIL, Tazama and Indeni has prepared
proposals for periodic price adjustment to reflect changes in costs and exchange rate; a system for
each entity is now operational.
The Petroleum Subsector
2.18         Under ZIMCO, the holding company, several energy parastatas operate: ZESCO,
Maamba Colliery, Tazama, Indeni, ZIMOIL, as do partnerships between ZIMCO and two
multinational oil companies involved in petroleum distribution (BP and AGIP)6/. In the
petroleum subsector, most policy decisions such as pricing, tariffs and investment are initated by
the energy parastatals.
2.19         The public sector is concentrated mainly in activities that have limited scope for
competition and require large investments, such as pipeline, storage and wholesale supply
facilities. The Indeni refinery is jointly owned by Government (50%) and by the private sector
(50% AGIP) which manages its operations. The product distribution and retail sales are handled
exclusively by the five private and joinly-owned oil marketing companies who own and opert
storage depots. The sales and individual market shares of 1992 are:
{/ AGIP (ambia) and BP (Zambia) are 50/50 joint ventures with the Government.

The retail outlets are owned by local private businessmen as dealerships and the road transport is
contracted to public and private transport companies. The rail tank wagons used by the marketing
companies are owned and operated by Zambia Railways (ZR). Tazara Railways does not
transport refined petroleum products in Zambia. Petroleum products not produced by Indeni
(mostly lubricants, greases and specialty products) are imported by the marketing companies
directly.
Hydrocarbon Potential
2.20         Zambia has four sedimentary basins. The Western Zambia Basin is the largest: it
covers 180,000 km2 of Western Zambia and extends to Botswana and Angola. Under Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project (Ln. 2152-ZA) funded by the World Bank, an aeromagnetic survey
over the country and a limited gravity survey were conducted. The countrywide geological work
identified two prospective areas: the Luangwa Valley and part of the Western Zambia Basin.
Two companies (Placid Oil Company and Mobil Oil Company) eventually entered into agreements
with the Government for exploration. Having had no positive result from exploration, both
companies relinquished the exploration acreage by mid-1988. Placid and Mobil expressed an
interest in the north of Lake Kariba, which was not included in the initial offering from the
Government, but Placid did not pursue this matter further. Mobil still possesses a concession on
the Zimbabwean and Zambian sides of the Zambezi River.
2.21         The Luangwa Basin7/ is still perceived to be promising for oil and gas;
however, considering the country's sluggish economy, the lack of foreign exchange and the high
risk of the investments, publicly-finded petroleum exploration should not be a priority.
Petroleum Demand
2.22         Domestic petroleum demand depends on the level of activity in the mining sector.
The total sales of petroleum products reached a peak of 818,565 tons in 1976/77. In the next ten
years, the total sales declined by over 35.4% to 528,858 tons in 1986/87. The petroleum
consumption profile, as in most developing countries, is dominated by middle distillates
(kerosene, jet fuel and diesel). The share of middle distillates was 52.4% in 1984 and around
60% during 1991-93.
1/ The Luangwa Valley, part of the Rift Valley has shown some potential.

2.23           The domestic demand growth scenario and the consumption pattern are
unlikely to change significanly in the medium-term because: (a) restrictions on Government
expenditures and scarcity of external resources for investments are expected to continue for
some time; and (b) copper production is expected to decline. Because of the Government's
implementation of structural adjustment program, total petroleum product demand over the
next ten years is predicted to grow at about 2.2 percent per annum from 532,000 tons in 1993
to 646,000 tons in 2002.

Potential Regional Market
2.24          The amount of fuel oil and bitumen demand (103,769 tons including 5,200
tons of bitumen in 1992/93, of which 77,870 tons of fuel oil is for the mining sector and
20,699 tons for industries) detennines the maximum feedstock mix throughput that the
refinery can process without generating excess fuel oil which cannot be sold. The present
demand level limits refining capacity to about 700,000 tons. As long as the refinery is
operated, for geographical and cost reasons the exports will be dimlted at around 75,000 tons
per anmnm (tpa) of white products mainly to the Shaba area of Zaire. Competition in the
Southern Zambia market is expected from the neighboring region by competitive pricing
especially by South Africa. Competition in supplying the Malawi mcrket results from moving
products from Dar-es-Salaam to Malawi by rail through the new Tanzanian facilities.
Inefficient operation of the Zambian rail system impedes export promotion.
Petroleum Refinng
2.25         The Indeni Refinery at Ndola was commissioned in 1973. Its design capacity
is 25,000 barrels per stream day (bpsd) or about 1.1 miUion tpa of feedstock. It was designed
to process Iranian Light crude with a flexibility of spiking products up to 25 percent of the
throughput. Since the refinery is a simple hydroskimming plant, the product yield mix can be
changed only by altering the quantity of products spiked in the feedstock. At present the level
of reduced crude in the mix is limited by the demand for fuel ofl and bitumen. Because of
the high percentage of light products in the feedstock, the refinery's capacity is constrained at
about 750,000 tpa. Any sigmficant increase in light products spiking at this capacity level
would result in poor product separaion and deterioration of product quality. Being designed
before the 1973 increase in oil prices, the refinery fuel consumption and loss is on the high
side (7 to 8% against the current industry norm of about 4% for such straight-run crude oil
refineries). To improve fuel efficiency through energy conservation and increase distillation
capacity, the refinery management has developed various proposals costing in the range of
US$1.0 million. Options for the future of Indeni include conversion to a bulk terminal, and
keeping Indeni operating as now but with improved efficiency.

Petroeum Distribution
2.26          The refinery feed-stock received at the terminal in Dar-es-Salaam is
transported to Ndola by the Tazama Pipeline. Apart from the storage capacity at the terminal
(6 tanks of 38,000 cubic meter-about 30,000 metric tons-capacity each), the pipeline itself
has a holding capacity of about 117,000 cubic meters of-92,000 metric tons-feedstock.
ZIMOIL purchases the crude and owns it until required products from it are sold to the
distributors. This modus operandi has prevailed over the last two decades, and therefore
during that period the private sector distributors have not used the pipeline for "own imports".
The refined products (except fuel oil, LPG, and some bitumen) are transferred to the adjacent
terminal, owned by ZIMOIL, by interconnected pipelines. ZIMOIL sells all the products in
bulk to the oil marketing companies for distribution throughout the county. Nearly 90
percent of the refined products are transported from the ZIMOIL terminal by road: the rest
are sent by rail. The road system, although expensive, is widely used because the railway is
inefficient and has limited rail load/unloading facilities. 15 engines were added in 1992 and
50 new tank wagons to be added in 1986. Nevertheless, turn-around remains poor. This is
attributable to the absence of full-train loading at Ndola and unloading facilities at Lusaka and
in the Southern regis.
Peoleum Product Pridng
2.27          Wholesale prices for all petroleum products are fixed by ZIMOIL allowing for
procurement cost, Tazaa's transport charges, the refinery processing fee and storage costs.
The Government levies duties on most products. The marketers' margins and inland transport
costs have been negotiated with the Government from time-to-time to adjust for changes in the
cost of operations and to ensure an agreed return on investment. Prices were not linked to
intenational prices, and until recently have not been regularly updated. The new pricing
system now in place is part of the parastatal reforms under the Privatization and Industrial
Reform Adjustment Credit (PIRC), intended to ensure that prices are adjusted promptly
product by product to reflect import costs. To be assured of a sound petroleum products
pricing policy, Government agreed that GRZ/ZOC would review petroleum product
prices at least monthly, and would adjust prices as required to reflect all domestic and
foreign costs, including those caused by devaluation of the Kwacha. IDA will review the
level and structre of petroleum prices with the Government at least twice yearly. Current
wholesale ex-Ndola terminal and Lusaka ex-pump prices are shown in Table 2.8.

2.28         The (weighted) composite price for bulk sales (based on the white products) at
the Ndola terminal Is about 138 percent of the sum of the average feedstock price CIF Dar-es-
Salaam price (US$165.94/ton), plus cost of pipeline transport (US$22/ton), refining
(US$23/ton), Ndola terminal fee (US$0.94/ton), and financing cost (1% of CIF Dar-es-
Salaam). Until December 1992 the full cost of imports was passed on to customers, but price
controls were reintroduced with the devaluation at the beginning of 1993. The Goverment
then increased the prices to be comparable with import parity prices by the end of June 1993.
Subject to ZOC operating efficiently, the current objective is to recover the losses incured
before June 1993 through the pridng system, before December 31, 1994. Government
confirmed this at negotiations. The next stage in development of pricing policy is to define
a mechanism for seting and revising margins, and for adjusting for changes in transport
costs. The Government engaged a consultant and confimed that a report would be and be
forwarded to IDA in September 1994. Implementation of the first stage of
recommendations, as agreed with IDA, will be a condition of effectiveness.
Government's Energy Sector Objectives and Development Plans
2.29         The investment framework in the energy sector continues to stress the
maintenance and rehabilitation of infrastructure and completion of projects already started
rather than the conception of new projects. Over the last few years, the Government made it
a priority to complete Phase Im of the Kafue Gorge Rehabilitation, the Victoria Falls Power
Station Rehabilitation, the Lusaka Reinforcement Power Project, the Taama Pipeline
Rehabilitation and the Indeni Oil Refinery Rehabilitation. Out of US$2.1 billion, the total
investment program for the period 1993-1995, the Govermment plans to invest US$131
million (6.2%) in the sector. Priority investment for the period also includes reinforcement of
the distribution networks in Lusaka and around the Copperbelt towns, the electrification of the
Mkushi Farm Block and rehabilitation of the Tazama Pipeline.
2.30         To improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of the labor employed, the
workforce must be reduced. While ZIMOIL and Indeni management agree in principle on
reducing the workforce, no time-bound action program is available yet. Tazama submitted a
proposal to reduce the workforce by 123 personnel (21%) and has implemented it. The
others are still submitting such proposals. The Bank recommends creating a competitive
environment through contractual performance standards for Tazama and the Indeni refinery
and petroleum product pricing reforms including wholesale and retail margins, as a step
toward full deregulation.
2.31         The economic benefits can be maximized if the existing pipeline is converted
to transport refined petroleum products and the refinery operations are suspended. The
pipeline would operate by carrying sequential batches, gasoline, kerosene and diesel; these
could be tapped off at points along the pipeline. The product line with depots along the line
would allow efficient and less costly distribution to the country's easte  regions and to
neighboring countries. Conversion requires investment, but this can be justified If product
exports to neighboring countries are vigorously pursued. As long as the refinery exists, the
pipeline should provide open-access to any importer (private companies should be alUowed to
procure feedstock Internaionally and use the pipeline for transporting it to the refinery).
ZIMOIL is prepared to consider proposals from the oil marketing companies to use the
suplus capacity available in the facilities of Tazama and the Indeni refnery and has informed



- 14-
the oil companies to this effect. The Government has confirmed that imports of petroleum
products are deregulated, subject to payment of appropriate taxes. Tazama and Indeni have
implemented toll tariffs for their services. Government has agreed to end controls on retail
prices before the end of 1996.
Role of the Bank Group In the Energy Sector and Lessons of Experience
2.32         The Bank's previous lending for energy in Zambia has focussed on the
development of hydropower generation, including expansion of the transmission network.
The Bank helped the Government prepare to rehabilitate the coal industry and to evaluate
options for modifying the country's only refinery. Bank assistance has especially helped to
strengthen the management and planning of key institutions in the energy sector, notably
ZESCO, ZIMCO, the Central Africa Power Corporation (CAPC, which the Bank helped
establish to encourage joint energy development between Zambia and Zimbabwe); the coal
industry; the energy planning function of the former Ministry of Power, Transport and
Communications; and the oil exploration promotion capacity of the Hydrocarbon Unit of the
Ministry of Mines. Technical assistance rendered under the UNDP/World Bank Energy
Sector Management Assistance Programme recommended institutional restructuring and other
improvements to enhance energy planning and coordination. The Bank's first loan (Loan 145-
RN, June 1956) was made before Zambia's independence, to assist with construction of the
Kariba Dam and the South Bank power station. The second loan (Loan 392-RN, October
1964)-the first to independent Zambia-helped to finance a 330 Kv high-tension transmission
line, the third (Loan 701-ZA, July 1970) was for the Kariba North Power Station. A fourth
operation (Loan 919-ZA, July 1973) helped to construct the Kafue Stage II hydroelectric
project and was followed by a supplementary loan for Kariba North in 1974. In 1982 an
engineering project was approved (Loan 2151-ZA, June 1982) to study the technical and
economic feasibility of modifying the Indeni Refinery. The Bank also funded (through Loan
2152-ZA, June 1982) detailed geologic, aeromagnetic and gravity surveys to gather and
organize data for promoting exploration of hydrocarbons by foreign oil companies. In 1983 it
financed an engineering project (Credit 1333-ZA) to prepare for the rehabilitation of the
Maamba Colliery. An engineering credit (Credit 1627-ZA) supported a project to assess the
rehabilitation requirements of the Tazama pipeline.
2.33         Focussing on the problems identified by the studies under the IDA financed
engineering credit, a pipeline rehabilitation project was prepared and a Credit was negotiated
in July 1987. However, disbursements to Zambia were ..ispended from late 1987 to early
1991 and again from September 1991 to January 1992, and all IDA-financed assistance was
halted during these periods. Some of the most urgent parts of the project were carried out by
ADB and EIB. The proposed project completes the renaining rehabilitation work. It builds
on the Energy Sector Strategy prepared in 1988. The proposed project is consistent with
overall Bank strategy in the country in Its focus on strengthening basic infrastructure and in
its attention to environmental issues. Through dialogue with the Government, the Bank has
identified the following issues: (a) encouragement of private sector participation; (b) review
of the work of state-owned sector entities; (c) introduction of a competitive environment to the
supply of petroleum; (d) reform and subsequent deregulation of petroleum retail prices; and
(e) improvement in the efficiency of petroleum supply organizations througih performance
contracts with well defined targets. These issues and concerns will be addressed through the
proposed project.

(e) improvement in the efficiency of petroleum supply organizations through performance
contracts with well defined targets. These issues and concerns will be addressed through the
proposed project.
2.34         The policy of limiting new public sector investments to strictly essential items
will be exemplified by the proposed project. Before completion of the Project, Government
will not permit Indeni, Tazama and ZOC to undertake any new capital investment In
excess of US$5 million beyond those Included in the Project without first consultng with
IMA. The Bank's involvement was instrumental in rationalizing the management structure of
the agencies operating in the petroleum sector and in establishing training programs aiming (i)
at preventing the recurrence of maintenance problems which caused the current deterioration
of the facilities and (ii) at ensuring reliability of supply for Zambia and its neighbors.
Systematic Client Consultation
2.35         The project will make serious efforts to listen to the beneficiaries of the credit
and to adjust project components based upon feedback received. The primary beneficiaries of
the project are the MEWD, Tazama, ZOC and the oil marketing companies. Secondary
beneficiaries are the customers of the OMCs, but as the project is designed to prevent serious
problems arising, it is impractical to measure the results against the performance that was
likely to happen in the absence of the project.
2.36         There has already been extensive discussion with the MEWD, Tazama, ZOC
and OMC. We are preparing a baseline assessment of current performance, against which
future performance can be measured. Government is also setting up a mechanism for regular
consultation with the project beneficiaries, to ensure prompt feedback and corrections to the
project components as needed. It will be important to ensure that the training program is
implemented as planned, to ensure a thorough skills improvement and transfer of knowledge,
and to review this at the mid-term review. In this way the project implementation will be
monitored and corrected to take account of the concerns of the beneficiaries and to meet the
overall needs.

MI. THE AGENCIES OPERATING IN THE PEIOLEUM SECTOR
The Borrower and the Exec-uting Agencies
3.1          GRZ would be the borrower of the US$30 million Credit. The proceeds of
the Credit would be onlent to Tazama (US$25.1 million) and ZOC (US$2.1 million) as
executing agencies and the Government would retain US$2.8 million for MEWD. The
onlending terms (in US dollars) would be for 20 years including a grace period of five years
at an interest rate of 8% (equal to 1.1 times the prevailing IBRD interest rate). Tazama is a
majority-owned subsidiary of ZIMCO on behalf of GRZ, the minority share being owned by
the Government of Tanzarma. Execution of a subsidiary loan agreenent with Tazama will
be a condition of effectiveness. A separate entity, Zambia Oil Company (ZOC), will be
formed to manage the procurement of feedstock and to own the ZIMOIL bulk storage. ZOC
will replace ZIMOIL, currently a Division of ZIMCO. Incorporation of ZOC and
execution of a subsidiary loan agreement will be among the conditions of disbursement
for the ZOC component.
Ministry of Energy and Water Development (MEWD)
3.2          The petroleum supply in the country is within the portfolio of MEWD, which
is responsible for identifying, analyzing and formulating appropriate policies and strategies to
address current and emerging energy issues such as pricing reform and restructuring of sector
organzations. The Minister for Energy and Water Development is responsible for
coordinating all aspects of energy sector development in the country, including (a) overseeing
the preparation and implementation of the national energy strategy, the annual energy plan
and the rolling five year investment plan; (b) reviewing and advising on all significant energy
capital expenditures; and (c) advising on all energy policy issues, including price levels and
structures. The Ministry is inadequately staffed meet these responsibilities fully. ESMAP has
identified the technical assistance components needed to overcome this deficiency and develop
the Kmistry's policy function over the next year. The proposed project includes a component
for implementing this support.
3.3          The energy component of the MEWD's portfolio will be handled by the DOE.
Ihis Department's functions include (a) review of energy sector investment proposals for
consistency with the national energy strategy; (b) prioritization of potential investments by
financial and economic viability and contribution to the achievement of sector strategic
objectives; (c) maintenance of an energy data bank; (d) provision of technical advice; and (e)
analysis of energy prices in relation to economic efficiency. At present the Departme -- lacks
staff with the qualifications and experience to carry out any of these functions to the extent
needed.
Prastatal Energy Companies
3.4          ZIMCO was converted to an investment holding company from April 1, 1993
as part of the reorganization and privatization program of the Government. The ZIMCO
companies scheduled for privatization employ about 67,000 staff (approximaty 45% out of
ZIMCO's total employment of approx 150,000). In principle, all other ZIMCO companies
are aso to be privatized. ZIMCO itself is to be phased out during 1994 and 1995. The
present privatization program shows no Government plan for the sale of the three parastatal



- 17 -
utilities, ZIMOIL (and ZOC, its replacement), Tazama and Indeni. Except as initiated as part
of the proposed project, the privatization program will not affect ZOC, Tazama and Indeni in
the immediate future.
3.5          ZIMOIL is currently responsible for procurement, ownership and bulk storage
of feedstock, and for supervising transportation, processing and marketing of petroleum
products in Zambia. The ZIMOIL tasks will be divided between ZOC (for oil procurement)
and the Consortium of Oil Marketing Companies (OMCC) (ZIMOIL's remaining functions).
Petroleum products are imported by ZIMOIL on a competitive basis, which has already led to
significant cost savings. In its Letter of Sector Policy Government has confirmed that ZOC
would use international competitive bidding procedures for petroleum procurement. Because
of the need for stocks in Dar-es-Salaam as well as Ndola, and the time taken to pump
feedstock to Zambia, ZIMOIL typically owned the crude/products for 16 weeks before
payment by the distributors-an exceptionally favorable and low risk operating environment
for distributors. Successful oil importation depends on managing this financing problem. As
discussed below, the areas for improvement in ZIMOIL's operations are manpower levels,
time taken for loading of rail tankers and improved oil procurement.
3.6          Transportation Tazama's costs of bulk transportation (Dar-es-Salam to
Ndola) are low because of the age of the pipeline system and the use of historic cost for
depreciation. Losses are high and environmental damage has been significant at times.
Moreover, the exposed parts of the pipeline are at risk. Recurring leakages in the pipeline
have brought down the pressure for pumping. Tazama's pumping capacity is 1.1 million tpa
but is not fully used because of lack of Zambian demand and the pipeline leaks which would
follow higher pumping pressures. The major issues connected with Tazama are the need for
better performance, implementation of an improved pricing system, and whether the pipeline
should transport feedstock or products.
3.7          The Refinery at Indeni has been maintained in reasonable condition, but was
designed in an era of lower energy costs and lower expectations of efficiency. The major
issues connected with Indeni are the need for better performance, implementation of an
improved pricing system, and the long term role of Indeni.
3.8          Marketing is done mainly through the following five oil marketing
companies, BP Zambia Ltd., AGIP Zambia Ltd., Caltex Zambia Ltd., Mobil Zambia Ltd.
and Total Zambia Ltd. The major issues connected with the marketing companies are the
need to reform the pricing mechanisms and redetermination of the role of the companies in
relation to feedstock procurement. Although sales to large customers are competitive, in
retail marketing price competition Is not keen.
Proposed Institutional Reforms
3.9          The Ministry of Energy and Water Development has obtained Cabinet
endorsement of a fundamental reform of the energy sector. In relation to the petroleum sub-
sector the focus of the reform is to take Government out of the sector, and to liberalize in an
orderly manner. MEWD has discussed the changes with the oil marketing companies and
they have all expressed clear support.



- 18 -
3.10         In relation to the oil procurement role of ZIMOIL, the Government will
establish Zambia Oil Company (ZOC) as a replacement company to undertake international
procurement of refinery feedstock. Government will have a 'golden share' but to the extent
possible the shareholding will be in oil company and private ownership. Incorporation of
ZOC and execution of the ZOC Subsidiary Loan Agreement wiUl be a condition of
disbursement of funds allocated to ZOC. ZOC would engage a petroleum procurement expert
to supervise feedstock procurement, and would have a procurement supervisory committee to
ensure transparency. Procurement of feedstock will be through international competitive
bidding processes.
3.11         The Government objective is for ZOC to sell the feedstock to a consortium of
the oil marketing companies (OMCC) at the Dar-es-Salaam terminal as soon as it has arrived.
Arrangements have to be made for the consortium to finance the purchase of the linefill (the
oil in the tanks and pipeline, about $30 million). Government will take all measures
necear for the establishment of OMCC by not later than December 31, 1994, and
ZOC will implement agreed steps for OMCC to take over ownership of
feedstock/petroleum products by March 31, 1995. A timetable for implementation of these
arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, will be agreed.
3.12         OMCC would negotiate a transport contract with Tazama by March 31,
1995 which would have progressively tighter performance standards on operating
efciency and physical losses, recopizing the exchange adjustments in the tariff
structr
3.13         By March 31, 1995 the OMCC would negotiate a processing agreement
with Indeni with progressively tighter performance standards with respect to operating
efficiency, physical losses and operating costs, automatically taking into account exchange rate
adjustments in the processing fee. Privatization of Indeni is currently being studied, but is not
feasible until the pricing system has been reformed and a decision is taken on the longer term
role of the pipeline. Privatization of Tazama, if feasible, will be pursued late in the national
prvatization program, and after gaining experience of management through the performance-
based management contract.
3.14         Management of the Ndola storage terminal is to be pased to the OMCC,
prior to effectiveness of this credit. It is expected that ZIMCO will transfer ownership of
the terminal to ZOC, and initially ZOC will lease the facilities to OMCC for a two year
period, with OMCC having full responsibility for operations and maintenance on a contract
management basis. ZPA has commissioned a study on the Ndola terminal with a view to
deciding on whether in the medium-term to lease or sell the assets, recognizing the need to
protect the national interest, particularly, and the need to provide access to this facility for
newcomers licensed to market products in the country. ZOC will, for the initial two years,
retain responsibility for new investments including the proposed ZOC component of this
project.
3.15         OMCs would construct facilities at their Lusaka terminals to use the railways
for bulk transport of petroleum products to Lusaka (and possibly beyond) and negotiate a
transport contract with ZR with tight performance standards on travel time, wagon return
time, and physical losses. ZR will confirm its acceptance In principle of these standards
as a condition for disbursement for ZOC's Ndola component. In light of the proposed



- 19 -
modifications to the marketing companies' Lusaka facilities to allow full train unloading
facilities for all OMCs, any companies making investments that would benefit other OMCs
would negotiate a throughput agreement fee with other OMCs.
Staffing: Parastatal Energy Companies
3.16         The ZIMCO holding company role has been reduced to providing a chairman
for each company (a Group Investment Director) and to financial controls and group legal
services. The energy companies fall under the Director for Utilities and Services. This same
director is responsible for the interim regulatory system. The longer term arrangements
resulting from the phasing out of ZIMCO have not yet been determined.
ZIMOIL
3.17         The ZIMOIL Division employs 75 operating and administrative staff members

ZIMOIL. The present organization chart of ZIMOIL is given in Annex 3.1. All positions
are fiiled by local recruitment. The ZIMOIL terminal has prepared a proposal for reducing
its workforce by replacing existing security personnel by hiring a private security service to
do the work on a contract basis. This proposal, which is expected to save about 8.5 million
Kwacha per year, is yet to be approved by the management. Under the proposed project, the
management of the bulk storage will be passed to OMCC, and the OMCC wil determine the
performance standards. Tnese will be revised and (as appropriate) incorporated into the
regulatory system.
Tazama Pipelines Ltd. (Tazama)
3.18         The 586 personnel working in Tazama earlier had been reduced to 474 as of
June 14, 1993, resulting in a net saving of 97 million kwacha per year. The organization
chart is given in Annex 3.2. While not eliminating overmanning, this action goes far towards
achieving the appropriate level. Tazama has entered into a performance contract with
ZIMOIL, and in due course will enter one with OMCC, setting out the standards to be
achieved.
Indeni Petroleum Refinery Company Ltd. (Indeni)
3.19         Indeni currently employs 402 personnel, equally spread between engineering,
production and finance/administration. There are six expatriates-five AGIP seconded staff



- 20 -
and one other non-Zambian. Indeni is also reducing Its manpower but has yet to present a
concrete proposal showing the plan and its associated compensation costs. An action plan is
at the draft stage. ZIMOIL has entered into a performance contract with Indeni, and (in due
course) the OMCC will enter into a performance contract setting out the standards to be
achieved by Indeni.
Acounts
ZIMOIL/Zambia Oil Company
3.20         ZIMOIL maintained separate accounts which are regularly audited (as part of
the ZIMCO audit) by a private firm of chartered accountants. The audited statement was
incorporated into the consolidated accounts of ZIMCO. The quality of audits is acceptable.
After ZIMOIL is reorganized into discrete procurement and storage companies, a separate
fuil-tiedged audited report will be available for each entity. It was agreed that ZOC annual
accoumts showing both activities, together with the auditor's reports, should be submitted
to IDA not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
Tazama Pipelines UImited
3.21         Tazama's accounts are acceptable and up-to-date. The annual accounts are
audited by an acceptable private accounting firm, and are satisfactory. The audit is normally
completed within four months of the close of the financial year. It was agreed that
Tazama's annual awcounts, together with the auditor's reports, should be submitted to
IDA not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
Indeni Petroleum Refinery Company Limited
3.22         indeni's accounting and management information systems are well established.
The company's accounts are audited by an acceptable private firm of chartered accountants
and submitted to the shareholders within six months after the close of the financial year. The
quality of the accounts and audits is acceptable and the books are up-to-date. As the project
does not support Indeni, IDA will not seek submission of Indeni's accounts.
Mistry of Energy and Water Development
3.23         The Ministry will maintain Project Accounts to summarize the expenditure
in relation to those parts of the project for which the Ministry is the implementing agency.
These accounts wlll be audited annually by an independent auditor and be submitted to
WlA not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.

IV. TBE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.1          The main objectives of the proposed project are to:
(i)   restructure the petroleum industry to become more competitive and cost
effective;
(ii)   develop policy through encouraging establishment of a satisfactory regulatory
framework and effective competition in petroleum importation and marketing;
(iii)  rehabilitate the Tazama Pipeline as a least cost, reliable means of transporting
oil to Zambia;
(iv)   strengthen Tazama's operational and financial management to ensure ta the
pipeline stays in satisfactory operational condition;
(v)   improve infrastructure facilities to reduce the cost of petroleum product
transport and distribution; and
(vi)  provide a basis for the private sector companies to facilitate exports by using
surplus pipeline capacity.
Pec Description
4.2          Capacity Strengthening of MEWD MEWD is responsible for identifying
and formulating policies and strategies to address current and emerging energy issues such as
pricing reform and restructuring the sector organization. A Technical Cell will be established
in MEWD to frame regulatory measures concerning energy sector issues and to monitor and
maintain records with respect to petroleum (Annex 4.9). The Ministry is inadequately staffed
for these tasks. ESMAP has identified the technical assistance components needed to
overcome this deficiency in the Ministry. The proposed project includes a component for
capacity building in the Ministry and for policy support (pricing, petroleum products export
potential and Ndola terminal leasing arrangements). Studies on pricing and on terminal
leasing are in progress; the study for petroleun exports will be completed by December
31,1999 prior to completion of the rehabilitation of the pipeline. Draft TORs are in
Annex 4.8.
4.3          Tazama Pipeline Rehabilitation The Tazama pipeline was originally
designed to transport a full range of petroleum products. It was later converted into a crude
oil line when the Indeni Refinery was commissioned. With the modifications and additions
included in the proposed project, the pipeline could be put back into product service for a
limited period. However, for long-term product pumping certain changes in the single point
mooring facilities and a second submarine pipeline are required (costing about US$12 million)
for as long as the TIPER refinery in Dar-es-Salaam continues to unload crude oil through the
existng system. Provision of an independent SPM for Tazama would significantly enhance
Zambia's security of supply. However, in view of the SPM's reliability record, its low usage
(ess dt  33%), and the options for replacement in the event of damage, decisions on



-22 -
replacement of the SPM should be deferred until the Government again reviews the refinery,
or until Tanzania needs to change its own use of the SPM.
4.4           To evaluate the extent of damage and assess the scope of the proposed
rehabilitation, a detailed survey using intelligent pigs with sensors (a mechanical device that
senses and measures pipeline defects while travelling inside the pipeline) was conducted with
IDA finascing (Cr. 1627-ZA). A reliable assessment of the corroded sections was thus made
possible, and the cost of repairs and replacement was accurately estimated. The survey
showed that the pipeline developed severe external corrosion because of (a) failure of the
pipeline outside coating; and (b) the effects of the low resistivity "black cotton" soil in which
the pipeline is buried. Although usual cathodic protection methods had been employed, their
effectiveness has been limited because of (i) inadequate preventive maintenance; and (ii)
widespread coating separation. Persistent incursion of sea water into the pipeline after each
cargo delivery at the Dar-es-Salaam offshore SPM has caused internal corrosion (concentrated
In the initial 250 km section). This pipeline portion was repaired/replaced in 1988 and 1990
using fumds from the Italian Government and EIB. The leaks which occurred in the Ruvu
river basin (close to the pumping station that supplies drinking water to Dar-es-Salaam) have
already been repaired (5 km between KM 74 and KM 79) using Tazama's own funds in 1987.
As a result of these repairs, the unaccounted-for pipeline losses have decreased from 15,219
tons in FY88 (CIF cost US$3 million) to about 6,146 tons in FY90. These losses in FY91
and FY92 were 3,788 tons and 1,295 tons, respectively. Since then an increase in product
leaks amounted in FY93 to 6,436 tons, presumably because of increased corrosion in
unrepaired areas of the pipeline. Problems caused by corrosion and inadequately trained
personnel persist. Two of the river crossings pose a physical risk. There is extensive
pollution at the various oil storage depots, where new operating practices will have to be
instituted. To maintain the mechanical integrity and safe operation of the whole system,
repairs and replacements are urgently required for the storage tank-farm in Dar-esSalaam, for
main and booster pump stations, for the cathodic protection, for the telecommunication
network and for transport vehicles.
4.5          Project Subcomponents The proposed project envisages repairs where
feasible and replacement where repairs cannot suffice. The project would rehabilitate the
remaining weak portions of the pipeline and all its auxiliary systems: the entire system would
then operate reliably. To prevent entry of salt water into the pipeline system, one of the tanks
at the Dar-es-Salaam tank farm will be dedicated to receiving oil contaminated by seawater.
In this tank, sufficient settling time will allow for the water to be separated and drained out
before the oil is transferred to the pipeline system. A new tank has been constructed to
ensure this even when one or more tanks are under repair. Suitable interphase detectors and
necessary modifications in the piping arrangements have been installed at the tank farm. This
scheme (coupled with the injection of corrosion inhibitors in the pipeline) would guarntee
prevention of internal corrosion. The cost of pipeline rehabilitation with other related items is
estimated at US$48 million (detailed cost break-down in Annex 4.1). The following
subcomponents are proposed:
(i)    Pipeline Rehabilitation from KM 250 to KM 1710 which includes 50 sleeve
repairs and 30 km of line pipe replacement on the 8-inch line, and 40 sleeve
repairs and 3 km of line pipe replacement on the 12-inch line. Strengthening
of the pipeline support at river crossings is necessary.



- 23 -
(ii)    Corrosion Protection The cathodic facilities which protect the pipeline from
external corrosion will be strengthened with the addidon of 6 new AC
cathodic protection stations with deep well ground beds and ten solar cathodic
protection stations with horizontal ground beds.
(iii) Mechanical Because the pump stations have been without major repairs since
they were commissioned, 14 pumps and engines must be overhauled.
(iv)   Electrical and Istrumentation Replacement of 9 existing station generators
and provision of new instruments for pumping units.
(v)    Telecommunications Eight sets of new HF radio systems to include
telemetry, HF and VHF support and telephone patch-up are required.
(vi)   Tank Farm  The rehabilitation work related to the storage facilities at Dar-es-
Salaam will include replacement of bottom plates for tanks T4, TS and T6,
repairs to the roof of five tanks, and construction of one new tank. This work
will minimize pollution through oil leaks from the tanks and prevent recurrent
incursion of salt water from the floating hose at the SPM into the pipeline
system. A 40,000 mn tank at Ndola will be constructed for receiving
feedstock.
(vii)  Vehicles, Spare Parts and Project Equipment To permit Tazama's
operation (and project implementation) to function efficiently, the project will
provide a motorboat, vehicles, project equipment (tractors, 20-ton crane,
excavators, bulldozer), spare parts, computers, and office equipment.
(viii)  Environmental New operating practices are to be introduced to minimize
environmental damage, and new methods of waste disposal will be presented.
Engines at the pumping stations will be modified for more efficient
combustion of fuel.
(ix)   Comultancy and Project Management The subcomponent includes
consulting services to assist Tazama in the detailed engineering design for
items (i) through (vi), in procurement of material and services including
preparation of tender documents, evaluation of proposals, and in the
supervision, monitoring and quality control of construction/installation work.
4.6          Institutional Strengthening of Tazama  An important component of the
project is technical assistance to Tazama to improve its efficiency and environmental
awareness. Experienced managers are to be engaged to bring Tazama up to international
standard in operations, maintenance and finance, and to give on-the-job training to Tazama
staff. The project provides US$3.3 million in foreign exchange, for hiring three qualified
people to fill the posts of key managers for 2 years; hiring one experienced project manager,
to be shared by Tazama and ZOC, required for the Project Implementation Unit for three
years (see para. 4.10); and financing the trainlng requirements of Tazama. The appointment
of three qualified persons to fiff the posts of key managers for 2 years by April 1, 1995
and the appointment of an experienced company to manage the pipeline based on a
performance contract by not later than April 1, 1997 have been agreed.



- 24 -
4.7          Rail Loading Facility Expansion At present 90% of the products from
ZIMOIL's termina at Ndola are transported by road tankers. The financial transport cost
could be reduced by about US$1.4 million p.a. (US$8 per ton based on ZR's tariff as of June
1993) if the long distance bulk transport of products were done by unit trains using the
existing rail system. Without adequate rail loading facilities unit train loading at Ndola is not
feasible. Sufficient storage tanks and unloading facilities at the receiving points are also
needed. The proposed project will expand the rail loading facilities at Ndola to include
loading facilities for 12 wagons at a time (enabling loading of unit trains of 24 wagons in two
placements), six loading pumps will be replaced, tank meters will be installed, and
computerized product loading facilities and product flow meters will be developed and used.
The proposed expansion of facilities at Ndola would also facilitate exporting surplus products
to the Shaba region of Zaire. A satisfactory transport contract between OMCs and Zambia
Railways is essential to achieving the distribution benefits, and confirmation by ZR of the
principles of such a contract will be a condition of disbursement. A possible coordinating
arrangement and draft transport contract is in the project files.
Related Investments to be Flnanced by the Private Sector
4.8          Indeni Refinery The refinery's operation is marginal because of its poor
product yield pattern, high consumption and loss of hydrocarbons. The Government wishes
to keep its only refinery in operation, but considers it inappropriate to invest public money in
what should be a commercial venture, and has requested AGIP to undertake the investment
merited by the economics of the refinery. AGIP has a study underway to consider potential
investments. To improve fuel efficiency through energy conservation and increase distillation
capacity, the refinery management has developed various proposals costing in the range of
US$1.0 million.
4.9          Lusaka Bulk Storage To complement the improved train loading facility at
Ndola it will be necessary to improve the unloading capability at Lusaka to enable a unit train
to be unloaded in not more than two placements. The private sector oil marketing companies
will undertake this investment after agreeing among themselves the facilities to be expanded.
As the pricing system will be based on rail use and road use will become too expensive, the
companies have a strong incentive to have these facilities ready on time. There is no need for
an implementation agreement with them on this issue.
Project Management and Implementation
4.10         Project implementation would be the responsibility of MEWD, Tazama and
ZOC. The rail loading facility expansion would be implemented by ZOC, the technical
assistance component to develop an efficient monitoring unit by MEWD, and the pipeline
component by Tazama. Tazama and ZOC would be responsible for coordinating activities
concerning appointment of consultants and contractors, procurement, project programming
and budgeting for their respective portions of the project. A project implementation team will
be established within the engineering department of Tazama. The Tazama Project Manager,
who will be an experienced pipeline engineer with experience in project implementation,
would lead the pipeline project team. The Project Manager's job description has been agreed
between Tazama and the Association. Appointment is a condition of effectiveness.



- 25 -
4.11         Of the three beneficiaries of the proposed project, two beneficiaries, Tazama
and ZOC, would require assistance from qualified and experienced engineering consultants.
Tazama would require the assistance of experienced engineering consultants for design,
engineering, preparation of project specifications and tender documents, bid evaluation and
construction supervision. Tazama has given IDA a short list of engineering consultants
satisfactory to IDA and has set out the selection criteria. Appointment of the engineering
consultant is a condition of credit effectiveness.
4.12         ZOC, In consultation with Tazama and under arrangements satisfactory to the
Association, would use the services of the same consultants for design, engineering,
preparation of tender documents, bid evaluation and construction supervision.
4.i ±        Tazama and ZOC would use the services of an experienced Contract Legal
Advisor for all contracts financed from the project funds including the technical assistance
component. The Contract Legal Advisor, whose charges would be financed from the
proposed IDA Credit, would be hired by Tazama and ZOC on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association.
Project Cost Estimates
4.14         Project base costs have been estimated at January 1993 prices. No taxes or
duties are levied on project goods. The total project cost, including contingency, is estimated
at US$48 million equivalent. This includes US$42.3 million equivalent for Tazama, US$2.6
million equivalent for ZOC and US$3.1 million equivalent for capacity building to MEWD
including US$0.2 million for training. Of the estimated US$6.2 million for technical
assistance excluding contingencies, US$2.2 million is for policy development, US$3.2 million
for capacity strengthening, and the balance for project implementation. Foreign exchange
costs would be equivalent to US$45 million, or about 94 percent of the total. The costs to be
incurred in Tanzania are included among foreign expenditure costs. The physical contingency
is estimated separately for each project component: the average is about 12.5% of the base
cost Price contingencies have been included on the international component of equipment,
materials and other supplies at 3.4% for 1994, 2.9% for 1995, 3.0% for 1996, 2.7% for
1997, 2.7% for 1998 and 2.5% for 1999, and the Zambian local component of civil works
and materials was calculated in US dollars. It is assumed that Zambian inflation will continue
to be promptly reflected in the exchange rate. Price contingencies total in aggregate 11% of
base cost. A summary of project cost estimates is shown in Table 4.1.

Fnandng Plan
4.15          The total project requirement of US$48 million equivalent would be financed
by IDA (US$30 million equivalent), EIB (US$15 million equivalent), and
Tazama/ZOClMEWD (US$3 million). IDA and EEB would finance US$45 million equivalent
In parallel to cover the entire foreign exchange requirement of the project. Government has
confirmed EIB's agreement in principle to this finance structure. Execution of an agreement
with EIB, including fulfilling condidons precedent to effectiveness, would be a condition
for IDA credit effectiveness. The proposed IDA Credit of US$30 million equivalent would
meet about 67 percent of the foreign exchange and about 63 percent of the total financing
required. The proposed Credit would be made to the Government. Of the total IDA Credit
of US$30 million equivalent, US$2.8 million equivalent would be used to develop an efficient
monitoring unit in MEWD, US$25.1 million equivalent would be onlent to Tazama and
US$2.1 million equivalent would go to ZOC. The onlending terms (in US dollars) would be
for 20 years including a grace period of five years at an interest rate of about 8%, or equal to
1.1 times the prevailing IBRD interest rate. The foreign exchange risks would be borne by
the beneficiaries up to the time they discharge their debt obligation. Tazama and ZOC would
finance the local costs from internal cash generation. The proposed fiancing plan is
summardzed in Table 4.2.

Project Schedule and Disbursement Profile
4.16          Completion of the project is estimated to require 40 months from the start of
physical work. However, in recognition of delays generally experienced in Zambia, the
project disbursements are forecast to take 60 months. On this basis the Project is expected to
be completed by December 31, 1999. The Credit closing date will be June 30, 2000. Ihe
implementation schedule for the various components is shown in Annex 4.2. A nid-term
review is planned for June 1996. From this review, the Government will prepare (and witl
cause Tazama and ZOC to prepare) an action plan acceptable to IDA, for furter institutional
refrm, and will cause Tazama and ZOC to implement that action plan. The tentative
supervision plan for IDA is shown in Annex 4.3. The proposed disbursement profile is based
on a realistic implementation schedule for individual project components and the
implementation profile for various petroleum sector and technical assistance projects. The
profile recognizes that the proposed project is a continuation of rehabilitation work being
completed using EEB and ADB financing, and using experienced engineering consultants for
project management. The disbursement schedule for IDA financing is summarized in Table
4.3 and is shown more fully in Annex 4.4.

of the bid price respectively. To cover the cost of proprietary spare parts and other
components for existing equipment and machines, IDA would finance up to US$1 million on
a sole source basis. For specialized equipment for which only a limited number of suppliers
are available, Limited International Bidding procedures up to an aggregate amount of
US$1 million will be adopted. Small items or groups of items (including office equipment
and vehicles) costing up to US$100,000 per contract for Tazama, and up to US$50,000 per
contract for ZOC would be procured under contracts awarded after International and Local
Shopping procedures by obtaining at least three quotations from reliable suppliers, or
alternatively using IAPSO up to an aggregate amount of US$1 million. The aggregate amount
of non-ICB procurement is US$3 million. The major consultancy contracts are the
Engineering services for the design and supervision of the Project (see paras. 4.6 and
4.1014.11) and the strengthening of Tazama's operations through incorporating three
experienced line managers into Tazama's structure (para. 3.10). Engineering consultancy
services amounting to US$0.6 million (40m/m) for Tazama and US$0.2 million for ZOC
(lSm/m), and services for institutional strengthening of Tazama (250m/m) and the MEWD
(lSOm/m) for US$3.3 million and US$2.6 million respectively, would be awarded in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Consultants. US$500,000 for Tazama will be allocated
from the capacity strengthening budget and US$0.2 million is provided in the credit for
MEWD for short and medium-term job-related training, seminars and courses. Training
programs with an annual timetable have been agreed upon. The institutional strengthening of
MEWD has been reviewed by ESMAP and appropriate measures have been suggested (para.
4.2).

reporting of contract award information by the implementing agencies, and comprehensive
quaterly reports to the Association by the implementing agencies, indicating revised cost
estimates for individual contracts and the total project cost, including best estimates for
physical and price contingency; revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising,

Allocation and Disbursanent of IMA Credit
4.18         The allocation of the proposed IDA Credit is summarized in Table 4.5.
Special Accounts (one each for MEWD, Tazama and ZOC) would be established in
commercial banks and operated on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. These accounts
would receive advances in amounts of US$1.5 million for Tazama, US$100,000 for ZOC and
US$150,000 for MEWD, and would be replenished periodically in accordance with applicable
IDA procedures. Disbursements would be made against full supporting documents, except for
payments against contracts for goods and works costing less than US$150,000 equivalent, and
for individual training programs. Supporting documents associated with SOE claims would be
retained in a central location by the relevant implementing agency, suitably cross-referenced
to the withdrawal application, and made available on request for review by visiting
supervision missions. As part of the annual audit for each implementing agency, the
independent auditors would give an opinion with respect to the Special Accounts and to the
amounts withdrawn on the basis of SOEs. The estimated disbursement schedule for the
proposed IDA Credit, shown in Table 4.3, has been based on the implementation schedules
for individual project components and is discussed in para. 4.16.

Envinmental and Safety Aspects
4.19         The project Is classified as Category B. The environmental review,
undertaken by a Canadian consulting group, and   inarized in Annex 4.6, identified two
river crossings where the pipeline is exposed and vulnerable, and three other locations where
the pipeline is exposed. A number of operational sites were noted where the exhaust
emissions from pumps are severe and where changes in operational practices or machinery are
requred. Operations have not been well managed and leaks have been extensive, with the
result that minor strucural modifications are needed at a number of operation sites to prevent
spillage affecting the soil. Some clearing up is needed for areas already damaged. The



- 31 -
operators will be trained in environmental awareness. In relation to the rehabilitation of the
Tazama pipeline and the expanded rail loading and unloading facilities, the consultant
identified no specW problems, and pointed out that once the work is complete the
environmental impact should be much improved. However, the consultant recommended the
development for Tazama and ZIMOIL/ZOC of environmental standards, preparation of an
enmironmental protection plan, installation of hard standings and devices for containing and
collecting oil spills, and for ensuring the proper functioning of the cathodic protection system.
A simple emergency plan will be developed to deal with a serious oil spill or a fire. Basic
equipment tO stop a serious leakage or a fire will be available at places along the pipeline and
at the terinals. Operators will be trained how to handle emergency situations.
4.20         Tazama and the Government (on behalf of ZOC) have agreed on the
environmental measures to be implemented in conjunction with the construction program,
substanly as outlined here and summarized more fully in Annex 4.5.
Project Development Impact
4.21         The goal of the Bank's strategy for Zambia is to assist the Government to
achieve sustnable economic growth and to reduce poverty. The proposed project is an
integal part of selected initiatives important to the support of IDA's country strategy:
promoting economic growth by focussing on strengthening basic infrastructure while
recognizing related environmental issues, reviewing the role of state-owned sector entities,
promoting competition in petroleum supply arrangements, supporting deregulation of
petroleum retail prices and the improvement of petroleum supply organizations' efficiency
through performance contracts. The rehabilitated system would supply petroleum fuels in an
environmentally and economically sustainable manner. The technical assistance to Tazama,
included in the Project, would help to improve its operational efficiency and its project
management. The proposed restructuring of ZIMOIL and its arrangement for early custody
trnfer of petroleum to an Oil Company Consortium would enhance the financial
commitment and presence of private sector companies in the importation and distribution of
petroleum fuels in the country.
Project Monitoring
4.22         MEWD, Tazama and ZOC, for their respective components, will implement
the proposed project in accordance with the indicators shown in Annex 4.6. The indicators
would establish whether the project is perceived as importing and distributing the oil
successfully and economically. These indicators would be included in the requirements for
quarterly progress reports from these organizations to IDA. Agreement was reached that
within six months after the completion of the project, the companies concerned would prepare
implementation completion reports using an outline to be agreed with IDA.
List of Documents on File
4.23         The proposed project and its components were defined and appraised as a
result of specialized engineering inspection of the facilities and consultarts' reports. Various
documents related to these inspections and studies are listed in Annex 4.7.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
5.1          The financial analysis has been made on the basis of the audited statements
submitted by the companies and the projections are on the basis of the notes and assumptions
explained in Annex 5.1.
Flnancial Policies of Zambia's Parastatals
5.2          Each parastatal has full authority on pricing as well as staffing, salaries, and
other management issues. Parastatals are to be managed as profit centers. There are to be no
subsidies from Government or from the holding company, and no loan guarantees except for
public utilities. The Government will not be involved in parastatal pricing. This policy was
not followed in the first part of 1993: in a number ef parastatals political involvement in
pricing has been extensive.
5.3          Government has set a mandatory dividend policy of 10% on revalued net
assets. Although revaluations have been normal at ZCCM and most of the Indeco companies,
this is not the case elsewhere: at this stage full implementation of this policy is impracticable.
Asset revaluations have been commissioned for the major public utilities but not for
companies scheduled for early privatization, except as needed in conjunction with the
privatization program. In implementing the dividend policy, the companies are finding
significant price resistance, and it may be impossible to achieve the dividend targets.
5.4          Overall financial policies common to most parastatals include the need for
each compauy to achieve a growth of at least 10% in the volume of production reflected by a
corresponding increase in productivity measured by the production per employee ratio. The
policy envisages a foreign exchange saving of 10% In real terms on forex utilization and an
increase of 10% on forex earnings. In capital expenditure projects the need to yield an
internal rate of return of 20% after providing for borrowing costs and mandatory dividend on
the inflation-adjusted Goverment equity (share capital+ accumulated earnings+ revaluation
reserves) has been prescribed.
ZIMOIL
FSnancdal Implications of ZIMOIL Operations
5.5          In the pre-1994 arrangement, ZIMOIL imports and owns the crude and uses
the services of Tazama and Indeni on a cost plus basis. ZIMOIL invoices the buyers (the oil
marketing companies). This arrangement has resulted in high costs of operation because of
excess manpower and the consequent establishment expenses for each company. There is
little or no accountability among the companies for these higher than necessary costs of
operation. There are no set standards for measuring efficiency. All costs and operations need
tD be better monitored to ensure conformity to international standards. Since early 1994
Zimoil has moved away from cost plus to negotiated contracts including some performance
standards.

Financial Performance
5.6             ZIMOIL's operating results and financial position for the period 1990-92 are
shown in the audited income statements and balance sheets in Annexes 5.2 and 5.3 and
summarized in Table 5. 1. The figures reflect ZIMOIL's policy to set sales prices of
petroleum products so as to recover: (a) the cost of procurlig refiuery feedstock and shipping
it to Dar-es-Salaam; (b) harbor and storage costs in Dar-es-Salaam; (c) financial charges for
procuring feedstock; (d) Tazama's fees (e) Indeni's refining fees including fuel consumption
and loss; and (f) Ndola terminal costs.

5.7             During late 1992 and the first part of 1993, ZIMOIL was not allowed to
change its prices in response to the depreciation of the Kwacha. This resulted in accumulated
arrears of n;arly 19 billion Kwacha (approximately US$35 million). The prices have since
been revised and current prices reasonably reflect current costs and adequately cover the
arrs. It will take until end-1994 to fully recover the accumulated arrears of exchange

losses. Earlier, ZIMOIL borrowed through expensive international credit facilities to finance
the procurement of feedstock. Because of this credit system, ZIMOIL was bearing the cost of
exchange fluctuations for 180 days-long after its ability to pass these on to marketers had
lapsed. ZIMOIL is now working on a cash basis by carefully pooling the petroleum product
sales proceeds in a separate account reserved for procurement of feedstock. These proceeds
are used to buy foreign exchange on a weekly basis. This procedure needs to be continued
very strictly for payment for feedstock to avoid ZIMOlL/ZOC bearing the cost of exchange
fluctuations. The Cuneo study identified ZIMOIL's procurement practices and Letter of Credit
costs as two areas for major cost savings. Procurement is now being conducted using
international competitive bidding. The adoption of a cash system for oil purchases and the
opening of a separate foreign exchange account for oil procurement has gone a long way to
minimizing Letter of Credit costs and should avoid losses due to exchange fluctuations,
provided that prices continues to reflect the costs incurred.
inanclal Projections
5.8          The financial projections have been prepared on the assumption that a new
Zambia Oil Company (ZOC) will be set up to procure feedstock and that bulk distribution
will be managed by a consortium of oil marketing companies (OMCC).
Zambia Oil Company (ZOC)
5.9          Under the proposed arrangement, ZOC will be responsible for procuring
feedstock, transporting it to Dar-es-Salaam and delivering it to OMCC in Dar-es-Salaam. The
price structure of ZOC will be worked out as in the schedule given in Table 5.2.

5.10           Given the current state of the Zambian economy, no significant growth in
domestic demand is forecast. Local sales are assumed to increase by 6.6% over a period of
five years (1995 to 2000). Export sales are assumed to be constant at 75,000 tons-
substantialy above the current level. Financing cost is assumed at 1% of CIF cost. Harbor
dues are levied at 1.5% of CIF value. Ocean loss is allowed @ 0.3% of CIF value. Ihe key
assumption is that sales prices are set by OMCs at a level to cover the losses acceptable by
international norms for pipeline transport, refining and storage. The Bank of Zambia (BZ)
fimd is to provide funds for repayment of loans to BZ to the tune of 19 billion Kwacha. It is
expected that these arrears together with the accumulated interest will be completely paid back
by December 31, 1994. A loss fund has been set up to compensate for any abnormal losses
(over and above the international standards) which are likely to experienced until the
rehabilitation program is completed. Thereafter, performance will be strictly monitored to
perform competitively and any loss above normally acceptable international standards will be

5.11             Under the proposed new arrangement, OMCC will own and take delivery of
the crude from Dar-es-Salam and use the Tazama pipeline to pump the crude to the Indeni
Refinery. The crude will be refined at Indeni and the finished products wil be stored at the
Ndola terminal facilities of the present ZIMOIL. Tazama and Indeni will be paid their
pumping and refining fee by the OMCC at a contracted rate. Internationally accepted normal
losses will be taken ino account in fixing the tariffs for Indeni aad Tazama, any cost over and
above the normal standards will have to be borne by the entities concerned. Until completion
of the rehabilitation, the special loss fund to be maintained by ZOC will be used for meeting
extra losses up to the amount in the fund. After rehabilitation is completed, all these units
will be monitored to very strict standards of efficiency and performance. The facilities at
Ndola terminal will be leased out to OMCC for a contracted fee pending a decision to lease or
sell. The break-down of the proposed pricing structure for OMCC is given in Table 5.4.

5.12           The 'producta cost exceeds the 'crude' cost by less than the notional railroad
fee, which represents the weighted average cost of transporting black products by rail if the
pipeline were converted to a white products pipeline. In practice, alternative arrangements
would avoid much of this cost by substituting alternative fuels; and there is no material
difference in cost between the options if allowances are made for at least 75,000 tons per
annum of exports.
5.13           The pumping fee of US$22 per ton for Tazama and the refining fee of US$23
per ton for Indeni have been based on the present tariff paid by ZIMOIL. These fees would
be adjusted as a result of the rehabilitation program and in response to changes in the
throughput rate. The bulk selling prices will also be adjusted to recognize the revised tariffs
from these companies. OMCC will enter into separate contracts with each entity involved in
the process to set tariff rates as well as the standards to be achieved in the operations.
Exports have been assumed to be 75,000 tons per year for the purpose of these projections.
Exports have been priced at US$20 above the domestic price.
5.14           OMCC wiU need an appropriate price adjustment system for timely and
prompt adjustments to pnces to reflect changes in international oil prices and currency
fluctations. It is expected that this will closely mirror the ZOC system. A study on this
critical concern is to be financed under the project. Subject to this, the OMCC financial
position is expected to be fully satisfactory.

Tazama Pipelines Limited
Financial Implications of Tazama's Operation
5.15         Tazama, which was established in 1968, is operating under the terms of a
1967 convention between the two governments. Tazama owns and operates the crude oil
pipeline from Dar-es-Salaam to Ndola, with an annual transportation capacity of 1.1 million
metric tons. The lack of demand (due to a depressed Zambian economy) means that the
pipeline's pumping capacity is not fully used. Tazama has only one customer (ZIMOIL) and
accordingly cannot adopt a satisfactorily competitive pricing policy. Although manning levels
have been reduced by about 20%, there is still room for further manpower savings. Because
of the monopoly there is no scope for directly measuring the efficiency of operations. All
costs are passed on to the consumer. Although comparison with pipeline operations in
developing countries shows that Tazama is better than average, it falls short of the best
performance achieved elsewhere. Previous attempts to gain efficiency by restructuring the
budget led to lack of maintenance, and eventually the need to seek a performance contrt
(see Chapter 3).
Financial Performance
5.16         The Convention provides that Tazama operate on a cost recovery basis and
periodically set the tariff that it charges ZIMOIL, to ensure that the company meets all its
financial obligations from current revenues. In view of Zambia paying all costs but Tanzania
shaing the dividends, a cost recovery basis with nominal profits is appropriate. Tazama acts
as a carrier of oil but does not own the oil at any stage. Until recently it has borne no
responsibility for losses. Tazama's operating results and financial information for the period
1988-93 are shown in the audited income statements and balance sheets summarized in
Annexes 5.7 and 5.8. A summary of fimancial results is shown in Table S.S. Tazama's
financial performance in 1992 and 1993 was unsatisfactory, mainly because of the
unexpectedly low volumes transported, the high inflation and exchange rate movements, and
the delays of recognizing these changes by adjustments to the price structure. Tazama has set
up a separate fund and an account for monitoring the debt payment by transferring the debt
servicing portion in the pumping tariff to this fund.

Fianca Projections
5.17            The summary financial projections are presented in Table 5.6. The detailed
notes and assumptions are in Annex 5.9 and the income statements, balance sheet and finds
flow statements are in Annexes 5.10 through 5.12. Tazama's tariff is set annually at a level
sufficient to recover all estimated costs, including debt service, on the basis of the projected
throughput of the pipeline. The key assumptions for the soundness of the position shown by
the projections are that prices will be revised regularly to recognize exchange rate movements
and inflation. The new tariff for 1994/95 will be set mostly in dollars so that exchange rate
movements are fully recognized. Subject to this, the constant price projections fairly
represent the position likely to be achieved. The projected tariff takes into account proision
for an expanded level of maintenance equivalent to US$1 million per annum.

be on a basis that would continuously reflect all costs and provide adequate maintenance.
This could include setting tariffs in dollars, or adjusting monthly to cover devaluations of the
Kwacha and debt service. Tazama shall arrange to revalue the assets periodically so that
these are represented at replacement value in the financial statements, the first being due
during 1994. Tazama shall submit the first revaluation report of the auditors (which is in
progress) to IDA within a month of its receipt.
Indeni Refinery
Financial Implications of Indeni Operations
5.19            Indeni now refines a mix of semi-finished petroleum products. The financial
position of Indeni is dependent solely on the processing agreement with ZIMOIL, and need
bear no relation to Indeni's economic justification. While in principle Indeni will also process
oil transported by Tazama for other companies, the high cost of Indeni's operation is unlikely
to auract many customers.  The operaing cost of the refinery amounts to US$23 per ton
over and above 7 to 8 percent fuel consumption and losses. This is 50% higher than in
similar refineries in other developing countries. The path toward resolving this is through a



- 41 -
progressively tighter performance standard and fee (para. 5.16), and through constrction of
tanks at Dar-es-Salasm so that product imports become possible (para. 4.3), and through
negotiations with AGIP (para. 3.14).
Fb da l Performance
5.20         The refinery operates on a commercial basis, with the processing fee being a
negotiated fixed amount per ton of throughput processed. Indeni has been showing an
increase In net income. But all its operating costs are being fully reimbursed by ZIMOIL.
So net income cannot be taken as indicating the unit's efficiency until the processing fee is
fixed on a more realistic basis to measure Indeni's effectiveness.
5.21         Since Indeni is not a proposed beneficiary of the Credit, no financial
covenants are recommended.

VI. JUSTIFICATION, BENEFTIS AND RISKS
Project Justification
6.1          The proposed project represents the core investment requirement in the
petroleum sector. It would rehabilitate the pipeline and improve the rail loading facilities at
Ndola. (The private sector oil companies will be responsible for improving the unloading
facilities at Lusaka.) It would remove the environmental threat in Zambia and Tanzania from
feedstock leakage. The pipeline's rehabilitation needs have accumulated over the years
because of institutional and technical weaknesses. The project would provide adequate
technical support, training and institutional strengthening so that the beneficiaries can operate
efficiently and avoid the management and maintenance problems of the past.
Economic Analysis
6.2          The economic analysis for each project component was conducted separately:
rehabilitation of Tazama pipeline and improvement of existing rail loading/unloading facilities
at Ndola and Lusaka. For improving loading/unloading facilities, the investment costs were
compared to the next least-cost alternative, distributing petroleum by road. For Tazama
pipeline rehabilitation, the investment costs have been compared to the alternative of shutting
down the pipeline and using the next least-cost alternative, the Tazara Railway.
Pipeline Rehabilitation Econondes
6.3         Investment costs have been compared to the next least-cost alternative of
supplying Zambia (and its land-locked neighbors) with petroleum products. Without the
Tazama pipeline the region's least-ost access to the sea would be by the Tazara railway
system, which runs parallel to the pipeline from Dar-es-Salaam. Tazara connects with the
Zambia Railway System at Kapiri Mposhi. Tazara's gauge is common with the railway
system in Zambia, Zaire, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola, Mozambique and South
Africa. If access to the sea via Mozambique and South Africa were denied, the Tazara
railway would also provide alternative access to the traffic from the land-locked Central
African countries.
6.4          Tazara carries most Zambian imports (mostly fertilizer and wheat) and exports
(copper and other metals) through interchange of wagons with ZR. It currently carries around
one million net tons of traffic a year, but has a design capacity of 5 million tons. Under
current conditions of efficiency and locomotive availability, the optimum turn around time
between Dar-es-Salaam and Ndola for a dedicated unit train is 9 to 10 days but averages 30
days. With improved maintenance (and availability of the existing locomotives), Tazara can
handle a traffic volume up to 2 million tpa. The turn around time on the system would
increase because of longer average lead time, delays at the ports and congestion on the
system. To supply the petroleum requirements of the country at 550,000 tpa increasing to
800,000 tpa by FY2002, three dedicated trains a day would be needed initially, increasing to
about five a day. This would require an initial stock of 450 new tank wagons and 28
locomotives at a cost estimated at US$99 million. About US$3 million would be required for
additional maintenance facilities and US$13 million for loading/unloading facilities, bringing
the initial investment to about US$115 million. Once imports reach about 800,000 tpa, the
number of tank wagons needed would increase to 670 (assuming a 90% availability factor)



- 43 -
and locomotives needed would increase to 42. This level of rolling stock would require a
total investment of US$84 million for locomotives, about US$64 million for tank wagons and
about US$15 million in loading and unloading facilities (excluding tankage). The total
incremental investment for the railway option (under the most probable scenario) would be
around US$163 million. This option would also increase the environmental risk compared
with the rehabilitated pipeline.
6.5          Against the alternatives of moving petroleum feedstock by the Tazara System,
or through the more expensive Southern African Railways carrying products from Durban, the
continued operation of the pipeline with investment of US$31.3 million in core rehabilitation,
and a later investment of US$14 million (in its 10th year of operation) for non-core needs, is
the least-cost option. As the "with pipeline" solution is less costly than the rail option in all
years, the economic benefit from the pipeline rehabilitation component is estimated at over
100%.
Rail Loading Facility Expansion
6.6          The investment costs to improve the rail loading of petroleum products
include: extending the facilities at Ndola to load 12 wagons at a time and modernizing the
rail unloading facilities of oil company depots in Lusaka. At both Ndola and Lusaka, sidings
connect the rail stations and depots. The loading facilities for tank wagons in Ndola are
limited to 6 to 8 wagons a day. Although the train system and loading/unloading facilities
exist at Lusaka, 80 percent of the petroleum transported from Ndola to Lusaka currently must
depend on road conveyance mainly because of the inefficiency of the rail facilities and tank
wagon turn around times.
6.7          The refined petroleum product is distributed by road and rail through the
depot located next to the Indeni refinery in Ndola. The loading capacity of the facilities at the
Ndola depot limits loading to only two rail tank wagons simultaneously, permitting 6 to 8
tank wagons a day. The unloading capacity at the BP depot in Lusaka (the biggest depot) can
handle up to 16 rail tank wagons simultaneously. In Lusaka, each OMC has its own depot-
the OMC's depots are adjacent-and there are several possible configurations of this
component. About 20% of the total demand for gasoline, kerosene and diesel in the Lusaka
area is now transported by rail.
6.8          The major benefits from the distribution component would be a reduction In
transport costs from a shift from road haulage to the improved railway transportaton system.
The increase in demand to be expected would be fumished through a more efficient and less
expensive system. EIRR for improving the distribution system of petroleum by upgrading
facilities at Ndola and Lusaka with the base demand case was 14.9% (See Annex 6.1). This
modest rate of return is due to the small volume of products likely to be transported and the
relatively poor performance of the ZR.
Indeni Refinery Economics
6.9          The refinery operating economics were evaluated on two cases: energy
efficiency improvement in the existing refinery, and mothballing the processing facilities in
the refinery and using the remaining facilities for a bulk products terminal to be supplied by
the Tazama pipeline operating as a multi-product line. Those options were analyzed using



-44-
three assumptions of the demand: domestic demand only; domestic demand together with
exports of 75,000 tons; and domestic demand together with maximum exports with the fiul
pipeline capacity used. The least-cost option to satisfy the demand (domestic and exports)
would be mothballing of the refinery together with conversion of the pipeline to a product line
(See Annex 6.2). However, the economic case for closure does not prove that closure should
be immediate, and consultants have recommended that closure wait until major expenditure at
the refinery is needed.
Project Risk
6.10         In Tazama there has been a long history of inadeqpate inspection and
mintenance resulting in extensive pipeline leaks which caused product losses and downtime.
This risk is mitigated by the proposed management contracts and on-the-job training. Poor
operation and neglected maintenance of the modernized facilities at Ndola and Lusaka would
be less likely to happen, since management would rest with the private oil distributors. But
the cost differential between road and rail may change, especily in view of weak
performance by ZR. There is some risk that ZR will never accept responsibility for losses of
product under its care, and that the Ndola rail loading component would not proceed. It is
normal practice in OECD countries for the railroad to accept responsibility for product losses
and to protect itself trough Insurance.
6.11         Converting the pipeline to a product line (not part of the project at this stage)
would improve the reliability and flexibility of the oil supply system. The transport of
products would enhance the likelihood of theft and would lead to need for stronger
surveillance. However, the success lies primarily in the capacity of Zambia to reduce
operating costs and losses by mobilizing the commercial and technical expertise of the oil
marketing companies to its best advantage. In addition, international refinery margins could
be expected to change, which could enhance or reduce the benefits of refinery closure.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RtECOMMMATIONS
A. Agreements
7.1          Before credit effectiveness:
(a)    Government wil execute subsidiary loan agreements with Tazam  (para. 3.1);
(b)    Government will execute agreement with EIB, including fulfilling EIB's
conditions of effectiveness (para. 4.15);
(c)    Government will implement the first stage of pricing reforms as agreed with
IDA (para 2.28);
(d)    Tazama will appoint Project Manager (pan. 4.10) and engineering consultant
for project engineering and supervision (para. 4.11 and 4.12); and
(e)    ZIMCO (or ZOC, if by then it is the owner of Ndola terminal) will contract
to transfer management and operation of Ndola terminal to OMCC (para
3.14).
7.2          As conditions of disbursement for allocation of funds to ZOC:
(a)    The incorporation of ZOC and execution of Subsidiary Loan Agreement
between ZOC and Government (para. 3.1); and
(b)    Zambia Railways will confirm its acceptance in principle of performance
standards on travel time, wagon return time and physical loss (para. 3.15).
7.3          Other agreements:
(a)    Government wil ensure that petroleum product prices will be reviewed at
least monthly and adjusted as required to reflect all foreign and local currency
costs, including these caused by devaluation of the Kwacha (pamr 2.27) and
wiUl be set at a level so as to permit ZOC to recover the losses incurred pror
to June 1993, through the pricing system, before December 31, 1994 (para.
2.28);
(b)    Government will remove controls on retail prices before the end of 1996

Environmental Issues
Ihe summary of the consultant's report is attched. The mitigation plan for presenly
existing environmental issues is as follows:
Pipeline
1.    Implement an extenal control program. Rewrap the pipe wherever it is exposed
(e.g., during repairs). Rehabilitate the cathodic protection system.
2.    Institute regular surveillance of the pipeline, improve vegetaton control.
3.    Improve river crossings where pipeline is exposed with a view to minimizing
environmental risk.
4.    Clear away or break up damaged soil and encourage revegetation.
Pipeline Statons
1.    Remove or break up damages soil and encourage revegetation.
2.    Install drums to collect oil spillage.
3.    Review pump operations and improve maintenance. If necessary, replace worn out
parts. Should this not resolve the emissions problem, alternatives will be reviewed
and the most cost-effective environmentally satisfactory scheme will be adopted.
Tenminals
1.    Line floors of the area where rail tank cars and road tankers are loadedlunoaded so
as to prevent leakage into the soil. Increase the containment area dyke wall.
2.    Remove damaged soil and treat, or 'landform".
In relation to the proposed project, the mitigation plan is:
1.    Prepare environmental standards, practice and procedures and operations and
maintenace guidelines.

2.    Prepare an environmental protection plan for pipeline route selection (where rerouting
is necessary), construction and operation.
3.    Ensure that construction is in accordance with the environmental protection plan.
4.    Use the opportunity created by the rehabilitation to remedy environmental problems.
5.    Install drums, hard standings, improved containment walls and similar measures, as
relevant, for all new construction.
6.    Ensure that the pipeline cathodic protection system functions properly.
SU1MARY OF CONSULTANT'S REPORT
Tanzania PipeUne FaciUties
Row Vegetation
The review of the pipeline revealed that the majority of the ROW was well vegetated
with native grasses and bush. In areas such as Mikumi National Park and Makata Plains, the
ROW was not visible being covered with substantial growth of grasses and bush. Through
the sections of hilly and mountainous topography, the ROW was clear of woodlands and was
covered in grasses to reduce the potential for slope erosion. In some areas of the pipeline,
such as Elphons Pass, vegetation growth was dense restricting access to the ROW.
Regular surveillance of the pipeline ROW is required for: pipeline leak detection; for
maintenance and repair operations; and to assess potential ROW encroachment by agricultural,
commercial and industrial developments. Overgrown vegetation on the ROW inhibits
surveillance activities, detection of pipeline and equipment leaks and may restricted access to
the pipeline for maintenance and repair. It is recommended that an enhanced annual brush
control program be implemented to control vegetaion growth, a'igment vegetation to increase
wildlife habitat and reinforce pipeline monitoring operations.
River Crossings
The pipeline ROW crossed numerous permanent and intermittent rivers, streams and
low-lying swamp areas. The majority of the river crossings did not exhibit any river slope
movement or erosion and were restored with good vegetative cover. As indicated in Section
4.1, pipeline exposures were noted in five locations with only two river crossings, the Songwe
River and the crossing east of Iringa, that will require extensive reconstruction or the
selection of new pipeline routes. None of the pipeline exposures were an immediate threat to
water resources or associated riverine habitat.
At river crossing repair locations, it is recommended that the pipe be placed below the
river bed at sufficient depth to avoid exposure due to river bed erosion. Ihe pipe should be
coated with concrete to counteract buoyant forces and hold the pipeline in place. Pipeline
sagbends should be extended into both banics to provide a factor of safety against pipe

exposure because of lateral bank erosion. Final engineering design of scour depths and bank
erosion should account for 1:100 flood conditions and changes to the river course over the
operating life of the pipeline. The river banks should be regrated and revegetated following
construction to pre-ent bank erosion and siltation of the river.
Pipeline Repair Locations and Pig Traps
Most of the pipeline failure and leak locations had been restored to surrounding
vegetated conditions within a few years of repair. There were a few locations where
vegetative recovery was impeded due to petroleum residue remaining on the ground.
At pig trap sites and pipeline locations which have experienced crude oil and
petroleum product spills in the past, it is recommended that operating personnel remove or
breakup the petroleum residue on the ground covering the sites, use implements to work the
remnants into the soil and add soil amendments, such as fertilizers, to assist in the bio-
degradation of the hydrocarbons and the restoration of the sites.
Although wastes from pigging operations have been routed by piping to burning pits
adjacent to pig traps, or slop tranks at pump stations, pig waste remnants in the trap receivers
and launchers were routinely dumped to the ground surface. Over time, the pig waste
accumulates on the ground and forms a residue or crust that inhibits vegetation growth and
restoration of the site. Petroleum residues also may percolate into the soil and contaminate
groundwater aquifers. To minimize this situation, it is recommended that drums (200L or
greater) be installed below each pig trap door to catch and retain the pig waste remnants as
the doors are opened. With drum installation, the pig waste will not interfere with operating
personnel and the wastes may be removed from the site at a more convenient time.
Facility additions are planned to complete the NPS 12 pipeline loops and abandon the
NPS 8 pipeline. The pipeline leak locations repaired with sleeves and clamps were considered
temporary repairs. These repairs, and any new corrosion points identified during the 1993
pipeline internal inspection program, are planned to be excavated and replaced with new pipe.
Pipeline construction and replacement along the existing ROW will have minimal impact on
the surrounding environment due to existing disturbance from current pipeline operations. In
areas where pipeline alignments are to be modified and new pipeline routes selected, it is
recommended that route selection and engineering design incorporate environmental protection
procedures to mitigate environmental impacts from construction and operation activities.
Pipeline Corrosion Protection
Tazama Pipeline officials stated that the cathodic protection system was functioning.
However, during the pipeline field inspection, test lead terminals for monitoring the cathodic
protection impressed on the pipeline were either missing or destroyed. At pipeline excavation
and exposure locations, external pipeline coating systems were damaged or absent. It is
recommended that an external corrosion control program be implemented. The program
should investigate the cathodic protection power supply locations for the impressed current
installations, the isolation of the marine and cross-country pipelines from each other, the
ground bed Illaions, and include repairs to the cathodic protection test lead terminals. In



- 61 -
Annex 4.5
Page 4 of 5
addition, each pipeline repair location, the pipes should be cleaned, inspected, hand wrapped
and coated with a suitable coating material to prevent the flow of corrosive electrical current
from the pipeline to the surrounding soil.
Pipeline Station Pumps
At the Tazama Pipelines Pump Stations, crude oil is used as a fuel for the pump
drivers. As a result, the driver exhausts emit dense black smoke containing particulate that
impinge on the station operating areas and surrounding environment. The constant exposure
to this exhaust add a continuous pollution source to equipment and grounds; augment
contamination stress to the natural environment; and, may be a contributory factor to health
problems of station employees. It is recommended that Tazama Pipelines investigate the
conversion of the pipeline pump drivers from crude oil to the continued use of diesel fuel. As
example, the pump station electrical generator drivers are run on diesel fuel which do not
emit black particulate exhaust. With the potential conversion of the pipeline from crude oil to
utasport of petroleum (products, supply of diesel fuel to the stations by pipeline would reduce
iansportation and storage costs. In addition, the pump driver exhaust stacks should be
reviewed for exhaust height to modify the point of ground impingement.
Pipeline Terminals, Tank Farms And Depots
Under the Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation Project, planned additions and
odifications include: additional tankage of Kigamboni, Ndola and Lusaka; improvements to
rail car loading facilities at Kigamboni, Ndola and Lusaka; and, improvements to petroleum
measurement and computerization. The planned facility additions by Tazama, ZIMOIL and
British Petroleum at the terminals, tank farms and depots in Kigamboni, Ndola and Lusaka
are located at their existing facilities within established industrial areas. The additions are
designed to enhance operating capability, capacity and control of petroleum product handling.
The modifications also will have the effect of reducing, and in some cases, eliminating
petroleum operations that currently are adversely affecting the surrounding environment, such
as capturing petroleum product spills and surface water in API separators.
Tank Containment Areas
The terminals, tank farms and fuel depots were well equipped and staff trained to
prevent petroleum spills. All had the capability to control and clean up spills when they
occurred. However, small spills of petroleum products transpired from fuel loading and
overflows at tank and truck locations or from corroded equipment.
At spill locations, pump stations and petroleum terminals and tank farms, large
quantities of petroleum contaminated soils are generated. These soils may be left in place to
acumulae and eventually create future disposal and groundwater problems. The soils can be
excavated and removed off-site at considerable expense, or they can be treated in a landfarm
environment. Although not applicable to all types of soils and petroleum products, landfarms
are a proven cost effective method of treating most petroleum wastes. It is recommended that
Tazama Pipelines and ZIMCO investigate the application of landfarming for the clean-up,
treatment and disposal of petroleum wastes at their operating facilities.

Annex 4.5
Page 5 of 5
Except for the Kigamboni Terminal, the tank containment area dykes at the terminals,
tank fms and fuel depots were not large enough to contain the tank volumes. Ihe
containment area floors were unlined and allowed the infiltration of crude oil and petroleum
products into the underlying soils. Consideration should be given to increasing the
containment area dyke wall and constructing containment floor liners to avoid soil and
groundwater contamination and the loss of petroleum product. In addition, containment areas
should be constructed for drum storage areas at each Tazama Pump Station to contain leaks
and spills.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PLANNING
Based on the environmental review of the proposed pipeline rehabilitation program
and facility additions at the terminals, tank farms and fuel depots, the planned activities can
be constructed and operated with minimal impact to the environment. Any significant impacts
can be mitigated by design details and the implementation of operational procedures. It is
recommended that an environmental protection plan (EPP) for pipeline route selection,
construction and operation should be prepared. The EPP can form the environmental baseline
for fiuture facility additions and modifications. The EPP should include the preparation of
environmetal standards, practice and procedures and operations and maintenance guidelines.
SAFETY ASPECr
The operators of the pipeline will be trained in environmental awareness. A simple
emergency plan will be developed in case of a serious oil spill or a fire. Basic equipments to
stop a serious leakage or a fire will be available at some places along the pipeline and at the
terminals. Operators will be trained how to handle emergency situations.

PERFlORMANCE MONrIORING CRITERIA FOR
TAZAMA PIPELINES LIMITIED
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
1     Operational Efficiency: When sufficient quantities of stock are available, the pipeline should
operate at its maximum rated capacity for not less than 345 days per year (The rated capacity shoud
be established by trial runs after rehabilitation is completed).
2     Operational Losses: After rehabilitation of the storage tanks and the pipeline system,
hydrocarbon losses should not exceed 0.3% of the total quantity handled through the system.
3     Consumption of Fuels and Lubricants: After the rehabilitation, realistic consumption of fuels
and lubricants in all pump stations should be established, and actual consumption should not exceed
by 10%.
4     Cost of Manpower Employed: Tazama has discharged 125 employees. This has generated
substantial savings in labor costs. However, there is room for further review.
5     Demurrage Payment to Tankers: There should be no payment of demurrage to tankers since
the mooring facilities are used only once or twice a month and demurrage is paid only when the
planning and scheduling are inefficient.
6     Maintenance Cost: Annual maintenance cost and its relationship with the total cost of
operation should be monitored; unusual increases should be subject to inspection and verification.

PETROLEUM SECTOR REHABILlTATION PROJECT
PETROLEUM EXPORT MARKET ASSESSMENT
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.    BACKGROUND: Zambia is a landlocked country in southern central Africa sharing borders wifth
Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zaire and Zimbabwe. To ensure a steady
supply of petroleum products, a 1710 km pipeline was constructed from Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania) to
Ndola (Zambia) in 1968. The pipeline with about 1 million tons per year capacity is the least-cost and
only reliable supply source of petroleum for Zambia. The pipeline transports a mixture of crude oil and
products to the refinery in Ndola where it is refined into finished products (LPG, gasoline, kerosene,
diesel, fuel oil and bitumen) mostly to meet Zambia's domestic product requirement. Small quantities
of diesel are exported to Zaire and bitumen and LPG are exported to Zimbabwe.
2.    Domestic demand for petroleum depends on the level of activity in the mining sector. The total
sales of petroleum products reached a peak of 818,565 tons in 1976/77. In the next 10 years, the sales
declined over 35.4% to 528,858 tons in 1986/87. The domestic demand for petroleum products and the
consumption pattern are not expected to change significandy in the medium-term because of restrictions
on Government expenditures, scarcity of external resources and decline in copper production.
3.    Since the Indeni refinery at Ndola, commissioned in 1973, is a simple hydroskimming operation,
the product yield mix can be changed only by altering the quantity of products spiked in the feedstock
The level of reduced crude in the mix is limited by the level of demand for fuel oil and bitumen
amounting to about 15% of the feed mix. Because of the high percentage of the light products in the
mix, the refinery's capacity is derated to about 750,000 tons per year. Any significant increase in light
products spiking at this capacity level would result in poor product separation. As it was designed before
the 1973 oil crisis and the resultant increase in oil prices, the fuel consumption and losses are high at 7
to 8% of throughput. Under these circumstances, the operation of the refinery is economically
unattractive, apart from the fact that the pipeline capacity is not fully utilized .,  the organization in
charge of petroleum import and bulk sale of products, intends to evaluate the economic merits of
converting the pipeline into a product pipeline and using its surplus capacity for export of products into
the neighboring countries.
4.    To establish the realistic potential for export of petroleum products into the neighboring countries
(particularly Malawi, Tanzania, Burundi, Eastern Zaire and the Shaba region of Zaire), and evaluate the
economic advantage of such exports . .......... intends to appoint a consultant to conduct a survey and
evaluate the consumption of various petroleum products in these areas. For the purpose of this study,

it is asued t  the pipeline will be converted into a product line. The proposed study wil be fnaced
by unds from the World Bank.
5.    OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF WORK: The main objectives of the proposed market survey are
to explore the neighboring countries' market for petroleum products, establish Zambia's export potential,
and evaluate the relative advantage in the delivered cost of products supplied at these export locations
through Zambia's Tazama pipeline as against products supplied from other possible sources in the region.
The soope of work will include, but not be limited to, the following:
(a)   review the consumption of petroleum products (gasoline, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil,
bitumen and LPG) in Zambia and the Government's demand forecast for the next ten
years and modify as necessary taking into account present economic conditions and
possible improvements;
(b)   review the consumption of petroleum products in the neighboring countries (Malawi,
Tanzania around Makambako and Mbeya, Burundi, Eastern Zaire around Uvira, and the
Shaba region of Zaire) for the past five years and make realistic demand forecasts for
these areas;
(c)   review the current modes of transportation of petroleum products to these neighboring
countries and establish the costs;
(d)   review the current operating cost of the Tazama pipeline and esdmate the expected
pipeline tariff in the next ten years in consultation with Tazama;
(e)   estimate the rail tariff to transport bulk bitumen and bulk LPG to Lusaka from the least-
cost source (Dar-es-Salaam or Durban);
(f)   study the Tazama pipeline route from Dar-es-Salaam to Ndola from available maps and
other technical information and recommend suitable product tap-off points for the
neighboring countries;
(g)   review the Tazama pipeline capacity, as a product pipeline (current and in the future,
taking into account its modernizion program) and estimate the potential product export
capacity available with economic advantage to Zambia under the scenario emerging from
the preceding findings and estimates; and
(h)   review the current operation of Tazama and the marketing companies operating in
Zambia and the petroleum product pricing mechanism currently in effect at the wholesale
(ex-deport level), evaluate the options available to Zambia and (takdng account of the

need for the importing country to share in the benefit), recommend on the conmnercial
arrangements most likely to obtain sustainable benefits to Zambia should the predicted
volume of exports be reached.
6.    QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPEREENCE.: The selected consultant should have a minimum of
ten years experience in conducting similar petroleum products demand surveys and evaluations of the
relave economic advantages of different modes of bulk transportation. Experience in dealing with
Govrmen officis and major intenational oil companies on all aspects of petroleum product marketing
in land-ocked countries, especially product pricing, marketing and dealers margins, bulk  portaton
costs, eport/import, inter-company hospitalities and settlement of bills is essential.
7.    SCHEDULE OF WORK: The proposed market survey should be started in the field with initial
briefing meetings with the officials of ........  and Tazanma within 15 days after the contract becomes
effective. The consultant is expected to produce a draft report within 4 weeks thereafter which will be
Jointly reviewed by the officials from .,  Tazama, the World Bank and the consultant. The consultant
will prepare the final report within 2 weeks thereafter, taking into account the modifications and additions
agreed upon during the joit review. The total services from the consultants are esdmated to take about
two manont.
8.    REPORT PRESENTATION: The final report should contain all data collected during the survey
and review the technical and commercW data, both to be assembled and tabulated in a manner that will
be usefil for future reference. The report should indicate the basis and assumptions used for all
aluations and estimations made. Sources of data collected should be indicated as footnotes to the tables
and charts. The reasons for selecting or rejecting a particular option should be clearly justified. The
report should contain specific recommendations with respect to each aspect studied. A list of key
personnel met during the survey and study should be appended.

PE.ROLEUM SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING IN THE
MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT
(TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE TECHNICAL CELL)
1. BACKGROUND
1.1   Ihe petroleum supply and distribution in the country is within the portfolio of the
Ministry of Energy and Water Development (MEWD) which is responsible for identifying,
analyzing and formulating policies and strategies to address current and emerging energy
issues such as pricing reform, removal of supply constraints, restructuring of sector
organizations and enforcement of environmental and safety measures. The Ministry is also
responsible for coordinating all aspects of energy sector development in the country, including
the national energy strategy, the annual energy plan and the rolling five-year investment plan
and advising on capital expenditures. The Ministry and the Department of Energy within the
Ministry are now inadequately staffed to fulfil these functions satisfactorily. To overcome
this deficiency, MEWD intends to establish a Technical Cell of suitably qualified persomel
and provide them with orientation and on-the-job training, as part of the proposed IDA-
financed Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation. Initially the Technical Cell is expected to be
organized with consultants who will be assisted, in the day-to-day work, by suitably qualified
Ministry staff. The consultants who will be on contract for carrying out the work initially,
will train the Ministry staff while providing operational service, on a timebound program, so
that the Government stff could take over the responsibilities within a specified timetable.
2. JOB SPECIFICATION FOR THE TECHNICAL CELL
2.1   The main objective of the proposed Technical Cell is to build capacity in the MEWD
to frame regulatory measures concerning energy sector issues, and monitoring and
maintaini  records with respect to petroleum product consumption, sources of supply, energy
conservation, international prices, ocean tanker rates, domestic pricing of petroleum products,
stock position in the country, tariff levied by various modes of transportation in the country
(pipeline, rail and road), review and advise on investment priorities in the sector, and develop
export earning potential using the country's infrastructure and environmental and safety
measures in the sector. The job specification for the Technical Cell will include, among
others, the following:
(a)   review consumption of each petroleum product (gasoline, kero/jet, diesel, fuel
oil for industry and mining, bitumen, LPG, lube oil and other specialty oil
products) in each sector (industry, mining, agriculture, transport, commercia
establishments and household) and record the figures for reference for at least
the past ten years;
(b)    prepare forecasts of consumption for the next five years and keep these



-70-                             Anex 4.9
Page 2 of 2
updated every year on a rolling basis;
(c)   review areas where petroleum is consumed in large quantities and evaluate
options for conservation wizh costs and benefits thereof;
(d)   monitor the international situation for supplying petroleum products on a
continuous basis and prepare cost-effective options for the country from time-

PETROLEUM SECTOR REHABILUTATION PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions on tnandal Projections
1.    It is assumed that the present ZIMOIL will be replaced as the Zambia Oil Company (ZOC).
All the assets and liabilities of ZIMOIL will be taken over by ZOC. ZOC wfll be in chage
of procurement of feedstock only. The bulk distribution will be separated from ZOC.
2.    A separate company (OMCC) will be responsible for the bulk distribution of products.
OMCC will take delivery and own the feedstock from Dar-es-Salaam after ZOC passes it on
to them.
3.    ZOC wil continue to own the facilities for the first two years after the formation of the new
companies and wiUl lease the facilities to OMCC at a mutually agreed fee. After two years,
OMCC wiUl lease or purchase the facilities. For projection purposes, OMCC will have to buy
the facilities from ZOC.
4.    Tazama wiUl continue to offer its facilities to OMCC. The pumping facilities wil also be
open to other oil companies approved by the Government.
S.    ZOC and OMCC will adopt the pricing structure described in Table 5.2 and 5.4 respectively.
They wiUl revise the prices to reflect exchange fluctuations and international oil price
movements.

PEROLEUM SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECr
Zambia Oil Company
Notes and Assumptions on Fnandal Projectiom
All figures have been expressed in 1993 constant million Kwacha. The excnge rate assumed is 600
Kwachas per one U.S. dolla.
Income Statemnt
1.    Selling prices have been based on the price structure described in Table 5.2. Two
computations have been shown-one with BZ fund: the other without the BZ fund. The BZ
fund relates to the arrears of 19 billion Kwacha (as .  6115193) payable to the Bank of
Zambia by ZIMOIL. This is being paid in installm.-ats and it is expected ta the entre debit
balance will be cleared by the end of fiscal year 1994-95. Ihe selling price has been
accordingy reduced to the ext  of the BZ fund and the related tax effect (from US$289 per
ton in 1994-95 to US$163 per ton for later periods).
2.    The CIF cost of feedstock is assumed 0 US$150 per ton, based on the average price for
1993. It is estimatedthat afeedstock of 1.09039 tons wL be required to obtain one ton of
finished product
3.    The Landed Dar-es-Salaam cost includes:
(a)    Harbor dues @ 1.5% of CIF
(b)    Normal ocean loss 0 0.3% of CIF
(c)   Inspection/Demurrage 0 0.25% of CIP
4.    Finance charges have been assumed @ 1% of C]F
5.    Interest on BZ fund relates to the interest payable on the arrears due to the Bank of Zambia
from Zimoil.
6.     t is assumed tat ZOC wll advance funds on a defered payment basis to OMCC for its
working capital requme. Interest on these funds has been assmed a 8.5 % per year.
7. Abnormal loss has been costed a 5% of CIF. Any surplus in this account above the actual
abnormal losses irred (over and above the internationally accepted standards) will be
transferred to a special wLoss Fund" to be used in future need. This Fund will exist only
during the rehabiliation process. Once the rehabilitation is complete, the units will have to
meet to intemational standards. In the projections, the provision for abnormal loss has been
made unti the year 2000.
8.    Adminie costs have been provided 0 US$1 per ton.

Balance Sheet
1.    Stodck: On an average, one shipment of stock is always expected to be in transit or in the
Dar-es-Salaam storage tanks. This has been priced 0 US$150 per ton for 90,000 tons.
2.    Accounts Recdvables: This represents the amounts advanced to OMCC. It is assumed that
ZOC will have to grant credit to OMCC for the fuil amount of stock held in the Dar-es-
Salaam storage tanks and in the pipeline (a total of approximately 180,000 tons 0 cost for
OMCC [US$289 per ton for 94-95 and US$163 per ton from 95-96J) and in the Indead and
the terminal tanks at Ndola (approximately US$29.13 million for 1994-95 and US$17.91
million later, estimated on the basis of the average stock held during Oct.and Nov.92 and
Feb.93). This will be gradually reduced over five years fom 1996-97.
3.    Plant and Equipment: Assets have been valued at the estimated replacement value of
US$ 10 million. It is expected that OMCC will buy these facilities by the end of 1996-97.
4.    DepreIation: 10% on a straight line basis assuming ten years of life.
5.    Work In Progres: The proposed project loan amounts have been accounted as work in
progress until the completion of the project.
6.    Long-Term Debt: Ihe funds proposed to be advanced by ZOC to OMCC for financing
working capital requirements are treated as long-term borrowing for ZOC to be repaid by the
year 2000. The amount payable within a year is shown as shortterm debt.
7.    Project Leans: Proposed World Bank loan of US$2.1 million to be disbursed in stages.
8.    Asset Reluon Reserre: Diffce between the book value and the revalued replacemen
value. [6,000-93 = 5,907 million Kwachas]

Tazana Pipelines Limited (Tazama)
1. General Notes on Accounting Principles (Historical)
Fbied Assets.
1.1   Fixed assets include all capital items.
ShortlLong-Term Indebtedness
1.2   Short-term indebtedness comprises installments repayable within a year on long-term
indebtedness.
Stocks
1.3   Stocks consist mainly of machinery spares, fuel and lubricants and are stated at the
lower of cost and net realizable value. In general, cost is determined on a weighted
average basis by reference to the actual landed cost of each consignment.
Depredation
1.4    Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line
basis over the expected economic life of the assets. The principal annual rates used
for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the previous years, are:
Capital work in progress                 Nil
Leasehold land and buildings              2.5%
Pipeline and tank farms                   5%
Plant, earth moving equipment
and office furniture                     10%
Cars, trucks, cffice equipment
and residential furniture                25%
Bush vehicles                            48%
Loose tools                              33.33%
Foreign Currencies
1.5    Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Zambian
Kwacha at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Net exchange gains
and losses on the translation of assets and short-term liabilities are recognized in the
profit and loss account in the period in which they arise. Exchange losses, interest,
and other charges on pipelined amounts are recognized on a cash basis.
1.6    Net exchange gains and losses relating to the translation of long-term borrowing are
deferred for recognition in the profit and loss account over the period of (and in



- 81 -                            Annex 5.
Page 2 of 5
proportion to) the repayment of the loans to which they relate. To the extent that
exchange losses arise from a major depreciation of the Kwacha against the currencies
of borrowings incurred for fixed assets recendy acquired or not yet commissioned,
these are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
1.7    All transactions of a revenue nature expressed in Tanzanian shillings are converted to
the Zambian Kwacha at an average rate throughout the year.
Cost of Borrowings
1.8   Interest on borrowings in respect of capital projects is capitalised together with other
borrowing costs. The rate of capitalization is the actual rate payable on identifiable
borrrowings for specific projects.
Taxation
1.9   By a convention between the governments of the Republic of Zambia and the United
Republic of Tanzania, the company is exempt from taxation.
Foreign Exchange Pipeline
1.10   From 1978 to October 3, 1985, Kwacha cover paid to the Bank of Zambia for the
settlement of foreign liabilities was placed in the foreign exchange pipeline awaiting
allocation of foreign currency. At the date of depositing the Kwacha cover, the
foreign liability was treated as setfled and both deposit and liability excluded from the
balance sheet. Since October 3, 1985, no further deposits have been placed in the
foreign exchange pipeline and foreign liabilities have been incurred only when the
availability of foreign currency for repayments has been ascertained.
Inflation Adjustnents
1.11   The company has not yet complied with International Accounting Standard Number 29
(AS29), "Accounting in Hyperinflationary Economies". No definitive statement has
yet been issued by the Zambia Institute of Certified Accountants, the body responsible
for the regulation of accounting standards in Zambia.

2. Projections
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Projecions
Ihe financial projections are based on historical accounts. The projections are made in 1993
constant Kwacha ($=600 Kwachas), without considering inflation and exchange rate
detioraon. As Tazama is a subsidiary of ZIMCO, ZIMCO confirms that it will contiue to
provide adequate support of working capital to enable the company to maintain its operations
as a going concern for the duration of the project
A. Inoome Statement

1995-96     -      712
1996-97     -      721
1997-98      -     729
1998-99     -      740
1999-2000    -     749

ZAMBIA
PEMTOLEUM SECTOR BEIIABUXTATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis of Refinery Operations
and Product Pipeline Options
AsLumptions for the Economic Analysis
1.    Consumption of products in Zambia was assumed as in Table 1 of Annex 6.2.
Forecast demand agreed with the Zambian Government during the pre-appraisal
missions was based on growth in GDP. The demand for fuel oil was based on
consumption in the mining sector.
2.    Crude and product prices were estimated on the basis of average March 1992 Middle
East prices as follows:
FOB (US$/ton)
Crude        127
LPG          106
Gasoline     193
Jet fuel     182
Naphtha      150
Kerosene     170
Diesel       151
Fuel Oil      70
Bitumen       85
VGO          120
Prices were kept constant during the project life.
3.    Crude and Product blends will be transported to Dar-es-Salaam SBM in 90,000-ton
tankers, and white products in 45,000-ton clean tankers. Ihe estimated freight costs
per ton were US$6 for 90,000-ton tankers and US$8 for the clean tankers (except
LPG and Bitumen). Freight costs per ton for LPG were estimated at US$150 and
Bitumen at US$300.
4.    In the products option, products wiUl be unloaded through a separate submarine and
on-shore pipeline connected to the SBM. Two additional storage tanks will be
provided at the Dar-es-Salaam terminal to segregate each product.
5.    Pipeline use until fully rehabilitated is assumed to be 800,000 tons/year (1,000,000
tonslyear afterwards).
6.    Refinery capacity to achieve 7% fuel consumption and loss is assumed to be 750,000
tons per year and 8% at lower capacity. After installing the preflash tower, refinery
capacity is assumed to be 1,000,000 tons per year, and after installing the energy

Page 2 of 7
conservation measure the Iuel consumption and loss is assumed to improve by 1 %.
7.    In the Product Line Case, two tap-off points at Makambako and Mbeya in Tanzania
and one at Kalonji in Zambia were envisaged. The fuel oil requirement of the mining
sector will be met by diesel supplied at the price of fuel oil initially. Using
experience gained during the first year of operation, a cheaper product of vacuum gas
oil (VGO) transported by the pipeline will be provided. Jet fael will be transported
by rail from Dar-es-SaWam initially, and after the first year of operation, it will be
transported in the pipeline as Duel Purpose Kerosene (DPK).
8.    The construction period for all facilities was assumed to be three years.
9.    In the Refinery Cases, exports will be limited to the Shaba region of Zaire and are
expected to be 75,000 tons per year under normal circumstances. In the Product Line
Case, exports to Shaba as well as to other countries from the pipeline were assumed.
The potential export markets assumed were: Shaba (Zaire) = 75,000 tons; Tanzania
= 60,000 tons; and South of Livingstone = 50,000 tons.
10.   The operating costs of the refinery and the pipeline were estimated on the basis of
current financial statements of Indeni and Tazama.
