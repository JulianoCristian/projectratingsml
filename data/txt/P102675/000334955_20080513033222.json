In harmony with other development\n            partners, the proposed Development Policy Operation (DPO)\n            will support the implementation of Ghana's Food and\n            Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP). This\n            operation will support planning and budgeting processes that\n            take into account the multi-sector and economy wide linkages\n            that support agricultural growth. By linking lending to the\n            implementation of the revised FASDEP and the evolution of\n            the sector wide approach, this operation will support the\n            sector's objective of supporting broad based growth and\n            increased private sector investments. Using the\n            Government's budget procedures, the proposed operation\n            will also help strengthen the decentralization process,\n            especially as related to agriculture. The main risks are:\n            (i) political risk associated with the 2008 election\n            campaign (low); (ii) continued delays in decentralization\n            process (low); (iii) delays in the completion of the SWAP\n            framework (moderate); and (iv) delays in budget allocations\n            and releases (moderate). This risk could be mitigated by\n            deepening the dialogue on expenditure frameworks and the\n            budget process, including GPRS II financing discussions held\n            at the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)/ Multi-Donor\n            Budget Support (MDBS) level."}, "docdt": "2008-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
