follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: sector\n            development policy lending for the agriculture sector has\n            proven to be an effective, flexible instrument that\n            empowered the Government of Ghana to implement a\n            country-owned policy and the related programs. An important\n            lesson for future operations is to ensure that the policy\n            agenda underlying the operation is complementary to the\n            Bank's and other development partners' investment\n            lending operations, thus creating synergies that enhance the\n            policy making process as well as program implementation. The\n            design of Agriculture Development Policy Operation (AgDPO)\n            policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions are major\n            undertakings that need to be better integrated in Ministry\n            of Food and Agriculture's (MoFA's) planning\n            process. Coordination between the World Bank's and\n            Canadian International Development Agency's\n            (CIDA's) budget support programs prevented duplication\n            and contributed to sector planning and coordination."}, "docdt": "2011-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
