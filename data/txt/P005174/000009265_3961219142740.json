inputs\n            and urban transport services, that would reduce Greenhouse\n            Gases (GHG) emissions from vehicular traffic, while\n            simultaneously improving local air quality.  GHG abatement\n            can be achieved through a variety of measures, all of which\n            will produce some reductions in local air pollution.  The\n            GEF project will identify a schedule of measures, to achieve\n            a target air quality improvement, which serve both\n            objectives at the lowest incremental cost for GHG abatement.\n            Such a schedule of GHG abatement maximizing measures, and\n            the associated incremental costs, will provide decision\n            makers with the information necessary to design a program of\n            local air pollution abatement that simultaneously, and cost\n            effectively, addresses global warming concerns. The project\n            is a joint effort between Tehran Municipality and the GEF to\n            study options for future development of the Tehran transport\n            system in an environmentally sustainable manner.  The GEF\n            contribution will enable the study to address concerns\n            related to global warming which would otherwise not receive\n            priority from a national perspective.  The project comprises\n            the following components:  (a) emissions inventory and air\n            quality monitoring; (b) traffic management and restraint;\n            (c) vehicle fleet and fuels improvement; (d) strategic urban\n            transport emissions reduction planning; (e) project support\n            and transport and air quality seminar; and (f) an\n            international panel of experts."}, "docdt": "1993-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
