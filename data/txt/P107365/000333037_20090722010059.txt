Borrower            The Government of Ukraine

Implementing Agency Not applicable

                    IBRD Loan;
Financing Data      Terms: 30 yr maturity with 5 year grace, level principal repayments, six-
                    month LIBOR for USD plus variable spread for an IBRD Flexible Loan.
                    Front end fee: 0.25% of loan amount to be financed out of loan proceeds
                    Amount: USD 500 million
Operation Type      Third Development Policy Loan (DPL-III)

                    The programmatic DPL series supports reforms under three policy areas: (i)
Main Policy Areas   improving the investment climate to sustain growth; (ii) creating fiscal space
                    for growth through strengthened public finances and public sector reforms;
                    and (iii) improving service delivery and social inclusion.

                    The key outcome indicators (which are detailed in the operation Matrix in
                    Annex 1) are as follows: (i) reduced cost of doing business; (ii) increased
                    international integration by reducing the cost of trade; (iii) increased private
Key Outcome         sector investment through development and stability of the financial sector;
Indicators          (iv) improved efficiency of public financial management; (v) fiscal space for
                    growth through reduced government consumption and transfers; (vi)
                    improved sustainability of the pension system.

                    The proposed DPL-III supports the Government's socioeconomic reform
                    program to promote sustainable and broad-based growth. In the context of
                    the global financial crisis and Ukraine's macroeconomic vulnerabilities, this
                    operation will support the Government's effort to set in place key policy and
                    institutional reforms that will help develop investor confidence and promote
                    a faster and a stronger economic recovery.

                    The operation builds on the achievements of the previous operations in the
                    programmatic series and carries forward the three-pillar agenda, namely: (i)
                    improving the investment climate to sustain growth; (ii) creating fiscal space
Program Development for growth through strengthened public finances and public sector reforms;
Objective(s) and    and (iii) improving service delivery and social inclusion. As regards to
Contribution to CAS improving the investment climate, this operation supports the enactment of
                    a Law on Joint Stock Companies. This Law is a breakthrough legislation on
                    corporate governance that will encourage transparency in corporate
                    practices, promote FDI, and reinvigorate the securities market. It also
                    supports a package of legislative and regulatory measures that lay out initial
                    steps in building a framework to rehabilitate the banking system. This
                    operation also supports executive actions to reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit in
                    the energy sector as well as to improve the business environment for new
                    firm growth by reducing the frequency and costs of business inspections. In
                    terms of fiscal policy and public administration, the DPL-III supports a
                    new procurement framework, which signals the commitment of the
                    government to increased efficiency and transparency in public spending. As

                 in prior operations, the DPL also supports a deficit target for 2007 and 2008
                 (the latter in line with the IMF Stand-By Arrangement recently approved by
                 the IMF Board). There are also a number of measures supported by the DPL
                 geared to improving tax policy, tax administration, and budgeting practices.
                 In terms of social areas, this operation supports focused achievements in
                 implementing education quality measurements and higher transparency
                 mechanisms in access to higher education. It also recognizes efforts that
                 would bring sustainability to the pay-as-you go pension system.

                 This operation is an integral part of the FY08-FY11 Country Partnership
                 Strategy (CPS) and is strongly anchored in its principles. The FY08-11 CPS
                 adopted a two pillar support strategy around: (i) improving competitiveness
                 by strengthening the business climate and investing in infrastructure, and (ii)
                 improving the delivery of public services through the reform of public
                 finance and public administration. The benchmarks and prior actions
                 (triggers) of this operation match milestones in the CPS.

                 The process of macroeconomic adjustment has just started and there are
                 significant downward economic risks moving forward. The most important
                 economic risks lie in the size of further external shocks (terms of trade,
                 credit markets squeeze and external debt refinancing), larger than expected
                 re-capitalization needs for banks arising from a sharper adjustment and lack
                 of refinancing, a potential overshooting of the exchange rate, and incomplete
                 implementation of the IMF-supported government program.

                 In addition, there are political risks which derive from the political
                 instability in the country. This can take many forms. Frequent changes in
                 Government may lead to delays in follow up on the implementation of the
                 reform program and to the recovery process itself. It may also lead to
                 backsliding on key reforms if changing political coalitions lead to different
                 reform priorities. Moreover, the political instability, especially in the current
                 economic climate, may also encourage greater public resistance to the
                 implementation of key reforms, such as further increases in energy tariffs.
Risks and Risk
Mitigation       The economic risks are mitigated in three ways. First, the IMF SBA would
                 serve as an anchor to maintain an appropriate macro-economic framework.
                 Second, the implementation of the reform program laid out in this operation
                 by the Government has, in itself, helped strengthen the basis for encouraging
                 investor confidence and supporting a faster and stronger economic recovery.
                 And third, the Bank continues to be engaged with the Government to build
                 upon the initial measures taken under the "Anti-Crisis Law" with respect to
                 the establishment of a strengthened framework for bank re-capitalization and
                 resolution so as to address immediate difficulties and contribute to the future
                 consolidation of the banking system in Ukraine. Residual economic risks
                 remain high nonetheless reflecting the uncertain global environment and the
                 challenges of policy implementation in the Ukrainian context.

                 Mitigating political risks is difficult. But, notwithstanding the fractious
                 politics, the country's recent political history suggests that Ukraine's
                 political system can generate compromise around key reform areas as shown
                 by the process leading to the accession to WTO and, more recently, the


                                            viii

                enactment of the Joint Stock Company Law and the "Anti-Crisis Law".
                There is also a sense in the country that the political and business
                communities would have a lot to lose from the economic consequences of a
                protracted crisis. But the design of this operation also actively seeks to
                mitigate the political risk in two ways. First, DPL-III supports an agenda for
                reforms that is common across the political spectrum. Indeed, experience
                has shown that the DPL program has provided an anchor to the
                government's reform efforts over the past three years. Second, this
                operation is based on measures that have already been completed prior to its
                approval. And third, many of the measures undertaken are anchored in
                legislative enactments which have a higher chance of irreversibility. This,
                however, still leaves open the possibility of slow implementation or even
                backsliding.

                        1. POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

A. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

1.       Ukraine has been beset by political volatility over the past three years. While the country has
made major strides in advancing democratic development, political and media freedoms, economic
reforms, and enforcement of property rights, it has also experienced continuous political volatility.
Domestic politics are highly contested, constitutional arrangements on the division of powers between the
President and the Parliament remain unclear, and the judiciary has become largely politicized and
undermined as an independent institution.

2.        The fragile coalition of the parties of the President and the Prime Minister (with a simple
majority of only 2 votes) never managed to realize its full potential in the Parliament. Political
confrontation and dissent reached its peak in early September 2008, when the Prime Minister's bloc sided
with the opposition deputies of the Party of Regions to vote for legislation significantly limiting
presidential powers. In response, the President's party abandoned the coalition. On October 8, 2008 after
failed efforts to form a new parliamentary coalition, the President called for an early election to be held in
December 2008. More recently, the President temporarily delayed his decision on the election to give
Parliament time to pass the anti-crisis legislation and to approve the budget financing for the elections.

3.       Despite the ongoing domestic political struggles, a broad consensus exists on Ukraine's
vision of reform and economic development. Notwithstanding frequent government turnover, all three
major political blocks went into the last 3 elections with a pro-market platform. Indeed, the political
forces have shown that they can come together to support reforms in key areas of national interest, such
as in the case of WTO accession and deepening integration with Europe. Efforts towards international
integration have been an anchor for Ukraine's economic reform process.

4.       While the current economic crisis has brought to the fore Ukraine's economic
vulnerabilities, it also provides an opportunity for policymakers to accelerate implementation of
much-needed economic and social reforms. The Government has already responded to the economic
crisis-- which was triggered by the global financial crisis-- by the adoption of an "Anti-Crisis Law1"
which was enacted on October 31. The immediate challenge is to follow up on its effective
implementation and stabilize the economy. However, Ukraine will have to move forward with fiscal,
business environment and social sector reforms needed to enable a quicker recovery from the current
economic downturn. Despite the sense of urgency, which has facilitated strong initial policy measures, the
policy environment remains challenging going forward.

B. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS AND POVERTY2

5.       Ukraine has enjoyed one of the fastest rates of poverty reduction in the region in recent
years. Poverty rates based upon a nationally-derived poverty line fell sharply from 19.5 percent in 2003


1The Law on Priority Measures to Prevent Negative Impact of Financial Crisis and on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts
of Ukraine. The content of the measures is described in more detail in Section 4 of this Program Document.
2This section draws on the Bank's Poverty Update 2006 and 2007, the Public Finance Review II (2008), and a policy note on the
impact of higher food prices (Agricultural Competitiveness or State Intervention: the World Food Crisis and Ukraine, May 2008).


                                                               1

to an estimated 7.8 percent in 2006 (the most recent year for which data is available), though the
reduction trend slowed in 2006 (see Figure 1.1).3 Economic vulnerability defined as the share of the
population below $5 dollars per person a day in 2005 PPPs (but above the poverty line) also fell sharply
during this period. But even in 2006, about a quarter of Ukraine's population was either poor or
vulnerable to poverty. The reduction in poverty was driven mainly by rapid broad-based productivity
increases in the economy which led to rising household incomes. Public sector increases in both real
wages and social transfers also helped raise incomes. The stagnation of poverty rates in 2006 likely
reflects the lagged effect of low economic growth in 2005. But rapid GDP growth of 7.6 percent in 2007
and a more modest 5.0 percent expected for 2008 will likely have led to further, albeit slower, poverty
reduction (see Section 7 Figure 7.1 for poverty simulations).

6.                 The analysis of poverty suggests that significant issues of inequality and vulnerability
remain. First, inequality is increasing. While overall inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient,
remains moderate compared to other countries at similar income levels, the sharp rise of the Gini in 2006
reduced the overall effect of growth on poverty. In part, the increase in inequality was on account of the
rapid rise in non-food expenditures driven by higher utility prices, which disproportionately affects the
urban population.4            Second, vulnerability to poverty is sizeable, and lower growth would push a
significant number of people into poverty. Household survey data suggests, in particular, that as much as
10 percent of all households in the poorest income quintile are indebted, and much of their outstanding
loans are in foreign currency. This makes poor households particularly vulnerable to interest rate and
exchange rate shocks.5

7.                 The acceleration in inflation rates (including that in food prices in the first semester of
2008) created significant social pressures and further pressure is expected from increased energy
tariffs in 2009. Real disposable income grew by 13 percent y-o-y in January-September 2008 and food
prices eased since July 2008. However, tariff increases for energy and other utilities, necessitated by the
continuous increase in the prices of imported energy will impose a further burden on poorer segments of
the population, particularly the urban poor (see Section 7 C).




3The national poverty line is based upon standard World Bank methodology. In 2005 prices, this translates into about $3.60 per
person per day. The Government of Ukraine uses a relative poverty line.

8.        Ukraine maintains a relatively generous system of social payments and transfers, but the
targeting could be improved to help mitigate the impact of the economic downturn whilst
remaining within the fiscal target. Ukraine spends around 20 percent of GDP on social transfers,
including the pay-as-you-go pension system, social funds, and social assistance programs. Repeated
discretionary increases in transfers allowed pensions and other social transfers to increase in real terms.
There is also an extensive system of special transfers and privileges awarded to certain occupations and
groups which are not particularly effective in reaching the poor. There are, however, some social transfers
that are well-targeted with the potential of being significantly scaled up, such as the program for the
extreme poor and the program for single mothers with children.6 As the sustainability of Ukraine's recent
social policies is called into question and as fiscal policy is tightened in response to the need for
macroeconomic stability, better targeting of transfer programs will be needed to protect the poorest and
the most vulnerable (see Section 7, C).

9.        Ukraine spends a significant percentage of GDP (significantly above comparable countries)
in sectors such as health and education. However, for the large amount of resources the budget spends
on health and education services, Ukrainians do not obtain good value.7 The health sector outcomes are
quite poor as shown by some indicators. While maternal and child mortality rates have improved in recent
years, male life expectancy at 61.7 years remains below the pre-transition levels and has been worsening.
At the same time, the incidence of illnesses such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS has been growing.8 Most
of the health indicators for Ukraine under-perform those for the new EU member countries. Data on
education performance are not available, since it was only in 2007 that Ukraine started to take part in
international comparable standardized tests of student performance. Nevertheless, there is indirect
evidence of increasing dispersion in the quality of learning combined with shortages of skilled labor as
reported by businesses. Moreover, Ukraine's score is among the lowest of all transition economies when
it comes to rating the quality of health and education services, as shown in the 2006 EBRD-World Bank
Life in Transition Survey.


              2. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS

A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

10.       Ukraine has experienced a solid recovery since the 1998-99 financial crisis, with annual
growth averaging above 7 percent between 2000 and 2007. This recovery started from a low base, as
GDP had fallen to below half of its pre-transition level by 1998. The financial crisis of 1998 led to a
realignment of the real exchange rate, which together with fiscal and financial stabilization efforts and
initial structural reforms in 2000-2001, helped to jump start the recovery. A competitive exchange rate,
favorable external terms of trade (a cumulative 30 percent gain between 2003 and 2007), and significant
under-utilized capacity allowed Ukraine to make good use of an unusually favorable external
environment and boost exports. The macro-policy framework, until very recently, involved a de facto peg
of the UAH to the USD with a significant burden of adjustment to external shocks falling on fiscal policy.
In an environment of positive external shocks, this fueled fast revenue growth. But larger budget
expenditures on current spending and transfers since 2005, together with increased access to international

6The support payments to people in extreme poverty cover around 3-4 percent of the population and cover 73 percent of the
extreme poor.
7A comprehensive analysis of the causes of inefficiency in health and education spending is provided by the World Bank Public
Finance Review II (2008).
8The Bank has been engaged on putting in place robust policy responses to deal with HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis through an
US$ 80 million investment loan, approved in 2002. However, these efforts have met with limited success due to a variety of
factors, including weak capacity, constant changes in government counterparts and weak ownership among top policy makers. A
learning ICR is under implementation to draw lessons and chart the Bank's future engagement in this critical area.


                                                               3

financing and rapid credit growth, fueled domestic demand. As a result, growth shifted from being export-
led to consumption-led, placing additional pressure on the current account and price stability (see Table
2.1).

11.      By late 2007, the economy was showing increased signs of overheating. Consumption had
risen at twice the rate of GDP since 2005, investment was up over 21 percent year-on-year (yoy) in both
2006 and 2007 and the current account balance had consequently deteriorated from a surplus of 10.6
percent of GDP in 2004 to a deficit of 3.7 percent in 2007, despite the substantial terms of trade
improvements. Up to 2007, this widening of the current account deficit was financed by large inflows of
foreign borrowings and investment.

12.      Macroeconomic pressures intensified in 2008. Price pressures mounted, driven by higher food
and energy prices, but also an inconsistent macroeconomic policy mix. Loose fiscal policies, a de facto
exchange rate peg, and an open capital account led to rapid credit growth and internal and external
imbalances with rising inflation and a growing current account deficit. Real wage growth continued to
outstrip productivity improvements and inflation rates rose to about 30 percent during the first half of
2008. Although an expansionary budget was approved for 2008, the Government tried to contain fiscal
pressures during budget execution by restraining non-discretionary spending and by over-executing
revenues (helped by the de facto inflation tax). Monetary policy was also tightened through higher
provisioning on external borrowings and through permitting the appreciation of the UAH by 10 percent
(relative to the US dollar) to a level of 4.6 UAH in May.9

13.      The global financial crisis has exposed Ukraine's inherent macroeconomic vulnerabilities
and led to an economic crisis. While sovereign and corporate spreads were already increasing for
Ukraine since the first half of 2008 in the context of high inflation and widening current account deficit,
the international financial crisis brought existing refinancing risks and risks associated with the banking
sector to the fore (see Section B). Moreover, the prospects of slowing global demand led to a sharp fall in
the price of steel, Ukraine's main export. Since early September 2008, the currency has depreciated by
over 20 percent.

months. Roughly 40 percent of external short
term debt in the banking sector is to parent banks and one third of external corporate debt is to parent
firms and/or within-group firms abroad (see detail in Table 2.2).

16.      Pre-existing banking sector risks have been accentuated by the crisis. Driven by the aim of
gaining market share and fueled by borrowing from abroad, banks grew their loan portfolios very rapidly
in recent years with lax credit analysis and underwriting standards. Nominal credit growth, which reached
78 percent yoy in February 2008 only decelerated to 54 percent yoy growth as of end-September. While
foreign ownership of banks improved confidence (foreign owned banks hold 40 percent of the assets),
significant risks accumulated through increase in foreign borrowings, foreign currency exposures and
mismatches, and rapid credit growth with lax loan evaluation. At the end of September 2008 around 30
percent of deposits were in foreign currency compared to 50 percent of credits. Banks are highly exposed

to a withdrawal of interbank or market funding with a loan-to-deposit ratio of around 180 percent at end-
October (see Figure 2.1), with the corresponding figure for foreign currency over 280 percent. Lending to
real estate accounts for only 15 percent of total loans, but mortgages are mostly denominated in foreign
currency and in the context of overheated real estate markets, create both currency and collateral value
risks. At the same time, supervision and regulation efforts have not kept pace with the sector's rapid
growth.

17.     In September 2008, liquidity dried up in the banking sector, forcing the NBU to funnel
resources through the system, with solvency and credit risks still looming large. The liquidity and
then solvency concerns for Prominvest Bank
(the 6th largest bank in the system), that was     Figure 2.2: EU steel price index in USD, Jan 1997=100

event triggered a steady leakage of deposits        250

from the banking system. During October, this       200
amounted to a 9 percent decline of UAH
deposits and a 6 percent reduction of foreign       150

recent years, declined sharply in the last three
months and may fall further, driven by slowing global demand (see Figure 2.2). On the import side,
Ukraine faces the likelihood of increased gas import prices in the wake of Russia's agreement with the
Central Asian states to pay prices at European levels minus transportation costs from 2009. These
developments signal the need for shock absorption through lower domestic demand and/or real exchange
rate adjustment.

19.     Wage and price inflation over 2005-2007 have eroded Ukraine's competitive position and
will require adjustment going forward. Consumer inflation has been on the rise over the last two years
and peaked in May at 31% yoy (see Figure 2.3). While global factors such as higher food and energy
prices have contributed to the inflation upsurge, expansionary macroeconomic policies have also played a


                                                     6

key role in this trend. The persistent rapid growth of nominal households' incomes (over 40 percent),
driven by significant public wage and pension increases, and a continued, albeit decelerated, expansion of
private credit led to higher inflation in Ukraine than in regional peers. Whilst inflation decelerated over
the last 5 months due to fiscal and monetary tightening, it remains high, above 20%. The resulting real
effective appreciation of the UAH has eroded Ukraine's external competitiveness at a time when its terms
of trade and access to finance are worsening. There is therefore a need for a combination of real wage
restraint and real exchange rate correction.

C. THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE AND THE IMF STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT

20.     Against the background of a worsening external outlook and evident strains in the domestic
economy, the authorities acted rapidly. Already since March 2008, the authorities had begun
implementing a more flexible exchange rate policy by initially allowing the UAH to appreciate and in
September 2008 by widening the band. Execution of the 2008 budget was conservative and the authorities
entered the crisis with a comfortable fiscal cushion. Nonetheless, as the environment deteriorated rapidly
during late September and early October, a set of fiscal and monetary policy adjustment measures were
designed and attention focused on the growing problems in the banking sector. The authorities recognized
that they would require outside assistance both to design a robust policy response and to provide
financing necessary for an orderly adjustment. Their plans and the request for assistance were presented
to the IMF and the World Bank during the Annual Meetings. An "Anti-Crisis Law", containing critical
elements of the authorities' response to the crisis was passed by the Verkhovna Rada on October 31.

21.     The "Anti-Crisis Law" contains provisions on fiscal and incomes policies, measures to
prevent a credit crunch and took initial steps towards banking sector rehabilitation. The Law
creates a stabilization fund, with the mandate to finance necessary capital increases in the banking sector,
in addition to providing support to the real economy, subject to privatization revenues being available. It
also clarifies the process for bank recapitalization and resolution, strengthening in particular the authority
of the regulator to intervene in banks suspected of solvency risks or in violation of prudential norms.
Details of the bank recapitalization and resolution framework have subsequently been defined by Cabinet
of Ministers and NBU resolutions. The Law further aims to strengthen confidence in the banking system
by increasing the level of insurance on deposits (both in local currency and foreign exchange) from UAH
50,000 to UAH 150,000, thus covering around 99 percent of household deposits in Ukraine. On the fiscal
side, the transitional provisions of the Law provide for the indexation of minimum wages to the official
CPI forecast, thus abolishing the earlier-intended convergence of minimum wages to the subsistence
minimum, which would have implied unsustainable fiscal expansion. Moreover, the Law obliges the
Cabinet of Ministers to submit a deficit free 2009 budget. Finally, the Law amends the budget to allow for
additional International Financial Institutions (IFI) borrowing, in light of increased financing needs.

22.     In support of the authorities' adjustment policies, the IMF approved on November 5 a
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for 11 billion SDR over two years. Under the program, Ukraine would
receive financing of USD 4.3 billion in 2008, USD 10 billion in 2009, and USD 2.3 billion in 2010. The
financing program also implies a minimum of USD 1.5 billion of external financing to the budget in 2009
coming from IFIs, and a similar amount in 2010 (see section D). The policy actions supported by the IMF
SBA are detailed in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.11

23.     A flexible exchange rate policy and critical measures on the banking sector are prominent
in the IMF SBA. As a prior action under the SBA the authorities abolished the exchange rate band. A
flexible exchange rate will provide a buffer to the economy against external shocks. Base money targets

are set initially as an anchor since the requirements for inflation targeting are not yet in place, but
measures will be taken for an appropriate transition to inflation targeting over the medium term. The
banking sector measures supported by the SBA are aimed at increasing confidence through a higher
threshold on deposit insurance (increased from UAH 50,000 to UAH 150,000) and having a prompt and
controlled recapitalization and resolution of commercial banks. As mentioned, the legal framework for
this was laid in the "Anti-Crisis Law" with subsequent implementing regulations issued as Cabinet of
Minister and NBU resolutions. The IMF SBA also supports the resolution of Prominvest Bank as a prior
action. Total costs of recapitalization (specifically, likely total capital injection to meet a 10% capital
adequacy ratio) are estimated to be at 8.1 percent of the 2008 GDP in the base case scenario, which
includes 5.5 percent of GDP in direct fiscal costs. But total costs could go up to 12 percent in a harder
landing scenario. Roughly half of this amount is estimated to be required during 2009.

24.      The IMF SBA also supports measures to ensure responsible fiscal management. The IMF-
supported government program targets a balanced budget for 2009 (excluding the cost of bank
recapitalizations), and prudent fiscal deficits in 2010 and beyond. The fiscal adjustment would notably
rely on significant cuts in subsidies and expenditure in goods and services. It would also reflect slower
growth of public sector wages and pensions compared to recent trends, as these would grow in line with
inflation, as envisaged by the response program of the government laid out in the "anti-crisis Law".12
Additionally, under the IMF SBA the authorities have committed to pass-through higher energy prices to
final consumers gradually over the next 2 years.

D. MEDIUM TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

25.      Ukraine is heading for a recession during 2009 in the face of the credit crunch, terms of
trade deterioration, and the likely slowdown in export demand as Western Europe and the world
more generally experience lower economic activity. Short-term macroeconomic stabilization will
require a significant tightening of aggregate demand and a shift in the composition of aggregate demand
towards net exports. The stock of public debt is currently low at 10 percent of GDP, and is projected to
remain sustainable throughout and after the adjustment, even after adding the potential costs of bank
recapitalization. External debt refinancing/roll-over for banks and corporates is at the core of the
stabilization process, and thus linked to the prospects of a credible program of macroeconomic policies
and structural reform moving forward.

26.      The IMF SBA provides an anchor for Ukraine's appropriate macroeconomic policies for
the next two years. While Ukraine would remain vulnerable to a variety of shocks in a fragile global
environment, the IMF SBA provides a macroeconomic policy framework that is adequate for the DPL-III
to proceed. The IMF-supported government program would tighten fiscal and monetary policies to
facilitate an orderly adjustment to the terms of trade and refinancing shocks currently underway. This
operation complements the IMF SBA by emphasizing structural reforms as a key element of policy
credibility and rapid recovery over the medium-term.

27.      Consistent and credible implementation of the IMF SBA will be required by the authorities
to prevent an erosion of market confidence. The macroeconomic policy framework is built on
conservative assumptions regarding Ukraine's terms of trade, but does imply a significant degree of roll-
over of private sector credits. This will require consistent signals from the authorities, and the willingness
to adjust further should the assumptions turn out to be unjustified. Residual risks to the economic and
policy outlook remain large even after mitigation, as emphasized below.



12The increase of the minimum wage level to the level of the subsistence minimum wage was avoided, in line with the Bank's
and the IMF's advice, although such a measure was envisaged by the government.


                                                               8

28.     The basic macroeconomic parameters in our forecast are broadly consistent with those in
the IMF SBA. Our estimate of GDP decline in 2009 (at -2 percent of GDP) is slightly smaller compared
to that of the IMF (at -3 percent of GDP), but our forecast for end 2008 GDP growth at 5% is also lower
than that of the IMF. We also expect a substantial reduction in the current account deficit. Our estimate of
refinancing needs in 2009 is larger than those estimated by the IMF, due to a larger estimated share of the
short term portion of longer maturity debt. The roll-over assumption used in the Bank's macroeconomic
estimations is 75 percent. Table 2.3 contains our latest macroeconomic estimates for 2008-2011, and
includes the IMF SBA over the next 2 years. Given continued global volatility, the assumptions
underlying these projections are likely to undergo further revisions and thus the projections presented here
are associated with a more than usual degree of uncertainty.

Source: WB projections.
29.     The key factors underlying these projections are as follows:

    (i)      The economy will be in a recession in 2009 due to the terms of trade shock, drop in
             global demand for metals, constrained refinancing of the private external debt and a
             resulting external credit crunch and reduction in domestic credit expansion. We expect
             growth to rebound to 3.5 percent in 2010 (still some 1-1.5 percent below potential output) and
             to reach an average of 5 percent thereafter. Ukraine's estimated medium-term growth rate is
             consistent with a moderate pace of convergence towards European income levels, assuming
             that the pace of European integration and investment rates seen prior to the crisis are regained
             towards the end of 2010.

    (ii)     Balance of payments pressures will lead the economy to adjust the composition of
             growth through 2009. Domestic demand is expected to contract sharply following years of
             fast growth while the contribution of net exports is going to become positive due to rapid
             import contraction. The growth composition is expected to stabilize thereafter with moderate
             (compared to output dynamics) domestic demand growth.



                                                     9

    (iii)      As a result, the current account deficit is expected to improve from over 6 percent of
               GDP in 2008 to around 3 percent of GDP in 2009-11. To achieve this adjustment, a 20
               percent real import contraction would be needed in 2009 in order to counter the 10 percent
               terms of trade deterioration. This is consistent with the significant tightening of fiscal and
               income policies envisaged by the authorities.

    (iv)       Real wages and employment would have to decline in 2009 to restore price
               competitiveness of Ukrainian exports in the wake of declining export prices and to support
               adjustment in aggregate demand. In the context of tight labor regulations it is likely that real
               wage adjustment will be relatively larger than changes in employment.

    (v)        With this current account adjustment the balance of payments would be financeable
               under our baseline assumptions. Our estimates show that a combination of smaller but still
               sizeable FDI inflows, a 75 percent of external debt roll-over, and the IMF SBA would cover
               the balance of payments needs Ukraine faces in 2009 (see Table 2.4). The medium-term
               projections assume a normalization of access to financing beginning in 2010 and current
               account deficits at about 2.5-3 percent of GDP.

    (vi)       The National Bank of Ukraine is expected to move gradually to a system of inflation
               targeting. As the NBU will limit reserve interventions, the exchange rate will discontinue as
               the nominal anchor. With the IMF SBA the level of gross international reserves is expected to
               stabilize at above 4 months of imports. Declining commodity prices, restricted monetary
               growth and cooling domestic demand will contribute to disinflation. However, offsetting this,
               exchange rate correction and adjustment of energy and utilities tariffs will make disinflation a
               more prolonged process.

    (vii)      The government will maintain a balanced budget in 2009 (not accounting for bank
               recapitalization costs) and a small deficit thereafter. Fiscal revenues are expected to drop
               by some 1.5 percentage points of GDP in 2009 due to lower Enterprise Profit Tax revenues as
               profit margins tighten, smaller Value Added Tax revenues as consumption declines, and
               lower Personal Income Tax and payroll taxes as real wages are likely to adjust by more than
               the GDP in real terms13. Consequently, growth in public consumption and transfers will
               decelerate to provide more room for capital spending. In the absence of substantial market
               access, external financing for the budget would need resources from the IFIs in the order of
               USD 1.5 billion per annum during 2009 and 2010, aside from the financing of bank-
               recapitalization.




13The impact on the international trade taxes collection is ambiguous: on one hand, as real imports decline collection go down,
on the other hand, as exchange rate depreciates the UAH equivalent of import value goes up.

30.      Even accounting for the potential fiscal costs of banks recapitalization, direct public debt
levels are likely to remain sustainable. Total costs of bank recapitalization (to bring banks to 10 percent
capital adequacy ratio) are in the order of 8 percent of GDP (in a base case scenario as estimated by the
IMF), which includes 5.5 percent of GDP of direct fiscal costs in principal and interests. Given the low
level of direct public debt (at 10 percent in 2008) and the projected fiscal cost of recapitalization, direct
public debt would increase to above 15 percent of GDP in a base case scenario, but would go over 20
percent of GDP under a stress scenario that doubles the fiscal costs of banks recapitalization (see Figure
2.4). These calculations embody an adjustment path for the exchange rate consistent with macroeconomic
balance. Should the exchange rate depreciates significantly (30 percent beyond the base case), the
required capital injections into the banking sector would be larger (closer to the stress scenario) but at the
same time existing public debt, which is predominantly denominated in foreign currency, would also
increase as a share of GDP. A combined stress test, doubling bank recapitalization costs and assuming the
exchange rate overshoots by 30 percent from the base case, would take public debt levels above 25
percent of GDP, still moderate by international comparison.

31.      The labor market will need to play an important role in economic adjustment, with both
employment and real wages having to adjust downward. The years of economic growth since 2000
were accompanied by the decline in unemployment and fast real wage growth. During the last 7 years real
wage growth outpaced real GDP growth by more than 100 percentage points (cumulative), exceeding the
underlying productivity growth. At the same time, unemployment almost halved to 6.2 percent as of mid-
2008. As the economy is heading into recession, the real wage is likely to drop by more than output.
Using the experience of the 1998-1999 crisis to calibrate the real wage response to the GDP decline, we
roughly estimate that the real wage might decline up to 12 percent in 2009. Some early anecdotal
evidence of the reaction to the economic downturn indicates that firms are approaching redundancies
carefully (although employment adjustment clearly will be part of the rebalancing process). In fact, in the
context of tight labor regulations as regards to firing personnel, firms in many cases are opting for across
the board freezing or reduction of salaries, and even shifting workers into extended leave without pay.


         3. PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES IN STRUCTURAL REFORM

32.      Since 2000, Ukraine's progress in structural reform has been modest. Ukraine ranks slightly
above the CIS countries' average in terms of progress in structural reform as measured by the EBRD
Transition Indicators (Figure 3.1). Its average overall rating was 2.7 in 2007, up from 2.4 in 2000 and 2.5
in 2005, and it has been converging towards the ECA average since 1999. The EBRD indicators reveal
particular weaknesses in the process of enterprise restructuring, governance, competition policy, non-bank
financial sector performance, and infrastructure reform. They also suggest that Ukraine is not closing the
gap with new EU member states fast enough, which may compromise the country's European integration
aspirations. Nonetheless, a critical threshold in reform has probably been passed, and despite occasional
setbacks, the general direction of market-based reforms has commanded broad consensus. A key impetus
for reforms has come from Ukraine's WTO accession process, which is likely to extend to negotiations
over a Free Trade Agreement with the EU. Additional drivers of structural adjustment have been the rise
in energy import prices and the significant increase in foreign capital inflows.

33.     On May 16, 2008, Ukraine became the 152nd member of the WTO. This crowns a 14 year
process of negotiations and legislative changes to comply with WTO demands supported by successive
governments across the party political spectrum. In the process of accession 75+ laws were amended and
150 bilateral protocol agreements signed by Ukraine with all WTO members. As a result, Ukraine has
locked-in important advances in structural reform and accepts key rules concerning future policy,
including:
    · Maintaining the import tariff reductions that it carried out during 2005-2007;
    · Reforming customs procedures in line with international standards (Ukraine also ratified the
        Kyoto convention on customs in 2006);
    · Reducing (or phase out) gradually export duties on scrap metal and selected agricultural products;
    · Shifting gradually the mode of agricultural support from input and production subsidies ("amber
        and yellow box") to measures supporting agricultural competitiveness, the environment and rural
        development ("green box");
    · Accepting limits on the kinds of investment support (TRIMS) that would be acceptable;
    · Accepting a much stronger regime for the protection of intellectual property rights (TRIPS);
    · Reforming its standardization, licensing and labeling regime to remove any discrimination against
        importers;
    · Adhering to the GATT's Article 24 in joining any regional free trade area.

34.     Energy sector reforms have concentrated on financial sustainability, but major regulatory
challenges remain. During the 1990s, the energy sector was a financial black-hole dominated by non-
transparent barter trades, huge cross- and quasi-fiscal subsidies and with falling efficiency levels. In
recent years, this has gradually been changing. Following the adoption of a law on energy debts, the stock
of debts in the sector resulting from non-payments decreased for the first time in 2006 and continued that
path in 2007. Much attention has been placed on the transparency of the gas import trade, but with rising
prices (and thus declining arbitrage opportunities) the rents that accrue to middle companies has much
diminished and barter trade disappeared. Moreover, the full pass-through of higher gas import prices to
industrial consumers has allowed the quasi-fiscal deficit to be reduced as a percent of GDP despite the
more than 200 percent increase in gas import prices. Households continue to benefit from large cross-
subsidies and household tariffs have not been adjusted since late 2006. In July a tariff adjustment of 15
percent for domestic household tariffs for gas was approved by NERC. Moreover, NERC has approved
another 35 percent increase in tariffs to take place starting December 1, 2008, which also responds to
commitments of the government in the IMF SBA. These increases, while insufficient to eliminate cross-
subsidies completely, mark a step in the right direction. Additionally, the power market has been
unbundled, although privatization of regional electricity distribution companies has been stalled for a
number of years. The gas sector remains vertically integrated and state-owned, and state-ownership also
dominates in the coal mining sector. The Cabinet of Ministers has adopted an energy sector strategy and
action plan for full harmonization of the sector with the European energy market, under which the main
regulatory and structural challenges in the sector are envisaged to be addressed.

35.     The banking sector has undergone a fundamental transformation since 2004, with the entry
of strategic investors and improved access to international capital markets, but the rapid growth
experience was not accompanied by corresponding strengthening of regulation and supervision. As
mentioned, there has been a build up in foreign capital in the banking sector and a rapid expansion of
credit in this period. Indeed, the rapid credit expansion in the banking sector and the need to adequately
handle the accelerating development of the non-bank financial sector underscore the urgency of
strengthening financial sector regulation and supervision, particularly in the areas of enforcement of
ultimate ownership disclosure, consolidated and risk-based supervision, and banking sector corporate
governance. In the non-bank financial sector, development is hampered by weak supervision, lack of
transparency in the ultimate ownership of intermediaries and issuers, non-transparent pricing, and the lack
of independence of regulatory agencies.

36.      Ukraine must further improve its business climate, competition policy, and the physical and
institutional infrastructure supporting private investment to help the recovery of its real sector,
which is being hit hard by multiple external and domestic shocks. A number of measures will be
critical to reap the gains from accession to the WTO, regain productivity improvements, and reallocate
efficiently assets across sectors.
     · On trade: Particular challenges include efforts to improve trade facilitation, transport and
         logistics infrastructure, a framework of PPP to attract investments (while closely guarding fiscal
         risks), customs harmonization (revised in line with Kyoto protocol), and technical procedures (in
         line with WTO and EU practices). The prospects of an Free Trade Agreement with the EU would
         also bring a number of issues on regulation, standards, agriculture, financial services and other
         onto the reform agenda.

     · On business environment and competition: The government will also need to ensure better
         implementation of measures to reduce business hurdles through the reform of permits and
         inspections and thus promote competition and job creation in the private sector. Evidence
         suggests that lack of competition hinders entry, innovation, and efficient reallocation within the
         economy with a number of policy measures needed to be taken to tackle this problem, for
         example in relation to the competition policy framework.14 Moreover, some studies suggest that
         an accelerating pace of labor reallocation across firms has contributed significantly to rising
         productivity growth in Ukraine since the late 1990s.15 This suggests that a restructuring process
         may be under way similar to that of some new EU member states in the early and mid-1990s.
         Other indicators, however, point to the lack of competition and difficult business climate as key
         constraints on firm innovation and technology adoption.16 This may in turn limit the extent of
         productivity growth within firms and accentuate the challenge of corporate restructuring now that
         Ukraine faces a much less favorable external environment.17

     · On the financial sector: As the financial sector grew rapidly exposing itself to the current shocks,
         the need to strengthen regulation and supervision has increased. The needed bank rehabilitation
         and consolidation process presents an opportunity for Ukraine to re-emerge from the crisis with a
         more transparent, prudent, and reinvigorated banking system.

     · On the energy sector: The continuation of structural reforms in the energy sector is essential to
         increase energy efficiency and safeguard competitiveness in the face of rising costs, including
         through larger private participation in the sector, more independent regulators, and adequate
         pricing. In all these areas, approximation to EU standards will be a key impetus and anchor for
         the reform process going forward, although the costs and benefits of full harmonization with the
         Acquis will need to be determined case by case.

37.      Ukraine's fiscal and budgetary policy needs to be reoriented towards laying the foundation
for sustained growth. Against the background of rising inflation and substantial future public investment
needs, fiscal policy needs to safeguard financial discipline in the context of a medium term budget
framework.

    · On the spending side, the government should aim at rationalizing and generating efficiency gains
        in consumption and current transfer spending to create fiscal space for needed investments and to
        face the challenges stemming from potential external shocks. This includes placing an emphasis
        on funding well-targeted social programs that would protect the vulnerable during the expected
        economic downturn.

    · On the revenue side, following a period of stabilization, the government should aim for declining
        marginal tax rates with an expansion of the tax base, and a gradual reduction of the tax burden
        over the medium-term while keeping deficits under control. These allocative decisions need to be
        supported by institutional reforms, including a fair, efficient and accountable tax administration,
        the reform of public financial management (in particular a strengthened capital budgeting
        process), a modern public procurement framework, adequate management of state owned
        enterprises and their quasi-fiscal activities18, and improved inter-governmental fiscal relations as
        a key building block towards improved delivery of public services at the local level.19

38.     Ukraine needs to make further efforts to improve the efficiency and quality of public sector
service delivery to raise economic opportunities and living standards equitably. With budget
spending over 40 percent of GDP, improving service delivery is not primarily a question of spending
more but rather spending more efficiently.20 Ukraine's social spending (on health, education, pensions
and social assistance) already consumes the bulk of its budget resources. However, to deliver better
quality services, spending will need to be reoriented from the current focus on input-norms on
maintaining staffing levels and basic structures, towards more performance-based spending, including
sufficient allocations for rehabilitation, maintenance and capital investment.

    · The education system, at all levels, needs to be strengthened to improve quality and to reduce the
        skill mismatch that currently seems to exist between supply and demand in the labor market.21

    · The public health system also needs financing and administrative reforms to reduce existing
        inefficiencies generated by its Soviet era input based system of budget formation that limits its
        ability to spend allocated resources in needed investments and renders it inflexible to meet
        increasing needs for improved quality.

    · Social transfers and social assistance need to be better targeted and the current system of social
        privileges needs to be reformed. The pension system needs to be reformed to become fairer
        (linking contributions more closely with benefits), more efficient (improving compliance rates
        and allowing contribution rates to fall), and fiscally sustainable over the medium term (given
        Ukraine's rapidly declining population). Moreover, its administration (in parallel with the
        administration of the other three social insurance funds) requires consolidation to reduce
        administrative and compliance costs.

                  DOWNTURN, AND THE BANK'S OVERALL SUPPORT

A. THE ROLE OF THE DPL PROGRAM AS AN ANCHOR OF REFORM

39.      Ukraine's reform agenda has developed within the context of significant political volatility
but there is an underlying consensus on the main directions of socio-economic development. Ukraine
has seen four medium-term reform programs since 2000, each with its own implementation plan. These
programs and plans have changed with each successive administration, adjusting to different levels of
urgency and priorities as seen by the government in office. Nevertheless, and despite differences in
sectoral emphasis, pace, and articulation, the long-term development objectives and selected reform areas
have remained as a common denominator across party lines. Table 4.1 provides a broad brush summary
of these common development goals and reform areas that have survived over successive governments.

40.      The government under Prime Minister Timoshenko moved rapidly to present its
"Ukrainian Breakthrough" program to the public, but its endorsement by Parliament was held up
in the ongoing power struggle. As Table 4.1 confirms, many of the themes of this new program are
consistent with the strategic directions of previous governments. Further integration with the world
economy and the EU in particular, improvements in competitiveness and in the business climate, and a
concern for shared growth and social inclusion are common denominators.

41.      The DPL program was designed around these "common denominator" development/reform
goals that have been, and are, part of the core reform agenda as seen across the main political
forces and provides an anchor for its implementation. The Bank explicitly takes into account the fact
that Ukraine's political environment may continue to be characterized by volatility. The challenge facing
Ukraine is primarily one of implementation rather than articulation of strategic priorities. Implementation
obstacles relate to the many particular interests that would be affected by reforms, and thus, Ukraine is in
need of greater policy consistency and discipline in implementation. One of the purposes of the DPL
program has been to provide an anchor for policymakers and ensure some continuity over changes in
governments. Moreover, this view is recognized by policymakers across party lines.

42.      The consensus around key objectives is a central rationale for proceeding with this DPL at a
time of significant political and economic uncertainty. The Bank's team has been continuously
consulting with the current Government and key members of the political opposition as well as the
President's office about the directions of the DPL program. These consultations have confirmed that a
significant degree of consensus exists around Ukraine's key economic reform priorities.

B. THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND THE
BANK'S OVERALL PACKAGE OF SUPPORT

43.      Despite urgent anti-crisis measures taken by the authorities (described in Section 2.C), a
substantial reform agenda remains, both to mitigate the effects of the crisis and to ensure a
sustained economic recovery. These measures include the detailed design and implementation of a
banking sector rehabilitation framework, as well as fiscal reallocation in the context of the 2009 and
subsequent state budgets to ensure the most vulnerable receive adequate protection whilst rationalizing
public spending in the social sphere consistent with the tighter fiscal envelope. Moreover, to lay the
foundation for a sustained recovery, the Government needs to ensure that public investments are
maintained at adequate levels and that structural reforms are accelerated to improve Ukraine's
competitiveness and attractiveness for private investment.


                                                        17

44.     The adjustment and reform agenda ahead will require additional support from the Bank
and other development partners. The DPL program was designed to support a medium-term structural
reform agenda and Ukraine has made slower than anticipated but nonetheless steady progress against the
agreed benchmarks. The changing economic environment requires additional measures, not all of which
can be covered by the current operation. The Bank has thus discussed with the authorities a package of
assistance over the coming two years in the context of the Country Partnership Strategy reviewed by the
Board of Directors in December 2007 and the Bank's overall response to the global financial crisis.

45.     The package of assistance is based around three pillars addressing respectively three main
challenges for an effective response to the current situation. First, there is a need to ensure that the
2009 budget not only presents an overall prudent fiscal stance, but uses the opportunity to improve the
targeting of social transfers to the poor and vulnerable in the context of greater fiscal restraint.
Consultations with the authorities on this issue have been under way for some time and Bank staff have
identified selected well-targeted programs that could be topped up. The authorities have expressed their
commitment to pursue this dialogue with the Bank in the Letter of Development Policy. Nonetheless,
because of the need to mobilize the Bank's financial assistance quickly, and given some uncertainty over
the timing of the 2009 budget discussions in the parliament, the recommended fiscal reallocation is
expected to be addressed in a future DPL. This operation does support measures to bring financial
sustainability to the pension system, however.

46.     Second, a Banking Sector Rehabilitation loan is under preparation to help defray the fiscal
costs of bank recapitalization and resolution and provide assistance in the design of a sound
framework to forward with this process. The basic framework has been laid in the "Anti-Crisis Law"
and subsequent Cabinet of Ministers and NBU resolutions. It provides for state funds for bank
recapitalization after a detailed diagnostic phase and foresees tight government control over banks
benefiting from the scheme. It also provides the NBU with enhanced powers to intervene in troubled
banks. However, the bank resolution framework still requires further work to ensure banks can be rapidly
resolved and to clarify how the assets of such institutions would be managed and depositors compensated.
There are associated technical assistance needs for the NBU during both the diagnostic and intervention
phases, as well as for the Ministry of Finance, to ensure the prudent use of public resources on which the
World Bank Group is coordinating with the IMF, the EBRD, as well as the US Treasury, USAID and
other bilateral donors. The Bank's financial assistance in this area was not foreseen in the Country
Partnership Strategy and is in direct response to the crisis.

47.     Third, the Bank will support economic recovery through the lending for infrastructure
investments programmed in the Country Partnership Strategy. Two large loans to finance
modernization of road and railways networks are under preparation, and several projects in the energy and
municipal infrastructure sectors are presently under implementation. The Bank's assistance will help
safeguard critical infrastructure investments at a time of reduced financing from commercial sources,
while work will continue across the World Bank Group to lay the foundation for increased public private
partnerships in the future (this Operation supports initial legislative steps in this direction).

48.     Over the medium term, even with completion of the current DPL series, a substantial
reform agenda remains. The structural reform challenges have been enumerated in the previous section.
The Country Partnership Strategy foresees continued engagement on structural reforms through additional
Development Policy Lending.

 5. PROPOSED DPL-III IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROGRAMMATIC DPL
                                                 SERIES

A. DPL DESIGN - STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND PROPOSED SEQUENCING

49.      This operation is an integral part of the FY08-FY11 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
and is strongly anchored in its principles. The CPS stresses in particular the need for selectivity and
flexibility in addressing Ukraine's evolving needs as a middle income country. The DPL is selective in its
policy benchmarks and foresaw only a limited number of prior actions for DPL III (triggers). At the same
time the DPL aims to be flexible in line with the Bank's best practice lessons in conditionality and, thus,
it leaves open the possibility of upgrading other benchmarks to triggers, while de-emphasizing selected
policy triggers to correspond to possible re-sequencing of reforms, as long as the overall pace of progress
is judged sufficient. Moreover, the benchmarks and prior actions (triggers) of this operation match
milestones in the CPS.

50.      This operation continues with the cross-sectoral approach recognizing that reform priorities
in Ukraine may (and do) shift from one sector to another depending upon the economic and
political realities. Indeed, while consensus reform areas exist across party lines, the pace of reform varies
across sectors and reform appetite within a specific sector may change depending upon the political
environment for certain issues. The cross-sectoral approach of the DPL allows the risks of such changes
in policy emphasis in a volatile political environment to be hedged to some extent within the context of a
consistent programmatic construction. Moreover, the strong inter-linkages between reform areas are
better addressed by a multi-sectoral DPL, which is the basic rationale for choosing this approach instead
of a series of single sector DPLs. The cross-sectoral linkages on the consensus reform areas are evident
(as discussed in the CPS). The underlying rationale is that there cannot be a sustained improvement in
private sector competitiveness and infrastructure investments without tackling issues of public finance,
governance, social protection, and public service delivery. Moreover, a cross-sectoral approach is critical
in the current adjustment context to ensure adjustment costs do not fall disproportionately on the most
vulnerable and that Ukraine is rapidly restored to sustainable growth.

51.      The FY08-11 CPS has adopted a two pillar support strategy, which provides a useful
framework for the evolution of the DPL series going forward. This simpler framework is based on
improving competitiveness by strengthening the business climate and investing in infrastructure on the
one hand, and improving the delivery of public services through the reform of public finance and public
administration on the other. This design aims to take into account to the greatest possible extent the
synergies between different reform areas, whilst forcing the Bank to be more selective in its support. The
DPL program is currently based on a three pillar strategy, but the second and third pillars are strongly
linked, since the Bank's support is targeted towards reforms that would increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of public services as the main entry point towards greater service quality.

52.      The DPL program contains significant linkages to the Bank's investment lending portfolio,
although the latter has been implemented with mixed success. For example, the DPL program
supports policy reform in the energy sector, which in turn has been key to unlock the Bank's investment
lending support, which now amounts to two large operations (Hydropower Rehabilitation, USD 106
million and Power Transmission Project, USD 200 million), with further loans in preparation. The DPL
program has continuously supported measures to improve fiscal management and modernize tax policy
and administration, efforts that are complemented by a State Tax Service Modernization project,
approved in 2001. The Public Finance Management Reform project, recently launched, is supported by
benchmarks related to establishing a medium-term budget framework, while drawing on the progress in
consolidation of the public finance management system supported by DPL-I and DPL-II.



                                                    19

53.       The DPL-III has narrowed conditionality and selectivity. The DPL-I already narrowed
conditionality compared to the PAL program in line with good practice and the DPL-II and DPL-III have
moved further in this direction (see Box 5.1). The DPL-III would support five prior actions (triggers) with
a reduced matrix of benchmarks.


Box 5.1: Narrowing Conditionality and Improving Flexibility
Consistent with the principles of good practice on conditionality, the present DPL-III operation narrows
conditionality further. This operation specifies 5 triggers with the purpose to achieve breakthroughs in a few critical
areas as a result of the program. The design assumes broad continuity in the government's strategic vision and a
gradual deepening of the dialogue around critical reform bottlenecks. Significant efforts have been made to ensure
that the reform triggers and other benchmarks are owned by the authorities. Three of the five prior actions (triggers)
for DPL-III (discussed in detail in the following sections) concern regulatory and/or legislative initiatives, over
which Bank staff have commented and extensively discussed with the authorities. The authorities look for the
Bank's support as a key element to push through the needed legislation, which faces some resistance from vested
interests in the parliament. Of the remaining two triggers, one (the fiscal deficit ceiling) concerns an area where
successive governments have demonstrated strong commitment. The trigger on the quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy
sector is politically the most difficult, given popular resistance against further utility price increases.

54.       Table 5.1 highlights the programmatic sequence of themes and their envisaged progressive
implementation in the design of the DPL program. This table shows both the breadth of the reform
agenda and the way specific themes are programmatically linked throughout time but also across the
thematic areas. Some cells in the last column (for this operation ­ DPL-III) contain only implementation
and enforcement, because these are relatively mature reform agendas, while new agendas identified at the
time of DPL-II are starting in DPL-III based on new analytical work and dialogue with the government.

B. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS AND DONOR COORDINATION

55.      This operation draws heavily on the Bank's AAA program. The flagship AAA product in
this respect was the programmatic Public Finance Review (PFR), with the first installment (PFR I)
completed in September 2006 and the second (PFR II) completed in late 2007. The PFR highlights the
critical issue of creating fiscal space for growth through making the public sector more efficient and
thereby allowing a reduction in the state's tax take. This central idea is reflected throughout the operation,
including in the suggested reform steps for improving tax and expenditure policy in a number of areas,
bringing fiscal sustainability to the pension system, and strengthening the capital budget system.
Analytical support in the areas of intergovernmental fiscal relations and efficiency and performance in
health and education services has been discussed with the government through the PFR II, helping to
shape the dialogue in these areas for DPL-III.

56.      In 2007, the Bank completed a Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA) and a
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) which provided the basis for discussion on
further improvements in public financial management. The key findings of the PEFA assessment are
that Ukraine scores relatively well against regional and international comparators on budget credibility,
treasury system, comprehensiveness, and transparency, but retains weaknesses in areas such as public
procurement, internal audit controls, and management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The CPAR
analyzed in depth the reversal in public procurement reform during 2005 and 2006, which has led to the
fragmentation of the public procurement system and the loss of public oversight with key functions
transferred to a non-government entity. DPL-III picks up on this analysis through its support for a new
framework for public procurement, measures to improve SOE management and financial reporting and
efforts to further consolidate the public financial management system by integrating it into a medium-
term budget framework (including capital budgeting--which was also analyzed in depth by the PFR).

57.       The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, the Corporate Governance
ROSC, and a Financial and Auditing ROSC also feed into the policy and reform dialogue. The
FSAP update highlighted the risks and the regulation and supervision shortcomings of the banking and
non-banking sectors. Its recommendations are reflected in several benchmarks in this operation. For
example, the ROSC exercises have motivated recommendations to strengthen the legal and regulatory
framework supporting the development of the capital markets and corporate governance. Additionally, the
IFC's Public Enterprise Partnership program has continued to advise on measures to improve the business
climate for SMEs and the measures proposed in this operation draw directly on this work in focusing on
inspections and standards reform.

58.      In addition, the Bank has provided advice in a number of critical areas, including tax
policy, grain export quotas, and energy price effects. It has provided continued swift and
comprehensive tax policy advice through suggestions for revisions of new draft tax legislation. It has
provided advice against grain export quotas and will continue the dialogue with the authorities on this
issue under the framework of a broader dialogue on anti-inflationary measures in coordination with the
IMF. It was one of the first institutions to come forth with estimates of the impact of higher gas prices on
Ukraine's economy and has updated this analysis with a policy note supporting the authorities' efforts to
raise domestic energy tariffs. The Bank has also published an updated poverty assessment that examines
in particular the impact of higher energy prices on the poor and shows that targeted support would be
effective and affordable in sheltering the poor from the energy price shock.

                              6. THE PROPOSED DPL-III OPERATION

59.       While DPL-III is the third in a series of programmatic policy loans and was anticipated in
the Bank's operations pipeline, it comes at a time of increasing need for external financing. In
response to the authorities' request and in view of the need to signal broad support to the measures taken
to facilitate an orderly adjustment, the preparation schedule for DPL-III was accelerated, taking advantage
of the reform progress already achieved and the flexibility of the design to give credit to selected
measures in response to the crisis. The DPL thus provides an opportunity for the Bank to support critical
structural reforms that will, on the back of the IMF's SBA, signal Ukraine's commitment to sound policy
making to financial markets at a time when such signals are particularly important, whilst laying the
foundations for a return to economic growth through the policy changes it leverages.

60.       The proposed DPL-III continues the multisectoral approach under the following thematic
umbrellas: (i) improving the investment climate for growth, (ii) creating fiscal space for growth through
strengthened public finance and public sector reform, (iii) improving service delivery and social
inclusion. Table 6.1 lays out key prior actions/triggers under this programmatic operation

61.      The triggers supported by this operation are designed to reflect its programmatic continuity
and to provide a solid structural response to economic challenges faced by Ukraine. As detailed
below, the measures in support of the first pillar are milestones of improving corporate governance and
transparency in the corporate and financial sectors and are thus critical complements to the financial
policies already adopted by the authorities and future bank rehabilitation programs. The fiscal measures
supported by the DPL-III are consistent with those supported by the IMF SBA, but at the same time
reflect the Bank's continued programmatic engagement on the reform of the energy sector, which is
complemented by technical assistance and investment lending support. The improvements in the
framework for public procurement are a critical basis for a more effective and efficient state capital
budget and address a key point in Ukraine's WTO and EU commitments. While the DPL-III does not
contain a trigger in support of the third pillar, it has provided a platform to maintain the dialogue with the
authorities on fiscal reallocation measures to protect the vulnerable and bring financial sustainability to
the pension system. Selected benchmarks are supported by this operation and broad strategic directions
are given in the Letter of Development Policy, while specific fiscal targets will be agreed with the
authorities in the context of future budget support.

62.      The remainder of this section explains the DPL-III program under these three thematic
umbrellas. Each sub-section highlights the policy accomplishments this operation supports. Moreover,
this section briefly explains the relevance of the program in the economic and reform context of Ukraine.
Annex I contains the detailed policy and institutional reform matrix with all the actions in the three DPL
operations, including medium-term outcomes. The results/medium-term outcomes were recalibrated at the
time of preparing DPL-II, since several of the results/medium-term outcomes expected at the beginning of
the series had been accomplished by early 2007 (see DPL-I ICR and DPL-II Program Document).

A. IMPROVING THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE FOR GROWTH

63.      As discussed, there is a large spectrum of reforms needed to improve the investment climate
in Ukraine, and to encourage foreign direct investment, in the present environment of significant
credit shortages and risk aversion. The DPL-III encapsulates selected critical reforms in the areas of
corporate governance, banking sector regulation, energy sector reform, and business regulation. Corporate
governance has been at the top of the agenda to bring transparency and encourage FDI over the last 10
years; this operation supports the joint stock company Law, a breakthrough legislation in this area (see
discussion below). Despite the progress achieved over the last years, the framework under which
businesses operate in the country continues to be characterized by burdensome regulation and repeated
discretionary interventions by public officials. DPL-II supported critical reforms in this area through the
legislation on permits and inspections and this operation supports benchmarks related to the
implementation of these framework laws. The rapid credit expansion in the banking sector underscores
the urgency of strengthening financial regulation and supervision while at the same time improving
corporate governance, a key legislative piece supported by this operation. The energy sector has seen
major advances in structural reforms but further progress is needed, particularly in bringing financial


                                                              24

solvency to energy companies and in adjusting tariffs for households and public utilities after the energy
price increases; this operation follows through with critical measures in these area as well.

64.        The DPL-III has three triggers under this sub-theme:

     · Enacted Joint Stock Companies Law, bringing Ukraine significantly closer to OECD
           principles of corporate governance. This Law, which was finally enacted in late October,
           represents the major reform in corporate governance in Ukraine over the last 10 years. It brings
           domestic corporate law significantly closer to OECD standards in terms of transparency,
           corporate responsibilities, safeguards against hostile takeovers and protection of minority
           shareholders. The potential benefits are wide, for example, in relation to external financing,
           transparency in corporate governance, and financial development. The improved framework is
           likely to encourage FDI and joint partnerships between foreign and Ukrainian firms which are
           needed for knowledge and technology transfers. It also facilitates the deepening and transparency
           of the securities market.

     · Legal and regulatory steps initiated to address banks' recapitalization and resolution,
           through the enactment of the Law on "Priority Measures to Prevent the Negative Impact of
           the Financial Crisis and amendments to legislative acts of Ukraine" and subsequent Cabinet
           of Ministers Resolution (s) geared towards implementation23: The "Anti-Crisis Law" enacted
           on October 31, 2008 (and the subsequent CoM resolution on bank recapitalizations) 24 lays out the
           basis to proceed with the processes of banking sector restructuring and consolidation. These
           pieces of legislation while critical as building blocks for such processes would need to be
           complemented with important additional regulation and executive actions to provide a
           strengthened framework to deal with the rehabilitation of the banking sector. Additional
           procedures are needed on both aspects: recapitalization and resolution, particularly guiding the
           overall functioning of these processes and their inter-linkages (including how these processes
           connect to the liquidity injections in the system moving forward).                                 A financial sector
           rehabilitation operation is being prepared to address these policy issues and support with
           resources and advice to the process of recapitalization and resolution that should lead the needed
           orderly consolidation in the sector.

     · Decrease in energy sector quasi-fiscal deficit (QFD) as percent of GDP over the last 12
           months (November 2007-October 2008) relative to 2006, including through: including
           through a combination of the following: (i) average cash collections is above 95 percent and 90
           percent in the electricity and gas sectors, respectively, and (ii) gas and electricity tariffs continue
           to move towards economic cost recovery levels.25 This trigger does not require each of the sub-
           measures to be met, bearing in mind the political sensitivity of each of them, and the observed
           link between higher tariffs and reduced collections in the short run. However, it does require the
           combination of measures to safeguard the overall achievements made in this area in 2006 against
           the background of increased gas import prices. The reduction has evidenced so far. Moreover, the
           energy regulator NERC has recently announced a 35 percent increase in gas tariffs starting in



23This critical measure on the banking sector replaces the triggers tentatively agreed a year ago on the Law related to the energy
sector regulator (NERC) and the Law on the unification of Function of the social insurance funds. In the current situation, and
given the need of adjusting tariffs across the board, the government rightly expressed concerns in the context of moving to
greater independence as regards to the potential for business or political capture of NERC. At the same time, the government also
feels that they can not allocate resources and efforts to the administrative unification of social insurance funds, particularly
without some key initial reforms within each fund.

        2009. See Annex 2 for the detailed analysis and methodology used.

65.     Additionally, this operation supports the following benchmarks under this sub-theme:

    · Approved action plan and initial steps taken to eliminate mandatory certification of food products
        in line with WTO. Recognizing that this is just a first step, the government committed to redouble
        efforts to come in full compliance with WTO on certification issues over the next months.

    · Privatization plan for power distribution companies (Oblenergos) is approved by CoM clarifying
        the list of companies to be sold to strategic investors.

    · Implementation of the law on public control of entrepreneurial activity is continued, including
        through the following: (i) executive actions on the implementation of the Law on public control
        of entrepreneurial activity resulted in improved transparency in the procedures as evidenced by a
        monitoring survey; (ii) more than 20 controlling agencies established risk criteria to select entities
        for planned inspections; (iii) risk-based system for tax audits is adopted through an order of the
        State Tax Administration.

    · A draft law is submitted to the Verhovna Rada prohibiting any entity (legal or physical) from
        acquiring (directly or indirectly) more than 5 percent of shares in any clearing and settlement
        company.

B. CREATING FISCAL SPACE FOR GROWTH THROUGH STRENGTHENED
PUBLIC FINANCES AND PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM

66.     Sustained economic growth in Ukraine will have to be based on higher private and public
investment. To make this possible, the Government needs to create fiscal space to finance greater public
outlays on infrastructure modernization and improvements in public services by generating sensible
savings across current spending and transfers programs. Over time, it would also need to decrease the tax
burden, particularly on direct taxes on labor and capital (while increasing the share of consumption taxes
in the tax structure), while also increasing the tax base, to allow a fiscally manageable transition.
Moreover, the government needs to face these challenges while maintaining fiscal discipline (DPL
continues to support a fiscal deficit target measure as part of its program). This would involve continued
reforms in the areas of: (i) tax policy and tax administration; (ii) budgeting (including capital budgeting)
with the aim at setting a workable medium-term budget framework; and (iii) public administration, with a
particular emphasis in setting an efficient and transparent procurement system. In addition, other second
stage reforms in intergovernmental fiscal and administrative relations and governance of SOE would need
to commence.

67.     The DPL-III has two triggers under this sub-theme:

    · The deficit of the consolidated budget (prior to bank recapitalization expenditures) is kept
        below 3 percent of GDP in 2007 and below 1 percent of GDP in the first 10 months of 2008
        (and is on track to stay within the benchmark agreed under the IMF macro framework by
        the end of 2008) . The programmatic DPL has had as a trigger a target fiscal deficit for each
        operation. The agreed target, at the beginning of the programmatic operation (a deficit of 3
        percent of GDP) has been revised in the context of the need for additional fiscal restraint and in
        line with the IMF SBA.




                                                      26

    · The public procurement framework is revised in line with good international practice. In
          recent years roughly 6 to 7 percent of GDP is spent through the public procurement system.
          Passing an appropriate framework for procurement would provide an effective signal to domestic
          and foreign economic agents of Ukraine's commitment to fiscal efficiency, transparency, and
          improved governance. An acceptable procurement framework is also necessary to fulfill
          Ukraine's WTO commitment to join the General Procurement Agreement. To fulfill this trigger
          the government would pass a Cabinet of Minister Resolution with the procedures and provisions
          acceptable to the Bank. These provisions would lay out an adequate framework for procurement
          and would be in place until an approved Law with exactly the same content is enacted.

68.       Additionally, this operation supports the following benchmarks under this sub-theme:

    · Excise taxes harmonized with EU standards and WTO. This measure moves excise taxation to
          international best practices. Moreover, in early 2008, the low excise rates for alcohol and tobacco
          were increased in line with Bank's advice.

    · The ratio of VAT refund claims > 60 days to quarterly flow of VAT refund claims is reduced to
          30 percent. This ratio improved from 50 percent in July 2006 (when this benchmark was agreed)
          to 17 percent in October 2008. The re-engagement of the authorities on this issue and the
          achievement of the benchmark send an important positive signal in this area that is critical for
          economic efficiency and the overall business environment.

    · Medium-term strategic plans and programs including budget ceilings (for current and capital
          spending) by line ministry are introduced. This is the first step in the path towards establishing a
          Medium-Term Budget Framework.

    · The number of state targeted programs is reduced by 15 percent in 2008 compared to 2006. The
          "targeted programs" are large in number, they tend to fragment capital budgeting, and reduce
          flexibility in project selection, and are subject to political patronage. Many of them no longer
          serve the purpose for which they were created more than a decade ago.26 A comprehensive re-
          evaluation of the economic feasibility and achievements of the existing targeted programs started
          in 2007 as many of these programs have no current economic rationale and have been structurally
          out of place in the reformed budget environment.

    · A Cabinet of Ministers Resolution is approved introducing a more competitive and transparent
          management selection process for State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). This action continues the
          implementation of the framework Law supported under DPL-II.

C. IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION

69.       Ukraine faces the challenges of a worsening demographic profile, deteriorating health and
education services, a costly public pension system and a poorly targeted and inadequate system of
social assistance. The inherited oversized network of facilities and staffing levels in health and education
remain highly inefficient and continue to be driven by input-based norms, which determine budget
formation. Despite significant total budget allocations, which compare favorably with other countries in
the region, the inflexibility of the financing system crowds out needed quality-enhancing expenditures
and investments. Social assistance faces new challenges, such as rising utility prices and the economic

26State targeted program objectives range widely, from social programs to law enforcement. But the actual funding is captured
by "economic" programs (mainly subsidies for the coal and agriculture sectors), while other programs are kept alive but are
under-funded or without funding. They are subject to "pork barrel" spending type of activities.


                                                              27

downturn, which will require efforts to further improve targeting and make the needed reallocation across
programs.

70.     While progress has not been achieved in terms of efficiency improvements in the education
sector, the government has made progress in encouraging learning outcomes and measuring
quality. This agenda is central to measuring the performance of the system moving forward and could
help leveraging needed reforms. The DPL program supports the following benchmark:

   · National External Assessments of student learning outcomes are institutionalized and the
      corresponding assessment certificates become the key basis for entrance to higher education
      institutions in Ukraine in 2008.

71.     The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system faces short term and long-term sustainability
challenges. Public pensions have increased from 12 percent of GDP in 2004 to an estimated 15.5 percent
in 2008. Without stabilizing measures pension expenditures would grow to close to 17 percent of GDP in
2009. The long term challenges are also significant since the demographic shifts Ukraine is experiencing
would lead to a ratio of 1/1.43 of workers/pensions by 2055. While pensions are the primary income
source for the older population, the rising pension expenditures have created additional fiscal pressures
and crowd out needed budget resources for pro-growth expenditures as well as for scaling up well-
targeted programs of social assistance.

72.     Given that it is unlikely that the government would have an approved budget for 2009 before this
operation goes to the board, this DPL does recognize simply the consideration of parametric measures in
the context of the fiscal policies that will be embedded in the 2009 budget. The government is considering
and intends to implement parametric measures designed to create fiscal savings to help the long term
sustainability of the PAYG pension system while releasing some pressure from the budget. These
measures include: (i) capping pension payments for working pensioners whose pension is above
subsistence minimum in 2009 (to 50 percent of pension benefit but no lower than subsistence minimum);
or capping pension payments for working pensioners whose total monthly income is above four
subsistence minimums (around UAH 2,400) in 2009 (including pension payments); maintaining the
current pension inflation indexation pattern and abolishing wage indexation in 2009; (iii) no recalculation
of the current pension benefits using the pensionable wage level of 2007; (iv) capping maximum pension
in absolute terms (UAH 6,065) instead of a multiple of 12 subsistence minimums; (v) postponing paying
special pensions until the statutory retirement age; and (vi) raising the pension contribution rate in the
simplified tax regime to the level of 50 percent of statutory minimum pension contribution (including
pension earmarked portion in simplified tax).

73.     Given the rapid change in economic and political environment, the government feels that it can
not allocate resources, efforts, and political capital to the administrative unification of social insurance
funds (a trigger agreed back in 2007) at this point, particularly without broad consensus across party lines
as regards to the shape of the pension reform moving forward. Nevertheless, reducing the high
compliance costs of paying taxes and social contributions is a central reform issues that needs to be
addressed in Ukraine.

                                  7. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. DONOR COORDINATION

74.      The DPL program has been designed in close collaboration and coordination with donors.
Throughout the process of preparation of the operation, from the analytical works that underpin the policy
measures through implementation in some areas, the Bank's team collaborated with a number of other
donors, including the European Commission (EC), USAID, and DFID.27 A Dutch Trust Fund is
financing activities on public financial management issues that are related to this operation. Moreover, in
the context of responding to Ukraine's increased need for financial and technical assistance to cope with
the impact of the financial crisis, the World Bank Group is working closely with the IMF, the EBRD, the
EIB and bilateral donors to design an effective assistance package with a particular focus on the financial
sector, the implementation of which is expected to be supported by follow-on operations.

75.      The Bank maintains a close coordination and dialogue with the International Monetary
Fund on issues related to the macroeconomic framework.

B. RISKS AND MITIGATION

Economic Risks28

76.      Moving forward, the most important economic risks lie: (i) in the size of further external
shocks (term of trade and credit markets squeeze), (ii) in larger than expected recapitalization
needs for banks arising from a lack of refinancing, (iii) a potential overshooting of the exchange
rate, and (iv) incomplete implementation of the IMF-supported government program. Given
economic uncertainties, both the assessment of the size of external shocks and impacts, and the proper
calibration of policy response is a challenge. Excessive or inadequate responses may undermine the
economic outcomes sought. For example, on the one hand there is a risk of tightening monetary and
income polices excessively to a point where the real economy would be squeezed in an environment of
further worsening of terms of trade, whilst balance sheets in the corporate and banking sectors are hit by
the needed exchange rate realignment. This would generate larger costs of recapitalization and a credit
freeze, creating a vicious cycle that would lead to a longer than anticipated recessionary period. On the
other hand, loose policies and the half way measures in establishing a flexible exchange rate would be
insufficient to counter the shock, leading to an unsustainable balance of payments situation and the need
for an even sharper adjustment.

77.      The main risk mitigation for economic risks would come from appropriate macroeconomic
and structural policies. While initial steps have been positive, consistent signals will need to be sent to
markets, which will be challenging in the context of persistent political instability. The fact that the stakes
are high may reduce the risks of inappropriate policies, as key stakeholders among Ukrainian businesses
have much to lose from disorderly adjustment. Nonetheless, implementation risks remain high even after
mitigation and policy uncertainty is significant.

78.      In addition, the policy framework agreed with the support of the IFIs may serve as an
anchor to maintain an appropriate macro-economic framework during the time of adjustment (see
Section 3). The IMF SBA is based on implementing exchange rate flexibility (with base money targets
and reserve floors), tightening income and fiscal policies, improving the financial position of energy

companies and reducing quasi-fiscal activities in the energy sector, and establishing the basis for financial
sector stability. This IMF-supported government program would indeed help to rebalance the economy if
implemented thoroughly by the authorities.

79.      The Bank is also working to build upon the initial measures taken by the government under
the "Anti-Crisis Law" with respect to the establishment of a strengthened framework for bank
recapitalization and resolution so as to contribute to the development of a modern banking system.
A financial sector rehabilitation operation is being prepared to address policy issues and support with
resources and advice the process of recapitalization and resolution that should lead the needed
consolidation in the sector. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is also
discussing with a number of local banks about the prospects of equity injections. The participation of the
IFIs in the process of bank rehabilitation would certainly help in increasing confidence and regaining
stability in the sector. Moreover, early developments show that foreign owned banks are beginning to
receive recapitalization and refinancing resources from their parent banks.

80.      Furthermore, the implementation of the reform program laid out in this operation will, in
itself, help strengthen the basis for encouraging investor confidence and support a faster and
stronger economic recovery. Key measures supported by this DPL-III include improving the quality of
banking sector regulation, strengthening the legislative framework for corporate governance, improving
financial discipline and incentives in the energy sector by reducing quasi fiscal deficits, and improving
transparency and efficiency in public spending by adopting an adequate public procurement framework

Political Risks

81.      Political instability poses risks of delays in the implementation of the reform program and
to the recovery process itself. There is no pro-government coalition in the Parliament at the moment and
new parliamentary elections are likely, although the formation of a different parliamentary coalition can
not be ruled out. Adding to the mix are the on-going struggles on the path to the next Presidential
elections that are scheduled for January 2010. A protracted political crisis in which the power struggle
between the major political groups dominates the policy agenda could delay significantly the reform
agenda moving forward and pose renewed confidence risks for Ukraine's already strained financial
markets.

82.      Notwithstanding the fractious politics, the country's recent political history suggests
Ukraine's political system can generate compromise around key reforms. Among the more recent
examples are: (i) the adoption of measures leading to WTO accession, (ii) passage of a new Joint Stock
Company Law, and (iii) the strong political support in the passage of the "Anti-Crisis Law". All major
political groups are committed to further market-based reforms and the political and business
communities would have a lot to lose from the economic consequences of a protracted crisis. While
political risks to program implementation are substantial, this operation takes the view that they are best
managed through continued active engagement and appropriately calibrated conditionality.

83.      The design of this operation seeks to mitigate some of the political risks by supporting an
agenda that is common across the main political forces. The DPL encompasses selected pieces of the
reform agenda that constitute "common denominator" of the last three governments' programs (involving
parties across the political spectrum). The program supported by the DPL series therefore represents in
some sense a common development vision and provides an "anchor" for reforms. The selective use of
triggers complemented with a broader set of benchmarks in areas where the engagement still needs to
deepen allows the Government considerable flexibility to choose the reform sequence to fit with political
realities, while focusing on critical constraints.



                                                    30

Implementation and Policy Response Risks

84.      This operation is based on actions/achievements made prior to its approval. Risks to
continued reform implementation or even backtracking remain, but there are mitigating factors as
well. Many of the measures undertaken are anchored in legislative enactments which have a higher
chance of irreversibility. For instance, the Law on the Joint Stock Company is not likely to be reversed as
it was backed widely by the major political actors. The same is true of the amendment to the Banking
Law on the disclosure of ultimate owners in banks. Though this amendment had significant opposition of
vested interests groups, it would be too visible and difficult to move away from it in the context of the
banking sector restructuring process that is now underway. However, the procurement framework
implemented through executive action is tied to the risk of political volatility and change in government.
Triggers such as the fiscal deficit target and the reduction of the quasi-fiscal deficit are connected to
macroeconomic policies under the IMF SBA.

85.      The achievement of the overall macroeconomic stability would depend on the timely and
effective implementation of the IMF-supported government program. As discussed earlier, the
government would need to take timely action on the measures laid out by the IMF SBA and it would need
to respond effectively to a rapidly changing macroeconomic environment. Adequate response has been
traditionally highlighted as a risk in the context of political volatility in Ukraine. The tranched approach
of the IMF SBA, with performance benchmarks along the way should help as an anchor for an
appropriate response.

C. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

86.      The primary source of distributional impact from the reforms proposed in this operation
relates to higher energy prices. As levels of cash collection in electricity and gas increase, electricity
and gas tariffs move towards full economic cost recovery, and cross-subsidization (through under-pricing)
to residential (and communal) customers is reduced, energy prices will increase. These impacts will be
compounded by higher market-based import prices for gas that Ukraine is now paying Russia. This is an
ongoing adjustment to market forces that Ukraine will have to undertake even beyond the timeframe of
this operation.

87.      The distributional impact from these tariff increases can be significant, particularly for the
urban poor. Staff estimates suggest that the poorest, who largely live in rural areas, will suffer a
moderate reduction in their purchasing power as they spend only a small percent of their income on
energy. Many of the rural poor rely on fuel wood as the major source of energy. However, the effect on
the urban poor will be stronger, even though poverty rates are 40 percent lower in urban areas than in
rural areas. Poverty simulations for the whole population suggest that a 10 percent increase in energy
tariffs, other things remaining equal, would reduce household purchasing power by 0.7 percent.

88.       There have been two sets of remedial policies that have offset the adverse poverty and
social impacts of these higher tariffs. The first relates to the broad-based increases in wages and social
transfers that have been provided by the Government in 2008. While these may have provided short-term
relief and more than offset the erosion of purchasing power for the majority of the poor and the
vulnerable, this has not been a sustainable approach given its contribution to fiscal laxity and the
economic imbalances in the economy. The second approach relates to the introduction by Naftogaz (in
January 2007) of a two-tier tariff that differentiates between higher and lower income level consumers.
This operates much like a lifeline tariff and allows Naftogaz to subsidize lower income users while still
meeting overall cost-recovery targets. In the absence of a comprehensive social assistance program that




                                                      31

can effectively target the poorest and the most vulnerable, this program provides a credible and pragmatic
solution to this problem.

89.              Nevertheless, the more serious poverty impacts will derive from the underlying financial
crisis and the economic slowdown in Ukraine. Staff simulations based upon the 2006 household
survey suggest that between 1.5 and 2.2 million people who would fall into poverty or would not manage
to get out of the poverty because of the crisis. According to a "pre-crisis" distributionally-neutral growth
scenario, poverty in Ukraine was projected to fall from 7.8 percent in 2006 to 2.3 percent in 2009 (or
about 1.1 million poor people). Following the on-going economic crisis, private consumption per capita in
2009 is projected to fall by 12.5 percent, increasing the poverty rate in 2009 to 5.5 percent (or about 2
million poor). However, if income distribution also worsens slightly every year (i.e., the Gini coefficient
increases by 0.01 percentage point each year), then the poverty rate in 2009 would be higher at 7 percent
(or 3.3 million poor).

90.              Among a myriad of poorly targeted transfers to the population, Ukraine has few social
programs that can help mitigate the impact of the economic downturn. But there are programs that
with additional improvements in targeting would also help in this task. In 2007 Ukraine spent about 2.5
percent of its GDP on social assistance programs (that is aside from the spending on the 4 social insurance
funds that reached close to 17 percent of GDP), including multiple privileges that are categorically
targeted and do not cover the poor. The Bank estimates that up to 65 percent of social assistance transfers
go to the poorly targeted programs. There are, however, programs that could help to protect the poor such
as the programs for the extreme poor and for single mothers with children. The support of the program for
the extreme poor, for example, covers around 3.5 percent of the population reaching 73 percent of the
extreme poor.

91.              As the sustainability of Ukraine's recent social policies is called into question and as fiscal
policy is tightened in response to the macroeconomic stabilization, better targeting of transfer
programs will be needed to protect the poorest and the most vulnerable. The Bank team is discussing
with the government the need for fiscal reallocation measures in the 2009 and 2010 budgets, in the
context of a balanced budget, as a way to phase out untargeted assistance and wasteful spending and
channel funding to the existing well-targeted programs. Scaling up funding of these programs would



                                                            32

provide an enhanced coping mechanism for the poor. The Government can also build up on these well-
targeted programs to design cost-effective compensation mechanisms for the poorest population in the
short run. At the same time, all existing programs providing housing and utility subsidies can be
improved by applying a hybrid means test (HMT) instrument. The Bank is currently working with the
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection to develop such instrument. The DPL-I program led to the
establishment of a unified registry for the recipients of social privileges, which will also have a key role in
improving the targeting of social assistance moving forward.

D. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST ADJUSTMENT OPERATIONS

92.      A recent IEG evaluation of the PAL program and an evaluation of the 2000-2003 and 2004-
2007 CAS consistently rate the impact of the Bank's adjustment program as satisfactory. The CAS
Evaluation acknowledges the strong role adjustment lending played in achieving CAS outcomes. By the
same token, the IEG evaluation of the PAL program rates the outcome of PAL-I and PAL-II satisfactory.
The basis for this positive assessment is both Ukraine's strong overall macroeconomic performance
during this period and the fact that almost all benchmarks under the PAL program were eventually fully
met, albeit with considerable delays.

93.      IEG recommends further that the DPL program be more closely integrated with investment
lending. This recommendation has been embedded in the design of DPL-II and DPL-III and is at
the core of the DPL-III-CPS relationship. The current operation is closely linked with investment
lending in the energy sector, in public financial management, and pension reform. The CPS proposes a
distinction between core programs, where investment and development policy lending complement each
other to make deep and concerted progress in areas at the center of the national development strategy, and
development and advocacy programs, where the reform roadmap is either insufficiently articulated or
insufficient political consensus exists to move forward. In these areas, development policy conditionality
should be used sparingly and instead non-lending engagement may be more appropriate to define the
reform roadmap. However, the current operation does use DPL benchmarks in selected areas such as tax
reform and administration, to indicate the preferred reform path, recognizing that additional discussion
may be required to see it fully implemented.

94.      IEG also argues against back-loading conditionality and tranching of development policy
lending. Both recommendations are consistent with emerging best practice. This operation continues in
the single-tranche tradition of DPL I. The programmatic nature of the operation allows the reform
program to be sequenced over a number of years, and while the pace of implementation has in some cases
been adjusted by shifting reform benchmarks from DPL II into DPL III triggers, the programmatic design
has made sure that the DPL program as a whole is not held hostage to delays in the implementation of
selected benchmarks, as long as overall progress is assessed to be satisfactory.

E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

95.      Specific actions under the proposed DPL operation are not expected to have any significant
negative effect on the environment. In sectors that have a close link with the environment and that are
supported in one way or another by this operation (such as energy), the actions laid out by this operation
might improve environmental conditions in the long run as they are geared to improving energy
efficiency. There is a possibility that fuel substitution towards greater reliance of fuel wood, and the
substitution of domestic coal for imported gas as relative prices change, might lead to greater carbon
emissions. However, substitution possibilities in urban households are limited due to the predominance of
central district heating while rural households already rely to a significant extent on fuel wood for
cooking and heating. Nonetheless, there could be some risk of deforestation if reliance on fuel wood



                                                      33

increases. Persistent inefficiencies in the domestic coal industry will limit the extent of substitution to
coal over the timeframe of this operation. Ukraine's accession to the WTO will sets limits on the overall
degree of support to agriculture, which could affect the management of natural resources. Significantly,
the WTO also requires Ukraine to move from inefficient input and production subsidies to more
environmentally friendly measures of support. The rest of the measures for all other sectors and areas in
this operation are fiscal, institutional, and regulatory in nature and would not have any visible impact on
the environment.

96.        DPL-I supported Ukraine's efforts to gain eligibility for emissions trading under the Kyoto
protocol and this is now proceeding. The Bank will continue to support Ukraine in maximizing the
benefits to which it is eligible under the Kyoto protocol both under Joint Implementation arrangements
and with the sale of emission reductions by the government. In addition, the Bank has been highlighting
the issue of environmental risks and pollution management in a local context through a targeted technical
assistance project in Zaporizhzhia. Success of this technical assistance may catalyze greater progress at
the national level in environmental risk management and reduction of industrial pollution. However, this
agenda is insufficiently developed as yet to serve as a basis for development policy conditions in this
operation. The Programmatic Adjustment Loan program also supported the reform of environmental
penalties and permits. The Bank is pursuing the implementation of this agenda further in the context of
overall efforts to focus the permit system on real health and environmental hazards and thereby increase
both its effectiveness and reduce its costs for businesses.

F. FIDUCIARY ISSUES

97.        The Government's reforms have improved Public Financial Management (PFM)
significantly over the last six years and this operation helps to close the gap on procurement, the
weakest link in country systems in Ukraine. The treasury system is fully operational and consolidates
spending operations across agencies and levels of government (through the Single Treasury Account).
The Bank supported the establishment of the treasury system and follow up projects are now beginning to
enable a single platform for revenues and expenditures as well as for all information generated across the
main ministries and agencies with significant PFM responsibilities. Recent reviews have also shown
improvement in external and internal audits. The weakest link is the public procurement system, which
not in line with good practice. As discussed earlier, the present DPL has as a trigger the establishment of
an appropriate framework for public procurement, which would bring transparency and efficiency to the
system and would fill the most significant existing gap in Ukraine's public sector systems (see figure 7.2)
Other ongoing reform efforts are targeting improvements in strategic resource allocation as well as
operational efficiency and accountability, with support of various donors including the Bank and the EC.

G. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

98.      This operation's monitoring and evaluation will be supported by a variety data sources and
analytical work developed by different stakeholders. These include: (i) State Statistics Committee
(which is also supported by a Bank project); (ii) Ministry of Finance and State Treasury reports (both
institutions supported by the PFM project under preparation); (iii) reports from the State Tax
Administration (also supported by a Bank project); (iv) reports from the Ministry of Economy; (v)
investment climate surveys and assessments produced annually by the Bank and the IFC; (vi)
programmatic macroeconomic and structural policy monitoring and analysis by the Bank team; (vii)
analytical work produced by the IMF and other donors, including the EU.

99.      The baseline and medium-term outcome figures are clearly stated in the Policy and
Institutional Reform Matrix (Annex I). The baselines and outcomes established are objective, concrete,
and measurable indicators of economic and institutional performance. They will be tracked periodically
under the DPL program. Most medium-term outcomes were over-achieved by the time of appraisal of
DPL II and thus they were, in agreement with the government, modified reflecting higher expectations in
some particular areas. All outcomes are set to be evaluated after 2009.

H. LOAN ADMINISTRATION

100.     Borrower and Credit Amount. The borrower is the Government of Ukraine represented by the
Ministry of Finance. The loan is for USD 500 million, with a 30 year maturity with 5 years grace, level
principal repayments, six-month LIBOR for USD plus variable spread for an IBRD Flexible Loan; with a
front end fee of 0.25 percent of loan amount financed out of loan proceeds. The loan proceeds would be
made available to the Borrower upon loan effectiveness.

101.     Disbursement. Upon approval of the loan and notification by the Bank of Loan effectiveness, the
Government will submit a withdrawal application. The International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) will deposit the proceeds of the loan into a deposit account at the request of the
Ministry of Finance. Prior to that the Bank will withdraw from the Loan Account a front-end fee
amounting to 0.25 percent of the loan amount. If, after deposit in this NBU account, the proceeds of the
Loan are used for ineligible purposes (for example, to finance goods or services on the IBRD standard
negative list), the IBRD will require the borrower to return that amount to the account for use for eligible
purposes. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

102.     Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date. The Government will maintain accounts and records, or
ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in accordance with
provision of the Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to

          ANNEX 2: Quasi-Fiscal Deficits in the Energy Sector: Methodology and Calculations

The quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy sector is calculated for the purposes of this operation as the
difference in the actual effective price charged to customers (tariffs, weighted by the shares of different
customer groups in overall domestic consumption and the respective cash collection rates for these
groups) and a benchmark price, multiplied by the overall consumption of energy.                         32  For the purposes of
this operation, the energy sector is defined as natural gas and electricity sectors.

In the gas sector, different prices are charged to households (further differentiated by levels of
consumption since January 2007), communal utilities, budgetary organizations and industrial consumers.
Industrial consumers are charged a price that corresponds to the import price for gas plus a mark-up.
Budget organizations and, to a lesser extent, communal utilities have seen their tariffs raised towards the
levels charged to industrial consumers. Households are charged lower tariffs, which is justified by the
National Energy Regulatory Commission (NERC) by the fact that Ukraine produces around 20 billion
cubic meters (bcm) of domestic gas at costs significantly below import prices. The authorities understand
the need over time to close the difference between tariffs charged to different consumer groups but see
this as a gradual process given political sensitivities. Communal utilities in turn have their tariffs for
heating approved by local governments, which have in several cases resisted the full pass through of
higher gas prices to heating tariffs. However, since tariff setting for consumers of heat is highly
decentralized and can hardly be influenced by the central government, this operation does not include the
heating sector into the calculations for the quasi-fiscal deficit, noting nonetheless its critical importance
for sector performance as a whole.

In the electricity sector, power generators supply power to a wholesale market (Energomarket) at a
regulated wholesale price.33 Distribution prices are also set centrally by NERC with a mark-up over the
wholesale price that varies with distribution costs. Hence in the electricity sector, the calculations
concentrate on the difference between the wholesale price and the cost benchmark. The coal sector is not
considered for two reasons: (i) coal prices in Ukraine are now at parity with import prices, but
inefficiencies in the domestic coal sector still require significant direct subsidies from the budget, which
are accounted for in the consolidated budget deficit; (ii) most coal is consumed by thermal power plants,
and thus accounted for in the electricity sector.

A key issue for the calculations of the quasi-fiscal deficit is the choice of a benchmark price. There are
essentially two options for this. The first option is the use of import or export parity prices as a
benchmark. For gas this is the netback price for Russian gas exports to Europe, net of transport costs. For
electricity, the export price charged by Ukraine for its electricity exports to other Eastern European
countries could be used, but this varies widely across customers since Ukraine only recently moved to an
auction system for power exports.

The second option is the use of a unit cost benchmark which takes into account the real costs of energy
supply. This option is pursued for the purposes of this operation. For gas the unit cost benchmark includes
an assumed cost of domestic gas production and the cost of imported gas, as well as distribution costs.
For electricity the unit cost benchmark is based on staff estimates of the long-run marginal cost of supply.


32There are technical losses and own consumption for production and technological needs in both gas and power distribution. In
the case of gas, these are accounted for as non-billed sales. In the case of power, the benchmark price estimate includes
compensation for technical losses, and hence only sales to final consumers (net of technical losses) are used in the calculations.
33With the exception of a part of TPP costs, which correspond to level costs and are established through bids on the Wholesale
Electricity Market itself.

Dear Mr. Zoellick,



        The Government of Ukraine would like to express its deep respect to the World Bank and
to you personally, and has the honor to inform you of the following.

        The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine highly appreciates the support to our strategy of
economic reforms provided by the World Bank over the last three years through the
implementation of a series of Development Policy Loans (hereinafter the DPL-III). The support
of the World Bank is an effective tool to move forward the reforms of the national economy and
the positive dynamics of economic development in Ukraine.

        We look forward to your further assistance and cooperation. We believe that our
partnership within the framework of the DPL-III would help to lessen the negative effect of the
global financial crisis on the economic and social development of Ukraine and to help in the
recovery process.

Macroeconomic Framework

        The economic recovery of Ukraine in 2000-2007 was impressive, with an average growth
rate of GDP of 7 percent. The real growth of GDP in 2007 was 7.6 percent, while the industrial
output grew by 10.2 percent. The positive structural shift in the industrial production is
confirmed by the increasing share of investment-oriented goods in output (in particular, the
volume of machine building production grew by 28.6 percent in 2007). Positive trends in
economic growth continued during the first half of 2008. However, due to the downturn of the
world economy and subsequent decline in demand and commodity prices worldwide, a dramatic
reversal of economic trends in Ukraine has started since August 2008. As a result, the industrial
output growth rate was at 2.2 percent to date, while real GDP decelerated to 5.8 percent. The
high GDP growth rate during January-October was mainly supported by strong growth in
agriculture (by 18.3 percent) and in transport (by 10.4 percent).

        The recent economic growth has been mostly consumption-driven. The active social
policy pursued by the Government promoted growth in the purchasing power of the population
through increases of the real income of households (by 12.6 percent in 2007 and 13 percent in
January-September of 2008). As the result of income growth exceeding productivity growth,
inflationary pressures intensified and consumer price growth has remained in double digits since
2006. The measures applied by the Government and the National Bank of Ukraine slowed down
inflation growth in the third quarter of 2008: consumer prices increased by 0.5 percent, the
lowest rate over the last 4 years. However, the consumer price index (CPI) grew by 18 percent



                                                53

cumulatively in January-October 2008 and we continuously view inflation as one of the major
risks.

        Domestic demand growth in Ukraine by far exceeded GDP growth, leading to a
worsening of the current account balance from a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2005 to a
deficit of 1.5 percent in 2006 and a further deterioration to a 3.7 percent deficit in 2007. Import
growth continued to exceed export growth. Imports of goods and services grew by 58.7 percent
in January-September of 2008 compared with the same period of 2007 and by 34.7 percent in
2007. Export growth was 28.4 percent in 2007 and 48.4 percent in the period of January-
September 2008 compared with the same period of 2007. The current account deficit was
partially financed by foreign direct investment. Inward foreign direct investment in the Ukrainian
economy in 2007 amounted to USD 9.2 billion, which was 1.6 times higher than the previous
year. In the nine months of 2008 (according to NBU operational data) it amounted to USD 8.9
billion, which is a 17.2 percent increase.

        The fiscal policy in Ukraine has remained sustainable. The consolidated budget deficit
was 1.1 percent of GDP in 2007. In 2008, we expect to keep the budget deficit as low as 1
percent of GDP despite the fact that decelerating economic growth will cause a drop in tax
revenues.

        Taking into consideration the global financial crisis and an economic slowdown in every
part of the world, we recognize that the economic situation in Ukraine is difficult and we are
ready to address these issues through implementation of relevant policy measures. We have
launched a two-year program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with the size of the
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) financial support to the Ukrainian economy amounting to USD
16.4 billion. The Government and the National Bank of Ukraine are planning to implement
coordinated fiscal and monetary policies, address the balance of payments vulnerabilities,
stimulate development of the domestic market and implement a package of measures for a
gradual transition to inflation targeting. Fiscal policy will be aimed at maintaining the budget
deficit at low levels; specifically, in 2008 it should not exceed 1 percent of GDP while in 2009
we aim for a zero-deficit state budget.

Progress Achieved under DPL I and DPL II

        The Government of Ukraine, in cooperation with the World Bank, is implementing
programmatic reforms supported by a Development Policy Loan Program which started in 2005.
The current DPL III is based on results achieved under DPL I and DPL II and is a logical
continuation of the reform program. Under the first DPL, the Government implemented
important reforms in the areas of trade liberalization, reduction of tax distortions, the creation of
a telecommunications regulator and reforming public sector finance. DPL II supported reforms
underlying the WTO accession and Ukraine became a WTO member in May 2008. In addition,
the Ukrainian Government, with the support of the DPL II program, made progress in the areas
of improvement of the business climate, telecom deregulation, education reforms and fiscal
adjustment. An important positive spillover from the past DPL loans has been the fact that they
have served as an anchor for the continuation of the structural reforms during the political
instability the country experienced during recent years.

Progress under DPL III

Continuing with the reforms carried out under the implementation of the DPL I and DPL II
programs, the Government has been actively engaged in arrangements worked out jointly with
the World Bank for preparation of the Development Policy Loan III. The Government has
already made progress in carrying out the DPL triggers, in particular:

          a. The Law of Ukraine "On Joint-Stock Companies" was adopted bringing Ukraine
              significantly closer to the principles of corporate management of the Organization
              for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and will eliminate the
              existing flaws in the legislation on corporate management. It will also solve
              conceptually the problems of securing the interests of joint-stock companies,
              shareholders, particularly the minority shareholders, creditors, employees and the
              State;
          b. Legal amendments to banking laws were introduced by Verkhovna Rada of
              Ukraine enforcing ultimate ownership disclosure, with a threshold of 5 percent;
          c. As stated before, the fiscal deficit was kept below 2 percent of GDP in 2007 and
              we aim for a budget deficit not exceeding 1 percent of GDP in 2008;
          d. The Government ensured that the energy sector quasi-fiscal deficit has not
              increased from 2006. In 2008, utility tariffs continued to move towards cost
              recovery levels;
          e. With a view to improving the Ukrainian legislation on public procurement, and in
              compliance with the EU standards, the previous version of the Law "On Public
              Procurement of Goods, Works and Services" was cancelled and a temporary
              Cabinet of Ministers Resolution was approved securing transparency in the public
              procurement system and bringing it closer to international standards. We
              elaborated the new draft Law "On Public Procurement of Goods, Works and
              Services" in line with international standards and it was approved in the first
              reading by Verkhovna Rada. Due to political circumstances, approval of this Law
              might be delayed. In order to secure efficient functioning of public procurement,
              we amended the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers to make it consistent with
              the draft law recently sent to Verkhovna Rada, which incorporates the expert
              comments received from the World Bank. The procurement framework
              established through executive action will remain in place until a law is passed by
              the parliament. Moreover, the Government is committed to reflect in future
              legislation the exact procedures agreed and implemented through executive
              authority.

       In addition, several other major reforms were undertaken. The Government drafted,
approved and submitted in July 2008 for consideration of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a draft of
the new Customs Code to modify customs legislation in line with the International Convention
on Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (Kyoto Convention) and the
Convention on Temporary Import (Istanbul Convention).




                                                55

        In order to improve the efficiency of public sector management, we initiated the
following measures:

            f. In September 2008 the Government approved the Resolution "On the Competitive
                Selection of the State Owned Enterprises Managers" that will allow the
                establishment of transparent and competitive procedures of selecting the
                managers of state-owned enterprises.
            g. Amendments to laws were drafted and submitted to Verkhovna Rada stipulating
                the strengthening of the administrative and financial independence of the National
                Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC).

        We took measures to improve business climate, namely:

            h. 227 obsolete international standards adopted before 1992 were reconsidered and
                cancelled in 2008. For replacing 215 of them, appropriate national standards,
                compliant with the European standards, were adopted and included in the
                National Standardization Plan for the year 2008.
            i. In order to improve the procedures of issuing permit documents in compliance
                with the European standards, a draft law on the introduction of amendments to the
                Law of Ukraine "On the Permit System in the Area of Economic Activity" was
                adopted by Verkhovna Rada in the first reading.

        We recognize the large investment needs of Ukraine and the importance of private sector
involvement. In order to address these needs, the draft Law of Ukraine "On the General
Principles of Development of the Public-Private Partnership in Ukraine" was written and sent to
Verkhovna Rada. The Concept of reforming the coal sector was approved, including plans for
coal mine privatization and also a number of other important arrangements. The Government
prepared and Verkhovna Rada adopted in the first reading in June 2008 the draft Law of Ukraine
"On the State Program of Privatization for 2008-2012".

  Government Priorities Going Forward

        Currently the negative trends in the global economy pose considerable risks to the
macroeconomic stability and economic development of Ukraine. We believe that, in addition to
the anti-crisis measures that were recently enacted by Verkhovna Rada and implemented through
regulations of the Government, a broad program is required to address financing needs and
ensure the basis for economic recovery.

        Moving forward, the Government intends to continue implementation of stabilization
measures and structural reforms that can help to: (i) restore confidence to the financial sector, (ii)
strengthen the role of budget allocations in supporting public investments to help the real
economy and to protect the vulnerable, under a balanced budget and prudent fiscal policy; and
(iii) continue structural reforms in the areas of fair competition, trade and business environment.

        As regards the financial sector, we are committed to a comprehensive strategy to deal
with the banking sector situation as a way to address confidence, liquidity, solvency, and bank
resolution issues. Most of the pieces of such a framework have been addressed through the anti-
crisis law and subsequent resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank of
Ukraine. In order to get support in this process we have requested the assistance of the World
Bank for implementation of a financial sector rehabilitation project.

        The Government is committed to implementing a financial sector rehabilitation program,
as described in the Law "On Priority Measures to Prevent Negative Impact of Financial Crisis
and on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine" and in Resolution # 960 "On
Approval of Government Participation in Banks Capitalization" of November 4, 2008, with the
aim to ensure the process of banking restructuring is implemented transparently and successfully.
As a first step we will put in place a rigorous program of special audits and further evaluation of
the viability of banks, in order to determine each bank's current level of solvency, liquidity and
compliance with prudential norms.

        As regards fiscal policy, protecting the poorer segments of the population, as well as
protecting infrastructure investments as a way to provide a stimulus to the real economy, is
critical in times of harsh economic adjustment. In the context of tight budgetary constraints,
protecting the poor through the budget can be done by generating fiscal savings across social
programs, particularly those that are not well-targeted to poorer Ukrainians, and then placing
emphasis on increasing in real terms the few programs that are well-targeted, such as the
program for the extreme poor and the program for single women with children. Moreover, efforts
will be taken to improve the targeting of programs that subsidize the costs of utilities and
communal housing. The budget is taking action in these areas, including through a measure
supported by the DPL III that envisages budget savings in the pension system. These savings will
also help to bring sustainability to the pension system for future generations.

        We recognize that maintaining, and even increasing, the share of fixed capital
investments is essential to enable a faster recovery of the real economy. Ukraine's infrastructure
is deteriorating rapidly and is in need of significant public investments. Moreover, we are going
to be the host of the Euro Cup 2012, which also encompasses significant state investments to
improve different transport modes as well as city and sports venue facilities. Significant
investments are also needed across the country in ports, roads, railways, energy, housing,
communal services and social sector infrastructure and equipment.              In Ukraine private
investment is complementary to public investment, and thus increasing public investment is a
key priority for the Government of Ukraine. This can also be done by finding savings across
subsidies, tax expenditures and other budget support programs. The Government will seek advice
from the World Bank on implementation of budget reallocation measures moving forward.

        Reforms on the revenue side of the budget are also important. We will continue efforts to
expand the tax base and in the future start a gradual and fiscally manageable tax rate reduction
on direct taxes. We will continue increasing excises on alcohol and tobacco and eliminating
VAT exemptions to strengthen indirect taxation. At the same time, we want to legislate tightly to
curtail certain transfer pricing practices (following OECD guidelines also accepted by the WTO)
and to implement stronger and less burdensome risk-based systems for tax audits and VAT

refunds. We will also legislate for, and implement, indirect methods of auditing. When the
political situation allows for safely passing to the Parliament a tax code that is stable and levels
the playing field for all, we will pursue that path.

       The Government is also planning measures geared towards continuing improvements in
the business environment, following through on reforms on inspections, permits, and standards.
We realize that to enable a fast economic recovery, entry and fair competition is critical to
domestic and foreign investors. The Government will reinvigorate efforts in the area of
competition policy and its implementation. At the same time, businesses need an effective
bankruptcy framework that allows a quick reallocation of assets to revitalize the economy; the
Government will place legislative and executive effort on that agenda as well. Energy policy and
transparent privatization processes are also at the top of the agenda of government reforms.

       As regards international trade, Ukraine has started discussions on a free trade agreement
with the EU. We are aiming at achieving a new quality in Ukraine-EU relations and foresee not
only tariff-related measures but also a regulatory convergence in many areas of common interest
that will create the basis for deeper economic integration.

       The Government also relies upon the National Bank of Ukraine for its adequate actions
that will encourage maintenance of macroeconomic and financial stability.

       Under such conditions, the Government of Ukraine requests the Bank to grant the
Development Policy Loan III in the amount of USD 500 million which would promote the
continued reforms and the maintenance of positive dynamics in economic growth in Ukraine.
The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine will put all its efforts into achieving the outcomes of the
future DPL-III program. By a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine the Ministry of
Economy is appointed as the implementing agency within the framework of the Project.
