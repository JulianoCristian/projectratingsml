Excellency:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement (Agricultural Sector Reform and Investment 
Project) between the Republic of El Salvador (the Borrower) and the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated September 30, 1993, as amended

Loan Agreement have the respective meanings set forth therein.
Pursuant to discussions between staff of the Borrower’s Ministry of Agriculture 
and Livestock and the Bank, the Bank hereby agrees to amend the Loan Agreement as 
follows:
I.
In Section 1.02 the word “and” at the end of paragraph (s) is deleted and the 
following new paragraphs (u), (v) and (w) are added to read as follows:
“(u) ‘BMI’ means Banco Multilateral de Inversión, the Borrower’s Multilateral 
Investment Bank;
(v) ‘Participating Bank’ means any financial institution regulated by the SSF, 
selected according to the criteria described in Schedule 7 to this Agreement; and
(w) ‘SSF’ means Superintendente del Sistema Financiero, the Borrower’s Financial 
Sector Supervision Agency.”
II.
Paragraph (a) of Section 3.01, is amended to read as follows:
“Section 3.01. (a) The Borrower declares its commitment to the objectives of the 
Project as set forth in Schedule 2 to this Agreement, and, to this end, shall carry

respect of the CENTA Subproject, Part C of the Project, through Registry, Part D.1 of 
the Project, through BMI and Parts D.2 and D.3 of the Project through SSF, all with 
due diligence and efficiency and in conformity with appropriate administrative, 
financial, engineering, economic  and environmental practices and standards, and shall 
provide, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, services and other resources 
required for the Project.”
III.
Article III of the Loan Agreement is amended by adding a new Section 3.08 to 
read as follows:
“Section 3.08.  The Borrower, through the SSF shall cause the Participating 
Banks receiving the technical assistance described in Part D.1 of the Project, to 
comply with the performance targets described in Schedule 7 to this Agreement.” 
IV.

the quality of its services and  improve the access to information by the financial

VI.
A new Schedule 7 is added to the Loan Agreement as set forth in Annex 2 of this

this letter and returning one fully signed original to us.  Upon receipt by the Bank

“SCHEDULE 7
Criteria for Selection of Participating Banks
BMI will request the interested banks to prepare proposals indicating their 
suitability to participate in the program and highlighting how they would like to 
expand their microenterprise portfolio. 
In the selection process we would give equal weighting to the following criteria: 
(1) the existence of a microenterprise portfolio;  
(2) at least 20 percent of their bank branches outside of greater San Salvador; 
(3) participation in the European Union FOMMI II program to develop microenterprise 
finance;
(4) high level interest within the bank as documented by the willingness of the 
President or his second in charge to participate in the rural finance innovation 
committee that will be set up within each Participating Bank; and
(5) quality of the proposal and willingness of the institution to innovate in the 
provision of rural financial services as documented by the proposal.
Participating Banks’ Performance Targets
1.
Modify or introduce at least 3 financial products (on the asset or liability 
side) targeted to rural low-income households and small-micro entrepreneurs prior to 
December 1999.
2.
Expand by 15% (over average levels since 1995 ) the microfinance portfolio 
($10,000 equivalent or less) to borrowers outside of greater San Salvador by December 
1999.
3.
Expand by 5% (over average levels since 1995 ) the number of savings accounts 
(accounts of $1,000 equivalent or less) outside of greater San Salvador by December 
1999.
4.
Issue microenterprise credits using market-based risk adjusted interest rates 
and fees by June 1999.
5.
Reduce by 25% the time between the receipt of a loan request and the 
authorization of the loan for microentrepreneurs using branches located outside of 
greater San Salvador by December 1999.
