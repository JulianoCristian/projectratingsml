improve Cameroon's transport sector sustainability,\n            through the private operation of the railway sector, thus\n            eliminating the burden on public finance for provision of\n            railway services. The project components consist of: 1)\n            rehabilitation, and modernization of the rail\n            infrastructure, to be implemented by CAMRAIL, comprising\n            rehabilitation of tracks; construction of small, and medium\n            structures, and bridges; acquisition of signaling, and\n            radio-telecommunications equipment to improve railway\n            operational safety; and general engineering works, including\n            the extension of the railway system to the port of Douala.\n            International aid will further contribute to financing this\n            component, in order to complement concessionaire financing,\n            particularly civil works, sleepers, and welding; 2)\n            rehabilitation of rolling stock, track maintenance\n            equipment, and workshops, for which CAMRAIL will have\n            overall responsibility for implementing this component,\n            given it will not be financed by the Bank; and, 3)\n            environmental, and social activities, focused on the\n            clean-up of polluted railway sites prior to concessioning,\n            particularly the creosote facility, and the diesel fuel\n            stations in Douala, and Yaounde, and includes engineering\n            studies, and pollution abatement supervision works.\n            Regarding social issues, overall safety measures, and\n            resettlement compensation of populations in the railway\n            right-of-way will be undertaken. In accordance with the\n            Concession Agreement, the Government assumes responsibility\n            for pollution abatement that predates the concession,\n            whereas CAMRAIL will implement this activity on behalf of\n            the Borrower."}, "docdt": "2002-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
