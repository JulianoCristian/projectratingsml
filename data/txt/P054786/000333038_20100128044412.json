outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the lack of clear Public Private Partnership (PPP)\n            regulations with regard to railway concession was a great\n            handicap. It is therefore recommended that with the\n            experience derived from this project and other similar\n            projects an appropriate and realistic framework for PPP be\n            developed first or at least in parallel with the concession\n            design. Passenger services in most of the concessions in\n            Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) require subsidies from the\n            government and are not the major priority of concessionaire.\n            This can result in: (i) deficit and lack of assurance of\n            financial sustainability for the concessionaire; and (ii)\n            neglect of passenger services activities when not funded by\n            the government. An appropriate passenger services\n            convention, which defines clear and practical rules, should\n            be part of the concession design from the onset. Considering\n            that other donors were involved in the project, donor\n            coordination turned out to be an essential success element\n            for the entire project especially during the preparation\n            phase. This helped to facilitate the concession process and\n            attracted qualified bidders with sufficient capital. Future\n            projects should therefore pay greater attention to enhancing\n            donor coordination. Timely external development assistance\n            contribution to finance large and costly infrastructure is\n            essential to support PPPs for railway services, which is\n            profitable for the entire economy but which does not have a\n            very high financial viability. In the specific case of this\n            project, delays in lenders mobilization did somehow\n            jeopardize the concession sustainability during its initial\n            years of operations."}, "docdt": "2009-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
