The most adverse activities\n            are: the application of creosote, a toxic preservative, to\n            railroad sleepers in the Cameroon Railway (CR) workshops;\n            the inadequate surveillance of the tracks; the rental of\n            land and shops in the right of way; three issues related to\n            the management of the railway and CR facilities, also the\n            management and maintenance of CR rolling stock; and finally,\n            the illegal transportation of bush meat and rainforest logs,\n            and the transportation of hazardous materials. Some of the\n            key mitigation measures include installing a treatment\n            system that limits creosote pollution, evaluating creosote\n            treatment sites, informing the public of contamination risk,\n            using protective clothing, collaborating with the population\n            living near the track to reinforce informal surveillance,\n            financing an inventory of the right of way in order to\n            define responsibilities and establish a sound land\n            management system, improving waste management of the CR land\n            area, building security fencing, improving the management\n            and handling of oil and diesel fuels, and controlling the\n            transport of bush meat, rainforest logs, and hazardous materials."}, "docdt": "2002-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
