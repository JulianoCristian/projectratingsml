{"cdata!": "The Title Registration Project seeks to\n            promote private sector development by implementing a\n            transparent, parcel-based, and easily accessible\n            registration system for land and other real property.\n            Specifically, it will a) increase the productivity and value\n            of land and other real estate by securing property rights\n            and promoting consolidation of fragmented rural land\n            ownership, and b) facilitate the use of property as\n            collateral and reduce transaction costs in title transfer\n            and mortgage finance by improving the efficiency of rural\n            and urban property markets. The project consists of three\n            components. The first component will support establishing a\n            nationwide common Information and Registration Centers\n            (IRCs) network for a secure registration of real estate\n            parcels and associated rights. It will include training\n            staff in the new system procedures; designing, prototyping,\n            and establishing a computerized title registration\n            management information system in 25 IRCs with linkages to\n            information systems across the cadastral network; and\n            further equipping local IRCs. The second component will\n            support surveying land to produce cadastral maps. It will\n            provide financing to equip and furnish the Mapping Center;\n            contract satellite imagery and finance global positioning\n            system grid enhancement work; and support the non-labor\n            operating costs of the Surveying and Mapping works. The\n            third component will finance equipping and operating a\n            Project Implementation Unit (PIU)."}, "docdt": "1998-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
