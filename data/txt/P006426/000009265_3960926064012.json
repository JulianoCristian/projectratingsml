Northeast Rural\n            Development Program-Minas Gerais Project, the Government of\n            Brazil hopes to (a) increase agricultural production and\n            productivity; (b) generate income and employment\n            opportunities for low-income rural families; (c) promote\n            water resource development and technology generation and\n            diffusion to decrease small farmers' vulnerability to\n            recurring droughts; (d) increase community participation in\n            all phases of the development process; and (e) strengthen\n            the State of Minas Gerais' capacity to provide\n            efficient agricultural services to small farmers. To that\n            end, the project involves several components including\n            construction of two state-managed irrigation schemes\n            totalling 2,840 ha and benefitting 750 farm families;\n            studies for possible future irrigation projects;\n            construction or rehabilitation of about 170 simple rural\n            water supply systems; and adaptive agricultural research and\n            basic seed production. In addition, the project provides for\n            extension services to about 38,000 small farmers; investment\n            credit for about 12,000 farms including 3,250 irrigated\n            farms; marketing support services for private traders and\n            small farmers; and funding for project administration; and training."}, "docdt": "1987-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
