To that\n            end, the project involves several components including\n            construction of two state-managed irrigation schemes\n            totalling 2,840 ha and benefitting 750 farm families;\n            studies for possible future irrigation projects;\n            construction or rehabilitation of about 170 simple rural\n            water supply systems; and adaptive agricultural research and\n            basic seed production. In addition, the project provides for\n            extension services to about 38,000 small farmers; investment\n            credit for about 12,000 farms including 3,250 irrigated\n            farms; marketing support services for private traders and\n            small farmers; and funding for project administration; and training."}, "docdt": "1987-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
