As part\n            of the Gulf of Suez project (Loan 1732 - EGT) the Bank\n            financed an exploration study which analyzed petroleum\n            prospects in a 2,000 square kilometer area in the Western\n            Desert adjoining the Abu Gharadig gas fields. Twenty-five\n            prospects, eight highly promising, were identified. The\n            proposed project comprises the following principal elements:\n            (i) seismic surveys: reprocessing trials in selected areas,\n            shooting about 170 km lines on structures to be drilled and\n            shooting a regional grid of about 900 km lines; (ii)\n            drilling: up to 9 exploration and appraisal wells, the\n            actual split to be determined as drilling progresses and\n            data is analyzed; (iii) testing and data processing; (iv)\n            technical assistance; and (v) in addition, the project will\n            include a component to evaluate the feasibility of\n            converting gasoline and subsequently diesel-powered\n            automotive vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG),\n            including a pilot scale conversion project."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
