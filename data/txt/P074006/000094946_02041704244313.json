"The objective of the Emergency\n            Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Living Conditions\n            Improvement Project in Congo, is to contribute to the\n            re-establishment of basic economic activities, and social\n            services, by rehabilitating primary, secondary, and urban\n            roads, drainage and school facilities. By prioritizing areas\n            in infrastructure, such as roads, social infrastructure and\n            private sector rehabilitation, the credit will benefit the\n            jump-start of the economy, and create conditions for\n            long-term development, while tackling immediate economic and\n            social needs of the most vulnerable, i.e., employment\n            creation. Specifically, the project will benefit local\n            entrepreneurs, and national consulting firms, and improve\n            living conditions. Nonetheless, political and social risks,\n            associated with the failure of the transition process to\n            democracy, and to building a political system that will\n            resolve differences without recourse to violence, may hinder\n            success, in addition to weak institutional, and\n            administrative capacities, and the Government's\n            inability to service its debt with the Bank. However, the\n            project will use simplified implementation arrangements, and\n            streamline procurement processes, as well as provide support\n            to the upcoming Public Expenditures Review, to mitigate risks."}, "docdt": "2002-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
