"Ratings for the Emergency Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation and Living Conditions Improvement Project of\n            Congo were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high,\n            the Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) A multi-faceted approach to\n            mitigating capacity constraints is necessary in a\n            post-conflict environment; 2) Cost overruns are common\n            features of emergency operations dealing with infrastructure\n            activities and higher levels of unallocated resources are\n            needed to address the higher level of uncertainty; 3)\n            Expectations in achieving results in emergency operations\n            should remain low, particularly in the absence of\n            information on indicators and baselines; 4) Balancing long\n            term sustainability and short term impacts is a difficult\n            exercise and normal Bank operations should immediately\n            follow the completion of emergency operations to address\n            long term sustainability; and 5) Project performance is at\n            risk when project restructuring is not carried out timely."}, "docdt": "2007-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
