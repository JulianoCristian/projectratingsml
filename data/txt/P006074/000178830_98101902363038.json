The principal objectives of the program are: (a)\n            expansion of the existing generation, transmission and\n            distribution systems to meet projected demand throughout the\n            period; (b) improvement of plant efficiency to reduce\n            specific fuel consumption and relative cost per generated\n            kilowatt hour (kWh); (c) improvement of the transmission and\n            distribution systems by utilization of appropriate design to\n            keep energy losses at a minimum; (d) improvement of\n            BLPC's institutional capability by developing long\n            range planning for generation and plant; and (e) undertaking\n            an energy conservation program and maximizing the use of\n            indigenous energy resources such as gas and bagasse. The\n            Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange costs of\n            distribution components that are not being financed by other\n            sources. In addition it would finance the foreign exchange\n            costs of studies for energy conservation, generation\n            expansion and tariff structure."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
