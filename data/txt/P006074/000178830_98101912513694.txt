POWER PROJECT
1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources and Use
1.01      The estimated total gross consumption of energy in Barbados in 1977
was 2.0 x 1012 kcal (2.0 x 105 toe), while energy consumption per capita was
about 8.0 x 106 kcal, (1978 estimated population: 252,000). 1/ Imports of
fuel and lubricants in 1978 amounted to about US$36.4 million, accounting for
11.5% of the value of total merchandise imports.  About US$20.4 million of
this amount was for domestic use and US$16.0 million was for re-export.
1.02      Petroleum provided 91% of primary energy in 1977, with natural gas,
liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and bagasse making up the balance. About 14% of
the total energy supply was provided by domestic crude oil, natural gas and
bagasse.  The major consumer of primary energy was the electric utility, The
Barbados Light and Power Company (BLPC), which used 44% of the total. Supply
and consumption of primary energy in 1977 are estimated as follows: 2/

1.03      Barbados is one of only two energy-importing Caribbean countries
(the other being Cuba) having minor production of crude oil and natural gas.
After intense exploration during the 1960s and early 1970s, a private oil
company began commercial-scale production of crude oil in 1973 and output
increased from 59 thousand barrels in 1974 to 283 thousand barrels in 1979.
Concomitantly, gross output of natural gas rose from 68 million cubic feet
(mcf) in 1974 to 547 mcf in 1979, largely associated with crude. 1/ Refining
is done by a 3,300 barrel per day refinery owned and operated by Mobil Oil
Corporation, and marketing companies operating in Barbados are obliged to
purchase products from it, except for aviation and marine fuels. The retail
prices of oil fuels are based on posted prices in the Caribbean market and
local refining costs. Import duty is levied on all petroleum products
except where domestic output does not fully meet demand, and road tax is
levied on gasoline.
1.04       All crude oil and associated natural gas produced in Barbados
is extracted from 11 wells by General Crude Oil Company (Texas), which is
owned by Mobil. The Government is in the process of forming the National
Petroleum Corporation to undertake exploration and production in the northern
two-thirds of the island, which is not covered by General Crude's concession.
The state-owned Natural Gas Corporation (NGC) distributes gas (188 mcf in
1979) and owns two gas wells, but it purchases the bulk of its requirements
from General Crude, having exclusive rights to all the gas the company produces.
At present, General Crude is venting about 1.0 million cubic feet per day
(mcf/d) of associated natural gas, while NGC's average daily sales are only
about 0.52 mcf/d. However, NGC has entered into an agreement with BLPC to
supply gas to the Spring Garden steam plant whose two steam boilers have been
fitted with gas burners and by late 1980 should be ready to use some 1.0
mcf/day of gas, representing about 9.0% of BLPC's fuel requirements.
1.05      Proven reserves of hydrocarbons are relatively small.  Those of
crude oil are estimated at 3.5 million barrels of which about 30% to 35% may
be recoverable, and those of natural gas at about 10,000 mcf. General Crude
has intensified drilling in the Woodbourne area and in 1978 made a heavy
oil discovery about 3 km south of the Woodbourne field near Charnocks in
southern Barbados. The Government, with assistance from UNDP, is now formu-
lating a strategy to improve hydrocarbon resource development, including
intensified seismic work and drilling of deeper wells, and is seeking external
financing for this purpose. It is expected that in the 1974-81 period, some
1 million barrels of crude oil and 1,000 mcf of natural gas will be produced.
At current consumption rates, this amounts to 10% and 12%, respectively, of
commercial domestic demand.
1.06       Barbados has no hydroelectric potential, and no geothermal explora-
tion has been conducted or is planned. Some locally produced charcoal is
used for cooking; firewood consumption is negligible. Bagasse is used by the
sugar industry, which is energy self-sufficient and, in addition, produces
more bagasse than it needs. This excess is now either stockpiled or burned.
The Canadian International Development Agency and the Commowealth Science
Council are funding a study, to be completed by the end of 1980, to measure
the quantities and qualities of surplus bagasse available and sugar factory
1/   This includes natural gas re-injected, flared and otherwise lost.  About
34% of gross output is delivered to final consumers.



boiler efficiencies. Also, BLPC and Sugar Factories Ltd. conducted trials in
1980 to supply power from Foursquare Factory (which has a 30% bagasse surplus)
to the public grid. The results of these trials were positive and the next
step is to establish a permanent connection to the grid. A price related to
BLPC's cost of fuel has been negotiated and other sugar factories may be
expected to follow suit where feasible. The situation will be monitored
during project supervision. In the field of solar energy, Barbados has
significant potential. An estimated 100 solar water heaters are already
installed, mainly in private residences in various parts of the island, saving
about 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent energy per year. The on-going Bank-
financed Heywoods Village Tourism Project includes a solar water heating
system that will supply about 75% of the hot water needs of a 308-room hotel
village. There is potential for the further use of solar energy for heating
water; the rate of penetration of solar heaters will depend on fiscal incen-
tives and the economics of converting existing houses and hotels to solar
energy. The Bank carried out a survey of the Barbadian energy sector in 1978
as part of a broader Caribbean energy survey.
Power Sector Organization
1.07       The power sector is, for the most part, well organized.  Barbados is
served by a single electric utility, BLPC, which generates, distributes, and
sells electric energy throughout Barbados. 1/ BLPC has an installed generating
capacity of 96 MW and transmission and distribution facilities which presently
serve about 67,000 customers, providing service to roughly 90% of the total
population of Barbados.
1.08      BLPC started a rural electrification program in 1964 and in the
13-year period 1964-76 it extended electricity to about 7,000 homes and, in
addition, about 4,700 families received interest-free loans for initial home
wiring. BLPC estimates that approximately BDS$ 100,000 per year will be
needed in the future for rural electrification. Service is now provided to
about 80% of rural households in Barbados.
Regulation
1.09      The Public Utilities Board (PUB), established by the Public Uti-
lities Act of 1955, has jurisdiction over rate-making, adequacy of service,
and the issuance of securities for the telephone and power utilities in the
country. All decisions or orders of the Board are subject to review on appeal
on points of law to a judge of the High Court of Barbados. The PUB consists
of five citizens appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Consumer
Affairs to serve three year terms. In addition, during a particular rate
hearing, the Minister may appoint two assessors to the Board, one selected in
consultation with the utility and one to represent the users of the utility
concerned 2/. The Board may engage technical experts to advise it; all Board
1/   The only other significant electric power supply in Barbados is about
13 MW of bagasse-fueled steam capacity in nine sugar factories, which
generated about 17 GWh for their own use in 1979.
2/   These two assessors have all the powers and functions of a member of the
Board except that of voting in decisions taken by the Board.

expenses, including the salaries of its members, are paid by the regulated
utility.
1.10      Electricity rates are proposed by BLPC and approved or modified by
the PUB through a process of public hearings modelled on US rate-making
procedures. The utility must give the PUB 60 days notice before putting a new
rate into effect. During this period, the PUB has the option of suspending
operation of the proposed rate for a maximum of six months beyond the proposed
effective date, during which time a hearing must be held. The PUB may authorize
temporary rates during suspension, but the utility is entitled to recover any
shortfall that occurs during the period if PUB's final decision authorizes
higher rates. The PUB does not claim to be a policy-setting body but it
attempts to arrive at balanced decisions on the basis of information presented
to it by the public and by BLPC. It also takes into consideration policies
adopted by US commissions. In addition to its assessors and advisors described
above (para 1.09), the PUB also relies on public objectors and the Government,
through the Attorney General, to interrogate company staff during rate hearings.
1.11      The last rate application, filed by BLPC in April 1979, was for a
3.2 BDV/kWh rate increase to take effect as of July 1979. The rates were sus-
pended by PUB and a temporary increase of 1.0 BDJ/kWh was granted while public
hearings were held. The Board fixed new rates in December 1979 which effectively
granted BLPC a further increase of 0.1 BDJ/kWh. BLPC requested a review of this
decision on the basis that it would put the Company in a critical financial posi-
tion and not allow it to obtain financing for its capital expansion program. In
May 1980 the PUB, revising its December decision, awarded BLPC a further tariff
increase of 1.85 BD4/kWh and surcharges totaling 2.66 BD#/kWh to run from
June 1980-May 1981 to compensate for regulatory lag. One of the objectors
appealed this decision. The Chief Justice presided over the appeal hearing
in the Supreme Court and in his judgement dismissed the appeal and confirmed
the rates set by the PUB.
1.12      These recent rate hearings lasted for 37 sitting days and cost
BD$ 390,000 (0.14 BDJ per kWh of 1979 sales), excluding BLPC staff time and the
cost of the subsequent review process. The elapsed time from the filing of
rates until the final decision was one year. Among the reasons for this are:
(i) the failure of the PUB to appoint experts to examine BLPC's opera-
tions and finances prior to the hearings (para. 1.09);
(ii) the fact that public objectors at the rate hearings, though required
to submit written objections to the rates, were allowed to roam at
will over the mass of data provided by BLPC and ask questions un-
related to the nature of their objections; and
(iii) the fact that most Board members have full time jobs and board
meetings have to be scheduled to meet this constraint.
1.13      With the purpose of streamlining subsequent rate reviews, the Govern-
ment has hired consultants to undertake a study of the PUB's operating
procedures. The consultants' report would be submitted to the PUB and the
Government and discussed with the Bank. The recommendations of the study



- 5 -
will be used to improve current regulatory procedures. A second study will be
made of criteria for determining power rates in Barbados. The conclusions of
the report could be used by the PUB to prescribe regulations for determining
tariffs, as provided for in the Public Utilities Act. These studies form
part of the project proposed for Bank financing (para 4.13). The PUB operat-
ing procedures study report is expected by April 1981.
Tariff Structure
1.14      The December 1979 PUB rate decision involved a change from the
declining block structure employed in the past to one in which commercial and
industrial customers pay a flat rate per kWh consumed and a charge related to
kW demand or installed transformer capacity. Domestic customers now pay
more per kWh the higher their consumption (see Annex 1.1). The proposed
project includes a marginal cost tariff study that will assess the adequacy of
the current structure and provide a basis for future changes in it, taking
into account BLPC's financial requirements and issues relating to subsidies
that may be socially desirable (para 4.13).
Sector Development
1.15      Presently 91% of primary energy and 100% of public sector elec-
tricity are supplied by petroleum products; consequently, serious constraints
could arise in the future if world-wide oil prices continue to increase.
Although the Government is encouraging continued development and utilization
of domestic crude oil and natural gas, as well as use of renewable energy
resources, the country must depend on imports for about 80% of its energy
supply in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the proposed Bank project
includes financing for studies to investigate long-range power generation and
fuel options, and electricity conservation methods (para 4.13).

2. THE BORROWER
General
2.01      The borrower would be The Barbados Light and Power Company Limited
(BLPC), which was incorporated on May 6th, 1955 to acquire from the Barbados
Electric Supply Corporation Limited, under an agreement dated March 19, 1955,
the latter's rights to supply electricity throughout the Island of Barbados.
On July 1, 1955, all the assets of the Corporation were transferred to the
Company. The existing non-exclusive franchise is embodied in the Electric
Light and Power Act of Barbados and remains in effect up to and including the
1st day of August 1986.
2.02      Prior to June 1977, 66.7% of BLPC's ordinary shares were held by
Canadian International Power Co. (C.I. Power), which, in turn, was 50% owned
by the Baldwin-United Corporation (Ohio). In June 1977, C.I. Power was liquid-
ated and its assets distributed to the shareholders, with the BLPC shares being
transferred to a liquidating trust administered by Power Consultants Interna-
tional (PCI, Delaware), a wholly owned subsidiary of Baldwin-United. BLPC's
ordinary shares are presently (November 10, 1980) held as follows (par value
BD$ 5 each): 1/
Shareholders                        Shareholding

C.I. Power Liquidating Trust                  2,883    66.7
Other overseas                                  100      2.3
Government (through the National
Insurance Corporation)                        300     7.0
Other local                                   1,038    24.0
Total                                    4,321   100.0
BLPC plans to offer for sale to nationals or residents of Barbados one million
ordinary shares in late 1980, in conjunction with the sale, on the local
market, of half a million shares currently held by C.I. Power. Government has
indicated its willingness to purchase a portion of the combined sale. Local
ownership of BLPC will increase to 53% from the current 31%. A further offer
of one million ordinary shares would be made by December 31, 1983 to nationals
or residents of Barbados, increasing local ownership to 61%. Government has
agreed to purchase any unsold portions of these issues.
Organization, Management and Staff
2.03      BLPC is an efficient and well organized company with competent manage-
ment and technical personnel. It is governed by a Board of Directors composed
of 12 members, one of whom is the Managing Director. Government, industry,
the private sector and the principal shareholder are represented on the board.
1/   Authorized capital is ten million shares, in addition, 600,000 prefer-
ence shares have been issued. Preference shareholders have voting
rights only when their dividend is withheld.

The Managing Director has four officers who report directly to him and are
responsible for the four principal activities (commercial, technical, financial
and data processing) of the company's operations (see Chart 2.1). BLPC's
total staff numbers 428 and it has been able to maintain motivated and compe-
tent personnel at all levels. The size of the staff is adequate in relation
to BLPC's operating requirements. The customers per employee ratio of 154
(1979) is second only to Colombia's 160 (sector average) for seventeen coun-
tries in the Latin American and Caribbean region for which data is available.
The high customer/employee ratio is due, in part, to the fact that BLPC's
procurement and system planning services are provided by C.I. Power Services
Ltd. In addition, BLPC receives management consulting services from PCI (para
2.02). Construction and erection of facilities is normally carried out by
BLPC staff, except for major works such as new power plants or transmission
lines, where local or foreign contractors are employed.
Existing Facilities
2.04      The existing (1980) BLPC generation system consists of 16 small
diesels which total 38 MW, two steam units of 20 MW each and one 18 MW gas
turbine for a total capability, based on peak ratings, of about 96 MW. The
1980 estimated peak load is 56 MW with a load factor of 69%.   The system has
a very high reserve margin of 71%. However, because of the present undesirable
unit size mix, firm capacity is only 56 MW. 1/
2.05      The present transmission system includes nine 24 kV/ll kV substations
with a total capacity of 61.8 MVA. The substations are interconnected by
approximately 53 km of 24 kV overhead line and 5 km of 24 kV underground cable.
The BLPC distribution system consists of about 1,250 circuit km of overhead
and 100 km of underground 11 kV primary distribution feeders, 85,000 kVA of
distribution transformer capacity and 1,060 circuit km of 230 V secondary
lines. Distribution voltage is 115/200 V three phase and 115/230 V single
phase. There are 12.3 MVAR of fixed and switched capacitors connected and the
system power factor is about 0.91 during the evening peak. The present
number of meters is about 60,500 single phase and 6,500 three phase serving
approximately 67,000 customers and a peak substation load of 53,000 kVA.
Also, about 9,700 street lights are owned and maintained by the company. The
system frequency is 50 Hz.
2.06      The average total system energy loss is about 9% of net generation,
consisting of the following: transmission 1.0%, primary distribution 3.2%,
secondary distribution 3.9% and unaccounted for 0.9%. Design and construc-
tion standards used for transmission and distribution system expansion are
in accordance with accepted utility practice, including economic conductor
sizing, power factor correction and transformer loading.
1/   Reserve margin is the difference between system capacity and system
peak load. Firm capacity is defined here as system capacity less the
two largest units.



Training
2.07      BLPC uses on-the-job training supplemented by classroom instruction
to develop and maintain a cadre of skilled technicians and managers. Presently
there are about six apprentices and twelve trainees in the program. This has
proven satisfactory in the past. However, the company is now establishing a
formal training program to meet the increasing personnel requirements of the
expanding system. The new training division will consist of a training coordi-
nator and two training supervisors who will administer a company-wide training
and safety program and report to the Personnel Adviser. On-the-job and
classroom training will be supplemented by appropriate overseas programs and
courses, mostly in Canada, the US and the UK for basic professional-level and
skilled technicians. Given the size of the company, the number of employees
and past performance, the training program is considered adequate. When new
equipment is installed, such as the low speed diesels and the 69 kV transmis-
sion line, contractors' training will be included at both the manufacturers'
facilities and the construction sites.
Accounting and Audit
2.08      BLPC's accounting and data processing systems are good.  Monthly
financial and operations reports are produced promptly and are reviewed by
management and BLPC's management consultants. In addition, the company has a
comprehensive computerized financial forecasting model to assist in analyzing
its future resource requirements. The data processing department is progres-
sively computerizing various aspects of operations such as maintenance schedules.
BLPC's annual statements are audited by an independent firm (Coopers and
Lybrand) acceptable to the Bank. BLPC has agreed to continue appointing
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and to send to the Bank the
audited financial statements together with the auditor's report within four
months from the end of each fiscal year.
Insurance
2.09      BLPC is insured against most common risks such as fire, accident,
hurricane damage and civil liability, in accordance with public utility
practice. Major works under construction are insured by contractor's all-
risk type policies and the Bank-financed project would have similar coverage.
BLPC has agreed to review its insurance coverage and to discuss the results of
this review with the Bank by December 31, 1981.

3. THE MARKET
Load Forecast
3.01      BLPC develops its market forecast on the basis of an analysis of
historical trends and knowledge of major projects that will have an impact on
electricity demand over the medium-term future. The market forecast presented
here is based on BLPC's December 1979 forecast and adjusted to take into
account actual results in January-May 1980 and the effects of expected increases
in the price of electricity.
3.02      Historical development of the power market from 1965 to 1979 can be               &
characterized by four different periods:
(a) 1965-69, when the growth rate in kWh sales averaged 18.8% per year;
(b) 1969-73, when the average growth rate was 13.1% per year;
(c) 1974, when sales declined 5.4% in response to a 33% increase in the
real average price of electricity (85% in current terms); and
(d) 1974-79, when sales grew at an average rate of 9.1% per year.
Growth rates in 1977, 1978 and 1979 have been 11.6%, 9.4% and 11.8%, respec-
tively, but growth is expected to slow somewhat to 7.6% in 1980-85 as the
average real price of electricity rises from 18.6 BD/kWh in 1979 to an esti-
mated 27 BDJ/kWh in 1985 (1979 prices) as a result of the estimated 3% p.a. rise
in the price of oil, upon which all BLPC generation is based (see Table 5.1).
This contrasts with the fall in the real price that has occurred since 1974,
when it was 23.9 BD4/kWh (1979 prices).
3.03      The projected evolution of sales by tariff category is as follows:
1979               1985                 1979/85

1/   General service tariff applies to non-domestic customers at low tension.
Secondary power is low tension single or three phase supply with a demand
meter. Large power is for supply at 3.3 kV and 11.0 kV. BLPC employees
have a special low tariff.
Table 3.1 shows actual and forecast sales and peak demand.

Capacity and Energy Balance
3.04      Table 3.2 gives BLPC's historical and projected energy and capacity
balances for the years 1978-85. Firm capacity has been defined here as
total capacity less the two largest units, which are the 20 MW steam units.
This definition is used since the planned annual maintenance outage time for
each steam unit is 5 weeks and forced outages have averaged 2-1/2 weeks per
year. Hence there are significant periods of time during which the system
effective capacity is reduced by the amount of one steam unit. Under these
conditions the system should be able to cope with the failure of the second
steam unit since, unlike most mainland systems, there is no adjacent power
system to provide back-up capacity (see para. 4.07).
3.05      Peak demand is estimated to exceed firm capacity in 1980 and 1981,
while commissioning of a first 14 MW low speed diesel unit in late 1982 and
a second unit in early 1983, in accordance with the least cost expansion
program (see para. 6.01) will bring firm capacity back above peak demand.
Late 1982 is the earliest date at which the new base load plant can be
installed; extra capacity could be provided in the interim by high speed
diesel generators, which have a shorter order lead time.  However, it is
estimated that the cost of this alternative is greater than the benefit
of the increased reliability it would provide.  BLPC's approch to the situa-
tion has been to order a second turbine for the gas turbine generator (thus
reducing the forced outage time for that unit), to advise those customers
that need incrased reliability to install standby plant (i.e. to increase
reliability selectively) and, when necessary, to shed load selectively.
3.06      The ratio between installed capacity and peak demand is projected to
fall from 1.69 in 1980 to 1.62 in 1984, at which time installation of another
base load unit will be required to bring firm capacity above peak demand. The
precise nature and timing of this plant is to be determined during a generation
expansion study to be carried out as part of the proposed project (para 4.13).
The rather high level of excess capacity in the system results from the fact
that the two 20 MW steam units are large in relation to system peak demand.
Annex 3.1 shows BLPC fuel requirements in 1980-86 derived from the sales
forecast presented here.

4. THE EXPANSION PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Program Background and Objectives
4.01      The relatively strong economic growth of Barbados during the past
years has produced proportional rapid increases in the demand for electricity;
growth in demand is projected at 7.6% p.a. during 1980-1985 (para. 3.03).
4.02      BLPC's generation, transmission and distribution systems must be
expanded and improved to serve this growing market while improving the present
quality of service.  The principal objectives of the 1980-1985 capital invest-
ment program are:
(a)  Expansion of the existing generation, transmission and distribution
system to meet projected energy demands of existing and new customers
throughout the period;
(b)  improvement of the average system plant heat rate to reduce specific
fuel consumption and relative cost per kWh generated;
(c)  improvement of the transmission and distribution systems by utili-
zation of economic design to keep energy losses at a minimum
consistent with projected demand and fuel prices;
(d)  improvement of system operations by developing an energy conser-
vation program and developing long range generation and facilities
planning; and
(e)  maximize the use of indigenous energy resources such as gas and
bagasse.
1980-85 Investment Program
4.03      BLPC's 1980-85 Program of capital investments includes:
(a)  the generation expansion program comprising the installation of
two low-speed diesel units of 14 MW each (peaking capacity) in
1982/83, a third 14 MW unit in 1985 and commencement of work on a
fourth 14 MW unit to be completed in 1987 1/;
(b)  the construction of 15 km of 69 kV transmission lines;
(c)  the construction of two 69/24 kV substations, the acquisition
of one mobile substation, and modifications to existing 24 kV
substations;
(d)  the conversion of about 402 km of 11 kV primary feeders to 24 kV;
1/   Final decisions on the third and fourth low speed diesel units would
be dependent on the outcome of the generation expansion study (para.
4.13).



- 15 -
(e) the distribution expansion program including installation of about
60 MVA of distribution transformers, 23.8 MVAR of capacitors, 36,400
meters, 300 street lights and associated additions to the 240 V
secondary circuits; and
(f) improvements and additions to general property including transpor-
tation equipment, buildings, land and right of way.
The program was designed by BLPC and its consultant C.I. Power Services, based
upon an average annual load growth of 8% and selection of the least-cost
solution, considering viable alternatives (para 6.01).
4.04      The detailed investment costs of the 1980-1985 program are shown in
Table 4.1 and are summarized below:

The above estimates, prepared by BLPC and C.I. Power Services on the basis of
prices prevailing in 1979, include 8% physical contingencies and engineering
and administration costs. Generation and transmission costs are based on
the consultant's estimates. Distribution costs are based primarily on similar
work now in progress. The cost estimates are considered by the Bank to be
reasonable and the investment program is well balanced to adequately serve
projected loads to 1985. Allowances for price increases have been made
using the following annual percentages:

Generation
4.05      Since peak load is estimated to exceed firm capacity in 1980,
additional generation must be added as soon as possible (para. 3.04).
The criteria for adding generation capacity will be to:
(a) maintain firm capability above peak load;
(b) maintain existing system reliability; and
(c) reduce the reserve margin to about 40%. 1/
The generation expansion program selected (para. 4.03) is considered accept-
able by Bank staff. BLPC issued bidding documents to manufacturers and,
consequently, received eight competitive bids on July 14, 1980. BLPC has
issued a letter of intent to sign a contract with Gotaverken Motor AB (Sweden)
for "turnkey" installation of two base load diesel units of about 14 MW
(peaking rating) with an option for two additional units. BLPC has agreed to
sign a contract satisfactory to the Bank for delivery and erection of these
units as a condition of loan effectiveness. This base load plant does not
form part of the project proposed for Bank financing (para 4.08).  While base
load diesels will serve BLPC's immediate needs, a long-range generation plan
(1985-2005) is needed to determine the size and type of plants required to
best satisfy the increasing energy demand. The proposed project includes an
engineering study to assist BLPC in development of such plan (para. 4.09).
Transmission and Distribution
4.06      BLPC concluded from system studies conducted as early as 1973 that
its 24 kV transmission line voltage would be unable to cope with long-term
future requirements beyond 1983. This decision has been confirmed by recent
load flow and system stability studies. In 1973/74, a higher transmission
line voltage of 69 kV was selected, thus marking 24 kV to become the primary
feeder voltage. Consequently, to facilitate conversion to 69 kV, the Spring
Garden steam plant (2 x 20 MW), which was completed in 1976, incorporated
dual-voltage step-up transfomers, 24 kV or 69 kV, and a 69 kV substation
design. BLPC presented the Bank with the least-cost program for expansion of
the existing system to the year 1998. The least-cost solution is to convert
the system to 69 kV transmission and 24 kV primary distribution (paras. 6.02,
6.03). Conversion will be scheduled over the years in accordance with economic
loading. During the 1980-85 program approximately 17% and 30% of the trans-
mission line and primary feeders, respectively, will be converted along with
the construction of two new 69 kV/24 kV substations at major load centers.
Project Origin
4.07      The Government requested Bank participation in financing BLPC's
future generating plant in September of 1978. BLPC, with the assistance of
consultants, had prepared a generation planning report covering the 10-year
1/   Because the two largest units total 40 MW, a 100 MW system peak (1987/88)
will be required before the reserve margin can be reduced to 40%.

period 1978-1987, which recommended commissioning an 18 MW gas turbine in 1980
and a 20 MW bunker C steam unit in 1982. The Bank requested BLPC to modify
some of the planning assumptions to include medium speed diesel units
using Bunker C fuel, as these units have been shown to be economic in several
other powaer systems of similar size in Central America and the Caribbean.
The Bank directed BLPC staff to several Central American and Caribbean countries
where the latter studied experience gained with other makes of diesel units and,
consequently, BLPC developed representative operating and cost data, for both
low and medium speed diesels, which was used in subsequent revised generation
expansion studies utilizing the General Electric Optimized Generation Planning
(OGP) program. The OGP computerized program combines system reliability,
operation, maintenance and investment costs to determine the least-cost
expansion program based on a target loss-of-load probability (LOLP). Sensi-
tivity studies included variations in fuel costs, load growth, maintenance
costs and unit reliability. The revised generation expansion program 1980-86,
which was developed following the August 1979 preappraisal mission based on
the results of the OGP study and considering system firm capacity requirements,
consisted of the following additions: 11 MW of high speed diesels (5 units)
in 1981, two 14 MW low speed diesels in 1982/83 and a third 14 MW unit in 1985.
Subsequent analysis by BLPC of the need for the high speed diesels (peaking
plant) resulted in their being eliminated from the program (para. 3.05).
4.08      After the November 1979 appraisal mission BLPC received attractive
offers for suppliers credit from a number of manufacturers to furnish and
erect the proposed low-speed diesel plant. At BLPC's request, the Bank
changed its proposed project content from generation to distribution as this
will have the greatest impact on easing the company's financial constraints.
The Project
4.09      The project proposed for Bank financing consists of the 1981-84 part
of the 1980-85 development program for distribution, excluding ongoing works.
The project would also include a generation expansion study, an energy conser-
vation study, a study of PUB operating procedures, and studies of criteria
for determining power tariff levels and structure. Bank participation
has had a significant impact on attracting other sources of finance for the
1980-85 program. The Bank project would consist of those components of the
distribution sector not readily identifiable as individual projects and for
which BLPC is unable to obtain a'ternate financing on reasonable terms.
These components are, essentially, the 24 kV primary distribution feeders,
distribution transformers, capacitors, service connections and studies.
The works and studies are described below (detailed costs appear in Table 4.2):
(a) 24 kV Primary Feeders. Conversion of about 312 km of 11 kV primary
feeders to 24 kV and replacement of about 21,200 kVA of existing
industrial transformers associated with the conversion.
(b) Distribution Transformers. Installation of about 42,300 kVA of
24 kV/120-240 V distribution transformers.
(c) Service Drops. Installation of about 16,500 customer service connec-
tions consisting of about 450 km of 120-240 V conductors from the
secondary pole line to the customers' meters.



- 18 -
(d)  Capacitors.  Installation of about 16.5 MVAR of capacitors to main-
tain a system power factor of 0.90.
(e) Studies. Consulting services for generation planning, energy
conservation and tariffs (60 staff months), and for PUB operating
procedures and PUB criteria for setting power rates (15 staff
months).
Project Cost Estimate
4.10      The proposed project's estimated cost is BD$16.0 million, of which
BD$12.1 million (76%) is expected to be in foreign exchange. The table below
summarizes the estimated cost of the project and detailed costs appear in
Table 4.2.

The base costs were estimated by BLPC and its consultant on the basis of prices
prevailing in early 1979 and found to be reasonable by the Bank. Engineering
and administration costs for the project are included in the base estimates.
An 8% physical contingency has been added to both foreign and local base
costs, which include installation and erection. The studies to be performed
as part of the project would require about 75 staff-months of consultants
services and have an estimated total cost of BD$1.7 million.   The average
staff-month cost, including salary, costs, fees, international travel and
subsistence, is US$11,500.   Allowances for price increases have been
incorporated in the cost estimate using the same annual percentage as for
the investment program (para. 4.04). Imported materials required for the
expansion and operation of the power system, excluding fuel, are exempt from
customs duty.

Local costs would be financed by BLPC.
Project Implementation
4.12       BLPC's staff will supervise engineering designs and specifications
for equipment and works which would be prepared by consultants acceptable to
the Bank. BLPC's staff, assisted by the consultant, would prepare bidding
documents, evaluate bids and award contracts for procurement of project items.
Equipment installation would be performed by BLPC's own forces who have
extensive experience in 24 kV wood pole line construction and the installation
of distribution transformers, capacitors and customer service connections.
Studies will be performed by consultants with qualifications, terms of refer-
ence and under contracts satisfactory to the Bank. The project implementation
schedule envisages completion by December 31, 1984. The detailed schedule
shown in Table 4.3 would be used to monitor progress during the project
period.
Studies
4.13       The proposed project includes the services of consultants, who will
be engaged by BLPC and Government under terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank to assist in the following studies:
(a) Generation Planning: BLPC, with rapid load growth and increasing
energy costs, needs to develop a long-range generation plan to
assure least cost expansion of the system. The consultant will
render advice and recommendations to BLPC concerning the technical
and economic aspects of generation schemes, including utilization
of coal, and develop a generation expansion plan to the year 2005.
In addition, the consultant will study the use of system reliability
as a planning tool and the economic consequences of adopting
different levels of reliability. The consultant will be engaged to
complete the assignment not later than June 30, 1982.



- 20 -
(b)  Energy Conservation:  BLPC, which generates all of its energy by
burning oil as a primary fuel, needs to develop an energy conser-
vation program to assist the country in its goal to reduce depend-
ence on imported petroleum. The consultant will organize a survey
of BLPC's major customers to identify those areas in which efficiency
of energy use may be economically increased by actions taken either
by the customer or by BLPC. Included in such actions would be
changes in the tariff structure, so this part of the program would
be coordinated with the tariff study.  In addition, consideration
would be given to the energy efficiency of major customer appliances,
such as refrigerators, water heaters and air conditioners, with a
view to determining what kind of action, if any, is required
on the part of BLPC or the Government to induce more economical
forms of electric energy consumption (e.g. appliance labeling
programs, government import restrictions on energy-inefficient
appliances, etc.). In designing the conservation program maximum
use will be made of the experiences of other countries in this
field. The consultant will be engaged to complete the assignment
not later than March 31, 1982.
(c)  Tariff Structure:  A consultant will be hired to assist BLPC in
developing a tariff study based on long run marginal costs. The
study will assess the adequacy of the current tariff structure
taking into account practical aspects, such as metering costs,
BLPC's financial requirements and issues relating to subsidies
that may be socially desirable. The study will aim to provide
a basis for future changes in the tariff structure. The study
will be completed by March 31, 1982 (para. 1.14).
(d) Public Utilities Board operating procedures and criteria for
determining power rates: Consultants have been hired by Government
to study the manner in which the PUB currently carries out its
regulatory duties and to recommend ways in which its performance
could be improved, particularly with respect to speeding up the
current lengthy decision-making process. Their report will be
submitted to Government and discussed with the Bank. The study will
be completed by April 30, 1981. A second study will address the
question of what should be the criteria adopted by the PUB in
determining the level and structure of power tariffs in Barbados.
This study will be coordinated with the marginal cost tariff study
but will consist of a broader examination of concepts such as
rate-of-return on revalued assets, rate-of-return on shareholders'
equity and contribution to investment as criteria for determining
power tariff levels. The study will be completed by June 30, 1982.
Procurement
4.14      Procurement of goods and services, other than consultants' services,
to be financed by the Bank would be through international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Equipment which cannot be
grouped into packages of at least US$50,000 equivalent would be procured on
the basis of local competitive bidding acceptable to the Bank. A maximum of
US$250,000 in the aggregate would be procured in this manner. In the case
of ICB, domestic manufacturers tendering under international procedures would



- 21 -
receive a margin of preference of 15% of cost or the applicable customs duty,
whichever is lower. Regional preferences for other members of the Caribbean
Common Market (CARICOM) would be limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of non-
regional goods or the difference in the amount of tariffs payable by CARICOM
and non-CAPICOM suppliers, whichever is lower.
Disbursement
4.15      Disbursements from the loan account would be made for 100% of foreign
expenditures for imported equipment, materials and consultants' services and
100% of expenditures for consultant services required for the studies to be
carried out by the Government.  The following table shows estimated loan
disbursements, assuming loan effectiveness to be March 31, 1981.

The closing date would be June 30, 1985, six months after project completion
to allow for the payment of retentions.
Environment
4.16      BLPC has carried out previous projects with due regard to environ-
mental protection and would do so in this project. Line routes consist of
conversion of existing lines and have been selected to follow existing rights-
of-way adjacent to highways and roads so that land clearing and visual impact
is kept to a minimum. The new diesel power plant will be constructed adjacent
to an existing power generation facility.
Project Risks
4.17      The project faces no special risks.  The schedule assumed for the
project is reasonable and takes into consideration normal engineering, admin-
istrative and construction procedures. Possible hurricane damage presents
a risk to projects in Barbados. To minimize the associated technical risks,
the transmission system will be designed to withstand at least 120 mile per
hour winds and its cost has been estimated accordingly. To minimize the
financial risks, BLPC will be requested to review its insurance coverage
(para. 2.09).

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Financial History and Present Position
5.01      BLPC's recent financial history is characterized by a period of
heavy investment during 1973-76, during which the 40 MW Spring Garden steam
plant was installed and construction expenditures averaged BD$ 14 million
per year, and a period of relatively light investment, averaging BD$ 5 million
per year, during 1977-79. Investment requirements during 1980-86 will again
increase mainly as a result of the need for new base load plant. The financial
health of the company during the first half of the 1970s was good, with rates
of return on partially revalued assets of between 7% and 8% and earnings per
share of between 80 and 100 BDi (16% to 20% of par value, see Table 5.1). 1/
The existence of a fuel clause in the tariff schedule helped insulate the
company against the effects of the 1973-74 increase in oil prices, which drove
average fuel costs per kWh sold from 1.7 BDd in 1972 to 6.9 BDd in 1974 and
contributed to a 7% decline in sales in 1974. BLPC has agreed to maintain
this fuel clause in effect. An increase in the basic rates in March 1974
contributed 26 percentage points of the 85% increase in average revenue during
1973-74 and permitted increased self-financing of the steam plant. During
1973-76 BLPC's net internal cash generation averaged 39% of investment. 2/ By
1976 the rate of return had declined to 5.6%, mainly as a result of the
capitalization of the steam plant that year, and earnings per share were
beginning to fall.
5.02      As a result of declining real tariffs, the company's financial
performance was poor during the 1977-79 period. The rate-of-return declined
to about 5% while the net internal contribution to investment during 1977-79
was negative, at -6%. Revised rates submitted in December 1976 to the PUB for
approval resulted in an August 1977 PUB decision which offset increases in the
basic rate against the fuel cost savings made possible by the new steam plant.
Hence, though average fuel costs rose by 0.2 BDJ/kWh in 1977/78, the average
total tariff declined by 0.9 BDi/kWh (5%). The net result was that from 1974
to 1978, while the average fuel cost rose by a total of 10% and domestic
inflation totaled 50%, average BLPC revenue per kWh rose by only 12% and the
operating ratio rose from 84% to 89%.
5.03      The company's investment program was reduced during 1977-78 because
of the growing scarcity of internal funds and some postponement of distribution
investment occurred. BD$ 5 million in capital was raised in February 1978
through the sale of 500,000 redeemable preference shares and 500,000 ordinary
shares, of which the Government acquired 300,000 ordinary shares through the
National Insurance Board. In addition, BLPC's overdraft with the Royal Bank
1/   The exception being 1973, when the rate of return was 5.2% and earnings
per share about 55 BDJ .
2/   See Table 5.3 for a definition of this ratio.



- 26 -
overdraft with the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) rose steadily from BD$ 865
thousand at the end of 1974 to BD$ 17.3 million at the end of 1979. 1/ The
overdraft has, thus, functioned as long-term debt without an amortization
schedule.
5.04      By 1979 the Company's earnings and cash flow position had become
critical. Despite poor earnings the Company continued to pay dividends
on common stock at the rate of 8% of par value. During both 1978 and 1979
dividends were greater than net income and the company was faced with a
BS$ 200 million investment program in the 1980-85 period. In April 1979 BLPC
submitted for approval a rate increase that would have averaged 3.22 BDi/kWh
as of July 1, 1979.  After awarding an interim increase of BDd 1.0 effective
July 1979, the PUB subsequently (in December 1979) granted BLPC a total of
BD4 1.09/kWh as of July 1979. 2/ BLPC requested a review of this decision
and on May 16, 1980, the PUB revised its former decision and awarded BLPC a
further 1.85 BDV/kWh effective June 1, 1980, and additional surcharges totall-
ing 2.66 BDJ/kWh to be effective for one year from June 1, 1980 to compensate
BLPC for the effects of regulatory lag. 3/ The rate-of-return on fully revalued
assets in 1980 is estimated at 7.7%.
Assets and Revaluation
5.05      BLPC's assets were revalued in 1964, 1972 and 1977; the 1977
revaluation will be booked only in 1980. In determining what constitutes
a fair rate base for regulatory purposes the PUB has, in the past, adopted a
figure that lies between the historical and the revalued value of assets.
As a condition of the proposed loan BLPC has agreed to revalue its assets
annually, using the 1977 revaluation study as a basis and applying suitable
revaluation indices for subsequent years. The choice of the indices is to
be agreed upon by BLPC and the Bank. This annual revaluation will not be
reflected in the Company's financial statements but will be presented as
supplementary information to the audited accounts.
1/   The current interest rate is 8-1/2% on the first BS$ 6 million and
9-1/2% thereafter.
2/   An improvement was also made in the operation of the fuel clause that
reduced the lag between fuel price rises and cost recovery through
the fuel clause.
3/   The May 1980 PUB decision also accepted the principles of deferred taxes
and investment tax credit deferral.  Deferred taxes is a deduction from
operating income that sets aside funds for the future payment of in-
creased tax liabilities arising mainly from the fact that the company
is allowed to use accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, while in
its audited statements to the shareholders it uses straight line depre-
ciation. The investment tax credit, also a deduction from operating
income, has the purpose of spreading the benefit of the investment tax
credit over a 20 year period rather than realizing it in the year the
investment is made. The rate-of-return, being calculated on operating
income before these two deductions, is not affected by them. Cash
flow available for the investment program is increased, however.

1/   See Table 4.1
21/   See Table 5.3
5.07      BLPC agreed to achieve a minimum 6% rate-of-return on fully revalued
average net fixed assets in 1981 and 8% thereafter; Government agreed not to
interfere with this commitment. With this level of earnings, the company will
be able to finance 38% of its 1980-85 investment program and working capital
from internal sources of funds. In addition, 4% of the resources would come
from the sale of shares in 1980 and 1983, while 58% of the investment would be
financed by suppliers credits and by loans, including the proposed loan.
5.08      Annex 5.2 gives the terms of BLPC's existing and future loans.
Annex 5.3 is BLPC's projected 1980-85 debt statement. BLPC would bear the
foreign exchange risk on all loans, including the Bank loan. The status
of the BD$ 140 million in loans required over the six year period is given
below:
(a) BD$ 12.0 million (US$6 million): proposed IBRD loan to finance
distribution works an studies (see Chapter 4).



- 28 -
(b)  BD$ 12.0 million (US$6 million):  CDB loan to finance the 72 kV
transmission line from Spring Garden to Port and Wotton substa-
tions. CDB appraised their project jointly with Bank appraisal
of BLPC's operations and expect to present it to their Board
of Directors in early 1981.
(c)  BD$ 23.5 million (LSTG 5.0 million):  CDC loan to finance distribu-
tion and other works. Loan approval is expected in early 1981.
(d)  BD$ 14.3 million (5.0 million Units of Account):  EIB loan to finance
substations and supervisory control equipment. EIB appraised their
project jointly with the Bank and have already negotiated the loan
with BLPC. Loan presentation and effectiveness are expected in the
fourth quarter of 1980.
(e)  BD$ 37.0 million:  suppliers credits to finance 85% of the foreign
exchange cost of low speed diesel generating units I and 2. BLPC
has received bids from eight manufacturers for these units, including
financing proposals at favorable terms. In order to ensure their
timely delivery, the signing of a contract for the units has been
made a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. 1/
(f)  BD$ 29.5 million:  suppliers credits for generation plant subsequent
to the first two low speed diesel units. This plant will be required
only in 1985 and financing is not currently being arranged (see para.
5.06).
(g)  BD$ 11.8 million in other local loans:  BD$ 7.8 million of this repre-
sents part of a BD$ 12.0 million loan from the Royal Bank of Canada
(RBC) which will be used to convert a portion of BLPC's overdraft
into long term debt. The remaining BD$ 4.2 million will refinance
RBC's existing outstanding long term loan to BLPC. This loan
has been obtained. The remaining BD$ 4.0 million will be required
in 1981. This loan has not yet been obtained. BLPC agreed to
provide the Bank with a firm financing plan for 1981 prior to
loan effectiveness. 1/
5.09      BLPC is currently arranging the issue of 1,000,000 new shares of par
value BD$ 5, in late 1980, of which the National Insurance Board is expected
to purchase a portion; the balance would be sold to local investors (para.
2.02). The financing plan calls for the sale of a further BD$ 5.0 million
worth of shares in 1983. Given BLPC's consistent history of dividend payment,
it is expected that these issues will be fully subscribed.
5.10      Given the substantial amounts of financing required to enable BLPC
to carry out its capital program, the company agreed, as a condition of
loan effectiveness, to have completed the sale of BD$ 5 million worth of
shares; in addition, prior to effectiveness of the proposed loan the CDB, CDC,
EIB and RBC loans should have been approved by their respective boards of
directors, or alternative financing arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
should have been made by BLPC.
1/    In November 1980, BLPC was negotiating a loan of US$26.6 million to
finance low speed diesel units 1 and 2. The local loan was also
under negotiation.



- 29 -
Future Financial Performance
5.11      The financial projections (Tables 5.1 to 5.4) indicate that BLPC
will earn a 7% rate-of-return on fully revalued net fixed assets in 1981;
achievement of an 8% rate-of-return thereafter, would permit BLPC to finance
about 38% of its investment over the 1980-85 period from internal funds while
maintaining its dividend pay out rate of 8%. In addition, BLPC's liquidity
would be increased by reducing the overdraft and increasing cash reserves.
Cash plus the undrawn portion of the overdraft facility would increase to 5%
of fuel and operating expenses in 1981 and to 9% thereafter. BLPC's overdraft
would be reduced from BD$ 17.3 million at the end of 1979 to BD$ 2.7 million
by the end of 1982 both as a result of the conversion of BD$ 7.8 million into
long term debt in 1980 (para. 5.08(g)) and as a result of increased cash flow.
The overdraft facility, which will have a limit of BD$ 10 million after the
1980 refinancing operation, would then be able to serve its intended function
of providing the company with a cash reserve, rather than, as has been the
case in the recent past, as a substitute for long term debt. The current
ratio would rise from 0.7 in 1979 to 2.1 in 1983 (Table 5.1). The debt
service coverage ratio would rise from a low of 1.3 in 1978 and 1979 to
an average of 2.0 in 1980-85, while the debt/equity ratio would be 28%/72% in
1985, giving the Company a wide margin for future borrowings.
5.12      The 1980 end of year average basic tariff, including the surcharge
of 1.88 BDi/kWh currently being applied during June 1, 1980 to May 31, 1981
to compensate BLPC for the effects of regulatory lag (para. 5.04), is estimated
at 15.68 BD4/kWh. 1/ It is estimated that no further tariff increase would be
required for BLPC to earn a 7% rate-of-return in 1981. The following increases
in the basic tariff would be required in subsequent years for BLPC to earn an
8% rate-of-return (increases effective January 1):
1981    1982      1983      1984      1985
BDi/kWh                 -        2.7       1.8      3.0       2.0
% of basic tariff       -       19       11        16         9
The net effect of the basic tariff increases and the forecast 3% p.a. rise
in the real price of oil would be to increase average total revenue per
kilowatthour, in constant 1979 prices, from 23 BDJ/kWh in 1980 to 27 BDJ/kWh
in 1985 (see Table 5.1). 2/
1/   A surcharge of 0.78 BDq/kWh is also being applied to the fuel clause
component to compensate BLPC for under-recovery on this component.
It is assumed for the financial forecast that the fuel clause will
continue to recover the full increases in fuel costs.
3/   This excludes the effects on BLPC's fuel costs of any substitution of
oil by natural gas or bagasse (paras. 1.04, 1.06).



- 30 -
5.13      Other covenants of the proposed loan agreement relating to the
financial aspects of BLPC's operations are:
(a) BLPC will obtain the Bank's agreement before incurring further
long term debt if its projected debt service coverage ratio falls
below 1.5;
(b) BLPC will obtain the Bank's agreement before raising its overdraft
limit above BD$ 10 million (para. 5.11);
(c) BLPC will maintain its end-of-year cash reserves, including the
undrawn portion of its overdraft facility and any sums reimbursible
by a financial institution, at 5% of fuel and cash operating expenses
in 1981, and at 9% thereafter (para. 5.11);
(d) Prior to undertaking any major investment (greater than US$1 million)
not included in the investment program agreed upon during appraisal,
BLPC will provide the Bank with evidence that such investment is
technically, economically and financially justifiable; justification
for additional generating plant will be provided by the generation
planning study which is part of the Project (para. 4.13);
(e) BLPC will issue one million ordinary shares by the effective date
of the proposed Loan and a further one million shares by 1983 for
purchase by residents and nationals of Barbados, with the aims of
increasing local ownership of the Company and of financing its
investment program. The Government agreed to purchase any
unsold portions of the issues (para. 2.02); and
(f) BLPC assured the Bank that payment of ordinary dividends will
not affect the execution of the investment program and that the
Company will obtain the Bank's agreement to any proposed altera-
tion to this policy. BLPC will review with the Bank, not later
than two months before the end of each fiscal year, its investment
program and proposed financing plan for the following fiscal year;
Performance Indicators and Reporting
5.14      A series of indicators of BLPC's expected operating and financial
performance is shown in Annex 5.4 and would be used to monitor the Company's
performance during project execution. BLPC will send to the Bank periodic
progress reports, a project completion report and such other reports as the
Bank may reasonably request.
1/   This excludes the effects on BLPC's fuel costs of any substitution of
oil by natural gas or bagasse (paras. 1.04, 1.06).

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solutions
6.01      Generation.  In order to verify the least cost solution for
generation expansion (para. 4.07), a comparison was carried out between:
(a) low-speed diesel units burning heavy oil;
i
(b) medium-speed diesel units burning heavy oil;
(c) extension of the existing steam plant burning heavy oil; and
(d) new coal-fired steam plant.
The coal-fired plant, in the required unit size range of 20 MfW or less, was
not considered economical. The relatively large investment costs for coal
unloading and handling facilities, additional transmission lines to a new
site at the north end of the island and cost of interim power supply during
the long construction period outweigh the lower energy cost of coal compared
to oil. However, coal fired units would be considered as an alternative in
the long-range generation expansion study where larger unit sizes would be
required. It was assumed that the proposed plant would be base loaded, as
the most economical plant in the system. For comparison, each plant would
have a firm capacity of 25.6 MW, producing 184 GWh per year starting in 1983.
Calculating the present worth of capital, operation and maintenance and fuel
costs, it was determined that the low-speed diesel power plant was the least-
cost solution for discount rates up to 14%. Actual BLPC fuel costs as of
January 1980 were used and escalated in real terms at 3% per year. Higher
fuel price increases, up to 6% p.a., would not change the above least-cost
solution. Diesel operation, maintenance, availability and capital costs were
based on estimates made by BLPC's consultant, who conducted a survey of 13
medium-speed and six low-speed diesel generation plants with an aggregated
installed capacity of 519 MW and 162 MW, respectively. Similar steam costs
were based upon BLPC's experience at its Spring Garden (2x20 MW) plant which
went into service in 1976. -
6.02       Transmission and Distribution.  Alternative considerations for
expansion of the existing 24 kV transmission and 11 kV primary distribution
systems were 138 kV, 69 kV,and 24 kV or 11 kV, respectively. 1/ The economic
analysis considered investment costs and costs of energy loss to determine
least cost solution by present worth. Operation and maintenance costs were
considered equal in each case. For the transmission system, 69 kV voltage was
selected as the base since the existing system was designed for conversion to
69 kV and the main transformers at the 40 MW Spring Garden power plant have an
output capability of either 24 kV or 69 kV. The transmission system invest-
ment program for both 138 kV and 69 kV was developed to 1998, a load factor
1/   BLPC had first considered 72 kV transmission and changed to the 69 kV
standard voltage during October 1980 as a result of discussions with
potential suppliers.

of 69% was used and costs of losses weje8galculated utilizing a loss factor
formula of Loss Factor = (Load Factor)       . 1/  Actual BLPC 1980 fuel costs
were used and escalated at 3% per year.   The study shows that 69 kV is the
least cost solution for discount rates up to 16% for the 1980-85 investment
program.
6.03      A detailed construction program to 1986 was developed to arrive
at investment costs to compare the 11 kV and 24 kV distribution schemes. Both
schemes incorporate the 69 kV transmission and substation voltage.  For the
24 kV scheme, it was assumed that no new 11 kV equipment would be purchased
and conversion to 24 kV would be carried out only when the loading of a
feeder or substation required it.  Economic justification of the 24 kV
conversion was based upon reduced fuel costs which result from less primary
feeder loss (I i) at the higher voltage.  In order to determine the differen-
tial energy cost for the two schemes, the average energy loss for the last 12
months for the existing 11 kV primary feeders was calculated. This loss,
3.2%, was then used to derive an estimate of energy savings when a fully
loaded feeder is converted to 24 kV. The cost comparison shows that the 24 kV
scheme is the least cost solution for discount rates up to 16%. A sensitivity
test which reduced the estimated energy savings for the 24 kV scheme by 50%
did not change the above least cost solution up to discount rates of 14%.
Investment Program Rate-of-Return
6.04      As the project consists of a certain portion of the 1980-85 invest-
ment program and its effects cannot be isolated from those of the other
components of the program, a rate-of-return was estimated for the program.
The cost and benefit streams related to the program are shown in Table 6.1.
The investment cost is that given in Table 4.1 with investment costs associated
with the fourth low speed diesel unit to be commissioned in 1987 excluded,
since it serves load growth only in 1987 and later. Fuel cost attributable
to the program is the growth in fuel cost in 1981-86, while benefits are taken
as the growth in sales during 1981-86, valued at the yearly average tariff as
given by the financial forecast of Chapter 5 (see Table 5.1). On an approxi-
mate basis, the system increase in capacity provided by the 1980-85 investment
program would be put to full use during the 1981-86 period.
6.05      The incremental investment program rate-of-return thus calculated
is 13.5%.  A sensitivity analysis shows the following: 2/
Rate-of-Return
Base case                                     13.5%
Benefits up by 10%                            16.3%
Benefits down by 10%                          10.4%
Investment costs up by 10%                    12.2%
1/   Loss factor is the ratio of average power loss to peak load power loss.
Cost of losses per kW of peak load loss is calculated as cost of losses=
annual hours x fuel cost x loss factor.
2/   Sensitivity analysis of variations in fuel cost was not carried out
since these variations would, in fact, be compensated by variations in
the average tariff. However, such variations could affect sales growth.



- 37 -
The rate of return is very sensitive to small variations in benefits as a
result of the significance of annual fuel costs in relation to investment
costs. The fact that the rate-of-return is of the same order of magnitude
as the estimated opportunity cost of capital in the Caribbean region (10%)
confirms the appropriateness of the tariff levels derived from the financial
analysis.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01.     During negotiations agreement was reached on the following principal
points:
Conditions of Loan Effectiveness
7.02 (a)  BLPC shall have signed a contract satisfactory to the Bank
for delivery of two base load diesel generators of about 14 MW
each (para. 4.05);
(b)  BLPC shall have presented to the Bank a satisfactory financing
plan for 1981 (para. 5.08(g)); and
(c)  BLPC shall have completed the sale of BD$ 5 million worth of
shares; loans from the Caribbean Development Bank, the Common-
wealth Development Corporation, the European Investment
Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada shall have been approved
or alternative financing arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
have been made (para. 5.10).
Loan Agreements
7.03 (a)  BLPC will review its insurance coverage and discuss the results
of this review with the Bank by December 31, 1981 (para. 2.09);
(b)  BLPC will undertake studies on generation expansion, electricity
conservation and tariffs under terms-of-reference acceptable to
the Bank; the studies would be reviewed with the Bank (para. 4.13);
(c)  The Government will undertake studies on Public Utilities Board
operating procedures and criteria for determining power rates and
discuss the results of these studies with the Bank (para. 4.13);
(d)  BLPC will maintain in operation at all times a fuel clause that
allows it to recover through tariffs variations in its fuel costs
caused by variations in the price of fuel; in addition, the fuel
clause will be adjusted periodically to allow for changes in gener-
ating plant mix so that BLPC does not experience any long-term
financial gain or loss through operation of the fuel clause
(para. 5.01);
(e)  BLPC will appoint independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank
and send to the Bank the audited financial statements, the auditor's
report and the auditor's review of the asset revaluation exercise
within four months from the end of each fiscal year (paras. 2.08
and 5.05);



- 40 -
(f) BLPC will maintain its earnings at a level sufficient to earn
a minimum rate-or-return on annually revalued average net fixed
assets of 6% in 1981 and 8% in 1982 and thereafter (para. 5.07);
(g) Government will not interfere with BLPC's commitment to earn a
minimum rate-of-return on annually revalued average net fixed
assets of 6% in 1981 and 8% thereafter (para. 5.07);
(h)  BLPC will obtain the Bank's agreement before incurring further
long term debt if its projected debt service coverage ratio falls
below 1.5 (para. 5.13(a)));
(i) BLPC will obtain the Bank's agreement before raising its over-
draft limit above BD$ 10 million (para. 5.13(b));
(j) BLPC will maintain its end of year cash reserves, including
the undrawn portion of its overdraft facility and any sums
reimbursible by a financial institution, at 5% of annual
fuel and cash operating expenses in 1981 and at 9% in 1982
and thereafter (para. 5.13(c));
(k) BLPC will not undertake any investment greater than US$1.0 million
and not included in the investment program agreed upon during ap-
praisal, without first providing the Bank with evidence that such
investment is technically, economically and financially justifiable.
Justification for additional generating plant will be provided
by the generation planning study which is part of the Project
(para. 5.13(d));
(1) BLPC will issue one million ordinary shares by the effective date
of the proposed Loan and a further one million shares by 1983 for
purchase by residents and nationals of Barbados. The Government
agreed to purchase any unsold portions of the issues (para. 5.13(e));
and
(m)  BLPC assured the Bank that payment of ordinary dividends will
not affect the execution of the investment program and that the
Company will obtain the Bank's agreement to any proposed alteration
to this policy.  BLPC will review with the Bank, not later than
two months before the end of each fiscal year, its investment
program and proposed financing plan for the following fiscal year
(para. 5.13(f)).
Recommendation
7.04      With the assurances listed above, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$6 million equivalent to the Barbados Light and Power
Company to be repaid over a period of 15 years including three years of grace.
