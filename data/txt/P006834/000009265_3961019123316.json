The main objective of the\n            project was to strengthen Caja, the primary financial\n            intermediary for agricultural credit in Colombia. Borrower\n            leadership of project preparation did not take place nor was\n            there active participation by the Government during project\n            implementation, especially when Caja was experiencing the\n            serious financial losses. Overall the outcome of this\n            project should be considered unsatisfactory. Some of the key\n            lessons learned from the project were: 1) Borrower ownership\n            and commitment is required for effective implementation and\n            sustainability of actions; 2) Stronger monitoring and\n            supervision on the part of the Bank can play a crucial role\n            in salvaging a project; 3) A Financial Intermediary is\n            unlikely to achieve its objectives on a technical assistance\n            project if it is not financial viable; 4) A more realistic\n            assessment of risks and external contributing factors is\n            required at project preparation; 5) Utilize the Mid-term\n            Review to ensure consensus on future implementation; and 6)\n            This project provided a good example of the problems\n            encountered with the sequencing of activities."}, "docdt": "1995-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
