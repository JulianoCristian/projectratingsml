reforms to upgrade and improve the\n            operational capacity of key public sector agencies.  The\n            project aims at strengthening Caja, the main financial\n            intermediary for agricultural credit in Colombia, thereby\n            helping to meet the rural sector's needs for financial\n            services in a more efficient manner.  The project will\n            comprise consultant services, training, office equipment and\n            civil works to assist Caja in defining and implementing\n            measures to improve operational efficiency, reduce its loan\n            portfolio arrears, improve credit procedures, enhance its\n            capacity to mobilize resources using market mechanisms,\n            improve its accounting and management information systems,\n            and rationalize and improve its branch network.  The main\n            project benefit is that Caja will become a more efficient,\n            competitive and self-sustaining financial intermediary."}, "docdt": "1988-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
