The\n            objectives of the project include:  (a) improving and\n            extending sewerage service to 70 percent of the population\n            of Istanbul by the end of 1994; (b) providing for\n            appropriate disposal of sewage to protect the waters and\n            shorelines of the Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus; and (c)\n            reducing unaccounted-for water.  Finally, the project hopes\n            to (d) strengthen ISKI's operation and maintenance and\n            industrial waste management capabilities.  To that end, the\n            project includes rehabilitation of parts of the water\n            distribution system; installation of a system for water\n            supply monitoring and control; and construction of sewage\n            collection and sewage treatment facilities.  A technical\n            assistance component of the project would provide advice and\n            training to strengthen ISKI institutionally."}, "docdt": "1987-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
