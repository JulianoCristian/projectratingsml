unsatisfactory, project sustainability was uncertain,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is\n            highly risky to attempt to compensate for past\n            under-investment in and neglect of water and sewerage\n            services by undertaking investment programs which are overly\n            ambitious in relation to the utility's proven\n            managerial and financial capabilities. Project appraisal\n            should make sure that required investments are adequately\n            staged and that Bank loans generally finance only those\n            investments that can be realistically implemented during the\n            grace period of the loan. The decision process regarding the\n            design and location of sewage treatment plants should\n            include early consultations with affected populations, and\n            all issues regarding site selection should be fully sorted\n            out before Board presentation; and mid-term reviews should\n            be held in a timely manner. In 1987, however, mid-term\n            reviews were not Bank requirement and one was not planned in\n            the initial project design. In September, 1994, however, a\n            mid-term review was carried out and assisted in\n            restructuring the project design. A timely mid-term review\n            could have assisted in addressing some of the major project\n            issues and project outcomes. At the time of project\n            preparation, mid-term reviews were not Bank requirements and\n            one was not planned in the initial project design."}, "docdt": "1998-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
