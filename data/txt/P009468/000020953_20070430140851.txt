Two separate ICRs have been prepared for the Fourth Fisheries Project (Report No:ICR000023) and the Aquatic
Biodiversity Conservation Project (Report No:ICR0000412). As the later project is fully blended with the former one in
terms of substance and implementation, these two ICRs have a common text with different Data Sheets.

F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project was to support sustainable growth in and equitable
distribution of the benefits generated from increased fish and shrimp production,



                                             ii

domestic consumption and exports. Growth of the sector was expected to help improve
livelihood of the poor dependent on fisheries. In addition, while not directly monitored
under the Project, the increased production was to have important nutritional and health
benefits, particularly for the poor. Fish contributes about 60% of animal protein in their
diet.

Five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were:

  - No. 01: Increasing production from inland open water fisheries by 100% by project
end;

  - No. 02: Increasing production of shrimp from project polders by project end;

  - No. 03: Increasing production from aquaculture by 50% by project end;

  - No. 04: At least 80% of project benefits were to accrue for beneficiaries from
moderately and extremely poor categories by end of project; and

  - No. 05: Establishing and sustaining a forum representing user-groups management
institutions in project oversight and decision-making by year 1.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

There has been no change in the original PDO. In March 2005, an additional objective of
the project was added to assist the Borrower in carrying out a program of rehabilitation
and reconstruction of the Government-owned fish farms in the areas affected by the
floods of 2004.

  In May 2004, KPIs were expanded from 5 to 9 to accurately reflect the scope, aims and
priorities of the project as they have evolved through the series of reviews and agreed
actions (see Annex 1). Major change was made for benefit distribution to the target
groups. It was reduced to 50% (original 80%).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

        The Bank's mission was to help Bangladesh reduce poverty by promoting rapid,
employment-creating economic growth and intervention to directly assist the poor. The goal was
clearly articulated in Bangladesh Rural Development Strategy and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) with respect to rural development. The CAS update aimed at accelerating
agricultural growth and rural development and strengthening linkages between agriculture and
non-agriculture development to address the needs of the poor. At the rural sector level, this goal
was to be achieved through faster rural and agricultural development.

        A large number of very poor people depend on fishing for nutrition and income. The
contribution of the sector to national food supply and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) needed to
be optimized in order to support economic growth and employment. At appraisal, the total
fisheries production was about 1.3 million tons, of which inland fisheries contributed almost 80%.
The sector accounted for about 10% of agricultural GDP, 3% of total GDP, 8% of total export
earning, 60% of animal protein intake, and 7% of total protein intake in the country. Almost 2
million and 12 million full-time and part-time fishermen were employed respectively.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

        The objective of the Project was to support sustainable growth in and equitable
distribution of the benefits generated from increased fish and shrimp production, domestic
consumption and exports. Growth of the sector was expected to help improve livelihood of the
poor dependent on fisheries. In addition, while not directly monitored under the Project, the
increased production was to have important nutritional and health benefits, particularly for the
poor. Fish contributes about 60% of animal protein in their diet.

      Five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were:

        KPI 1:       Increasing production from inland open water fisheries by 100% by project
                     end;
        KPI 2:       Increasing production of shrimp from project polders by project end;
        KPI 3:       Increasing production from aquaculture by 50% by project end;
        KPI 4:       At least 80% of project benefits were to accrue for beneficiaries from
                     moderately and extremely poor categories by end of project; and
        KPI 5:       Establishing and sustaining a forum representing user-groups management
                     institutions in project oversight and decision-making by year 1.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

        There has been no change in the original PDO. In March 2005, a new objective was
added to assist the Borrower in carrying out a program of rehabilitation and reconstruction of the
government-owned fish farms in the areas affected by the floods of 2004.




                                                   1

          In May 2004, KPIs were expanded from 5 to 9 to accurately reflect the scope, aims and
priorities of the project as they have evolved through the series of reviews and agreed actions (see
Annex 1). Major change was made for benefit distribution to the target groups. It was reduced to
50% (original 80%).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

          Overall, the original target groups are poor people dependent on fisheries resources. The
main beneficiaries and the primary target groups by component, as envisaged at appraisal (Re.
PAD, p 10, para C.3), are (a) for inland open water fisheries - poor traditional and occasional
fishers in rural poor households; and (b) for fresh water and shrimp aquaculture ­ small holder
fish and shrimp farmers and landless laborers getting employment (440,000 additional jobs to be
created per year), and very poor shrimp seed/fry collectors (mainly women, total 27,000 in
project area). The sub-component supporting shrimp fry collectors were dropped. Rural poor
families consuming fish were considered important but not quantifiable, and thus secondary
beneficiaries.

          The benefit distribution indicator was reduced, at a later stage in May 2004, from 80% to
50% for the project as a whole. The original KPI-4, suggesting 80% of benefits from increased
production in all project components were to accrue for the people from moderately or extremely
poor categories, was realistic for inland open water component only.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

          The Fourth Fisheries Project (FFP), including the GEF-funded Aquatic Biodiversity
Conservation component, was designed to be implemented over a 5-year period, with a total
cost of US$60.8 million at appraisal, of which GEF financing was US$5.0 million, IDA
financing US$28.0 million, DFID US$15.5 million, Government of Bangladesh (GOB) US$9.3
million, and Beneficiaries US$3.0 million. The project had originally five components, as
follows:

          Component 1- Inland Open-Water Fisheries Management (US$17.1M): This component
aimed at improving management of inland open-water fisheries by developing sustainable,
community-based institutions and supporting them in undertaking a program of adaptive
management of their fisheries resources. Proposed management measures included stocking,
restoration of habitat, establishment of fish sanctuaries, and construction of fish passes or a
combination of these options. Main activities to be accomplished by project-end were (a) 60,000
ha of open water bodies/floodplains stocked each year with fingerlings; (b) 8 fish-passes and 5
fish- friendly regulators built; (c) 10 fish habitats rehabilitated; and (d) 50 fish sanctuaries
established.

          Component 2 - Coastal Shrimp Aquaculture (US$8.5M): This component aimed at
establishing sustainable and equitable institutional arrangement for managing coastal polders1
and works to facilitate the development of environmentally friendly shrimp production. The main



1 Polder is an area encircled by earthen embankment with water control structures for drainage and flushing.


                                                         2

activities of this component included (a) Rehabilitation of 4 Third Fisheries Project (TFP) polders,
and (b) Development of a new polder for improved shrimp culture.

          Component 3 - Freshwater Aquaculture Extension and Training (US$5.7M): This
component included development and application of an appropriate extension strategy for fresh
water aquaculture and establishment of an institutional network. Specifically, this included (a)
extension strategy developed, documented, and approved by end of year 3; (b) Framework for
aquaculture support network prepared for 200 thanas/upazilas2 by year 2: (c) Coordinated
aquaculture extension programs involving network members developed, resourced and
implemented in 50 thanas by end of year 3, and a further 150 thanas by end of year 5 -- all to
sustain beyond project life; (d) improved aquaculture technology adopted by 35% of trained
farmers in 670 ha3 of demonstration pond in 200 thanas increasing productivity to 3 tons per ha
by end of project; and (e) At least 25% of project participants in pond aquaculture development
would be women.

          Component 4 - Aquatic Resources Development, Management, and Conservation Studies
(US$ 3.9M): The component aimed at assisting the Government in strengthening the basis for
aquatic resources policy development and fully blended with FFP. This was to be achieved
through studies of the key issues in aquatic resources development and management for the
conservation of hilsa4 fisheries, aquatic biodiversity and genetic diversity. Specific activities
were: (a) planned studies completed and documented by year 3; and (b) action plans to
mainstream biodiversity conservation into fisheries sector completed. Originally, 19 research
studies under three themes were envisaged: Hilsa Conservation (5), Aquatic Biodiversity
Conservation (10) and Genetic Diversity (4).

          Component 5 - Institutional Support: Manpower, Training and Equipment(US$25.8M):
This aimed at strengthening the capacity of Department of Fisheries (DOF) to manage and
support the fisheries sector, plan for its development and long-term sustainability, and implement
the national fisheries policy. Specific activities included: (a) Action Plan for the implementation
of the National Fisheries Policy completed and documented by year 1; (b) Assessment of
organizational and human resource capacity and needs of DOF completed by year 1; (c) Plan for
organizational and human resource development plan prepared and approved by year 2, and
implemented by year 3; and (d) Strategy and program for post-project development of the
fisheries sector prepared and approved by end of the project.

1.6 Revised Components

          In addition to the original components, a new component was included in 2005 for
rehabilitation of 31 fish farms affected by 2004 floods.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

          The implementation of the FFP in the initial years were difficult and slow due to various
reasons including slow transfer of jalmohals (Government-owned water bodies) for the open



2Thana has now been named as Upazila, a sub-district, the lowest level of Bangladesh Government administration.
3670 ha pond area was considered as demonstration area, while 7,000 ha was considered for economic analysis at
appraisal (see Annex 5, Table A.4/B.4)
4hilsa: Ilish Ilish, the most important salt/brackish water commercial fish species of Bangladesh.

water fisheries management, additional studies to address the social and environmental concerns
related to shrimp aquaculture, and lack of capacity within DOF for translating the national
fisheries policy into a strategy for implementation. Following slow progress and challenges
during the first few years of implementation, the overall project scope was scaled down at Mid-
Term Review (MTR) in June 2002 and subsequently in May 2004 with corresponding
cancellations of the IDA Credit including re-allocations among categories. The revisions at MTR
(June 2002) were the following:

          - Area for inland open water fisheries reduced from 60,000 ha to 22,700 ha;
          - Number of pilot fish-structures5 reduced from 13 to 6;
          - Number of fish habitat for restoration reduced from 10 to 7;
          - Development of a new shrimp polder was dropped due to time constraint; and
          - SDR 6.0 million cancelled from the IDA Credit and about US$1.3 million from GEF
            Grant.

Subsequent revisions in May 2004:

          - All pilot fish-structures dropped;
          - A new subcomponent on pilot livelihood initiatives for affected fishers included;
          - KPIs expanded from 5 to 9 (see para 6.3); and
          - Extension of IDA Credit closing date by one and half year up to June 30, 2006.

Second cancellation of SDR 1.5 million from IDA Credit was made, effective May 2, 2006 due to
further revision in the scope.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

          Project Development Objective was consistent with the CAS. In line with the CAS, the
development objective at appraisal was to reduce rural poverty by promoting agricultural growth
with special attention to assisting the poor directly. It addressed the issues of enhancing rural
development and natural resources management, and strengthening institutional capacity to
promote and sustain them. It was also consistent with the GOB's Rural Development Strategy.

          The Bank's diagnosis of the problems and the proposed technical solutions were
generally appropriate. The PAD is well written and clear, excepting the benefit distribution
aspects by component. Prior to this project, there were a number of project interventions in the
fisheries sector--the last being the TFP. The Bank was, therefore, well-equipped with a wealth of
experience in the sector, and incorporated the lessons gained from previous projects. This project
had community-based approach to fisheries development and the early involvement of the
stakeholders in the process. The involvement of NGOs, and the partnership with other bilateral
donors were also stressed.

         The quality at entry was deficient. With the benefits of hindsight, the quality at entry was
deficient due to (a) the complexity of the project--attributed to a combination of five related, but
very different components, which was very demanding on staffing and resources; (b) the lack of a
clear definition of one of the main outcomes regarding distribution of the project benefits for
various components; (c) the ambitious targets for the Inland Open Water Fisheries component,
with the optimistic assumptions that transfer of jalmohals6 will happen smoothly in the given
policy environment; (d) short time frame for complex biodiversity research and lack of capacity
within DOF to carry out GEF-funded studies; (e) ambitious target for institutional component to
implement the Human Resources Development (HRD) plan by project year 3; and (f) the
resultant difficulties and ambiguities surrounding the issue of floodplain stocking (see section
10.1).

         Target for benefit distribution was unrealistic. It was envisaged at appraisal that by
project-end at least 80% of the benefits resulting from increased production will go to the
beneficiaries from moderately and extremely poor categories, which was found to be unrealistic
to achieve during implementation. This 80% benefit distribution was specified for the whole
project, without breakdown by project components. While poverty targeting was applicable in
component, such as Inland Open Water Fisheries Management, it was unrealistic in others. For
example, the expected benefits distribution in the shrimp polders has been largely pre-determined
in terms of ownership of shrimp farms. Similarly, for the Aquaculture Component, owners of fish
ponds are, by default, not the very poor.

         Inland open water fisheries set an ambitious target. The target of the inland open water
fisheries component to increase productivity by 100% by project-end, and stock fingerlings in
60,000 ha of water bodies was unrealistic. During the early years of implementation, it was found
that:

     · transfer of jalmohals from the Ministry of Land, and establishment and strengthening of
         community organizations were difficult and required more time than previously
         anticipated;
     · even for the floodplains of TFP, selected in advance at appraisal, could not be stocked
         with fingerlings during second year of the project, due to delays in appointing NGOs, and
         changes made in the composition of Fisheries Management Committees (FMCs); and
     · project duration was short for a 3-year stocking cycle that allowed only two batches to
         run.

As a consequence, the area for stocking fingerlings was decreased from 60,000 ha to 22,700 ha
and the productivity target was reduced to 50%. While the revisions demonstrated a sense of
reality, it can be said fairly safely that the appraisal target was over-optimistic.

         Maximum stocking density of 10 kg/ha/year was interpreted as a fixed one in most
cases. While the PAD was clear about the modality of intervention in fingerlings stocking in
terms of water area, depth, and phases; and maximum stocking density and decision making,
experience has shown that this activity faced implementation difficulties. In reality, stocking was
made to the maximum of 10 kg/ha, regardless of whether it was necessary or not, before
communities were adequately organized. In some water bodies, stocking was not required. As the




6 jalmohals are Government-owned water bodies.


                                                     5

stocking density was set to the maximum, some communities were unable to pay for their co-
share.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

         Overall, the project implementation is rated moderately satisfactory. Delays with the
individual components became apparent during implementation to warrant changes in scope,
and extension of the project became necessary. With its effectiveness in late 1999, the project
went into implementation in early 2000, and was generally moving at a slow pace up to the
MTR. Implementation of the Freshwater Aquaculture Extension and Training component was
relatively smooth and effective from start to the end of the project. The studies on Aquatic
Biodiversity and Conservation, although had a late start due to delay by about two years in hiring
the consultants, caught up substantially towards the end and delivered the defined outputs.
Institutional Support component achieved satisfactory result towards the end of the project, albeit
with long delays early in the implementation process. Inland Open Water Fisheries, experienced
delays mainly due to longer time required to deal with the social aspect of community
organizations; and delays in transfer of jalmohals from the Ministry of Land. For the Shrimp
component, additional studies were required to address social and environmental concerns as
expressed by NGOs to DFID-HQ during implementation and was independently assessed before
civil works could be started. At the end, the findings of the study did not alter the program, which
was an extension of an earlier program supported under Third Fisheries Project (TFP). Other key
factors affecting the implementation are the following:

         Important implementation issues and solutions were identified in a timely manner,
except scaling down of benefit distribution indicator. Major changes took place at MTR in mid-
2002, and later in mid-2004. At MTR, the changes were mainly regarding the key output targets
with reduction in floodplains areas for fingerlings stocking, and by dropping the construction of
new shrimp polder altogether. However, the major outcome indicator of 80% benefits accruing to
the poor was only scaled down to 50% two years after the MTR. Although the distribution issue
was raised and discussed during the early years of project implementation, downward revision
was made during the later part in May 2004. The target should have been clarified and revised,
preferably by the MTR.

         Despite slow start, National Fisheries Strategy and Action Plans were prepared for the
fisheries sector. Implementation of the Institutional Support component showed a positive change
in implementation of the project. This component was rated unsatisfactory until late 2004, and
turned to moderately satisfactory towards project-end. Initial rating was due primarily to the slow
progress in translating the National Fisheries Policy (NFP) into a strategy. Following
recommendations at MTR, a Participatory Fisheries Planning Team (PFPT) was established in
2002 within DOF to review and define its core functions in the context of the NFP, and to design
a National Fisheries Strategy (NFS). The Strategy and Action Plans were very relevant and timely
for development of the fisheries sector. The DOF and the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock
(MOFL) showed strong commitment to and ownership of the outputs which, the ICR mission
believed, were the results of implementing this multi-component project. Most importantly, the
sector and the sub-sectors strategies were taken to the national planning process by incorporating
them into the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and to prepare the sector
Roadmap.




                                                 6

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

        Overall, the original design for M&E was rather weak, especially on the critical matter
of defining and measuring changes in poverty situation. As to how the critical poverty target (KPI
no.4: At least 80% of project benefits were to accrue for beneficiaries from moderately and
extremely poor categories by end of project.) would be achieved was neither thought out for the
fresh water and shrimp aquaculture components, nor were resources clearly allocated to identify
baselines and monitor on this indicator, including other M&E activities.

        M&E team however, showed resourcefulness in establishing baselines and
undertaking evaluation. Despite the weak design, the project M&E team showed considerable
resourcefulness during implementation in establishing in-depth socio-economic baselines and
undertaking evaluation for the three main components, such as inland open water, fresh water and
shrimp aquaculture. With small adjustments, the actual poverty indicators used were consistent
with others used in the country. Various catch assessment activities, which were not included
directly in M&E, but tried out, remained weak till the last year or so of project extension. This
means that final evaluation of open water production remains a difficult job. However, it can be
expected that the community-based catch reporting system, which was developed and made
operational in the last few years, will provide a useful foundation for future monitoring in project
areas, and perhaps serve as a model to be developed on a wider scale.

        M&E results were satisfactorily used to adjust the project design during
implementation. While it is difficult to assess their direct utilization, the M&E results
undoubtedly made a considerable contribution to project implementation. For example, support
for Community Based Organization (CBO) strengthening was increased to address the evaluation
findings indicating earlier weaknesses in terms of "elite capture" and apparent over-enthusiasm
for stocking under inland open water fishery management. Specific training on poverty targeting
was provided as targeting weaknesses were identified under evaluation of the Aquaculture
Extension component. This could not however correct the low number of poor targeted under
aquaculture extension. Overall, the considerable amount of objective and thorough M&E carried
out in close collaboration with DOF component teams has no doubt positively influenced their
learning and reflection, and their ownership of the project as a whole.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

        Procurement: Overall, the procurement procedures followed the Bank's guidelines with a
few flaws however. The overall procurement capacity of the DOF needs to be upgraded. In post-
review of sample contracts, a few cases of procedural flaws were found in National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) and National Shopping (NS) packages. The provision for NS should be at a
minimum with appropriate monitoring mechanisms. Post review of NCB contracts below the
Bank's prior review threshold were carried out on a half-yearly basis for the implementing
agencies (DOF and BWDB), to avoid procedural discrepancies and ensure efficient execution of
the procurement plan. Hiring of consultants to undertake the studies, under GEF-funding, took
about 21 months, which put everything behind the schedule and also disrupted the
implementation of other project components.

       Financing and Disbursement: Of the total IDA Credit of SDR 20.6 million (US$28.0
million equivalent), 58% was disbursed, 6% was undisbursed and 36% was cancelled with
downscaling. DFID provided US$15.5 million equivalent of co-financing, of which almost 100%
was disbursed. Out of the total GEF Grant of US$5.0 million, 66% was disbursed, 9%


                                                  7

undisbursed and 25% was cancelled with adjustment in the planned studies. As scope of the
project was scaled down at MTR, SDR 6.0 million was cancelled as of January 30, 2003 at the
borrower's request. There was also a second cancellation of SDR 1.5 million, effective May 2,
2006 due to downward revision of the scope. As of March 29, 2007, total IDA disbursement
amounted to SDR11.99 million (92%) of the revised total allocation of SDR13.10 million.

       Financial Audit: Overall, the financial management aspects have been handled generally
in a satisfactory manner. All financial statements that were received within the due dates were
audited. In all, the GOB auditors made 94 observations (DOF 75 and BWDB 19) for IDA-funded
activities, and 5 observations against GEF-funded component. At ICR, 42 (FFP 39, GEF 3) audit
observations were settled and 57 (FFP 55, and GEF 2) are outstanding. From the Bank's
viewpoint, 6 number of observations were identified as material. Subsequently, IDA received
satisfactory responses on all of these audit observations. A further scrutiny of the outstanding
observations revealed that all the observations material to IDA were adequately attended to.
Most of the remaining observations were related to non-compliance with the government
procedures, such as deductions of taxes, deposit of the interest in the treasury and deduction of
Bank charges, commission from bank account beyond authorized provision etc.

         Environment: At appraisal, the project was designated as Environmental Category B,
since the components were found to have relatively limited environmental impact potentials. It
was also envisaged that with proper implementation per the project design, the components would
either have insignificant or a beneficial impact on the environment. At the end of the project, no
evidence of significant environmental damage was found or reported by the local communities.
Significant community involvement in implementation has helped to avoid any significant
environmental risks before they could actually occur.

         Under the Inland Open Water Fisheries component, one of the issues identified at
appraisal was impact of stocking exotic species on indigenous biodiversity. Based on an impact
study under GEF-funded component, DOF was advised to stock common carp on a pilot-research
basis in up to four floodplains representing no more than 10% of the total fingerings stocked, and
monitor the issue in detail. Sanctuary establishment and habitat restoration had very positive
impacts that were well received by the communities. Two risks were also anticipated with shrimp
aquaculture component: overlapping of extended shrimp culture period with rice cultivation, and
threat of wild shrimp seed collection on coastal biodiversity. The first risk was addressed by the
community organizations with a general agreement on an overall management plan including a
cropping plan for each functional block. The second risk, the threat on biodiversity, a GEF-
funded study concluded that wild fry/post larvae collection was likely to have an insignificant
impact at this point of time. With the availability of hatchery produced shrimp fry and GOB's ban
on fry collection, the conclusions of the study were found plausible. The study also found that the
polders with shrimp culture resembled more closely to natural systems with the seasonal
sequencing of freshwater during the rainy season, followed by brackish water in the dry season.
Implementation of the hilsa management and conservation plan by GOB has showed positive
outcome for hilsa as well as other fish species. Environmental issues should be integrated into
project's M&E frame work and be a part of routine monitoring.

         Resettlement: The project was designed to minimize land acquisition and to keep it
around 20 ha, and about 9 ha was acquired for the project. During implementation of the shrimp
component, which was expected to use most of the lands, acquisition was completely avoided for
excavation/re-excavation of canals. The polder communities decided to contribute the lands on
rent (or haari, a traditional land rental arrangement) which enabled the landowners retain the
regular incomes from and titles to the lands. Acquisition for the regulators eventually amounted


                                                  8

to about 9 ha, which affected 152 households, and displaced a non-formal primary school and a
household living on public land. The polder communities relocated the displaced school and
household away from the canals. Acquisition of the land was however delayed till November
2004 due to uncertainties about commencement of the rehabilitation works. Considering the delay
in land availability, but the need to synchronize the works on canals and regulators, the polder
communities and the landowners, who were also the direct beneficiaries in shrimp aquaculture,
decided to use the same rental arrangement on an interim basis for the period until the acquisition
process was completed. As of June 30, 2006, BWDB transferred the compensation funds to the
Deputy Commissioners, but no payment for compensation was made. Compensation payment had
been underway and about 20% has reportedly been completed by mid-March 2007.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

         Transition arrangements for the project were generally good and hand over had been
quite smooth. This was made possible by the teams from within the DOF who were actively
involved in the management of project activities. Smooth handover was especially likely for the
Aquaculture Extension and Shrimp Aquaculture development, where local DOF and BWDB
would continue to provide support to the fisher and polder communities. The agreements between
BWDB and polder committees on sharing Operation & Maintenance (O&M) activities related to
the physical infrastructure were viewed as a major step forward to sustainability. Commendable
efforts were also given by project teams into identifying and implementing exit strategies during
the last year of the project.

         Institutional arrangements for an inland open water unit and broader M&E support
were not in place within DOF. Following approval of Monitoring and Evaluation sub-strategy
under the project, and preparation of an action plan, MOFL indicated its willingness to complete
necessary institutional arrangements in phases. Locally, phasing out started in several inland
open water management sites by end of 2005, with reasonably functioning CBOs and some of
which were promised continuing NGO support. However, it was difficult to know with any
certainty what would happen at open water sites once the project closed with little or no resources
to ensure NGO follow-up with difficulties generally expected to arise due to social complexities
of capture fisheries. The situation may as well get worse due to transfer of the experienced
upazila level DOF officials, whose support was critical for coordination and technical oversight,
and could provide external mediation to resolve difficult social issues.

         To track the long term beneficial impacts, key performance indicators should have
covered the following:

    · Production changes at household levels;
    · Distributional aspects of benefits of production to poorer groups (clearly identified in the
         project);
    · Process monitoring to examine whether there is a return of "elite capture" under open
         water fishery; and
    · Effectiveness of targeting poverty and gender under the aquaculture extension activities.

         However, there were considerable uncertainties as to how the M&E activities could take
place on a regular basis without external support, as there was no institutional set-up with



                                                9

adequate resources for this type of M&E. On a more fundamental level and in the medium term,
an objective reassessment of and building a monitoring system for the country's fisheries
resources were also needed to establish a solid basis for assessing production changes in general
and especially of declines observed in non-project open water areas. Experience with other
projects, e.g. those related to the management of Oxbow lakes, indicated that monitoring of fish
supply in local markets could contribute to resource assessment, at least in cases of more confined
water bodies.

        Possible role of the World Bank in the fisheries sector. With other donors assisting
GOB to develop the fisheries resources, especially in inland open water, the World Bank could
play an important role with policy issues, including monitoring and evaluation. This could be
with a view to more programmatic and PRSP aligned future financial support by the Bank and
other donors. Particular areas for policy considerations would be on:

    · Jalmohal lease issues for inland open water fisheries including rational fees and its
        payment modality, poverty and gender targeting; and
    · Balancing contributions of aquaculture and inland water fisheries to poverty alleviation
        as well as biodiversity aspects.

A major achievement of this project has been the formulation of the National Fisheries Strategy
(NFS) and eight Sub-strategies that have already been approved by the MOFL, and eight draft
action plans to implement the NFS. These documents, strongly owned by DOF, were in turn
taken up for incorporation at a higher level in the national planning process, and in the PRSP and
fisheries sector Roadmap. The GOB is looking for financing the implementation of its action
plans. It is recommended that the World Bank reviews these documents and action plans and
works out, together with the GOB, how best to proceed for future development of the fisheries
sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

        The project was very relevant to and consistent with the country's development
priorities. The development objectives, design and implementation were highly relevant to and
consistent with the country's current development priorities and the Bank's country and sectoral
assistance strategies and corporate goals. The issues of increased productivity and growth, and
reduced poverty remain top priority of the Government. Presently, the FFP together with other
donor-funded projects supports only about 250 of the country's 12,000 inland water bodies.
Experience and lessons from this project are considered instrumental for developing the
remaining water bodies. In this respect, the NFS and Sub-Strategies, the improved capacity of
DOF, and the knowledge from various studies are considered highly relevant.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 4)

        At closing, the project largely achieved its revised objective of productivity increase.
However, the second objective of equitable distribution of the benefits was only achieved for
the inland open water component (77%). Overall, 19% of the project's benefits has reached the



                                                 10

targeted poor (weighted average), compared with the appraisal projection of 80% (see para 1.2).
This distribution target was revised from 80% to 50% in mid-2004, after 4.5 years of
implementation (see para 1.3). The details of the achievement by component are the following:

         The inland open water fisheries component is rated satisfactory against its revised
targets. This component largely met (see para 3.4) the revised physical targets (18,500 ha out of
revised 22,700 ha) for implementation of fisheries management interventions and organizations
for open water sites. It also achieved both the productivity (65% as compared to revised 50%) and
equity objectives (77%). Targets for stocking area were revised at the MTR after delays in
transfer of jalmohals, because this would leave insufficient time to properly engage and
strengthen communities. The achievement of the more realistic targets should also be appreciated,
in the light of overall declines in open water catches outside the project sites. Implementation of
the FFP, together with other similar projects, proved that the community-based approach to
management of open water bodies was feasible and beneficial if they were owned and managed
by well-trained communities. The implementation experience suggests that a long-term lease, at
a reasonable and predictable fee, to the poorer communities could lead to better management of
open water bodies, and, thus, reduce rural poverty.

         The coastal shrimp aquaculture component is rated moderately unsatisfactory against
its revised targets. This component, despite delayed start, achieved the revised output targets in
terms of polder rehabilitation and organization of water management committees (see para 3.4).
Proposed development of a polder, new to those initiated under TFP, there was not enough time
to create and strengthen social organizations and then to identify and implement any required
rehabilitations. As such, development of the polder was dropped at MTR. While its expected
productivity objective would be largely achieved at full development (estimated at 30% as
compared to original target of 20%), equitable distribution objective was less likely to be
achieved due to the existing ownership structure of the shrimp farms. The project created
recognition of and provided a role and voice to the landless poor in decision making as well as
access to productive resources. Social preparation before construction of infrastructure played a
significant role in removing social conflicts, assuring the quality of works, and forging
community ownership of the assets created by the project. Development of shrimp, a high-value
added international commodity, could also contribute significantly to the economic development
of the country.

         The freshwater aquaculture extension and training component is rated moderately
satisfactory. This component achieved its original target (200,000 farmers in 211 upazilas
including 25% women trainees), and marginally fell short of its productivity objective (45% as
compared to original 50%). Its beneficial impact on the poor was, however, far less than
estimated at appraisal, primarily due to the existing ownership structure of the ponds. The
aquaculture sub-sector has, nevertheless, seen a general upward trend over the past years; the FFP
added an extra momentum to this pre-FFP upward trend. It has shown that even                limited
investment on farmer training and extension could have a substantial positive impact on the farm
communities. The project also benefited non-target farmers as they learned from trained
neighbors and the private operators as they established hatcheries and nurseries in response to the
increasing demand for spawn and fingerlings. The training and piloting of village-level Local
Extension Agents for Fisheries (LEAFs) to sustain the project efforts at low cost was also a
breakthrough for the Government approaches. Experience in other Asian countries has shown that
aquaculture can help to diversify agriculture, increase income, and play an important role at a
certain stage of development.




                                                 11

        The aquatic biodiversity conservation component (GEF-funded) is rated satisfactory.
Despite initial delays in implementation, the achievements of this component through Studies
were considerable. The planned 14 studies were completed, which have clearly improved
knowledge and awareness of the aquatic resources and conservation issues. Many of the findings
were already institutionalized and translated into Government policy and action plans. A Plan for
Hilsa management had been under implementation since 2004. Various initiatives were started to
improve the genetics of the major cultured fish species by establishing brood banks and training
hatchery operators. After closure of the GEF funding in December 2004, the Hilsa and Genetic
Improvement sub-components were continued with IDA Credit up to June 2006.

        The institutional support component is rated satisfactory. One of the major
achievements of the FFP was made by the Institutional Support to DOF and Training of NGOs.
Despite the slow pace in the early years, this component produced many tangible outputs, namely,
the National Fisheries Strategy (NFS) and eight Sub-strategies, and eight draft action plans to
implement the NFS. Unlike similar past documents, the NFS and action plans were produced by
using the experiences and lessons learned from FFP and other past and current projects, and were
genuinely owned by MOFL and DOF. These documents were also accepted for incorporation in
the national planning process, in the PRSP and sector Roadmap. Similarly important were the
draft proposal for reorganization of the DOF, and the capacity building of its staff in order to
work with the NFS.

        The rehabilitation of the damaged fish farms under the Flood Recovery Assistance
component was completed and they were in operation. The component covered rehabilitation of
31 fish farms under DOF, including one (Raipur Regional Training Centre) repaired earlier under
the project.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

        The overall ERR was re-estimated at 120% as compared with 48% at appraisal. At ICR,
economic analyses were carried out in order to compare with the ex-ante analyses at appraisal.
The analyses were done by component, using actual costs incurred and the benefits estimates
produced by various studies and surveys. Summary of the analyses is presented below (details
and assumptions are presented in Annex 3.

The improvement was due primarily to: (i) better performance of the Freshwater Aquaculture
component. (The analysis was still conservative: it included only 12,599 ha pond area out of total
22,430 ha actually covered by the project [7,000 ha at appraisal], in consideration of variations
[40-70%] in the farmers' adaptation to improved practices.); and (ii) larger weight of the Aquatic
Resources component (83% of the total net benefits). (If the Aquatic Resources component was


                                                 12

excluded from the calculation, the ERR of the whole project decreases to 84%.) The Inland Open
Water and Coastal Shrimp components generated lower ERRs which, however, were still
economically acceptable. The lower-than-expected ERR of the Shrimp component was due
primarily to two main factors: (i) long implementation period causing delay in realization of the
benefits; and (ii) 20% decrease in shrimp price estimated at appraisal. Decreased ERR for the
Inland Open Water component was due primarily to a decrease in water areas, which caused an
increase of the unit cost. At 12% discount rate and over 20 years, the Net Present Value (NPV)
was estimated at Tk 10.7 billion (or about US$153 million).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

         Overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. With a project assigned value of 4.16,
the rating was based on the evaluation approach stipulated in Appendix B of the new Guidelines
on Implementation Completion and Results Report (August 2006). The contribution to PDO by
each project component is elaborated in section 3.2. Shrimp component would have a better
outcome rating without delays due to additional studies carried out by Co-financier in response to
NGO concerns (see Section 2.2). The evaluation breakdown by component is summarized below:

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

         The project's expected contribution to poverty alleviation goals and equity objectives
were ambitious and probably not achievable. In strict percentage terms, less than a quarter of
the original target was reached. Benefits reached only 19% of the poor, as opposed to the original
target of 80%. A total of 45,000 poor fishers and, by inference, roughly the same number of
households was reached by the project.

         Targeting poor fish and shrimp aquaculture farmers were difficult. Due to pond
ownership distribution, outreach to poor fish and shrimp aquaculture farmers would be difficult
unless there was a greater affirmative action towards the poor. Interestingly, despite the very low
targeting under Aquaculture Extension (8% of fish farmers), this component covered over a third
of all the poor under the project. Despite the reduction in project sites, considerable effort and
achievement were made under Inland Open Water to support poorer fulltime fishers, and include
landless in shrimp area committees and rehabilitation activities. In the alternative livelihoods


                                                13

support component, which was added later, the NGOs achieved very good targeting and
livelihood results for the very poor, although not all were from fisher families. Despite being a
small sub-component, it reached more poor than the shrimp component.

         The inland open water component put an effort to ensure and monitor representation of
the poor on fishery management committees. Later assessments generally indicated that poorer
fishers were benefiting as much as the better off, at least towards the end of the project. However,
impact assessment for both the shrimp and aquaculture extension components indicated that the
better-off were not only the larger beneficiary group, but also got relatively greater benefits from
production. To some extent this could have been expected, given the land and other resources
available to them. However, there were also indications that the technologies (fish aquaculture
extension) and the location of constructions (shrimp aquaculture) tended to favor those with
larger ponds/ shrimp farms.

         Hilsa conservation plan affected those who were involved in the fishing of juveniles.
While the hilsa conservation and development plan, implemented under the project, increased its
production, it negatively affected those who were involved in jatka (juvenile hilsa) fishing. The
survey carried out by the project indicated that livelihood of about 65% (270,000) of the hilsa
fishers in the project area, had been affected seasonally as a result of establishing sanctuaries and
closed season management. The Government, however, implemented the mitigation measures in
a limited way through food/income support for the affected households. As under aquaculture,
there were considerable production benefits; but there might have been considerable bias as to
who enjoyed these benefits. The project also dropped an original sub-component targeted
specifically at very poor, mainly women shrimp fry collectors, as wild shrimp fry collection was
banned by the Government at an early stage. It was noted in its favor that the project, through
other studies it supported, identified and strongly recommended measures to address these
negative impacts. One study noted that wild shrimp fry collection by poorer people had only a
minor role in shrimp fry decline.

         50,000 women were trained on aquaculture, which is 25% of total trainees. Originally,
only the aquaculture extension and shrimp fry collection components specifically targeted women.
The latter, as noted above, was dropped. Under the aquaculture extension the target was almost
achieved, reaching nearly 50,000 women (25%). This is definitely significant, it showed a large
number of women could be reached through extension, and impact assessment demonstrated that
they could also make efficient use of resources and training. Ironically, this efficiency--linked
with relatively low production increases compared to men--could not fully materialize due to the
fact that they were unable to harness more household resources, which remained largely under the
control of their husbands or other male relatives. As a result, women's share of benefits remained
lower than that of males. Aside from the alternative livelihoods component, which included
women, there was little assessment of how women might have benefited from inland open water
or shrimp fisheries development.

         Community Organizations were useful in resolving local conflicts. While not
specifically one of the objectives, but mentioned as important in various part of the PAD, the
project assisted in addressing complex local social issues through the formation and capacity
building of broad-based fisheries and water management committees. These efforts significantly
helped to address local conflicts and issues regarding shrimp farms and canal water sharing,




                                                 14

inclusion of landless poor in CBOs and define local rules and leadership for some beels7 and
rivers.

         Local Elites had substantial influence in 40% CBOs. During project implementation,
the floodplain stocking under the Inland Open Water Fisheries Management component
experienced "elite capture" in some places in the sense that the targeted poor fishers did not really
benefit from stocking and in some cases were even negatively impacted. Beginning in October
2003, the project addressed this problem for about 60% of the relatively better performing CBOs
through capacity building and networking with NGOs and similar CBOs in the country. For the
remaining 40%, floodplain stocking was phased out and alternate income generating activities
targeting the poor fishers as well as other poor members of these committees were taken up in a
modest way.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

         Learning by doing is possibly the better way. This is described under the specific
Institutional Development component (Section 3.2). Here the broader and unintended
achievements are summarized. With no specific institutional development baselines and
assessments, changes can only be described qualitatively. For example, there was extensive
training, including overseas courses, for the project related staff. However, despite the positive
feedback given by trained DOF individuals who were still around at ICR, it is hard to assess
whether these are as important as the experiential learning through direct engagement in project
implementation. It seems more significant that experiences in this, and other related projects like
MACH8 and CBFM-II9 have provided DOF working groups with very substantial and realistic
insights into developing a longer term National Fishery Strategy and sub-strategies for the
country. Provided resources are adequate and policy changes taken place, particularly in terms of
jalmohal lease arrangements necessary at the highest level, the strategies may provide one of the
most solid foundations and longer term institutional change of the project.

         Institutional change at the local level is necessary. To support policy implementation in
the long term, institutional change is also necessary at the local level. First of all the project has
engaged a considerable number of DOF staff and NGOs as implementers for the different
components. Being trained and gaining capacity through experiences (including difficult ones
from earlier stages of the project and into exit strategies) these agencies are now in a better
position to continue their support in the future. However, there are always uncertainties as to the
resources available for sustaining and expanding experiences, particularly for inland open water
activities, the most critical one is supporting the poor fishers. Unfortunately, the model of linking
local open water fishery management to local upazila governments, as adopted under other
projects and provides a key link to local problem resolution, has been developed too late to be
adopted under FFP.

         The project successfully carried out few pilots, which need phased scaling up. At the
community level, the project has developed resource management and service support institutions

at the local level, with very useful institutional models emerging towards the later stages. For
inland open water, functional fishery management committees were in place in most of the
project sites, with representation, resource generation and leadership criteria to ensure at least
some longer-term empowerment of poorer fishers. Resource generation at local level by private
sector initiatives, such as Pankowri model (seasonal aquaculture in privately-owned floodplains)
still need external oversight, say through NGOs, to ensure fair allocation of benefits to the poor
and biodiversity aspects. Under the project, innovative arrangements have been made with
inclusion of landless in water management committees in shrimp polder 32. For fish aquaculture,
the Local Extension Agents for Fisheries (LEAF) system, while only a pilot, has shown itself to
be very popular as a local participatory farmer-to-farmer support system, with potential for
further development as a private extension system. The government has allocated resources to
expand the model.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

         Secondary adoption was made by about 33% neighbors of the direct beneficiaries. In
the Fresh Aquaculture Extension component, in addition to the trained 200,000 farmers,
secondary adoption was estimated to be around 33% of the project direct beneficiaries. This
secondary adoption is likely to increase further in the future. This important parameter indicates
that the technical package is well accepted by rural communities, and aquaculture is financially
attractive. Other unintended positive outcomes and impacts were identified particularly in relation
to the developments in the private sector, although systematic data are lacking to substantiate this
claim. In response to increasing demand for spawn and fingerlings, many private hatcheries and
nurseries have been established. These production-related activities together with those for
marketing have created additional employment. In recent years, aquaculture has grown rapidly,
and played dominant role in fish markets. In the longer term, the negative impact of this
success could be, from producer side, the decline of fish prices.

(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

         No Beneficiary survey was carried out for FFP.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

         The overall risk that the project's development outcomes will not be realized is
moderate. The risk, related to long-term lease of jalmohals to communities for inland open water
fisheries on a sustained basis, is dependant on policy revision by the Government. In addition,
the institutions and financial resources, to sustain them for ensuring continued support to the poor
at DOF, local agency or community levels, are at initial stages of development. Further
improvements are not likely at the local level, given the transfer of DOF staff and uncertain
presence of NGOs. These issues have now been included in the new National Fisheries Strategy
prepared under the project, and MOFL is in discussion with the Ministry of Land for early
resolution of the lease issue in addition to decentralized support to fishing communities at the
upazila level.

         Production increase for open water fisheries and aquaculture are likely to be sustained.
Regarding production outcomes, the risks are considered moderate for inland open water fisheries



                                                  16

(including hilsa) and low for aquaculture. Because the production gains have been proven, and
the benefits are largely under the control of the beneficiaries, especially in aquaculture, these
gains would be relatively resilient to external risks, such as political changes, need for external
resources, and environmental impacts. Despite its benefits for poorer or better-off stakeholders,
open water fisheries may still face risks: production may return to original 'open access'
controlled by rent seeking "political elites", causing the loss of production gains.

         Production gains for shrimp aquaculture, although still not proven, are also likely to
sustain, because they are also largely under beneficiary control. However, they may still be
vulnerable to natural disasters - as all productive activities in coastal areas are. In this respect, the
good quality of construction under the project is expected to somewhat reduce vulnerability and
improve flood recovery.

         Mainstreaming of biodiversity and conservation aspects will face challenges. It is likely
that satisfactory implementation of the Government's action plan, in view of growing population
and a declining resource base, is at moderate risk. The biodiversity and conservation aspects
have been incorporated in the approved National Fisheries Strategy (prepared under the FFP), and
National Biodiversity Strategy 2004 (prepared by Ministry of Environment and Forest under a
separate GEF-funded project) and it is likely that the risk will be minimized to the extent
possible by the concerted effort of the Government and all other stakeholders.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

         Bank performance through the lending phase was moderately satisfactory. The DO to
reduce poverty by promoting agricultural growth with special attention to directly assist the poor
was consistent with the CAS. The Bank's diagnosis of the problems and the proposed technical
solutions were generally correct, other than the complexity due to five related, but very different
components.     The PAD is of good quality, well written and clear, excepting its benefit
distribution aspects. It incorporated the wealth of experience the Bank previously acquired in the
fisheries sector. However at hindsight, a number of weaknesses in quality were there at entry, and
the main ones have been elaborated in Section 2.1.

         In spite of deficient quality at entry, the project largely overcame the problems and
accomplished moderately satisfactory status, because of the persistent follow-up by the Bank
during implementation through close monitoring and necessary adjustments in the project design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

         Overall, the quality of supervision is rated 'moderately satisfactory. Supervision
missions were adequately carried out, with appropriate staffing. Implementation issues and


                                                  17

solutions were correctly and timely identified and discussed with the counterpart. Nevertheless, in
retrospect, the Bank should have taken early action to rectify and clarify the most important and
contentious outcome: the 80% benefit distribution to the poor. The decision to reduce the target
was made after 4.5 years during implementation. The resolution of this particular issue by MTR
could have positively influenced the project outcome.

        Joint implementation review teams (IDA and DFID) rated this project as 'Satisfactory'
from the beginnings till September 2003 (PSR No.11). The November 2003 mission downgraded
the rating to 'unsatisfactory" based on the assessment of outcome level KPIs. The "problem
status" of the project continued till October 2004 (PSR No.14). Meanwhile, a "supervision clinic"
was arranged in February 2004 to review the project's performance and provide guidance to the
Bank team on steps to overcome implementation problems. Based on the guidance, the intensity
of reviews was enhanced and the outcome indicators were expanded by May 2004 mission, from
5 to 9 to accurately reflect the scope, aims and priorities of the project as they have evolved
through the series of reviews and agreed actions. A major change was made for benefit
distribution to the target groups, which was reduced to 50% (original 80%). From March 2005
(ISR No.15), the project has been rated 'moderately satisfactory' following six-point scale as
against previous four-point scale.

        The Bank team assisted the Government in identifying and preparing the Fourth Fisheries
Project including the GEF-funded component and accessing the GEF resources. The Bank's
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) carried out a Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA6) in
August 2004 and rated the overall supervision quality during FY 2003-2004 as moderately
satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        Due to the points discussed in (a) and (b) the Bank performance was rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Government's commitment
to the project was seen throughout implementation period, although was not sufficiently flexible
to adapt to evolving situations, to make changes to project targets, as was evident at MTR and at
subsequent stages of implementation. Many good practices and lessons (such as establishing
sanctuary as a means for conservation and biodiversity, genetic improvement, local extension
agent for fisheries, and hilsa management) learned from this project have been incorporated into
the Government's regular program. But the delay in hiring consultants for GEF-funded activities
and transfer of jalmohals was one of the major shortcomings that eventually delayed the entire
implementation process and reduction in key targets for inland open water component. While
varying lease periods have been guaranteed, it is still uncertain whether or not the leases will be
renewed at expiration of the current period. This uncertainty may greatly affect performance of
the Inland Open Water component that promises to benefit the poor more than other components.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


     Implementing Agency           Performance


                                   The performance of the implementing agencies is rated
                                   moderately satisfactory. DOF and BWDB were generally
                                   committed to achieving the development outcomes, from
                                   preparation through implementation. DOF entrusted Local
                                   Government Engineering Department (LGED) with the
                                   responsibility of fish habitat restoration works. It is

     Department of Fisheries,      commendable particularly for DOF for its commitment and

     Ministry of Fisheries and     ownership of the National Fisheries Strategy and Action

     Livestock (MOFL)              Plans. The agencies tried out some new concepts such as
                                   LEAF and acquired experience and lessons, particularly in
                                   community organization, which have been incorporated into
                                   its programs. The recognition of and collaboration with NGOs
                                   by DOF, although not yet as full strategic partners, can be
                                   seen as a key to achieving community engagement in fisheries
                                   management.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        The overall performance of the borrower is rated moderately satisfactory. The main
factors that preclude the ICR team to rate Satisfactory are: slow and partial transfer of
jalmohals, delay    in awarding consultancy    contract   for   GEF-funded     activities, slow
implementation, particularly the formulation of NFS and action plans.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

1.      User rights over common property resources are fundamental. While there was
considerable achievement in terms of production increases in aquaculture, the greatest share of
benefits to the poor accrued under the inland open water component. This was particularly
important, especially in a situation where inland open water fisheries are gradually declining.
Resolving the institutional issue of lease, which provides secured access right to the fishing
communities in a predictable and fair manner, is fundamental for successful implementation of



                                               19

the open water fisheries component and a prerequisite for further development of many other
water bodies in Bangladesh.

2.      Simple cost-effective entry points are needed in open water fisheries. Priority should be
given to the development of simple interventions, such as establishment of sanctuaries, control of
fishing gears, closed fishing seasons, etc, in parallel to strengthening of the community
organizations. More costly stocking activities can then begin depending on the community
perception of benefits and their ability to invest their own resources. Stocking of good quality
fingerlings in closed and small water bodies managed by strong community organizations can
have a higher chance of success.

3.      Community involvement in preparation through monitoring of construction works
increases quality. Participation of community organizations in preparation, implementation and
monitoring enhances the quality of infrastructure, although it requires a longer time. Better
quality together with the user-friendly infrastructure such as regulators in the shrimp polders will
increase production and the chance of sustainability.

4.      Political support is critical to sustain nature conservation efforts. Implementation of the
hilsa management and conservation plan by the Government showed that political will, coupled
with strong support by the relevant Government agencies, can bring about cooperation among
various parties; and that accurate management information from the project and the local
communities was essential for successful management of fishery and other natural resources.

5.      Dealing with social change demands longer time and realistic targets. A protracted time
horizon and less ambitious targets are needed to deal with social change, the creation and
distribution of rights, building community organizations to manage common property resources
and the accompanying changes of thinking in the bureaucracy.

6.      Flexibility is needed in case of community driven process oriented programs. While
donors may be in a relatively better position to accommodate or adjust to the changes, particularly
in the case of a process-oriented project, the government, due to its inherent, rigid project
processing system, still finds it difficult to do so. There is thus a need for a change in
government's approach to such projects, including the subsequent need for appropriate training
and sensitizing of staff.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

        No comments were received from the Borrower and Implementing Agencies. Summary
of Borrower's ICR for the project was received on November 26, 2006 (see Annex 7) and the
Government has indicated its 'no objection' to the public disclosure of the final ICR.

(b) Cofinanciers

No comments were received from the Co-financier (UK-DFID). A Project Completion Report for
the FFP was prepared by DFID in June 2005, which is available in the project file.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Community-based Inland Open-water Fisheries Management

         Based on social and technical considerations, initial selection for areas suitable for
intervention under this component was 51 sites. The reduction in sites came largely on the
realization of considerable difficulties that would be faced in getting entrenched local elites to
give up their user rights over most water bodies. NGOs were contracted between 2001 and 2003
to assist communities form committees and rules for open water management. Community based
fisheries management organizations were established at all 51 sites; however, for 12 sites, direct
project support was withdrawn over the period 2003-05 because the time available to achieve
sustainable management would be too short to address deep-seated social issues. At present, 39
sites are performing satisfactorily with a potential to be sustained after project end. In 10 of these
sites, direct NGO support has already been withdrawn since January 2006. A total of 18,500 ha
are covered under the 39 sites. This is considerably less than the original targets for areas (60,000
ha10) and sites (98). The target was later scaled down to a revised agreed target of 20,000 ha. For
2005 in 39 sites, 11 have been stocked by fishers using their own resources, with a total area of
6200 ha. A total of 75 fish sanctuaries have been established covering all sites - of which 15
established under fishers own initiative. In 7 sites habitat restoration has been done through
LGED.

         To assess the outcomes, unfortunately baseline production estimates are uncertain. Open
inland waters are generally well known to be very hard to monitor reliably the yield, due to the
high variability between gears, areas, years, seasons and long-term changes taking place on
floodplains, and engaging scattered small-scale fishers in the process. The relatively crude data
from FFP field monitoring shows very high variability, and reports indicate high margins of error,
so a large part of the data cannot be used confidently. What the project has been able to do in the
last few years, is to train communities to gather their own data through regular record keeping,
making such information useful also to themselves. This information can be used to make some
assessments at a later stage.

         Drawing on the best available data, in a majority of sites there were production increases
in the years 2001-03 of around 10-50% per year in non-stocked sites and 100-200% stocked sites.
While some of the variability is inherent between sites, the ICR team is undertaking a more in-
depth analysis to try to identify the most useful data to derive trends. With the latest (2004-06)
more reliable catch records, annual increase is generally in the order of 5%, with an even spread
of sites with decreasing and increasing catches. The figures between 2001-03 and 2004-06 are not
strictly comparable as the data were collected differently, but change may be due to yields
reaching a maximum. Also the dip in yield to 2005-2006 may be due to the particularly
favourable catches from flood year 2004. Overall, the increases are roughly in line with fishers'
own impression (beneficiary impact survey) indicating largely marginal increase in catch and
income. Based on sub-samples of more reliable data, and comparisons with DFID-funded CBFM-
II11 and USAID-funded MACH12 projects data, the roughly estimated yield increases are likely to
be in the order from 150 at baseline to 250 kg/ha in the last two years around a 65% increase.
There have been increases in the number of fish species recorded at most sanctuary sites.

Stocking targets have been considerably underachieved, probably due to too rigid and over-
ambitious expectations of community contributions at earlier stages, without the necessary
community organizational build-up. Interestingly enough, with time, many of the fishers groups
have begun to stock on their own: in 2005-06 eleven CBOs stocked 24 ton fingerlings using their
own resources.

         41,600 fishers were covered under these areas in 2001/2, of whom 60% were full or part-
time professional fishers who generally represent the poorest segment of rural populations in
Bangladesh. Project data indicate that the total number of fishers on project sites has decline by
2005-06 to nearer 33,200, though some of this difference may be due to original inclusion of non-
fishers. Nevertheless if the decline is real, it could be because improved catch has contributed to
increased assets to start other livelihoods. However, based on impact assessment information, this
could point to a more worrying trend of an exit out of fisheries due to increased management
restrictions on access. This would be especially worrying if those leaving are poorer, however
evidence from FFP surveys on a few sites do not link these changes consistently to project effects,
but a more general exit from fisheries. Exit from fisheries activities by professional fishers in
control areas could be even greater. Therefore, there is the possibility that, with the decline in
fisheries, the professional fishers need to seek an alternate livelihood to support their families. In
2004 75% of fishers surveyed considered that all or the majority of poor fishers (they are nearly
always professional) benefited from stocking, but on sanctuary sites this was more mixed: 24%
saw a majority benefiting, and minority losing out. Significantly, however these moderate
increases in benefits have to be set against control sites where yields were consistently declining.

         Sustainability. The establishment of Fisheries Management Committees (FMCs) and
village level sub-committees have been the first and fundamental step in creating sustainable co-
management of fishery resources, with user-group voice in the decisions on the nature of
interventions and their implementation. In addition to development of site based management
committees, initial work on networking by community based organizations has been started in
collaboration with other projects at a regional level. It is, however, too soon to tell whether that
will result in sustained sharing of experiences and provide support to policy change.

         In all cases, the FMCs have obtained the lease rights either through a nominal or zero
fee or in the case of more productive areas -- variable fees based on expected yield. However,
these leases are of variable length, expiring in 2004, 2007 and some up to 2014. The expiries of
these leases post-project are of considerable concern to fishers. Several groups mentioned threats
by former powerful leaseholders wishing to have the old auction system again. In addition, it was
noted that in areas with otherwise relatively successful gear restriction and sanctuary
interventions (e.g. BKSB beel), khas land was being privatized as ponds, and fish attracting
depressions established on private land in the beel area. While it was felt by fishers that such
activities are increasingly likely to capture project benefits by elites, they were unwilling to
address such high conflict and politicized land use issues.

Component 2: Coastal Shrimp Aquaculture

         Overcoming a two-year delay in its start due to additional studies to examine social and
environmental impacts, this component has achieved much of what it set out to do in terms of
outputs, and in some ways more than expected. With the support of three contracted NGOs, all
committees have been established as planned and all Polder Committees (PCs) have built up their
own funds. The development of committees took place during the two years when various studies
were undertaken, which at hindsight may have assisted the overall quality of interventions. The
community consultation process has resulted in piloting of an approach with voluntary


                                                  23

agreements between land owners, lease holders and Block and Polder Committees to resolve land
issues on shrimp polders. Despite delays, procurement actions and construction have nearly been
completed for targeted works in all 4 polders, though polder no. 32 is lagging behind. In addition,
a   communal      shrimp    landing     platform/collection  hall   is   nearing   completion.    The
communities decisions on the site selection and construction of structures, as well as on the
supervision of implementation, have created an unprecedented sense of ownership of water
management systems in the polder areas.

         However, due to the delay in implementing this component, and works only coming to
completion at the end of project, it is not possible to assess outcomes in terms of direct production
benefits associated with the project. For sampled areas, from the total project area covering
10,454 ha under 4 project polders, the baseline shrimp yield levels of 250 kg/ha (polder 5) and
183 kg/ha (polder 23) are considerably lower than the appraisal assumptions (around 350kg/ha),
probably due to gher (shrimp farms) ponds splitting into smaller units as part of longer-term
trends. Nevertheless anecdotal evidence indicates that some improvement of around 10-15% is
already being achieved; and, with full functioning and management, this could increase to 30-
40%. The baseline studies for shrimp ghers suggest that considerable further increases will not
happen without further improved disease management primarily in the form of ensuring disease-
free fry in association with appropriate water management practices.

         Overall most owners of shrimp farms are smallholders, though a few big farmers own the
largest area of shrimp farms. The number of smallholders benefiting from project water
management infrastructure and interventions who are either moderately or extremely poor
constitutes 20% in polder no. 23, and 38% in the more remote polder no. 5. Polders no. 31 and no.
32 are more likely to reflect the neighbouring polder no. 23. Further, the total pond areas under
management of the poors are even smaller, as they tend to own smaller ponds. In terms of shrimp
farming, the distribution of relative benefits of improved water management (and so production
increases) is likely to go to larger farms adjoining canals rather than those in the middle of blocks.
These farms have better production to start with, and are thus less likely to be poor. Nevertheless,
with the project, all groups benefit from the improve water management capacity and
management.

         The establishment of a voice for the landless through their committees and representation
in block and polder committees has been a considerable achievement. The landless have gained
fishing access to canals (khas land) through committee agreements in one polder. They have also
been engaged to a greater extent in labour on gher and canal rehabilitation.

         Sustainability. The breadth of committee membership and sense of ownership in the
water management systems under development is a considerable project achievement; and, like
the inland water committees, are fundamental to sustainability. Nevertheless, due to the late start
of activities on the ground of this component, there are some points of concern on sustainability
that were repeatedly raised. The first concern is a request from all key local stakeholders for
extension of NGO presence for an additional two years or so. There is clearly a concern that there
may be a return to conflicts without external mediation, as well as continuing limitations in
committee     membership       and    skills,  which     could   affect   the   water   management
systems effectiveness. The second recurring fear was for the return of canals/khas lands to private
lease after the end of the project. Under the original project agreement these leases were meant to
be permanently cancelled. The re-privatization of leases would not only affect landless getting
fishing rights but also community management of water flow through these canals to ghers.




                                                  24

Initially there was a subcomponent on improved shrimp fry collection methods with training of
30,000 shrimp fry collectors, most of whom are very poor, women and children. This component
was dropped when the government banned wild fry collection. The government was unwilling to
look into further capacity support to former fry gatherers (many of whom are in fact continuing
due to lack of alternate activities), despite them being among the extremely poor, since wild fry
collection had become an illegal activity under the government ban. A GEF funded study under
Component D also found that these small scale shrimp fry collectors do not have a major impact
on fishery resources, compared to larger nets. It is likely that such collectors will phase out in
time due to an increase and low price fry supplied by private hatcheries.

Alternative Livelihood Program

         There was no specific component or target originally associated with this activity. This
was because it was finally agreed in 2004 in response to reduced livelihoods for shrimp fry
collectors due to the ban, and the desire to support inland open water fishers affected by seasonal
fishing closures and other interventions. This activity was set up on a pilot basis with 2,000
households in 8 Upazilas, and two NGOs, working in the polder and inland open water areas.

         The NGOs effectively targeted extremely poor households (less than 60Tk/day), mostly
women, and the interventions were popular with beneficiaries and effective despite differences in
approaches. In the inland water areas, also over 25% of households targeted were non-fishers. A
process evaluation concluded while the program was intensive and of relatively high cost, this
was necessary to reach such underprivileged and often scattered beneficiaries. Impacts have not
been assessed, though there were signs that new livelihood activities were being adopted. The
pilot activities lasted less than a year due to the end of the DFID funded period. The DOF did not
continue this activity under IDA funding as it lacked the suitable manpower for the intense
monitoring. Thus, while the two NGOs have considered extension of activities under their own
funding, this can only be sustained on a very limited scale considering the overall needs of the
project area

Component 3:Freshwater Aquaculture Extension and Training

         This component has satisfactorily established effective aquaculture extension strategy
with partners. A large concerted mechanism was put in place to reach a large number of
aquaculture farmers. The effort included the development of 12 training manuals and three TV
spots, training of 460 DOF and 175 NGO officers, 167 school teachers, 17 fish fry traders, and 90
Local Extension Agents for Fisheries (LEAF). The resulting extension training reached 200,000
farmers (75% male and 25% female) in 211 pails. 8000 Fisheries Villages were organized.

         Successful implementation of the project activities have significantly improved the
knowledge base and capacity of DOF staff and NGO officers as well as developed the skill of
200,000 trained farmers. Ninety-five percent of the farmers understand 40-70% of the training
messages while 5% understood all. The average yield (2.9 mt/ha) as obtained by the trained
farmers is 45% higher than that of the untrained farmers. (60, 40 and 12% in case of farmers
trained in Batch 1 & 2, 3 and 4, respectively). The yield increase in case of women operated
ponds was lower than for men (27% higher than the untrained farmers, compared to 50% higher
for men), but their profit margin per unit input was higher than that of the male farmers, as their
production cost was also lower, especially in later training batches. There has also been secondary
adoption of training recommended practices - by up to 33% of non-trained pond-owners in
project villages in the first two batches.



                                                   25

         The physical targets of this component were successfully achieved both on output and
outcome levels, though poverty targeting in relation to the original overall indicators in the
logframe was not achieved. Targeting of the poor was very weak but not discriminatory, as there
few poor farmers with ponds. Initially the project had no clear specific poverty targeting or
strategy for this component. Only 8% of project trainees were moderately or extremely poor
people largely a reflection of the existing pond holding structure. However even after training of
extensionists on poverty targeting, selection of poor did not significantly improve.

         Continued support by DOF at upazila level is necessary to make achievement by this
component sustainable. The support would include continued presence and contacts of the trained
DOF officers, NGO officers and school teachers with the fish farmers, Fisheries Village Groups
and LEAFs duly supported by information, training and extension materials developed and
distributed by the component to continue the activities in the right direction. Through the NFS
sub-strategy, there are plans and even some resources allocated to continue support to and
expansion of the LEAF concept by the upazila team. There is also institutionalization of the
concept of Fisheries Village and farmer's exchange visits for aquaculture extension as well as the
development of a project proposal for external funding under the Aquaculture Investment
Program.

Component 4: Aquatic Resources Development, Management and Conservation Studies

         This was a blended GEF funded component under the Fourth Fisheries Project with three
sub-components - Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation, Hilsa Fishery Management and Genetic
Improvement of cultured fishes.

         Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation: Aquatic Biodiversity conservation was supported and
studied under the inland open water and brackish water components. The studies produced some
recommendations to provide policy direction to the future fisheries sector development and to
incorporate adequate attention for conservation of aquatic biodiversity in the inland open waters.
Improved knowledge of the key biodiversity issues have been defined and brought into routine
management strategies of DOF, and incorporated into the NFS.

         Hilsa Fishery Management: Four major studies were conducted on the reproductive
biology, management conservation strategies, stock assessment and catch monitoring of hilsa as a
key commercial and indicator species. Trainers training and awareness campaign modules were
developed and training was offered to 80 Officers of DoF and BFRI, and 2,500 Fishers and other
stake holders. Capability of GoB officials has improved considerably concerning hilsa fishery
management on one hand and on the other hand the stakeholders awareness for conservation of
the hilsa fishery through implementation of the Fish Conservation Act has increased significantly.
Four sanctuaries and one major nursery ground and an imposed fishing ban (two months in the
sanctuary areas and ten days in the major nursery ground) were established. GoB has increased
logistic support for hilsa management and created a permanent budget head to provide food
assistance to the affected fishers during the fishing ban periods. The declining trend of hilsa
production appears to have been reversed with a registered an annual increase of 11.9% in 2005
over 2004. However, a longer term monitoring program will be required to show that the above
noted interventions were significant in reference to other natural fluctuations due to annual
changes in hydrology. It is important to note that concurrent with the documented impact on hilsa
production, monitoring of other associated aquatic species in the vicinity of project interventions
appear to have increased in diversity and density due to the hilsa-targeted interventions.
Continued monitoring of those species will also need to be pursued over the long-term to confirm
this early finding.


                                                 26

        Genetic Improvement: Three studies were conducted: Development of Brood Stock
Management Plan for Bangladesh, Short-term Preservation of Milt for Enhancement of Genetic
Diversity, and Pilot Cross Breeding of Hatchery Stocks for Genetic Improvement. The results
obtained were disseminated to 90 DOF and 345 private hatchery operators through organizing
training programs. Brood Stock Management and Breeding Plans were developed in collaboration
with BAU and BFRI. Techniques for short term preservation of fish milt were developed for
genetic diversity improvement of hatchery brood stocks of mirror carp and used successfully for
cross breeding of hatchery brood stocks. One scientific paper was presented in a national seminar
and two manuals (Manual for Genetic Conservation in Commercial Hatcheries in Bangladesh and
Identification Manual of Pure Silver Carp Breeders) were published. The importance of restored
genetic quality of silver carp for poorer pond owners has been highlighted. The studies indicated
that biodiversity-safe stocking of exotics is possible by reducing their reproductive capacity.
Stock improvement through cross breeding of hatchery stocks created interest among private
hatchery operators, some of whom are actively taking up innovations. There is improved
awareness of the stake holders about genetic quality of the fish seeds. The knowledge base of
hatchery operators has been enhanced in genetic-related issued for hatchery operation.

Component 5: Institutional Support to Department of Fisheries (DOF) and Training of NGOs

        The National Fisheries Strategy (NFS) and its 8 sub-strategies have been prepared and
were approved by the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock in January 2006. Only the Aquaculture
Extension sub-strategy was originally planned in PAD, and the whole set of sub-strategies and
action plans were only included after the MTR. The sub-strategies are: Aquaculture, Aquaculture
Extension, Inland Capture Fisheries, Marine Sector, Shrimp, Monitoring and Evaluation, Quality
Control, and Human Resources Development. These have been prepared in participatory manner
within DOF and with partner agencies and projects, and in local consultations and capture many
hard-learned lessons. Discussion within and among sub-strategy working groups has led to
coherent and mutually reinforcing strategies providing a unified and very solid platform for future
government led action and any external support. A draft, overall 10 year action plan and priorities
for the NFS has been prepared; and action plans for eight sub-strategies have been finalized. The
DOF staffs involved in the project are clearly fully engaged and aware of the policy and resource
constraints facing the future implementation.

        The Government has allocated a budget line for the implementation of the HRD sub-
strategy, and a draft proposal for reorganization of DOF and capacity building is being prepared.
The HRD strategy has had to quite rightly follow the delayed NFS, rather than precede it. There
are provisions for expansion of LEAFs and continued training and linking to the local upazila
Fisheries Officer levels and government for continued capacity support.

        Several thorough impact studies for all key components have been prepared despite lack
of specific budget line13. A computer network linking 64 districts with Headquarter has been
established. While the MIS is under development and wide levels of training have improved
capacity, there are some concerns with its future maintenance and transfer of trained staff. Some
dedicated staff have been budgeted under a DANIDA project. Under the project, links have not
been firmly established to the DOF fisheries resources survey system (FRSS) established in 1982
and which needs updating, but the information issues have been clearly identified as needing to

be addressed in the NFS with recommendations for the establishment of Monitoring and
Evaluation Wing in DOF.

         Sustainability. The project undertook several steps to try to ensure as much post-project
mainstreaming and sustainability of its efforts as possible. The project staff in conjunction with
DOF staff prepared and largely implemented exit strategies overall, and for the different
components, in 2006. Much of it has been to ensure lessons and capacity that has been built at
national and local levels from the project are mainstreamed into supporting the implementation of
the NFS. The preparations have been highly appropriated and well undertaken, if somewhat
belated. In addition, there are various specific activities in other components that were, with good
foresight, designed for supporting sustainability: fishery and polder management committees and
forum; LEAFs; action plans to mainstream biodiversity and hilsa management. And these have
been largely adopted by the Government.

         There are further converging lessons from FFP and other projects, on the nature of inland
open water management in particular, which have been mainstreamed in the NFS and action
plans, such as: the decentralization of fishery management decisions and stakeholder bodies to
Upazila level, the need for long-term leases for open water body based on user
groups management plans. The MOFL in principle seems committed to following through on
these. The challenge is to sustain and build the capacity to implement them, especially the inland
open water and shrimp components. Here considerable resources are further needed to scale-up
and further support communities, and gain committed top-level policy change in terms of leases.
Large amounts of external resources for fisheries are unlikely to be available in the next couple of
years at least. The question of long-term leases has been on political agendas for many years, and,
as the original design documents recognized, there are very powerful vested interests in
controlling and exploited natural resources for fisheries. The issue of allocating long-term leases
to broad based and poorer user groups is thus likely to remain the key challenge and goal for
future fishery management.

Component 6:Floods Rehabilitation

         The Flood Recovery Assistance component was introduced from March 2005, in
response to the request by the Government. This new component covers rehabilitation of 31 fish
farm under DOF, including one (Raipur RTC) earlier repaired under the project. So far,
rehabilitation of 16 farms has been substantially completed, and works in remaining 15 are
expected to be completed by end of project.

Assumptions and Analysis The main project benefits are increased fish and shrimp production
through various project interventions, increased employment opportunities, and better aquatic
biodiversity conservation. The project costs include fingerlings, civil works, transport, machinery
and equipment, consultants, training, and studies, which were budgeted/spent for the (sub)
components from all financing sources (i.e. Borrower, IDA, UK-DFID and GEF) . All values
have been expressed in Bangladesh currency (Taka) at constant 2006 prices.

        A 20-year project life was considered for all components. After removing price
contingencies, taxes, and duties, all investment costs have been included in the analysis. The
increases in yield due to project impacts were derived from project baseline survey and other
studies undertaken by the project.

        Whenever possible, project costs were allocated to specific components in the financial
and economic analysis. However, it was not possible, for example, to allocate common costs such
as the Project Management Unit, institutional development, national and foreign consultants,
transport, machinery, and equipment to any specific components. Thus the overhead cost,
amounted to about 63% (40% at appraisal) of the project cost, was allocated to various
components according to their share (i.e. 40% to Inland Open water Fisheries, 10% to Shrimp and
Coastal Aquaculture, 30% to Freshwater Aquaculture and 20% to Aquatic Resources
Development and Management).

        Detailed economic and financial analyses are presented below. The project's overall net
present value (NPV) is Taka 10,752 million (about US$153.6 million) and the overall economic
rate of return (ERR) is 120%. As mentioned in Section 8.5 (a), about 65% of the hilsa fishers
(270,000) in the project area have been seasonally affected as a result of establishing sanctuaries
and closed season management. Estimated income loss of the affected juvenile hilsa fishers is
about Taka 1.0 billion, which has no effect on the calculated ERR of 120%. The project
significantly enhances the net economic wealth of Bangladesh. The increase in availability of
fish for domestic consumption, and the foreign exchange earned through export of shrimp
generate substantial benefits to society.

Inland Open Water Fisheries

         Inland open-water fisheries component, including the training program, enhances the net
wealth of the economy through the increase in fish production. The ERR for the inland open-
water component is 33%.

         Considering the integrated interventions, the component was analyzed aggregating the
costs and benefits of all subcomponent together. There were initially four sub-component of the
Inland Open Water Fisheries component. Such as (i) Stock Enhancement 60,000 ha, (ii) Fish
Passes 8 and regulators 5, (iii) Habitat Restoration 10 sites, and (iv) Aquatic Sanctuaries 50 sites.
During Appraisal, each of the subcomponent was analyzed as separate intervention for which the
ERRs vary in the range of 26% to 143%.

Achievements of this component are: fish pass and regulator subcomponent was dropped; habitat
restoration was partially achieved; stocking enhancement was achieved in 8,500 ha; and a total of
75 sanctuaries were established.

Coastal Shrimp Aquaculture

         It generates 19% ERR (70% at appraisal), although there is delay in realization of the
benefits from the shrimp component. The shrimp price is reduced from appraisal (Tk300/kg) to
post project (Tk239/kg according to baseline survey). The component is substantially delayed due
to additional studies on shrimp sector at the implementation stage. However, benefits have started
to generate from FY2006 as reported by shrimp farmers, hence potential benefits are considered
for analysis based on field survey.

         There are two models considered for the shrimp component             (1) shrimp and rice
cultivation and (2) shrimp only. There were 8,555 ha for shrimp-rice and 1,899 ha for shrimp
only polders. A 43% increase both in shrimp and fish production at full development was
considered based on the field survey information.

Freshwater Aquaculture Extension.

         The ERR of the Freshwater aquaculture extension component is 266% (77% at appraisal).
It is estimated that a total of 113,000 farmers has adopted the improved technology (70,000 at
appraisal). Total pond area of 12,599 ha (out of total 22,430 ha covered by the project) was
considered for incremental production in the economic analysis against 7,000 ha at appraisal. As
adaptation of training messages was found to be varying from 40-70% - Batch 1&2, 70%; Batch
3, 50%; and Batch 4, 40%, a pond area of 12,599 ha (56%) was considered for incremental
production on a conservative basis. The investment costs were much lower than planned but the
incremental production was much higher compared with appraisal which generated 6 times net
benefits.

Aquatic Resources Development, Management, and Conservation

         This component generates a high ERR of 164% (282% at appraisal) due to high benefits
compared to low investment costs. All costs, both from the project by all the financiers. and GoB
investment, were included in the analysis. Besides, cost of aquatic biodiversity studies was also
included. The total catches, both generated from the project and the GoB investment, were
considered in the analysis. During appraisal it was estimated annually around 3,707 metric tons of
juvenile hilsa (known as jatka) were captured illegally by fishermen. Through the project, GoB


                                                 30

established protected sanctuaries, enforced closed fishing during the breeding season, and
mitigated impacts on poor fishers. At appraisal, the incremental production was estimated to
23,000 tons. Recent production increase was estimated at 57,000 tons and 78,000 respectively for
2004 and 2005, representing significant increase over that of PAD. Summary results of
Economic/Financial analysis is in the following table and the details are in the attached

[1] During Appraisal, each of the subcomponent were analyzed as separate intervention, however, during
implementation it was found that almost all the site have multiple interventions in same sites, hence it is not
possible to calculate, ERR and benefits separately for each subcomponent. Considering the integrated
interventions, the component was analyzed aggregating the costs and benefits of each implemented
subcomponent together.
[2] This subcomponent was dropped.
[3] The total benefits and costs include the fisheries studies and the institutional support costs as well.

The Project

1. The Fourth Fisheries Project started in 2000 for duration of five years, and was funded by the
Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the World Bank/IDA, DFID of the United
Kingdom, and Global Environment Facility (GEF). The original credit closing date was Dec 31,
2004, which was extended up to June 30, 2006 for the IDA credit. The DFID Grant was extended
up to June 30, 2005 and GEF-grant closed as scheduled.                   Following 2004-floods, a new
component was included in 2005 for rehabilitation of 31 affected fish farms.                     The project
activities were organized in six components:

        i.         Open water fisheries component (also known as Inland Capture Fisheries);
       ii.         Shrimp and coastal aquaculture;
      iii.         Freshwater aquaculture, extension and training;
      iv.          Aquatic Resource development, Management and Conservation Studies;
       v.          Institutional support; and
      vi.          2004-Floods Rehabilitation Program

Assessment of Output/ Outcomes and Implementation Experiences by Component:

Component 1: Open water fisheries component

3.       The open water fisheries management component included fisheries management and
enhancement interventions through closed seasons, gear restrictions, stocking of fingerlings,
establishment of aquatic sanctuaries and aquatic habitat restoration (re-excavation of canals and
floodplains). These have been implemented through a community based fisheries management
approach. Community Based Organizations (CBOs) were established at water body level as
Fisheries Management Committees for management of fisheries resources. The stakeholders at
village level were first identified and a committee was formed in each village. These committees
are known as Fisheries Sub Committees. Representatives of these committees at a water body
make up the Fisheries Management Committee.

4.       NGOs14 have been employed at each site to mobilize and organize the community with
technical assistance from the local Department of Fisheries office. The Fisheries Management
Committee with the help of the NGO and local staff of the department prepares an annual
fisheries management plan for the water body. The sustainability of the project has been ensured
by the formulation of by-laws for the Fisheries Management Committees and they have been
registered with the Social Service Department. Annual general meetings have regularly been
organized by the CBOs.

5.       Community based organizations were originally established at 51 sites. The performance
was closely monitored by the project and NGOs, and subsequently support was withdrawn from
sites which were not performing well and where there was no scope for improvement. At the end
of the project 45 community-based organizations in 39 sites were performing satisfactory with a
potential to be sustained.

6.       Fishers are classified as being poor or extremely poor (initial surveys by the project).
Following the criteria for the classification of sites, which included access rights and
representative organizations, it can be concluded that practically all benefits of project
interventions in these sites accrue to the target group. The 39 sites comprise more than 41,000



14In 2003-04 there were 14 NGOs contracted by the project: BRAC (22 sites), SSS (5), Proshika (6), CNRS (5), TMSS
(4), Padakhep (3), GMF (2), GSK (2), ASG, BUK, BUS, DCHDO, ESDO, Nobalok (all one each), working on 55 sites
(including 5 sites planned for construction of fish passes and fish friendly regulators).


                                                            44

fishers out of 60,000 in the original 51 sites. Sixty-eight percent of the original target groups thus
reap benefits from the project.

7.       Results of fish catch data from 33 sample sites for year 2004-05 and 2005-06 (Bangla
years 1411 and 1412) were positive and encouraging. The production increase was 140% (from
the baseline figure of 120 to 289 kg/ha/year) on average against a target of 100%. However, it
should be noted that there are questions about accuracy on the methods used for catch data.

8.       Poor fishers were negatively affected by seasonal bans on fishing, which were an integral
part of the adopted management measures. As a pilot program, a total of 1475 fishers households
were provided with alternative livelihood activities through asset transfer (Cow rearing, goat
rearing, Duck rearing, rickshaw/van, fish culture, small trading, etc.).

9.       The CBOs at stocking sites (11 out of 14) stocked fingerlings at their own cost after
project subsidies were ended. A total of 15 fish sanctuaries were established by CBOs from their
own funds. These are positive indications of the sustainability of the approach.

10.      The achievements of the open water fisheries management component against the target
are given in the table below:

Component 2: Shrimp and coastal aquaculture

11.      The project aimed at setting up institutional arrangements for sustainable and equitable
development and management of shrimp polder infrastructure, which would lead to improved
production by small holders in five polders (four polders, which had been developed during the
Third Fisheries Project and one new polder). In 2002, in view of time constraints the new polder
was dropped. The target was a 20% production increase. Also, 30,000 fry collectors should be
trained in selective fishing methods to reduce by-catch.

12.      The initiative by BWDB to carry out feasibility studies for the rehabilitation of
infrastructure in the polders had to be deferred because of concerns about social and
environmental impact of shrimp farming. The concerns triggered a shrimp sector study on
environmental, social, economic, and technical issues. The study took about two years and
revealed that there was scope for the project to reach its intended aims.



                                                  45

13.     Technical surveys and design as well as social mobilization to introduce community
based water management, with the assistance of NGO's, were initiated during 2003.

14.     The training of shrimp fry collectors could not be implemented because of the
Government's ban on shrimp fry collection in 2000. Instead the project provided alternative
livelihoods support to 525 fry collectors through asset transfer (Rearing of cow, goat, and duck,
rickshaw/van, fish culture, small trading, etc.).

15.     The institutional set-up for water management in the polders comprised Block
Committees (60) and an apex Polder Committee for each polder (in total 4). In addition a
Landless Committee was formed to enable the landless to influence and be heard in issues related
to infrastructure development and water management. The feasibility studies, initial identification
and prioritization of block and polder wise interventions were carried out in consultation with the
committees.

16.     The Polder Committees constituted more than 100 `participatory monitoring sub-
committees' at each construction site. They operated in accordance with a memorandum of
understanding with BWDB and contractors.

17.     The baseline survey showed that 20 ­ 38% of shrimp farmers were classified as poor and
that the yield was about 250 kg/ha/yr. This was considerably lower than estimates (350 kg/ha/yr)
during the project appraisal.

18.     The infrastructure development was completed at the closure of the project. It was
therefore not possible, during the project period, to determine the impact on water management
and yield. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the production increase could be 30 ­ 40%,
compared to the 20% target.

19.     Almost all planned civil works was completed except jetties and forestations which were
dropped due to the delayed start. Following table shows the rehabilitation works:

Component 3: Freshwater aquaculture, extension and training

20.     The aim was to train 200,000 farmers in 8000 villages in 211 upazilas, through an
extension approach based on the village model, called the `Fisheries Village'. In each Fisheries
Village a group of 25 farmers was selected. In total 40 groups were formed in each selected



                                                 46

upazila. The `Fisheries Villages' were brought into the training program in four batches to spread
the work load for the extension staff. The groups were given 6 days training the first year and
follow up visits by extension staff the following year.

21.     The targets were that (i) 40% of the trained farmers would fully adopt the training
messages, (ii) that they would attain 50% incremental fish production, and (iii) at least 25% of the
farmers should be women. The overall project objective that at least 75 % of project benefits
should accrue to moderately and extremely poor households was valid also for this component.

22.     The production target was almost reached with an average production increase of 45%. It
was noticeable that while Batch 1 and 2 attained a 60% increase, the impact fell in the following
two batches. The target of women participation was numerically reached, although women
benefited less from training than men. Women have less access to ponds and less control over
resources which could be inputs in fish farming. The poverty targeting was not achieved for
obvious reasons, since fish farming requires access to a pond. An attempt was done during the
last two batches to improve this through farmer selection through PRA methods. This did not
improve the targeting of poor.

23.     For smooth transfer of field activities to the Department of Fisheries at the end of the
project period and to ensure sustainability, an exit plan was elaborated. The plan included: (i)
supervision and monitoring of Fisheries Village activities and (ii) piloting of Local Extension
Agents for Fisheries (LEAF), selected from the Fisheries Village groups.

24.     To strengthen extension there was a need for linkages between prospective extension
service providers. To that effect, training was given to one science/agriculture schoolteacher, one
NGO extension staff and one fry trader from each project upazila.

25.      The numerical target of 25% women in the Fisheries Village Groups was almost reached
(24.8%). However, the benefit gained by women from the training fell far short of men's. Men
improved their harvest by 45%, trained women gained only 23.6%. The shortfall seems to be due
to a combination of poorer technical knowledge and lower inputs. The women had less control
over the use of household resources (for example to finance inputs) and less physical access to
ponds (women cannot manage ponds remote from the homestead and in more conservative areas
they are confined to the homestead).

26.     The poverty targeting failed. The criteria for selection as trainees included access to a
sizeable ponds, which automatically excludes the moderate and extremely poor. Further the
technical package which was selected for extension demanded a minimum pond size to be
effective. The sample survey also showed that the moderately and extremely poor who
participated benefited less than other groups in terms of production. The training had least impact
for moderately and extremely poor women trainees. An assessment showed that poor could
benefit from broadening the range of aquaculture technologies. Poor people often have micro-
ponds of a few square meters in which they are fattening African magur. Even if they had been
selected, these farmers could not have benefited from FFP training, which did not cover
technologies suitable for such small water bodies.

27.     The initial results of the piloting of LEAF were positive. The LEAFs, which were
selected by the groups, are in general well-suited for the post, being younger and better-educated
than the average pond farmers, and economically secure). Their technical knowledge is well
above the general level of trained farmers. The Department of Fisheries has decided to expand the
LEAF programme funded from the revenue budget.

Component 4: Aquatic resource development, management and conservation studies

29.    Biodiversity, including species , genetic, and habitat diversity, has been affected by
human interventions in the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin with loss of species. At present there are
56 endangered species, some of them critically, out of the 256 recorded species in the country
(IUCN 1998).

30.    The `Aquatic Resources Development, Management and Conservation Studies'
component of the FFP, had three subcomponents:

       (a)      Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation:      The inland aquatic ecosystem and the
               impacts of stocking and the introduction of exotic fishes on biodiversity were
               studied. The studies recommended that biodiversity conservation measures
               should be included in future inland open water projects..

       (b)     Hilsa Fisheries Management: Knowledge on conservation of hilsa fishery was
               improved through training and awareness building. Four sanctuaries and seasonal
               fishing bans were established to protect breeding and nursing grounds of hilsa.




                                               48

         The Government has declared 10-days fishing closure for jatka protection and other
         riverine biodiversity. Besides, a line item under revenue budget for hilsa management and
         food assistance to affected fishers has been included from FY 06.

         Hilsa production has increased about 38% (75,000 tons in 2005) over 2002-03 at 2005
         worth Tk. 15,000 million. The export earning from hilsa has also increased considerably.

         (c)     Genetic Improvement: A `Brood stock management and breeding plan' was
                 developed, including recommendations to conserve aquatic biodiversity in the
                 wetland ecosystem, from likely genetic damage by escapes/stocking of
                 domesticated aquaculture stocks. The results indicated that biodiversity-safe
                 stocking of exotics is possible by reducing their reproduction capacity. Further a
                 method for short term milt preservation was developed and tested.

         Seventy-five sanctuaries were established in open water project sites, to protect over-
         wintering populations of indigenous fish's species. Hilsa production increased with 38%
         (75,000 tons in 2005) over 2002-03 at 2005 worth Tk. 15,000 million. This was achieved
         a 10-days fishing ban on jatka and other riverine species. A line item under revenue
         budget for hilsa management and food assistance to affected fishers has been included
         from FY 06.

         Habitat restoration: Fish habitat was rehabilitated in seven sites, through excavation of
         silted bees and canals.

Component 5: Institutional support

31.      The project assisted the Department of Fisheries to examine key issues for the fisheries
sector and formulate the National Fisheries Strategy, with eight sub-strategies (aquaculture
extension, aquaculture, inland aquaculture, marine fisheries, monitoring and evaluation, shrimp,
inland capture fisheries, human resources development, and quality control). The strategies were
formally adopted by the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock in January 2006. They followed
general principles which were common for all sub-sectors. The principles are based on the need
to devolve decision making to field levels through decentralization of authority; the desire to be
more responsive to the needs of the stakeholders and ensure that they have greater say in the
management of the resource through community participation and co-management; the need for
an improved central co-ordination, planning, management and advocacy function; the need to be
better informed about the status of the resource and the impact of activities; and the desire for
more dedicated staff resources who have the depth of skills and knowledge to perform the task.
The strategies were developed through a consultative and participatory process involving all
relevant stakeholders.

32.      An Action Plan for the detailed implementation of the National Fisheries Strategy was
drafted with support from the project following the same consultative and participatory approach.

33.      During the work on the strategies, the need for a re-orientation of the Department of
Fisheries and strengthening of future core functions were defined, leading to a draft proposal.

34.      During the last year the support offered by the Department of Fisheries has increased and
institutional development activities were actively promoted by the Director General, who chaired
the Participatory Planning Team, leading the preparation of the National Fisheries Strategy. The
ownership of the process by the department will ensure that the recommendations will be


                                                   49

implemented. The improved ownership of the process was further manifested during the year
with the appointment of a senior member of the department as chair of each of the sub-strategy
groups. The process of strategy formulation was also actively supported by other development
projects (MACH and CBFM-2) as well as the DANIDA supported programme. These will
continue supporting the implementation process.

35.      The National Fisheries Strategy, its sub-strategies and Action Plans proved to be
instrumental in guiding the Department of Fisheries and Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock in
prioritizing and programming for future interventions under the revenue budget, the Annual
Development Programme, and for discussions with potential donors on development cooperation.
The documents were also extensively used by the Ministry of Fisheries in its preparation of a
Road Map for the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy.

36.      The National Fisheries Strategy, the sub-strategies and the Action Plan, were published
on CD-ROMS and in printed form.

Component 6: 2004-Floods Rehabilitation Program

37.      Following 2004-floods, at the request of the Government, the Bank agreed to include a
new component under the Flood Recovery Assistance program and it was effective from March
2005. This new component covered rehabilitation of 31 fish farm under DOF, including one
(Raipur RTC) earlier repaired under the project. As of June 2006, rehabilitation of all 31 farms
had been completed, and the farms were in operation.

Major factors affecting the implementation

Open Water Fisheries Component

38.      There was insufficient understanding in the design phase of the time, which would be
required during the inception phase of the project, to review debate and reach an understanding of
the form of community organizations needed for community based fisheries management. This
led to a delay in launching the component.

39.      There were significant delays in handing over of water bodies from the Ministry of Land
to MOFL for the project implementation.

40.      The NGOs capacity and capability to handle community based natural resources
management were not fully understood. There was initially no provision for capacity building for
NGO staff. Resources (not least project manpower) had later to be allocated for this purpose.

41.      There was limited experience, knowledge and commitment to community based
management among DOF staff. The project initiated training of DOF staff, at central and local
levels. The attitude, understanding and knowledge were enhanced through these interventions and
DOF staff could efficiently and effectively support the processes.

42.      There were predetermined interventions not compatible with the concept of community
based management, which builds on participatory processes to reach agreements on interventions
and insufficient understanding of the time needed to establish functioning, strong and
representative community organizations and to reach agreements on interventions.




                                                50

Shrimp and coastal aquaculture

43.      The shrimp and coastal aquaculture component was seriously delayed because of
mounting concerns about social and environmental impacts of shrimp farming. The components
work plan was thus revised to include a two year comprehensive study and survey phase. This
phase was followed by a debate before it was decided to go ahead with infrastructure
development. The 18 months extension of the project could not compensate for the initial delay,
causing the community management processes put in place to be weaker than anticipated when
they should take over operation, management and maintenance of structures. The anticipated
extension activities to complement infrastructure development could not be implemented, which
may impact on reaching the target for sustainable increase in production.

Freshwater aquaculture, extension and training

44.      This component built on the strengths of DOF and its long successful experience of
aquaculture development and aquaculture extension. This familiarity, competence and capacity
were major factor leading to an efficient, effective and successful implementation of the
component.

45.      Extension Officers were hired for the duration of the project. Uncertainties about their
future role in DOF lead to a lack of motivation during the latter part of the project.

Aquatic resource development, management and conservation studies

46.      There was a two years delay in hiring GEF-funded consultant. The period for consultant
supported implementation of the component was reduced. In spite of the delays the component
managed with a somewhat reduced scope to finalize most of the scheduled studies.

Institutional support

47.      There was a considerable delay in initiating the work of the component. There were also
uncertainties about the scope of the component as to its focus. Strategy development was initially
limited to aquaculture extension. During the mid-term review the scope was vastly expanded to
cover eight sub-strategies and the National Fisheries Strategy. Later reviews and agreements
added the preparation of action pans for the implementation of the strategies. These additions and
changes led to frequent needs to change plans and focus.

48.      There was initially not a common understanding between development partners, DOF
and the project of the concept of institutional development. Thus, there was no proper
institutional analysis carried out as a basis for proposals of institutional reform and strengthening.

49.      There was no counterpart staff allocated for institutional development and no natural
home in the department for these activities. It took time to find a suitable modus operandi,
including the Participatory Planning team and Working Groups for the preparation of strategies
and action plans.

50.      During the last two years of the project the drawbacks identified above were overcome.
DOF increasingly took ownership of the strategy processes and was actively driving them. The
liaison with and support for strategy development from MOFL was a positive factor for the
successful outcome.


                                                   51

General

51.     Significant changes in focus and scale were agreed during the mid-term review. The
subsequent revision of the Project Proforma, confirming these changes in approved and
sanctioned actions and spending, and the approval procedures for the Project Proforma were time
consuming, causing uncertainties about and delays in implementation.

52.     There was a lack of continuity as to the composition of review teams, especially with
regard to socio-economic aspects, leading to ad hoc proposals and demands for new data, new
surveys and studies, which impacted on the work planning.

53.     The different closing dates for grants and IDA credit necessitated a shift in contractual
arrangements for consultants, leading to delays in field work during the last, crucial year of
operation.

54.     The increasingly positive attitude towards and understanding of the project in DOF and
MOFL lead to significant support to its implementation. This considerably helped in mitigating
the factors identified above.

Future Operation Plan and Sustainability

55.     The National Fisheries Strategy (NFS) provides the foundation for sustainability of the
gains in this project. The Government has operationalised the strategy through action plans,
which were prepared with support from the project, to guide further development and
conservation work. MOFL has prepared a "Road Map" aligned with the Government's PRSP,
which builds on the NFS, its sub-strategies and action plans.           Various lessons from the
experiences of FFP and other ongoing projects have been mainstreamed in the sectoral programs
such as conservation aspects an co-management of open water fisheries, aquaculture extension
through `fisheries village' approach, scaling up of LEAF, improved brood stock management,
implementation of the Hilsa management plan, and marine fisheries development. To implement
the NFS, the DOF will require re-organization and strengthening and a HRD plan has been
prepared.

56.     DOF adopted before the closure of the project an Exit Strategy defining areas to be taken
over and carried forward by the department. The Director General appointed committees to
promote and monitor the implementation of the Exit Strategy. The strategy includes for example
new roles for the Upazila Fisheries Officers in promoting community based fisheries management,
continued support and extension for inland fish pond culture, the carrying forward of the Hilsa
management and brood stock management plans, as well as mechanisms for the further
implementation of the National Fisheries Strategy. The Exit Strategy was instrumental in
ensuring sustainability of activities initiated by the project.

Performance Evaluation

57.     Bank Performances: The project was prepared by a government team in consultation
with various stakeholders including the World Bank, and DFID. The project with its original five
components was a very complex and challenging one. During implementation, it was felt that the
development objective of benefit distribution is fully compatible with inland open water
component only and not with shrimp aquaculture and freshwater aquaculture components.
Targeting 80% of the beneficiaries among poor in these two components were unrealistic.
Flexibility in project execution was limited and restricted, to some extent.


                                                   52

58.     Monitoring and supervision by the Bank was satisfactory. Regular monitoring and
effective support and flexible and positive attitude of the Bank, along with the efforts of
executing agencies, lead the project to a reasonable success. Realizing the deficiency in the
project design and complexity of implementation, the Bank agreed to adjust implementation
approaches in most cases as appropriate. In spite of Bank's efforts, however, the implementation
had slowed down and target of area coverage and amount of money allocated could not be spent
due to various issues, which include initial controversy over the type of community organization,
handing over of public water bodies by the ministry of land, controversy over shrimp aquaculture,
and lack of appreciation for a national fisheries strategy. Periodical implementation review by
the Bank in association with DFID was helpful to identify issues and overcome those. Joint mid-
term review of the project in June 2002 by the Bank, and DFID provided useful guidelines in
order to overcome some outstanding problem and to take some decision, particularly the
reduction in the project coverage, cancellation of surplus loan money. Relation between the Bank
and the GOB was satisfactory and very helpful for project implementation.

59.     Performance of Cofinanciers: Co-operation and assistance of Cofinancier (UK's DFID),
was excellent and very helpful in project management, training in undertaking useful studies,
research monitoring including other support services

60.     Borrower's Performance:        Overall, the borrower performance was satisfactory.
Aquaculture and biodiversity component performances were more than satisfactory.            The
government showed exemplary commitment in hilsa management through enforcement of
various conservation measures. In case of inland open water component, there was no prior
arrangement for bringing Government owned public water bodies (Jalmohals) of floodplains for
community management under the project. However, due to continuous efforts made by the
executing agency and actions taken by the Government, the project could cover 18,500 ha in 39
jalmohals under inland open water component, against the original target of 60,000 ha. The
shortfall in coverage is due to cumbersome procedures for handing over public water bodies
(Jalmohals) for the purpose, lack of experience among NGOs and DOF to work on community-
based resources management programs, overly centralized management and deficiencies in the
component design (such as access to soft credit for lease fee, AIGAs during the ban period).
Target fisher community, belonging to the lowest strata of our society contributed to and shared
in the stocking cost, which is encouraging. In case of shrimp component, unilateral decision by
the development partners.

Key lessons learned

General

61.     The Fisheries sector is important for the development of Bangladesh and crucial for food
security. All sub-sectors offer opportunities for further development, provided proper
management, conservation of natural resources and biodiversity, with positive impact on the rural
economy and for the generation of export earnings.

Inland capture fisheries

62.     Inland open water fisheries offer an appropriate vehicle for pro-poor development and
provides as safety net for poor and marginalized groups.




                                                53

63.     Community based fisheries co-management is an effective way for sustainable fisheries
management, provided sufficient time and resources are allocated to establish inclusive, strong
and transparent organisations, representing the genuine resource users.

64.      Long term user rights of water bodies are a pre-requisite for conservation and sustainable
management of natural resources. The present lease system, which is revenue based, does not
promote sustainable management, and should be replaced with a lease system to control access
and ensure sustainable management. To benefit poor fishers affordable lease values and long term
access should be guaranteed.

65.     Well functioning institutional arrangement are crucial for good impact of technical
fisheries management. Sanctuaries were found to be an effective entry point resulting in visible
improvements in catches and biodiversity.

66.     When attempting a community based co-management system there should not be any
pre-determined interventions as a standard package. Interventions should be decided by
community groups after proper participatory facilitation by the project and adapted to the locality.

67.     Site selection for OWF interventions should be based on a detailed study and screening of
potential sites.

68.     High-cost and risky interventions, like stocking, should initially be avoided and decided
upon only when inclusive, strong and representative organizations have been established. Also,
stocking is an enhancement intervention more suited to smaller, closed water bodies with
effective control, than larger, semi-closed or open water bodies.

69.     Implementation of management measures, like closed seasons, lead to reduced income
for fishers in the short term. There is little capacity among fishers, belonging to the poorest in the
society, to absorb and cope with the lean season. Community-based fisheries management
interventions should be accompanied with interventions to mitigate such negative short term
impacts. Also, fisheries management and access control inevitably lead to exclusion and restricted
fishing effort. Interventions to establish alternative income opportunities are effective in reducing
fishing effort.

Shrimp culture

70.     Inclusive community organizations are a pre-requisite for sustainable shrimp aquaculture
by small holders.

71.     DOF need to focus on ensuring an arrangement for disease free fry (seed), improved
extension services including better disease management and reliable quality assurance for the
exportable products.

72.     The fragmentation of the big shrimp ghers into smaller units results in reduced
management capacity and there is a need for improved extension in shrimp polders through
private-public sector collaboration.
Aquaculture Extension

73.     An intervention which is based in the basic strengths of the implementing organization is
likely to be immediately efficient and effective. The aquaculture extension component



                                                   54

demonstrated that DOF, provided it is allocated adequate resources, is capable of large-scale,
logistically complex, operations covering the whole country in aquaculture extension.

74.      If technical messages are clear and simple, traditional top-down methods work well.
However, for future interventions more participatory, demand led, methods will be required,
including private-public partnership arrangements. This change in approach demands capacity
building in DOF.

75.      The project demonstrated that the approach, which was chosen, could target small-scale
farmers. However, the ultimate target groups of the project, poor and extremely poor groups,
lacking access to ponds were not reached. Targeting poorer households with micro-ponds require
sufficient attention and resources. The costs of such interventions and the likely limited impact on
income for the poorest groups should be weighed against interventions for possible other income
generating activities.

76.      The project was effective in targeting women. However, women had less benefit from the
training provided, depending, among other factors, on having less influence on the use of
household resources than men. To gain the full benefit for women participating in aquaculture
will require effort and resources spent on awareness building and longer term support.

77.      To ensure quality brood stock, selected DOF-owned fish farms may be used and for
quality fish seed. DOF-owned fish-farms may be used through public-private partnership as
recommended by IMED in its evaluation.

Aquatic resource development, management and conservation studies

78.      The Hilsa-management plan demonstrated positive results (conservation of the resource
and increased subsequent catches) of a proper management system, backed by political support
and associated measures to mitigate the short term negative impact on fishers in terms of reduced
income during closed periods.

79.      The project demonstrated effectively how improved brood stock management can be
implemented.

80.      The project demonstrated a low-cost, intermediate technology method for milt
preservation and transportation.

Institutional development

81.      The participatory process for the formulation of sub-strategies, the National Fisheries
Strategy, and the Action Plan, was effective in increasing the understanding of strategic issues for
fisheries conservation and management in DOF and among other stakeholders. The process itself
rose awareness and created commitment to future approaches in the sector.

82.      The national Fisheries Strategy, the sub-strategies and Action Plan, have demonstrated
their effectiveness in focusing debate on future interventions and will serve as a tool for MOFL
and DOF to focus its support and facilitate discussions with potential donors. DOF needs to
regularly review and revise the strategy, sub-strategies and action plans to keep them up to date.
This is a pre-requisite for them to useful instruments to guide development interventions.




                                                 55

Implementation arrangements

83.     A project, executed by a PIU within the implementing agency, may not be the most
efficient vehicle for sectoral institutional reform program.        FFP initiative to facilitate the
preparation of national fisheries strategy was initially viewed as a project-driven activity instead
of a sector-driven one. For future interventions a full integration in the department's organization
should be considered.

A. GRANT OBJECTIVES

Original Statement of Grant Objectives

The project objective was to support the conservation of globally important wetlands and aquatic
related biodiversity in Bangladesh by mainstreaming biodiversity and aquatic ecosystem
conservation within the inland and coastal fisheries sector.

Changes to Grant Objectives
If original objectives have been changed, explain the nature of the revisions and the justification
for them.

No Change.

Achievement of Grant Objectives
Discuss and rate the extent to which the activity achieved its relevant objectives.

The Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation Project (project) was a companion project to the Fourth
Fisheries Project (FFP) funded by IDA and DFID. The objective of the project was to support the
conservation of globally important wetlands and aquatic biodiversity through Grant-supported
activities. The project achieved most of its objectives and is expected to achieve a satisfactory
development impact, once the national fisheries strategy, with a reasonable coverage of
biodiversity and conservation aspects, is approved and its implementation begins. FFP closing
date has been extended to June 30, 2006 and the approval of national fisheries strategy is
expected during 2005.

B. OUTPUT

Achievement of deliverables

1. Discuss and rate the actual output or deliverables completed, compared to the expected output,
for each component of the grant.

The project (Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation Project) refers to component 4 of the companion
Fourth Fisheries Project (FFP) and consists of five sub-components: (i) management of Hilsa
fisheries areas; (ii) assessment of ecosystem integrity and sustainability; (iii) ecological relations
to exotic species; (iv) action plans and aquatic database; and (v) studies to develop future projects.
(Ref. FFP-Project Appraisal Document, Annex 2, page 46). In addition, the project envisaged co-
financing the establishment of 50 aquatic sanctuaries.       The outputs completed, in association
with FFP, and their ratings are the following:

Originally, the project under the first three subcomponents/ themes envisaged 19 research studies:
Hilsa Conservation (5), Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation (10) and Genetic Diversity (4). Given
reduced time from about five to about three years to implement the project, the number of studies
was reduced to 15 in an Updated Work plan of October 2002. This was further reduced to 14
studies in September 2003, as one study, the study on movement/ migration pattern of Hilsa was
dropped. The final numbers of research studies are: Hilsa (4), Aquatic Biodiversity (6) and
Genetic Diversity (4). The outcome of the research studies has been documented in twelve
reports (see the titles in Consultant's Final Report no. 38.24, table at page 7).

Management of Hilsa fisheries areas (Theme 1- Hilsa Conservation): The project team has
completed four studies on: (i) reproductive biology, (ii) population dynamics of Hilsa, (iii)
management & conservation of Hilsa , and (iv) improvement of the Hilsa catch monitoring
system. In addition, social issues in the Hilsa fishery due to the seasonal ban in a particular
section of the river has been studied, and a separate report on social issues has been prepared to
assist the Government in developing an appropriate mitigation plan through consultation with
affected groups for minimizing the impact on the affected communities.

Assessment of ecosystem integrity and sustainability (Theme 2: Aquatic Biodiversity
Conservation): Altogether six research studies under this theme has been carried out ­ four for
inland and two for coastal biodiversity aspects as below:

Inland Aquatic Biodiversity: There have been four studies on: (i) biodiversity of FFP floodplain
& riverine habitats, (ii) biodiversity studies of FFP sanctuaries and habitat restoration, (iii) studies
on impacts of stocking, and (iv) livelihoods aspects of biodiversity in inland waters.

Coastal Aquatic Biodiversity: Two research studies were carried out on: (i) environmental issues
in shrimp polders, and (ii) ecological studies of wild shrimp larvae.

Ecological relations to exotic species (Theme 3: Genetic Biodiversity): The project carried out
four research studies on the following areas: (i) assessment of the impact of exotic introductions,
(ii) framework for the import and use of exotic organisms, (iii) genetic status of exotic and
endemic brood stock, and (iv) improvement of brood stock management techniques.

Action Plans and Aquatic Database: The project envisaged that the studies would facilitate the
formulation of six Action Plans under three themes. This has also been modified due to the fact
that the FFP, in parallel to the GEF Action Plans, is developing strategies and action plans to be


                                                  58

incorporated as a part of the National Fisheries Strategy. Thus, this project focused on the
recommendations on biodiversity conservation aspects and incorporating those into the various
action plans developed by the FFP, instead of making separate action plans as an agreed approach
to ensure `mainstream' planning. The key recommendations on biodiversity aspects have been
incorporated in the inland open water and coastal fisheries (see part C).

An "Atlas of Biodiversity Issues", synthesizing results from the studies with particular emphasis
on their implications for development planning, fisheries and biodiversity conservation, has been
produced. The main target audience is planners, policy- and decision-makers at various levels.

Finally, an outline for an Aquatic Biodiversity Information System (ABIS) has been developed in
cooperation with the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS).
This seems to be an important tool for biodiversity conservation and natural resource
management in the future. This project has initiated the process of establishing this system and it
will take a sustained effort on the part of the Government in order to make it work.

Studies to develop future projects:       The project team has prepared concept papers for four
projects. These are: (i) establishment of sustainable management of flowing jalmahals (rivers)
through community-based fisheries management; (ii) sustainable management of artisanal and
mechanized commercial fishing in the coastal areas of Bangladesh; (iii) establishment and
management of aquatic sanctuaries, and impact monitoring of sanctuaries established under FFP;
and (iv) protection and conservation of juvenile and gravid Hilsa. These concept papers are under
review by the Department of Fisheries (Implementing Agency).

Establishment of aquatic sanctuaries: This project co-financed the establishment of 48
sanctuaries, against 50 originally planned and introduced the community based management
system including control of fishing efforts and other measures. The sanctuaries are of: riverine 29,
floodplains 13 and closed water bodies 6. With regard to the lease status of the sanctuaries, 36
are non-leased and 12 are leased water bodies. The project carried out a qualitative assessment,
based on interviews with the community representatives, in six riverine sanctuaries. In all these
six study areas, there has been increase or re-emergence of species, ranging from 19 to 40 in
numbers.

2. Discuss and rate as to how well the grant output met the quality standards of the recipient and
the beneficiary.

Although the project had a late start, having been delayed by about two years, it has delivered the
defined deliverables/outputs and those can be rated moderately satisfactory. Generally, the study
reports are of satisfactory quality. Particular mention may be made of: (i) Common Carp,
Cyprinus carpio (L), as an alien invasive species in Bangladesh, with an assessment of its future
use in stocking; (ii) environmental Issues in Shrimp Polders: the effect of shrimp farming on the
Coastal Environment, and (iii) Hilsa Management and Action Plan. The project's contribution on
biodiversity and conservation aspects in finalizing the national biodiversity strategy and drafting
national fisheries strategy is well acknowledged.

C. OUTCOME

1. Achievement of developmental results
Discuss and rate the actual developmental results, compared to the expected outcomes, for each
component of the grant.

        Hilsa Management Development Plan: Hilsa remains the most important capture fishery
in Bangladesh. In the years 1999-2002, the Hilsa fishery showed precipitous declines that could
in the long term have resulted in its collapse.          Based on project recommendations, the
Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and Department of Fisheries (DOF) established and protected
sanctuaries enforced closed fishing during the breeding season and mitigated impacts on poor
fishers among other actions. Those steps taken by the Government, based on management
recommendations of the DOF and the FFP, are likely to help lead to improvement of the fishery.
Attention has also been drawn to the short and long-term socio-economic costs to some fishing
communities, particularly those that fished the jatka, or juvenile hilsa, for which
recommendations were made for introducing Government programs for the development of
alternative livelihoods for impacted and most vulnerable groups. From consultation with the
affected groups, it was found that the importance to establish a seasonal ban on fishing of jatka
was fully understood due to the direct impact that over-fishing on stocks of these juveniles had
been having over the past several years. The affected groups also recommended that the ban
should be extended to all of Bangladesh and not only in those areas where jatka fishing was a
major activity. The complicating factor is that the main fishing grounds for jatka and that of hilsa
differ, making access to the hilsa fishery by the jatka fishers difficult due to more distant location
and territoriality of the differing fishing groups. However, the TA team also suggested that the
closed season be for a period of three months that could allow more access to the jatka fishery,
reducing impact on fishers' livelihood, while at the same time assuring adequate survival. The


                                                 60

GOB imposed a five-month closed season. The December 2004 mission recommended that
follow-up research be conducted to determine and/or confirm the optimal period.

         Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation - Inland waters: The findings from the inland study of
five inland water bodies showed that the greater the connection to rivers and open waters the
more diverse and productive the aquatic life within those water bodies becomes. These are
preliminary findings from the study of five water bodies (beels) with a variety of interventions ­
establishment of sanctuaries, stocking, and/or habitat restoration ­ thus the results are more
indicative than conclusive about a particular intervention. Open water systems in Bangladesh
are affected by a range of natural and anthropomorphic factors that can vary significantly from
one year to the next, depending upon climate ­ rainfall and flooding, in particular ­ pollution,
flood control, etc. Under extreme cases of flood such as in 2004, there was an enormous infusion
of cultured fishes that escaped from aquaculture due to flooding of ponds. Therefore, the findings
and significance of the results of the study would need to be further examined.              From a
biodiversity and production standpoint, the combination of sanctuaries with effectively timed
closed seasons and ban of the use of inappropriate gears are likely the most effective combination
of interventions. All management actions should be decided and implemented via a participatory
process involving all stakeholders in the vicinity

         Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation - Coastal waters: There were two major findings
from studies on biodiversity in coastal polders and the impact of shrimp fry collection on marine
biodiversity and fisheries production. Concerning the study on biodiversity in polders, the main
finding basically evaluated several points along a transect in the south-west part of Bangladesh
(Khulna area) from northern more freshwater areas to southern marine areas found that the
intermediate brackish water area contained the highest productivity and diversity of naturally
occurring organisms in the area.         From productivity standpoint and considering that the
biodiversity was largely comprised of small worms, crustaceans, and mollusks, there could be
some matching of the feeding preferences of stocked organisms so as to exploit effectively these
naturally occurring and rapidly regenerating populations of organisms. An important finding is
that fully protected polders that are no longer seasonally brackish are less diverse biologically and
less productive than polders where seasonal shrimp culture takes place. This is an important
finding. While social issues remain, where small holders are not directly involved in year around
operation of their lands, polders with shrimp culture more closely resemble natural systems with
the seasonal sequencing of freshwater during the rainy season followed by brackish water in the
dry season. The main finding of the study on shrimp fry collection is that at present (not
necessarily in the past) PL collection is likely to be having an insignificant impact on coastal
biodiversity. However, from recall information, the biodiversity shown in these studies is
significantly lower than those shown in past studies. Past studies noted larger numbers of fish ­
loss of fish fry in the catch could indicate that the impact on these species had already occurred
possibly through a combination of factors including over-fishing in the Bay of Bengal, shrimp fry
collection, and the loss of seasonal brackish water habitat due to closing polders to water
exchange during the dry season.

         Genetic Biodiversity: The project focused on two broad areas ­ an evaluation of the
impacts of exotic introductions on biodiversity and the degradation of genetic quality of fishes in
Bangladesh. Overall, the project found that the impacts of exotic introductions on aquatic
biodiversity have, with some exceptions, been limited. Specifically in the case of common carp,
though subject to a lot of attention, their introduction has not been shown to cause serious damage
to tropical rivers and floodplains with diverse fauna-as is the case in Bangladesh.      The project
has reviewed and detailed the declining quality of the country's freshwater aquaculture brood
stocks particularly the Major Indigenous and Chinese Carps. This is an issue of national concern


                                                  61

to the GOB and the country's fish farmers. The project developed detailed 10-year management
and breeding plans for the improvement and maintenance of brood stocks at twenty one GOB fish
seed farms designated as "Brood Banks" to abate the declining quality of cultured and propagated
freshwater fishes in Bangladesh.

Practical research and implementation of genetic improvement of breeders could not be
completed within the short time frame of the project. Furthermore, many research results were
achieved but could not be disseminated to the field. Genetic diversity issues in brood stock and
hatchery management are complex and generally little understood and they require a sustained
technical input on genetic biodiversity over a longer period than was available. Nevertheless, the
project has significantly raised the awareness of the Government and private sector hatchery
operators over the issue, and there is rapidly increasing interest in producing good quality seed.

        Mainstreaming of Biodiversity Aspects:         The findings and recommendations of the
research studies on biodiversity and conservation aspects have been incorporated in finalizing
various sub-strategies for the National Fisheries Strategy. The key features are: (i) establishment
of aquatic sanctuaries for inland open waters; (ii) regarding the Hilsa fishery in Bangladesh,
establishment and protection of sanctuaries, enforcing closed fishing season including mitigation
for impacts on poor fishers to address the critical conservation and habitat issues; (iii) more
cautious and selective approach in introducing exotic species; (iv) improvement of brood stock
management; (v) seasonal shrimp culture with brackish water in the dry season followed by
freshwater during the rainy season to enhance productivity as well as biodiversity in coastal
polders, provided the social issues can be managed appropriately; and (vi) inclusion of
biodiversity as one of the key element in M&E sub-strategy/framework.

2. Relevance
Rate how well this activity was consistent with the development priorities of the country, the
Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS) and the Bank's sector strategy.

        The project was consistent with the development priorities of the country and Bank's
country strategy. The companion Fourth Fisheries Project has supported rural development by
increasing fish production with emphasis on sustainable resources management principles with
community participation, rural poverty alleviation, employment generation, and conservation of
aquatic biodiversity. This project has satisfactorily carried out research studies and made strategy
recommendations on biodiversity and conservation aspects of the aquatic resources, specifically
oriented toward mainstreaming these principles in national development and management
strategies.

3. Efficacy
Rate how well the activity achieved its stated grant objectives.

        Aquatic biodiversity mainstreaming is a continuous process, which was initiated under
the project. The exit strategy addressed the need for ensuring that the process continues after the
closing of the Grant. Through the incorporation of biodiversity issues into the National Fisheries
Strategy (including various sub-strategies), this process stands a good chance of being sustained
beyond the project duration, provided that the strategies and their associated action plans are
implemented. For the genetic and hatchery management issues, in particular, the concept is
taking hold among hatcheries in the country with clear understanding and directions set to address
the problem.




                                                 62

4. Efficiency
Rate the results of this activity relative to its associated costs, implementation times and
economic and financial returns.

         Given the initial delays by about two years and type of activities, the project in about 39
months (original about 58 months) has satisfactorily delivered all the agreed outputs.

D. IMPACT

1. Capacity Building Impact
Rate how well this activity contributes to capacity building.

         The impact of the project on awareness building at the national/country level on the
importance of aquatic biodiversity conservation is satisfactory, while the capacity at the level of
implementing agency (DOF) is nominal and less than satisfactory. The project had a team of
international consultants with counterpart national consultants in each area of specialization,
which was useful in exchanging and transferring knowledge and technology. In addition, this
project (biodiversity research) is very complex and time-consuming and little can be achieved
through a single project or organization, without linking and cooperating with other relevant
stakeholders. This project, in course of implementation, established important linkages among
many institutions positioned to advance aquatic biodiversity conservation such as Bangladesh
Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI), Bangladesh Agriculture University (BAU), Institute of

2. Sustainability
Rate how likely the results will be sustained.

         Through the incorporation of biodiversity issues into the National Fisheries Strategy
(including various sub-strategies), the chance of the results being sustained beyond the project
duration is likely, provided that the strategies and their associated action plans are implemented.

         With the project having concluded at the end of December 2004, the MOFL and DOF
agreed and assigned one of its officers to be the biodiversity/environmental coordinator, possibly
within the Fisheries Resources Survey Section (FRSS) unit for the short-term until the
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit is established, as suggested in the draft Monitoring and
Evaluation Strategy. Further, until such time as the DOF completes the National Fisheries
Strategy (NFS) process, DOF also assigned an officer in each of its departments to serve as "focal
point" for the implementation of the various studies, management and action plans developed by
the project.

E. PERFORMANCE

1. Bank
Discuss and rate how well the Bank carried out specific responsibilities assumed by the Bank for
this trust-funded activity.

         The Bank assisted the Government in identifying and preparing the Fourth Fisheries
Project including this GEF-assisted companion project and accessing the GEF resources. One
strength of the Bank's performance lay in considerable staff continuity. QAG carried out a
Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA6) in August 2004 and rated the overall supervision
quality during FY 2003-2004 as Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, the Bank performances can be
rated as Satisfactory.

2. Recipient
Discuss and rate how well the Recipient fulfilled the different tasks that were expected as part of
the trust funded activity.

         On balance, allowing for the special nature of the project, the Borrower's performance
may be judged as Moderately Satisfactory. "Procurement of technical assistance to undertake the
studies took about 21 months, which not only put everything behind the schedule, but also
disrupted implementation of FFP" (Re. QSA6, 2004). Although the aquatic biodiversity TA team
had a late start, the project has completed its agreed tasks satisfactorily. The one area where this
project could have further benefited with regard to mainstreaming biodiversity conservation in the
DOF's ongoing activities would have been to have at least one DOF officer at a minimum
assigned in each of the specialty area to work with the team. The GOB initiatives on establishing
and protecting sanctuaries, enforcing closed fishing season, and mitigation for impacts on poor
fishers among other actions, are likely to help lead to improvement of the fishery for all interest
groups; for they address the critical conservation and habitat issues that pertain to the hilsa and
inland fishery\ies in Bangladesh (see Section C on Outcome). The findings and recommendations
of the studies on biodiversity and conservation aspects have been incorporated in the draft sub-
strategies, which will lead to the preparation of National Fisheries Strategy. Therefore, the Project,
at this point, is likely to accomplish its objective to mainstream the biodiversity and conservation
aspects to the National Biodiversity Strategy and National Fisheries Strategy through its studies.
The Government demonstrated commitment and support to the project at all stages, once the TA
team was onboard, although at times biodiversity and conservation aspects were not fully
understood. The Borrower generally complied with the major Grant covenants. As a follow-up,
the Government has been committed to carry out the Hilsa management and improved
broodstock for inland aquaculture through FFP till June 2006.

F. LESSONS LEARNED / RECOMMENDATIONS

Discuss the most significant positive and negative lessons learned from the success or failure of
the grant activity and make recommendations for different stakeholders.

Recommendations for the Bank

       Biodiversity issues take time to study and gain adequate understanding to propose
       effective and realistic management options. The complexity of the subject and the
       dynamic nature of aquatic ecosystems in the Bangladesh context require studies and
       implementation activities for the long-term. The effective time-line, that this project had
       available (3 years), only provided understanding of the issues with few steps toward
       mainstreaming effective actions. This project should therefore be considered as a starting
       point to address the important aquatic biodiversity issues.

       Collaborative arrangements with different research institutions and partnerships with
       advocacy type NGOs are necessary for effective dissemination and implementation of the
       core concepts of the project.

Recommendations for the Recipient (Client)

       Implementation of the hilsa management and conservation plan by the Government
       showed that political will, coupled with strong support by the MOFL/DOF, can bring
       about cooperation among Ministries (including the Navy and Coast Guard); and accurate
       management information from the project and the communities in the area was essential
       for successful management of fishery and other natural resources. [Other examples are
       ban on polythene bags and lead-based fuels for three-wheelers.]

       This project has managed to bring biodiversity issues onto the fisheries agenda within
       DoF and has initiated some activities to establish linkages between various stakeholders.
       For long-term sustainability, there is a need to build on the momentum started with the
       project. Accordingly, the DOF needs to commit itself to continue to promote aquatic
       biodiversity and take related actions within and beyond the fisheries sector where aquatic
       resources are impacted.

Recommendations for the Donor(s)

       Integrated study/program for natural resources management at the national level is
       necessary, followed by well-coordinated implementation of sectoral study/program.

Recommendations for the Development Community

       Biodiversity conservation is not a luxury. Inland and coastal fisheries in Bangladesh
       depend directly on high and sustained biodiversity of the ecosystem, species and genetic
       level. At the same time, the value and sustainability of fisheries and its inter-linked
       dependency on aquatic biodiversity is the best argument for its conservation.
