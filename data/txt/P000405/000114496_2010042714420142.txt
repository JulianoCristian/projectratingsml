Re:
Loan No. 3206 CM
(Social Dimensions of Adjustment Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Social Dimensions of Adjustment Project), dated 
August 3, 1990 (the Loan Agreement), between Republic of Cameroon (the Borrower) and 
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), and to your 
telex dated January 22, 1991 requesting a modification to the covenant included in the 
Loan Agreement regarding the employment of the adviser to the Director General of FNE, 
so that said employment would be a condition of disbursements against certain 
Categories instead of a condition of Loan effectiveness.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank hereby agrees to the following 
amendment to the Loan Agreement:
The condition to the effectiveness to the Loan Agreement set forth in Section 
6.01 (b) is waived, provided however that it is added as a condition of disbursements, 
in respect of Categories (9) and (10), listed in paragraph 3 (c) of Schedule 1 and 
reads:
"and (vi) the adviser to the Director General of FNE referred to in 
paragraph 1 (d) 
of Schedule 5 to this Agreement has been employed, in 
accordance with the provisions of 
Section II of Schedule 4 to this 
Agreement."
Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing by countersigning and dating 
the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
Very truly yours,
By /s/ Iain T. Christie
