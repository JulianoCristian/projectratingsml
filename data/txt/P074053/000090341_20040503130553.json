efficiency, user and provider\n            satisfaction, and long-term fiscal sustainability of the\n            healthcare system in Turkey. The project has the following\n            six components: Component A) supports Ministry of Health\n            (MOH's) institutional transition from a provider of\n            services to a policy maker and regulator of service\n            provision, while retaining key public health functions. This\n            component has four sub-components: (i) restructuring of the\n            MOH; (ii) establishment of a National Pharmaceutical and\n            Medical Devices Agency (NPMDA); (iii) quality assurance and\n            accreditation of health facilities; and (iv) establishing\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Capacity for the Program\n            for Transformation in Health (PTH). Component B) supports\n            the establishment of a single health insurance fund by means\n            of consolidating the four existing health insurance schemes,\n            and expanding its reach to an additional estimated 22\n            million citizens who are not fully covered. Component C) has\n            four sub-components: (i) introduction of family medicine as\n            an organizational model for the provision of outpatient or\n            primary health care services; (ii) harmonization of MOH and\n            SSK hospitals towards greater autonomy; (iii) developing an\n            effective patient referral system to reinforce system\n            hierarchy; and (iv) strengthening population health\n            programs, including disease surveillance, maternal and child\n            health, prevention and control of communicable and\n            non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The reorganization will be\n            implemented in a phased manner, with pilots in large cities\n            during Phase I, to be rolled out nationwide during the\n            second phase. Component D) has two sub-components: (i)\n            health and social security human resources policy and\n            planning; and (ii) strengthening the School of Public Health\n            (SPH), to become a center of excellence in advocacy,\n            training and research for the MOH. Component E) supports the\n            development of national standards in line with the\n            realignment of institutional roles and responsibilities in\n            both MOH and Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MOLSS).\n            Component F) involves activities related to project\n            management. It will support project coordination between the\n            two ministries as well as project implementation in each\n            ministry, and an oversight mechanism for overall project\n            guidance and policy support for both the PTH and the project itself."}, "docdt": "2004-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
