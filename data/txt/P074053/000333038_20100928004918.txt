F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of Phase I was to enable the Government to strengthen the institutional
environment for the implementation of its Program for Transformation in Health (PTH)
that will improve system stewardship, streamline financing and service delivery, and
build the institutional capacity to extend health insurance coverage to the whole
population in a fiscally sustainable manner.



                                               ii
  The specific objectives, set in line with the Government's PTH, are to assist Goverment
of Turkey (GoT) to: (i) re-structure MOH for more effective stewardship and policy
making; (ii) establish a universal health insurance fund; (iii) introduce family medicine as
the model for the provision of primary health care services; (iv) ensure financial and
managerial autonomy for all public hospitals irrespective of ownership; and (v) set up a
fully computerized health and social security information system.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO for Phase I was to: (i) help expand the capacity of the Ministry of
Health (MOH) and the Social Security Institute (SSI) to formulate and effectively
implement health policies, health sector regulatory mechanisms and health insurance
functions, (ii) support the implementation of critical health services delivery reforms
(family medicine and hospital autonomy) with the objective of improving access,
efficiency, quality and fiscal sustainability of the health sector.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

In 2004, Turkey lagged behind many Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries on key health outcomes. Life expectancy was nearly 10 years below the OECD
average, and infant and maternal mortality rates were among the highest of middle-income
countries. The public health sector was underperforming due to inefficiencies in resource
allocation, under-training of staff, and poor incentives (World Bank 2003). The health financing
system was fragmented with four separate social insurance schemes, and only 24% of the poorest
decile had health insurance coverage. Finally, there was inadequate system stewardship and
governance by the Ministry of Health (MOH), as well as little coordination between the MOH
and Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MOLSS), which was involved in health insurance and
health financing.

Although previous governments had attempted to restructure health service delivery and
financing (e.g., introducing family medicine and General Health Insurance), no significant health
reforms had been implemented in the last two decades, largely because of political difficulties. In
2002, an opportunity arose when the Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the general
elections with a majority of parliamentary seats and was interested in systemic health reform.
The Government outlined its reform objectives in the Urgent Action Plan (UAP) and the sector-
specific Health Transformation Program (HTP), both of which proposed to transform the way
health care was financed, delivered, organized, and managed.1 There was urgency and
momentum for the reform, and prior to project appraisal, several bills had already been drafted to
restructure the social security system, establish Universal Health Insurance (UHI), and reorganize
the MOH. In addition, operational changes were already taking place--for example, the benefits
package for the Green Card program (health insurance targeted for the poor) was expanded to
include outpatient benefits, and the distinction between MOH and MOLSS hospitals was
removed to give patients flexibility to visit any hospital.

The rationale for a World Bank-financed project was that international expertise and financial
support would be needed for such an extensive health reform, and the Bank could leverage its
extensive country dialogue and operational experience in Turkey. For example, the Bank had
been engaged with the previous government on health reform and establishing UHI. The Bank
had recently completed an in-depth health sector study in 2003, which served as a strong
analytical foundation for the Government's health reform (World Bank 2003). The Project and
study were also consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in 2003 and the Policy
Note "Turkey: Greater Prosperity with Social Justice" in November 2002, all of which
recommended systemic health reform. Operationally, the Bank had supported three health
projects in Turkey since 1989 with mixed results, however, the experiences from these three
projects led to a strong recognition from both the Bank and the Government that: (i) systemic
health reform was needed instead of incremental improvements, and (ii) capacity-building and
technical assistance would be more beneficial than supporting health infrastructure or specific
interventions.2 The Bank's Adaptable Program Loan was a good instrument to support the
Government's ambitious and long term health sector reform.

 The Primary Health Care Services Project (1997) aimed to introduce family medicine and develop a
primary health care system. The First Health Project (1998) aimed to improve the health status of people in
8 underserved provinces, enhance efficiency of service delivery, improve financial sustainability, and

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Since this Project was the first of a two phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL), there is an overall
program objective and program-level indicators. The program objective is "to improve the
governance, efficiency, user and provider satisfaction, and long-term fiscal sustainability of the
health care system in Turkey." (see Annex 11 for more information on the program indicators).

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the Loan Agreement3 list the original PDO as: "to
enable the Government to strengthen the institutional environment for the implementation of its
Program for Transformation in Health that will improve system stewardship, streamline financing
and service delivery, and build the institutional capacity to extend health insurance coverage to
the whole population in a fiscally sustainable manner."4

The PDO for the project differs in several parts of the PAD and the Loan Agreement.5 In annexes
of both documents, the PDO is also described as: "Governance of the health care system is
realigned and the roles and responsibilities of key government agencies are redefined along the
functional lines of stewardship, financing, service provision and health and social security
information management." The ICR does not assess this alternate PDO because: (i) most original
project documents refer to the PDO as described in the paragraph above, (ii) the project team did
not monitor this PDO during supervision, and (iii) the Restructuring Project Paper recognizes this
discrepancy and uses the original PDO above.

Similarly, there were substantial discrepancies in the key outcome indicators in the PAD and the
Loan Agreement. For example, the set of outcome indicators differed greatly even within the
annexes of the PAD and the Loan Agreement (see Annex 11). This ICR uses the outcome
indicators in the "Performance Monitoring Indicators" table for two reasons: (i) these indicators
were listed as the "original" indicators after restructuring, and (ii) the recollection of the original
project team was that the alternative outcome indicators were more process oriented and
measured intermediate outcomes. Table 1 shows the original outcome indicators, and the output
indicators are in Annex 11.

Table 1. Original Outcome Indicators
1) MOH no longer involved in service provision expect for public health programs
2) MOLSS no longer involved in service provision
3) Evidence of public hospitals operating under a new autonomous model
4) Evidence of increased user and provider satisfaction as a result of family medicine pilot
5) Evidence of capture and use of health, service use and financing data generated in the family
medicine pilot by the newly integrated information system

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification


strengthen the management capacity of MOH. The Second Health Project (2004) aimed to improve the
access to the health systems in the 5 provinces affected by the 1999 earthquake and 23 eastern low income
provinces and the quality of health care management. The projects were rated "unsatisfactory" for
development outcomes in the ICR and by IEG.

  Supplemental Letter No. 2 of the Loan Agreement lists the PDO and indicators
4
  The PDO is described this way in PAD Section B.3 and PAD Annex 3 (Phase I objective). The PDO is
slightly different in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement, the PAD project data sheet, and the Restructuring
Paper, with the word "assist".
5
  See Annex 11 for a more detailed discussion.


                                                    2
The Project underwent a World Bank Board approved restructuring on June 21, 2007, and the
PDO was revised: "(i) to help expand the capacity of the MOH and the Social Security Institute
(SSI) to formulate and effectively implement health policies, health sector regulatory mechanisms
and health insurance functions, (ii) support the implementation of critical health services delivery
reforms (family medicine and hospital autonomy) with the objective of improving access,
efficiency, quality and fiscal sustainability of the health sector." 6

While the Government's long-term objectives under the HTP remained the same, legal and
political difficulties with the passage of reform laws meant that two key outcome indicators of the
Project were not likely to be met: (i) MOH no longer involved in service provision except for
public health programs, and (ii) Evidence of public hospitals operating under a new autonomous
model. The first indicator was dependent on a MOH Restructuring Law, which was included as
part of the larger Public Administration Framework Law that was vetoed by the President of the
Republic in 2006. With upcoming elections in 2007, resubmission of the law was not politically
feasible, and the Government wanted to focus instead on capacity building of the MOH for
stewardship. Similarly, with the change in political economy, the Government wanted to proceed
with a hospital autonomy pilot, rather than nationwide implementation, for the second indicator.

Thus, many of the key outcome indicators were revised (see Table 2, output indicators in Annex
11). In addition to removing indicators related to MOH restructuring, there was a deliberate
objective of de-linking project indicators and investments with the adoption of laws, which were
beyond the control of the MOH and MOLSS/SSI. Furthermore, the family medicine reform had
progressed further than anticipated (already introduced in 10 provinces by December 2006) so
two indicators were added to reflect achievements with family medicine scale-up and utilization.
Finally, new indicators on health financing and insurance coverage were added to capture and
outcomes that were not originally monitored.7

Table 2. Revised Outcome Indicators
1) MOLSS no longer provider of health services
2) Ninety percent of the population enrolled with family doctors in at least 15 provinces of Turkey
3) High enrollment levels (over 90%) in family medicine pilot areas
4) Contracts based on prospective provider payments implemented between UHI Fund and at least
20% of public hospitals and all private hospitals
5) Increased coverage of health insurance among vulnerable groups
6) Improved performance (quality and efficiency) in at least 50 percent of Ministry of Health hospitals
as compared with baseline
7) New human resource strategy for the health sector adopted by Government
8) Hospital autonomy pilot implemented in one province of Turkey

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

  The Social Security Institute (SSI) was established as an independent organization from the MOLSS in
2006 to integrate and administer the health insurance system. After 2006, it became the Project
implementing agency.
7
  Overall, restructuring was motivated by a need to both increase project relevance and accelerate project
implementation, making the restructuring primarily a combination of both "adaptive" and "corrective"
restructuring. The corrective restructuring dealt mostly with: i) revising components and sub-components
to increase accountability, and ii) program management changes to address implementation bottlenecks
(see Section 1.6).


                                                     3
Both the original and revised PDO specified the main beneficiaries as the MOH, MOH affiliates,
and the MOLSS/SSI. There was strong recognition that this first phase of the APL would
strengthen the "institutional environment" and have "minimal direct social impact". In Phase II,
it was expected that the entire population of Turkey would be a beneficiary of improved health
services. Since the Project supported many policy reforms, the entire population of Turkey was a
secondary target group that would ultimately benefit from the expansion of health insurance,
family medicine and hospital autonomy, and increased health system performance and
efficiency.8

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The PAD described the components financed under the project as follows.

A. Restructuring the MOH for Effective Stewardship supports MOH's institutional transition
from a provider of services to a policy maker and regulator of service provision, while retaining
key public health functions. This component included: (i) restructuring of the MOH, (ii)
establishment of a National Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (NPMDA), (iii) quality
assurance and accreditation of health facilities including establishment of a new quality unit in the
MOH and accreditation of the National Hygiene Laboratory, and (iv) establishing a Monitoring
and Evaluation (M&E) framework for the HTP and a M&E unit within the MOH.

B. Building Capacity of the Health Insurance and Social Security Institutions supported the
establishment of a single health insurance fund by means of consolidating the four existing health
insurance schemes, and expanding its reach to an additional estimated 22 million citizens who
were not fully covered.

C. Reorganizing the Delivery of Healthcare Services included: (i) introduction of family
medicine as an organizational model for the provision of outpatient or primary health care
services, (ii) harmonization of MOH and SSK hospitals towards greater autonomy, (iii)
developing an effective patient referral system to reinforce system hierarchy, and (iv)
strengthening population health programs, including disease surveillance, maternal and child
health, prevention and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The
reorganization will be implemented in a phased manner, with pilots in large cities during Phase I,
to be rolled out nationwide during the second phase.

D. Strengthening Human Resources Capacity to develop the skills and competence of the
health workforce, in line with the changing role of the MOH and its affiliated institutions. It had
two sub-components: (i) health and social security human resources policy and planning, and (ii)
strengthening the School of Public Health (SPH), to become a center of excellence in advocacy,
training and research for the MOH

E. Building Infostructure for Health and Social Security supported the development of
national standards in line with the realignment of institutional roles and responsibilities in both
MOH and MOLSS. This was to be done in a phased manner, first with the development of
standards and the establishment of a records and information network in the social security
system, and thereafter between the social security system and the hospitals. It had two sub-

 While the second part (ii) of the revised PDO regarding health service delivery reforms does not clearly
specify a beneficiary, it implies that the project beneficiaries were to be the recipients of the service
delivery reforms--the whole population of Turkey.


                                                     4
components: (i) building the health information system, and (ii) building the social security
information system.

F. Project Management Component supported project coordination between the two ministries
as well as project implementation in each ministry, and an oversight mechanism for overall
project guidance and policy support for both the HTP and the project itself. It funded project
management, including financial management and procurement, as well as technical assistance
needed to support the Project Management Support Unit (PMSU).

Annex 1 shows the Project costs by component and compares the appraisal estimate with
actual/latest estimate . Although less than 71% of the appraisal credit proceeds were used, there
were many cancellations and amendments during implementation (see Section 1.7).

The expected causal linkages with the PDO were as follows: Component A was intended to
"improve system stewardship", while Component B was designed to "streamline financing" and
"build the institutional capacity to extend health insurance coverage to the whole population in a
fiscally sustainable manner". Component C was targeted at streamlining and improving "service
delivery", and Component D was more broadly focused at strengthening the "institutional
environment" and "institutional capacity". Components E and F were enablers supporting the
entire Project with an integrated IT system and project management.

1.6 Revised Components

On July 17, 2005, a component was added to complete the construction of five Regional Training
centers (reallocation of 2.5 million â from unallocated), which were initiated under the Second
Health Project but not completed prior to the closing date. As this reallocation did not entail a
change to the PDO or key outcome indicators, this change did not require Board approval.

The Project components were substantially changed in the formal restructuring, approved by the
Board. The key changes are shown in Table 3. The Restructuring Paper provided two main
reasons for the changes in components: (i) to reflect the PDO changes, particularly with respect to
MOH capacity building rather than restructuring, and (ii) to streamline the components to
improve accountability for implementation. For example, Component E on infostructure was
originally shared between the MOH and MOLSS/SSI, but was split during restructuring to clarify
responsibilities.

D.1. Health and Social          Revised to Strengthening       Revised to clarify accountability with
Security Human Resources        the Refik Saydam Hygiene       RSHI. RSHI activities were originally
Policy and Planning             Institute (RSHI)               under A.2 and A.3 (National Hygiene
                                                               Laboratory). Human resource activities
                                                               were reassigned to Component A and
                                                               Component B for MOH and SSI,
                                                               respectively.

Since most of the Project disbursement occurred after restructuring, descriptions of the outputs in
Annex 2 are under the revised sub-components. Annex 15 shows the original and revised project
components, including actual expenditures (and % of appraisal and restructuring).9

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

The Project had several changes and loan amendments. The key changes are as follows:10

    ·   On March 29, 2006, a loan amendment reduced the Borrower's contribution for
        consultants and reallocated 5.36 million â to Goods (4.62 million from Consultant
        services), so that the MOH could procure IT hardware and software for its health
        information system.
    ·   There were 3 loan extensions for the completion of health centers from Dec 31, 2005
        until Dec 31, 2008 due to contract issues with the contractors (which were brought to
        court) and delays in co-financing.
    ·   During Project restructuring, several funding changes were made:
        - The APL1 loan was extended for the first time to Dec 31, 2008.
        - The funding related to MOH restructuring, NPMDA, quality accreditation, and
            hospital autonomy were substantially reduced.
        - The funding allocated to the M&E coordination unit was substantially increased by
            260% from 1.74 million â to 6.26 million â.




9
  Please note that the Borrower's contribution to project financing was reduced substantially by a loan
amendment in March 2006, so the project figures at appraisal and restructuring are not directly comparable
because the MOH and SSI continued to support reform activities from their own general budget.
10
   Some minor changes included a 50 basis points waiver of the front-end fee (FEF) for all IBRD loans,
cancelling 247,000 â from the FEF, on August 3, 2004.


                                                    6
        -    The amount allocated for grants to NGOs was reduced from 1.63 million â to 0.20
             million â because mechanisms were absent to assess and accredit participating
             NGOs.
        - Funding for the School of Public Health was reduced, although some of the originally
             planned project amount was financed by the Borrower.
        - Funding for Project Management was increased by 88% to support the functioning of
             the PMSU and the hiring of a Project Management Consulting Firm.
        - Low-interest loans to family doctors to set up and refurbish their practice settings
             were dropped because it was only relevant if family medicine was privatized.
    ·   In October 2008, a loan amendment included the following changes: (i) 5 million â
        for the MOH portion of the loan was canceled, partly due to appreciation of the Euro
        against the US dollar, but also because procurement for restructuring of RSHI was
        postponed to Phase II of the APL (Health Transformation and Social Security Reform
        Project, HTSSRP), (ii) the SSI reallocated 4.2 million â from consultant services to goods
        to provide necessary hardware for technological infrastructure, (iii) the loan was extended
        a second time until June 30, 2009 to complete the procurement procedures for
        construction of Refik Saydam Laboratories and to facilitate a smooth transition from
        Phase I to Phase II (HTSSRP) by keeping human resources ready and available and
        continuing to employ consultants.
    ·   In June 2009, a loan amendment included the following changes: (i) 3.4 million â was
        canceled from the loan (2.3 million from MOH portion, 1.1 million from SSI portion)
        because activities which had not been completed yet under APL1 would be continued
        under HTSSRP, (ii) the SSI portion of the loan only was extended to Dec 31, 2009 due to
        delays initial delays with the implementation of the activities managed by SSI. The
        additional time would allow for priority UHI capacity-building activities to be completed.
    ·   In October 2009, 2.55 million â was further canceled from the SSI portion of the loan
        because the envisioned activities would not be completed within the APL1 timeframe.

After all cancellations are taken into account, the final loan amount was 38.20 million â, meaning
that 91.3% of the loan proceeds were used. In June 2010, the remaining loan amount of 3.63
million â was cancelled.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis. The background analysis conducted prior to and during
Project preparation was highly satisfactory. The Project was supported by an in-depth sector
study (World Bank 2003) that evaluated the production, finance, delivery and organization of
Turkey's health system. The study recommended five key elements for a health reform strategy,
which were incorporated into the design of APL1: (i) consolidation and redefinition of the MOH
and MOLSS, (ii) establish UHI, (iii) strengthening delivery of primary care services, (iv)
reorganizing public hospitals for greater autonomy, and (v) developing a package of essential
services and targeting public spending.

Project preparation benefited from extensive engagement on systemic health reform issues with
the previous government and various health system stakeholders. This early Project preparation
work included a study tour to Mexico in 2002, which was significant in helping both the Bank
and Government learn first-hand about the implementation of health and social security reforms.
In addition, high-quality preparatory work was conducted under a Japanese PHRD grant in 2003


                                                7
including a detailed political stakeholder analysis (Gonzalez Rosetti 2004), MOH restructuring
analysis (Aktan 2004), a health information systems study (Timoshkin et al. 2004), and a detailed
Project Implementation Plan (Sur et al. 2004). The grant also supported a detailed strategy for the
reform and extensive consultations, including a high-level consultation meeting in Istanbul in
July 2003 with various health system stakeholders (MOH, MOLSS, service providers, academics
and international experts).

Based on this analysis, there were three key reasons for Bank involvement. First, the Bank's
engagement was important in providing international expertise to support the health reform.
Second, the project was unique in setting up a partnership between the MOH and MOLSS for an
integrated reform of provider and payer health institutions. The collaboration between the two
ministries was not effective, and the Bank's involvement would provide additional commitment
toward cooperation. Finally, it would have been difficult to finance consultants and technical
assistance from the Government's general budget sources, whereas the Bank's financing provided
a more flexible source of funds.

Assessment of the Project design. Overall, the Project was well-designed to support the
Government's reform. An APL was an appropriate instrument choice given that the Project
supported the Government's 10 year health reform program and that health reforms are typically
a long-term process, best supported through phases. There was a recognition at the time of
appraisal that the overall program and Project were quite complex and "ambitious" (e.g., Project
Concept review and Quality Enhancement Review, QER), but there was a crucial "window of
opportunity" for systemic health reform, and the HTP had outlined an even more ambitious
reform. To reduce the complexity, the APL only supported some components of the broader
HTP, and the program was phased. APL1, the first phase, focused primarily on building
institutional capacity, the legal framework, and pilots for nationwide scale-up.

Still, in hindsight the Project may have covered too broad a range of activities: family medicine,
hospitals, School of Public Health and population health initiatives, health workforce capacity,
restructuring both the MOH and MOLSS, and developing an integrated IT system. Some of these
activities could have been more effectively phased. Given the uncertainty around the future Social
Security Institute (SSI), which would be established independently from the MOLSS, there could
have been less emphasis on an integrated reform. The complexity of the Project, particularly
governance for the future SSI, was noted during the QER (to be discussed further in Section 5.1).

The project implementation arrangements were also complex and overlapping, with Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) for each of the ministries, a separate PMSU, an Inter Agency
Steering Committee (IASC), along with Technical Working Groups (for each component) and a
National Advisory Board (NAB). Lack of ownership from MOH staff was a critical issue in past
Bank projects, and a different implementation structure with Technical Working Groups was
designed in APL1. Unfortunately, these Working Groups were not effective in increasing
ownership among existing MOH staff, and instead added additional workload and another
organizational layer. PIUs had also not been effective in previous Bank projects, and the capacity
of PIU staff was not well addressed in the implementation arrangements.

Finally, there were shortcomings in M&E design, which will be discussed further in Section 2.3.

Adequacy of the Government's commitment. There was strong Government ownership of the
Project from the senior managers of the MOH and MOLSS. During the consultation meetings in
July 2003, both ministers expressed very strong commitment to the reform and the Project itself.
The Government had recently developed their HTP, which showed strong political commitment


                                                 8
and urgency for systemic health reform. APL1 was completely aligned with the HTP and
supported four critical "building blocks" within the HTP: (i) MOH capacity for governance and
stewardship, (ii) introduction of UHI, (iii) introducing family medicine and hospital autonomy,
and (iv) competent and motivated health workforce.11

Assessment of risks. Despite all the preparatory work, some risks may not have been adequately
identified and addressed. Two key risks that became prominent during implementation were:

       ·   Coordination between the MOH and MOLSS. The team assessed this as a "modest
           risk", although it should perhaps have been rated higher given the lack of effective
           cooperation mechanisms. In the PAD, the risk is addressed by separating components to
           each Ministry, but Components D, E, and F remained shared. The role and responsibility
           of the IAWG in mitigating this risk was not specified.
       ·   Institutional Capacity. Implementation and procurement capacity was recognized in the
           PAD as a "modest" risk. Given the implementation capacity challenges in previous Bank
           projects, this risk should perhaps have been rated higher with additional mitigation
           measures, especially because the MOLSS had no prior experience with Bank
           procurement. The PAD describes only one mitigation measure--the recruitment of a
           Management Consultant Firm (MCF) to support the PIUs and PMSU. The QER panel
           recommended that selection of the MCF be one of the conditions for loan effectiveness,
           but unfortunately, this was not included. Instead, the PAD estimated that the consulting
           firm would not be employed until 6 to 9 months after loan effectiveness.

2.2 Implementation

There were five major factors that affected implementation progress, both negatively and
positively:

Implementation was substantially delayed in the early years due to weak project management
capacity. There were delays in establishing the PMSU and PIUs because qualified staff could not
be appointed and staff that were in place had little training in financial management and
procurement. The PMSU did not become fully operational until July 2005, almost a year after
effectiveness, and the MOH and MOLSS PIUs were not fully staffed by the Mid-Term Review
(MTR) in September 2006 UNOPS, the management consulting firm that was hired to support
the PMSU and PIUs, was not contracted until Dec 2005. As a result, disbursement was only 7%
at the MTR. New implementation arrangements were established at that time, along with a new
PMSU director, both of which greatly improved implementation progress.

Political economy issues delayed implementation. In addition to those already discussed
regarding MOH restructuring and hospital autonomy, the passage of two laws regarding the
establishment of UHI and the restructuring of the SSI also took much longer than expected.
Parliament initially approved the laws in May 2006 and April 2006, respectively, but then a
constitutional court decision in December 2006 further delayed implementation until the laws
were approved again by Parliament in April 2008. Many of the Project activities were related to
the implementation of these two laws, particularly the social security information system.

Government commitment from the MOH and MOLSS/SSI greatly affected implementation.
Strong commitment to the Project from MOH senior management was critical to implementation.

     Letter from Minister of Health to President Wolfensohn dated March 10, 2004.


                                                      9
While there was strong commitment from the Minister of Labor and Social Security, the
uncertainty concerning the structure of the SSI and the lack of continuous SSI leadership were
significant implementation obstacles. The President of SSI left in 2006, and there were
subsequently several (acting) Presidents. Without leadership continuity, there was inconsistent
engagement with the Bank and less commitment to the Project. As a result, SSI components had
little disbursement until December 2007, when a new PIU coordinator was assigned who had
previously worked with the Bank on the Turkey Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) project.
Subsequently, project activities were clarified, and implementation of the social security
components greatly improved.

A decline in the relationship between the original Bank team and the MOH contributed to delays
in implementation. Technical and policy disagreements between the Bank and the MOH in 2005-
2006 concerned: (i) MOH restructuring, (ii) hospital autonomy, (iii) duplication in IT systems,
and (iv) field coordinators.12 On all of these issues, both sides presented arguments with sound
technical merit, but these disagreements led to a decline in the working relationship between the
original Bank team and the MOH, reducing communication and delaying implementation.

MTR (September 2006) and restructuring (July 2007) were used effectively to improve project
implementation. A new Bank team was introduced just prior to the MTR, and the team used the
MTR to: (i) assess progress to date on achieving the PDO and on indicators, (ii) examine
performance to date in each of the Project components, (iii) identify the key reasons for poor
performance, and (iv) develop a comprehensive plan and next steps for accelerating project
implementation. Recognizing the political economy challenges, two significant decisions, were
made at the MTR. First, agreement was reached with the MOH to change two APL1 objectives:
i) to focus on MOH stewardship and capacity building rather than restructuring, and (ii) to
support a hospital autonomy pilot rather than nationwide implementation. These changes greatly
increased the likelihood of achieving the PDO and showed the MOH that the Bank could be
flexible. Second, Project implementation arrangements were substantially revised. MOH line
agencies were authorized to utilize Project funds for implementation to increase ownership and
simplify arrangements. The MOH PIU was dissolved, and the role of the PMSU was revised to
provide support for only MOH project components. The PIU of the MOLSS/SSI was retained to
support social security components.

These changes were part of the restructuring of the Project formally approved by the Board.
They substantially improved implementation progress, with procurement and disbursement rates
increasing almost immediately, particularly for the MOH components. Formal restructuring
reinforced the flexibility of the Bank in supporting a complex reform.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


12
  The Bank team wanted the MOH to stay the course on MOH restructuring and hospital autonomy, as
originally designed in APL1, whereas the MOH wished to pursue these at a later stage due to changes in
the political economy. On IT, the Bank team wanted to prevent duplication in IT systems between the
MOH and MOLSS and disagreed with the MOH on the scope of work for the health information system.
The MOH wanted to collect and analyze operational health services data, whereas the Bank team thought
that as a stewardship body, the MOH would be a secondary user of that data. The MOLSS/SSI as the payor
would be the primary user of health utilization data for reimbursement and quality control purposes.
However, the uncertainty around the restructuring of social security and MOLSS/SSI may have made an
integrated IT system difficult. Finally, the Minister of Health wanted field coordinators to monitor and
resolve issues related to implementation of the health reform, and the Bank team objected because the field
coordinators were not in the original Project design and did not provide a systematic M&E function.


                                                    10
This section focuses on the project outcome and output indicators (rather than the program
indicators) as: (i) they were specific to APL1, and (ii) APL1 was intended to build institutional
capacity and develop pilots, whereas impact on broader health outcome indicators (monitored by
the program-level indicators) was intended for Phase II.

Design

At approval: The project's M&E framework was initially weak with some indicators not clearly
defined, some with unclear baselines13, and all lacking target values.14 Two out of the five
outcome indicators, "MOH no longer involved in service provision" and "MOLSS no longer
involved in service provision", were policy changes and did not adequately capture increases in
institutional capacity. Some output indicators were similarly not well-defined, and in fact, the
QER panel highlighted that additional clarity was needed on indicators such as "Family medicine
model defined and pilot tested" and "Monitoring and evaluation system established."15

The PAD also does not specify institutions or units responsible for M&E. The PAD only states
that the "MOH and the MOLSS will be the main sources of data for monitoring of outcomes and
results", so the responsible units within the ministries were unclear. While an M&E unit would
be set up under Component A, this unit was not expected to monitor the project indicators.

After Restructuring: After restructuring, the number of outcome indicators increased to 8 to better
align them to the revised PDO. New indicators were introduced: (i) to measure family medicine
progress; (ii) capacity of the SSI; and (iii) increased capacity of the MOH to improve hospital
performance and to develop a human resource strategy. However, the MOH indicators still did
not adequately measure MOH system stewardship, particularly with regard to strategic planning
or M&E.16 Many of the output indicators remained unclear. There were some gaps as well, with
no output indicator for the RSHI activities and no IT indicators.17 Finally, there were again no
specified institutions or units responsible for M&E in the Restructuring Paper.

Implementation

Before restructuring: There were two shortcomings with M&E implementation before
restructuring. First, the outcome indicators that were monitored were slightly different from
those in the "Performance Monitoring Indicators" table of the PAD and Loan Agreement, and this
discrepancy was not resolved. Second, the set of indicators continually changed after the MTR
(see Annex 11). The outcome indicators being monitored changed in ISR #7 and in ISR #8 as the


13
   For example, in the "Arrangements for results monitoring" table in the PAD some baseline values are
"Limited under a different form" and "Very limited" rather than providing additional explanation to more
specifically define the capacity of existing institutions.
14
   Since most indicators were related to policy changes, the target value may have been self explanatory.
For example, "Universal Health Insurance established" could arguably be a target value.
15
   The M&E design was also poor because many indicators relied on legal changes, which were not entirely
in the control of either the MOH or MOLSS and dependent on the Parliament and the President. Though
technical assistance through the project could have built capacity, the political environment could still
prevent a law from passing, hence showing no progress with regards to the related indicator.
16
   There were only two indicators for the MOH: i) Improved performance in MOH hospitals and ii) New
human resource strategy adopted.
17
   The original IT indicator "The newly developed health and social security information systems are
successfully tested" was removed. In fact, it was not included in Annex 5 of the Restructuring Paper as an
original output indicator.


                                                   11
objectives of the MOH changed. The output indicators changed as well, with the number of
output indicators reduced from 13 in ISR #6 to 4 in ISR #8.

After restructuring: The Bank and the PMSU consistently monitored the outcome indicators in
each aide memoire, which was a strength in M&E implementation. There were still some
shortcomings, however. First, the indicators were inconsistently monitored, as reflected in the
ISRs, which was not recognized by Bank management. After restructuring, there should have
been 8 outcome indicators and 13 output indicators, but the outcome indicators changed both in
number and type and only 2-3 output indicators were monitored.

Second, for the few indicators that were not policy indicators, there was limited data collected.
For example, the number of primary care visits, referral rates, and hospital performance indicators
either did not have available data or were not regularly updated.

Third, Government M&E systems were not effectively strengthened. There remained a distinction
between Project M&E (conducted largely by the PMSU) and the M&E unit (supported by the
Project under Component A). After restructuring, funding for the M&E coordination unit was
increased substantially, although this unit did not provide a true M&E function for the Project or
the MOH. The unit did not systematically and objectively collect data, nor was the information
managed in a centralized database and made transparent. The M&E coordination unit focused
primarily on implementation of the health reform and collected data in an ad-hoc manner, and the
field reports developed were confidential. It should be noted, however, that the M&E
coordination unit was extremely effective in driving forward implementation of the health reform,
and the information collected by the unit was used heavily in informing decision-making.
Provincial meetings were held with participation by the Minister himself, and decisions at these
meetings were made based on data collected by field coordinators. However, the unit was not
systematically monitoring and evaluating data. The Bank team continuously raised systematic
M&E as a key issue, and the Government also recognized this as an issue to be addressed in
HTSSRP.

Utilization

M&E utilization before and after restructuring was relatively similar. As most of the Project
indicators were strategic, policy indicators, the data was not necessarily used to inform decision-
making or resource allocation within the MOH and MOLSS/SSI. After restructuring, the PMSU
did consistently monitor the outcome indicators and used them to monitor progress of the Project
itself. There was greater support for M&E capacity and utilization through some of the Project
components, such as the support for health information systems and studies conducted by the
SPH. Overall though, systematic M&E and its use in informing policy remained a critical issue
recognized by both the Bank and the Government. This recognition led to M&E being a key
priority of HTSSRP with a Result Framework aligned directly with the MOH's strategic plan and
work on a comprehensive Health Systems Performance Assessment.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There were no safeguard policies triggered by this project as there were no new civil works or
any expected negative impact on the environment. This project was a Category C. The
completion of the training centers did not trigger any safeguard policies.

Procurement practices were generally satisfactory after the PMSU and PIU were fully staffed.
APL1 was a consultancy-focused project as substantial amount of the Loan was allocated for


                                                12
technical assistance from international and local firms and individuals. In addition to prior
reviews, annual procurement post-review missions were conducted during the project
implementation. No major deviations from the WB Procurement Guidelines and Loan
procurement arrangements were identified during the ex-post reviews. After the initial
implementation delays, the PMSU and PIU were fully operational with qualified procurement
specialists and consultants.

Financial Management (FM) practices throughout the Project implementation period were
generally satisfactory. Both implementing agencies, MOH and SSI, provided timely and
satisfactory financial monitoring reports. Independent auditors' reports were unqualified and
received in a timely manner. All FM staff resigned in 2006 due to management changes in the
PMSU, and the FM rating was downgraded to unsatisfactory. However, shortly thereafter an FM
team from the Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness Project, which was partially
implemented by the Ministry of Health, was given the responsibility to ensure FM support to the
PMSU with the help of a consultant. Consequently, FM arrangements and ratings improved.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

APL1 was designed to build institutional capacity, restructure the MOH for more effective
stewardship, and develop the design and pilots for nationwide implementation in Phase II. The
policy changes and reforms enacted during APL1 provided a foundation for more extensive
health reforms in Phase II. Four triggers in particular were established for Phase II:

     ·   Universal Health Insurance Law has been adopted by the National Assembly
     ·   Satisfactory progress has been made towards the establishment of the institutional
         arrangements for the social security system, particularly for the UHI and a unified
         pensions system, using a common database and technological platform
     ·   "Infostructure" for new social security agencies has been pilot tested and evaluated
     ·   A new PHC organizational model based on Family Medicine pilot has been tested and
         evaluated

The overall program objective remains relevant in Phase II as the health reform continues. All
four triggers were met in Phase I, and Phase II (HTSSRP) was approved by the Board in May
2009. The Phase II goals of HTSSRP are unchanged from those identified in the PAD for APL1
except for no longer financing the set up of a fully computerized information system for health
and social security because there have already been significant investments in SSI hardware and
software.18 The specific objectives of the HTSSRP are: (i) increasing the effectiveness of the SSI
and MOH in formulating and implementing reforms in provider payments and health systems
performance; and (ii) piloting output-based financing for non-communicable diseases (NCD)
prevention and control. HTSSRP became effective on Sept 29, 2009 and has been making
satisfactory progress so far.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


18
  The original goals of Phase II were: (i) roll out family medicine as the model for the provision of primary
health care services, (ii) complete financial and managerial autonomy for all public hospitals (iii) make the
universal health insurance fund fully functional; and (iv) set up a fully computerized information system for

The PDOs, both before and after restructuring, remained highly relevant to the health reform in
Turkey. Health sector reform was and still remains a high priority for the Government, and the
objectives of system stewardship, streamlining financing, improving service delivery, and
increasing access are still relevant today. In fact, the Government's HTP, a ten-year reform
program that began in 2003, continues today with the same 8 themes as before.19 The fact that
the objectives of HTSSRP are consistent with those outlined in the APL1 PAD reflects the
continued relevance of the original objectives.

The design and implementation of the Project are also relevant as reform activities supported by
each of the Project components continue today, many supported by HTSSRP. For example, the
MOH is continuing to develop its stewardship role and the law on MOH restructuring will be
introduced again. SSI capacity building for fully operational UHI continues. Family medicine is
expected to be rolled out in all 81 provinces by the end of 2010, and hospital autonomy will be
piloted and implemented; both of these activities are supported by HTSSRP.

During restructuring, the PDO and project design were changed to increase the relevance of the
objectives to the priorities of the Government at that time because of changes in the political
economy. The Government remained committed to the overall program objectives, and the key
Project objectives that were revised (MOH restructuring and hospital autonomy) are now
incorporated into HTSSRP. Project activities that were not fully implemented such as M&E were
also included in HTSSRP.

Overall, the objectives, design and implementation are highly relevant.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Before restructuring: The original PDO focused primarily on institutional strengthening of the
MOH and MOLSS in support of the HTP. The overall PDO was quite broad and general, but can
be broken down into 3 specific Project objectives. Please see Annex 12 for tables that show the
achievement of each of these objectives as defined by both outcome and output indicators.
Overall, project achievement for the original PDO is moderately satisfactory.

(a) Strengthening the institutional environment [to] improve system stewardship. Project
achievement in meeting this specific objective related to MOH stewardship is moderately
satisfactory. The associated outcome indicator was not achieved because the MOH was not
restructured and remains a service provider. With the transfer of SSK hospitals to the MOH, the
MOH is even more involved in service provision than before the project began.

At the same time, however, the project was able to support increased capacity in the MOH for
policymaking, regulation, and quality control, all referenced in the baseline indicator value. For
example, the MOH has adopted a 2009-2013 strategic plan for multi-year budgeting and planning
that each line agency must be aligned with. A well-functioning health information system was
developed, supported by consultants that were funded partially through the project.

(b) Strengthen the institutional environment [to] streamline financing and build the institutional
capacity to extend health insurance coverage to the whole population in a fiscally sustainable
manner. Project achievement in meeting the second specific objective is satisfactory. The
achievement of the outcome indicator, integrating hospitals managed by the SSK and MOH, was
important in improving the efficiency of SSK hospitals, which were less efficient than MOH
hospitals before 2005 when they were transferred.

Regarding the extension of health insurance coverage, APL1 provided policy support for reforms
that have dramatically increased health insurance coverage. Figure 1 shows that in 2003, prior to
the HTP and APL1, health insurance covered only 64% of the Turkish population, with extremely
low coverage under the Green Card program (which targets the poor). The coverage under both
obligatory insurance (SSK, BK, or ES) and Green Card has increased during the reform, and
coverage is now at 87% of the population. It is difficult to attribute this outcome of increased
coverage directly to APL1, however, as Project-financed activities were not related directly to the
increase in coverage (e.g., the Green Card benefits package was expanded before APL1, coverage
increased to 84% in 2007 prior to any disbursement for SSI components, see also Annex 2).
Extending health insurance coverage "to the whole population" was a Project objective, and it
was mainly through this objective and the trigger of establishing UHI that APL1 provided policy
support to the increase in coverage.

(c) Strengthen the institutional environment [to] streamline service delivery. Project achievement
towards meeting the third objective is rated moderately satisfactory. The introduction of family
medicine and hospital autonomy in particular, were reforms supported by the project (see Annex
12). The original PDO had intended for only a family medicine pilot and evaluation, and
nationwide implementation would occur in Phase II.

A pilot family-medicine implementation law was adopted by the National Assembly in 2004,
creating the necessary legal framework for introducing family medicine with capitation payment
in Turkey. Family medicine introduction began with a pilot in Duzce in 2005 and by the end of
APL1 was introduced in 33 provinces with 23.1 million people enrolled, which has been a major
achievement.

There was strong evidence of increased patient satisfaction in family medicine provinces based
on EUROPEP surveys that were conducted in 2004 and 2008 (OECD and World Bank 2008). In
2004, average patient satisfaction across all provinces was 69%, whereas by 2008, patients in
family medicine provinces had an 86% satisfaction rate on average and patients in non-family
medicine provinces had a 75% satisfaction rate. Unfortunately, data was not available to
separately establish baseline means for provinces where family medicine would later be
introduced to calculate an average difference-in-difference. A further shortcoming is that this
modified diff-in-diff approach is still unable to account for differential trends. If family medicine
provinces had an existing upward trend in patient satisfaction, this approach would incorrectly
attribute the improvement in patient satisfaction to family medicine.20

On the provider side, a study conducted by the PHC Directorate of the MOH showed that
provider satisfaction in 9 provinces increased from 50.7% to 58.4% after the introduction of
family medicine. Unfortunately, this before-and-after type of analysis is not as rigorous as it
cannot rule out that other factors may have increased satisfaction across all provinces, regardless
of whether family medicine was introduced. This is the only available provider satisfaction data,
however, and does show a positive trend.

While hospital autonomy was not achieved through a legal reform, APL1 did support MOH and
MOLSS/SSI policy changes and activities that gave hospital and clinic directors more decision-
making authority. In particular, hospital and clinic directors were given the authority to make
procurement and investment decisions, providing them greater flexibility over the health facility
budget.

After restructuring: The revised PDO can be broken down into 3 similar components.21 Appendix
13 shows the achievement of each of these objectives as defined by the associated outcome and
output indicators. Overall, project achievement for the revised PDO is satisfactory.

(a) Expand the capacity of the MOH to formulate and effectively implement health policies and
health sector regulatory mechanisms. The first objective was revised to focus on MOH
"capacity", which is reflected in the outcome indicators, and achievement of this objective is
satisfactory. One of the key achievements related to this objective is improved performance in
MOH hospitals, largely due to the introduction of a Performance Based Supplementary Payment
(PBSP) system which helped regulate the quality and performance of hospitals. The PBSP system
was piloted in 2003 and is now implemented in all 850 MOH hospitals. A Performance
Management and Quality Development Department monitors both individual and institutional
performance indicators, collected from hospital electronic information systems and audits, and


20
   A study conducted in 20 provinces by Hacettepe University also showed an increase in overall patient
satisfaction with FM with satisfaction rates of 85.6% in FM provinces and 79.4% in non-FM provinces
(MOH 2009).
21
   Although the actual wording of the revised PDO consists of two components with the objectives for
MOH and SSI capacity combined, this PDO achievement analysis splits these into two because the
objectives for the MOH and SSI were different, and there were separate indicators for each ministry.


                                                   17
based on these indicators, up to 40% of hospital revolving funds can be distributed to hospital
staff as supplementary payments. The system has also been expanded to PHC facilities.

APL1 funds supported the establishment of the new Performance Management department
through trainings, evaluations, and limited consultant services. Attributing causality in an APL,
which supports system-wide reforms, is difficult. In this case, the MOH financed the majority of
activities to develop the PBSP system through its general budget, but APL1 did provide support
through technical assistance and capacity building. The results from the PBSP system were quite
impressive though, so even limited attribution of results to APL1 would be significant. Total
supplementary payments for health staff salaries have increased from $0.76 billion to $1.79
billion in 2007, and total monthly remuneration for health workers, especially specialists and GPs
working in hospitals have increased substantially, on average a 77% increase for specialists as
shown in Figure 2.22

The increase in salaries for health workers was especially important to reduce the staff working
part-time or full-time in the private sector and to ultimately increase productivity in the public
sector. For individual health staff, these supplementary payments can range from 150% to 800%
of staff basic salaries (MOH 2009), and as a result, the ratio of full-time to part-time doctors has
improved dramatically since 2004 from 42% to 75% (see Figure 3). Most importantly, the PBSP
system has contributed greatly to an increase in the productivity and efficiency of specialists in
hospitals (although this increase cannot be attributed to the PBSP system alone, e.g., the number
of hospital exam rooms was increased under the HTP removing another supply side constraint).
Figure 4 shows that the number of examinations in public hospitals increased from 135 million in
2004 to 210 million in 2008. The productivity of specialists has likely increased as the number of
specialists has stayed relatively constant over the period and the number of examinations per
specialist has increased by 50%.23

22
   Latest data available as of ICR. Data for 2008 was being finalized by Performance Management and
Quality Development Department unit, and preliminary data suggest that supplementary payments
increased to slightly over 1.8 billion Euro.
23
   It is possible that the PBSP system, by incentivizing reporting of examinations, may have encouraged
more complete reporting of examinations. Thus, examinations in early years may be under-counted due to
previously unrecorded examinations.

Evidence of increased MOH capacity is also reflected in the development and adoption of the
2009-2013 strategic plan for multi-year budgeting and planning, which was supported by APL1
with consultant services and technical support. A Strategic Development Department was
established, along with a unit within this department to monitor achievement of strategic
indicators associated with the plan. An HR strategy was developed as part of the 2010-2014
strategic plan, which was submitted to the Minister of health for his clearance by project closing.

Finally, although not reflected in the outcome indicators, MOH capacity for regulation and
stewardship was also strengthened through studies conducted by the SPH. For example, the SPH
conducted a study on health work force jointly with the World Bank (Vujicic 2009), which was
important in providing evidence for formulating the HR strategy. The SPH also conducted an

assessment of a referral chain pilot in Isparta province that informed MOH policy to halt the
implementation of mandatory referral (due to health workforce constraints) (TUSAK 2009).

(b) Expand the capacity of the SSI to formulate and effectively implement health insurance
functions. Achievement of the second objective is satisfactory (see Annex 13). APL1 support
contributed to the MOLSS becoming no longer a service provider and the establishment of
Universal Health Insurance. APL1 project activities such as IT hardware and software, training
program development and direct trainings, and a public information campaign helped directly in
strengthening the SSI. With APL1 support, global budget prospective payments were also
established with all MOH hospitals.

It is important to note that the establishment of UHI was also supported by Programmatic Public
Sector Development Policy Loans (PPDPL) 1 and 2, which had prior actions of passage of two
laws: Law on the Social Security Institution and the Law on Social Insurance and Universal
Health Insurance. PPDPL2 also supported a common database and technological platform for
UHI. Thus, a combination of Bank instruments supported the UHI achievement.

Expansion of the Green Card program under the HTP had perhaps the largest impact on
increasing health insurance coverage among the poor, the final outcome indicator in Annex 13.
Once again, it is difficult to attribute the coverage results entirely to APL1, since project funds
were not utilized directly to finance activities (consultants or capacity building) directly related to
the expansion of the Green Card program. In terms of attribution, APL1 mainly provided policy
support for increasing coverage since increasing coverage was a Project objective and an
outcome indicator.

Figure 5 shows the increase in health insurance coverage for the poorest decile in Turkey.24 In the
Household Budget Survey (HBS) of 2003 prior to APL1, only 24% of the poorest decile had
health insurance, whereas by 2008 (the lastest HBS data), 82% of the poorest decile had
coverage. This significant increase in coverage is largely due to the increase in Green Card
coverage, from 12% to 62%. Overall, Green Card holders increased to 9.5 million by 2008 (14%
of the population), and this coverage expansion is perhaps largely because of an increase in the
benefits package (Aran and Hentschel 2010). In 2004, benefits were expanded to cover outpatient
services, and in 2005, benefits covered outpatient prescription drugs. Annex 14 shows the
increase in coverage for all deciles.25

24
   From Aran and Hentschel 2010 and the ICR author's calculations for 2007 and 2008. The authors find
little protective effect of this increase in coverage on catastrophic out of pocket expenditures, largely
because catastrophic expenditures are rare in Turkey.
25
   Table X also shows that despite the rapid rollout, targeting of the program has remained effective with
46% of the beneficiaries in the bottom decile (and 71% in the bottom quintile).

(c) Support the implementation of critical health services delivery reforms (family medicine and
hospital autonomy) with the objective of improving access, efficiency, quality and fiscal
sustainability of the health sector. Project achievement towards the final objective is rated
satisfactory, particularly with regards to the introduction of family medicine (see Annex 13). The
family medicine model, which was described earlier, was introduced in 33 provinces, more than
double the target number of provinces. Over 23.1 million people were enrolled in family
medicine in these provinces, which was a significant achievement, and the results in family
medicine can be directly attributed to APL1 since the Project financed much of the technical
assistance for the family medicine model (e.g., consultants to help with the model design and new
guidelines) and trainings for 6,557 family doctors.

The second family medicine indicator examines both PHC visits and referrals. Figure 6 shows the
average number of PHC visits in family medicine and non-family medicine provinces, with
separate lines for each cohort of family medicine provinces (year in which family medicine was
introduced). For example, the line with diamond markers shows the average number of PHC
visits for the 7 provinces where family medicine was introduced in 2007, and the dotted section


                                                   22
represents the period before family medicine introduction. Figure 6 shows an increasing trend in
the number of visits across all provinces (whether in family medicine provinces before family
medicine was actually introduced or in non-family medicine provinces), so simply taking the
difference in the average number of visits before and after the introduction of family medicine
would incorrectly attribute a larger increase in PHC visits to the introduction of family medicine.

Thus, a fixed-effects regression method was used to control for unobservables across provinces
and over time. Regression results examining the effects of family medicine introduction with a
one year lag are shown in Table 4 (i.e., introduction of family medicine in 2005 would lead to an
effect on PHC visits in 2006, not 2005). The first column shows a simple regression with no
controls, the second column adds year dummies to control for the improving time trend, and the
third column shows the fixed-effect regression results that control for fixed unobservable
characteristics across provinces. The results show that family medicine increased the number of
PHC visits per capita by 0.22, an 11% increase over the mean number of visits in 2005. Over a
longer period of family medicine implementation, consultations per capita may further increase.

The picture is different for referral rates, largely because of the unreliability of the referral rate
data since a mandatory referral chain was not established (see Figure 7). The spike in the
proportion of PHC visits that resulted in a referral for Duzce in 2006 was due to a piloting of the
mandatory referral chain. Because the ratio of patients to family medicine doctors is so high in
Turkey (1:3400 on average), a mandatory referral chain was piloted but then eliminated. The
referral chain would be established at a later stage when the number and capacity of family
medicine doctors had increased. Referral rates decreased in 33 provinces where family medicine
was introduced from 11.6% to 2.0% in 2009, but this decline cannot be attributed to the
introduction of family medicine. The regression results in Table 5 show that the introduction of
family medicine had little impact on referral rates, but again the data are generally unreliable and
in some provinces there were also spikes in referrals due to mandatory referral pilots.

Regarding the third outcome indicator, a hospital autonomy pilot was not conducted because the
pilot law was not passed. As discussed above, there were improvements in hospital authority and
decision-making, and a significant achievement with the PBSP system, which has been included
under the MOH stewardship objective.

3.3 Efficiency

Overall, efficiency before and after restructuring is rated satisfactory. The PAD did not have any
formal economic analysis with a net present value, economic rate of return, or cost effectiveness
calculation. As a result, efficiency objectives were never explicitly defined or a baseline
established. As with most health reform projects, a formal economic analysis has not been
conducted as part of the ICR because of the difficulty in rigorously attributing outcomes to
Project activities, particularly with the policy reform focus of the Project. However, many project
activities did contribute towards improving the efficiency of the health sector:

     ·   The PBSP system in hospitals increased the efficiency of specialists in hospitals with
         improvements in the number of examinations per specialist as seen in Figure 4. The
         PBSP system, along with other efficiency improvements in hospitals, also contributed to
         reducing the average length of stay for inpatients in all types of hospitals (see Table 6).
     ·   Several complementary reforms contributed to a substantial increase in the number of
         consultations per physician (including general practitioners), which increased from below
         2,500 in 2004 to above 3,500 in 2007, well above the OECD average of about 2,500 (see
         Figure 8).26 These reforms included the PBSP system, the negative incentives in the
         family medicine model, tripling of expenditure on preventive and primary care over this
         period, an increase in exam rooms, and additional financial incentives to work in
         deprived areas (Vujicic et al. 2009).
     ·   The family medicine model also included incentives for vaccination and other child
         health measures such as antenatal care and infant follow-up visits. Improvements in
         preventive care increase efficiency of the project as future health care costs are reduced
         and worker productivity in the long run are increased.

  Vujicic et al. (2009) cites 3 notes of caution on the increase in consultations per physician. First,
physician headcounts have been used, which does not account for changes in part-time work among
physicians. Second, physicians who switched to full-time may have brought private patients, who were
previously unrecorded, over to the public sector. Third, the PBSP system may have encouraged more
complete reporting of consultations than before.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

Because the Project was restructured, the overall outcome rating is a combination of the pre- and
post-restructuring outcome ratings. The pre-restructuring outcome rating is weighted 28%,
corresponding to the percentage of project funds that had been disbursed up to the time of the
restructuring. Table 7 summarizes the pre- and post-restructuring outcome ratings, which
combine the assessments of Relevance + Achievement + Efficiency, weighted 25%, 50%, and
25%, respectively. Achievement of PDOs has been weighted higher because of the importance,
particularly in a policy and technical assistance project, in achieving the objectives and
indicators.27

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

APL1 contributed to positive impacts for the poor, particularly with the substantial increase in
health insurance coverage. Annex 14 shows that health insurance coverage increased to an
additional 16 million people from 2003-2008, with dramatic increases in coverage among the
three poorest deciles--from 24% to 82% for the poorest decile, 38% to 81% for the next decile,
and 27% to 81% for the third poorest decile. The introduction of family medicine likely increased


27
  The ICR guidelines do not provide guidance for how to evaluate the factors of relevance, achievement,
and efficiency. Weights were used to reduce the subjectivity of overall ratings before and after
restructuring.


                                                     26
access and quality of care in poorer and more rural areas as well, although no data was available
to specifically analyze this issue.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project was focused on institutional strengthening and has made a significant impact on both
the MOH and MOLSS/SSI. The MOH and its affiliated institutions have been able to utilize
project resources more effectively to build capacity, particularly through establishing the
Strategic Development Department and the Performance Management and Quality Development
Department. Both of these departments play important roles in the Turkish health sector and will
continue to do so in the future. The capacity and role of the SPH was also strengthened under
APL1. The health information system also provides an infrastructure for evidence-based
policymaking and facilitating data and transactions.

Capacity of the MOLSS/SSI has been strengthened to a lesser extent, primarily because of the
delays with legislation to establish the SSI, in consistent institutional leadership, and in project
management. Gains were still made, however, in later years particularly through extensive
training and in support to the IT infrastructure.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

No unintended outcomes or impacts were measured or identified during the ICR.

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcomes achieved through APL1 is rated as Moderate. The Project
primarily financed capacity building and institutional strengthening, and the MOH and its
affiliates were able to utilize project resources well for technical assistance and training. As a
result, many of the Project outcomes will likely be sustained because capacity was developed
directly within line agencies and not in separate project teams. For example, as discussed above,
the Strategic Planning Department has enhanced its capacity for strategic planning and multi-year
budgeting for the MOH.

Capacity of the SSI was strengthened to a lesser extent, and a risk to UHI and financial
sustainability of the health sector is the frequent organizational changes in SSI. Although UHI
was established, the implementation of UHI may be at risk if there continue to be organization
and leadership changes. The Government is aware of this risk and has included an SSI
component in HTSSRP for capacity building and UHI implementation.

Financial sustainability of the health sector is a risk that could affect the APL1 reforms. SSI
continues to run substantial deficits, which have increased from 9.5 million â to 14.3 million â in
2009 (3.27% of GDP).28 As discussed earlier, Green Card expenditures have increased
substantially. At the same time, global economic and financial developments have the potential

to also affect the financial and political space to sustain the health sector reforms. The
Government is aware of this risk, and expenditure caps have been put on hospitals and
pharmaceutical prices to begin to address financial sustainability.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The main strengths in quality at entry were extensive background work, a Project design that
supported critical health system reforms, and a clear rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank
team engaged effectively over many years with the Government to design a large-scale health
reform project, addressing the key components related to health system underperformance.

There were two shortcomings, however. The first was an M&E framework with weaknesses and
inconsistencies, as described earlier. In particular, the responsibility and roles for M&E remained
unclear, leading to the establishment of an M&E coordination unit that has perhaps delayed the
establishment of a centralized, systematic M&E unit. Second, the team did not adequately
mitigate risks, particularly regarding coordination between the MOH and MOLSS and the
implementation arrangements. Given the mixed track record of Bank-financed projects in Turkey,
greater attention to capacity building activities for the project teams could have been conducted
during preparation (e.g., selecting a Management Consultant Firm).

A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was conducted prior to project appraisal, but some of the
QER panel's key recommendations were not incorporated into the final design. The panel
suggested simplifying the final design, revising indicators, clarifying the governance of the future
SSI, and improving implementation arrangements (e.g., Technical Working Groups would not
provide enough accountability for results).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team before restructuring provided strong technical support and proactively identified
implementation issues such as the lack of an integrated IT system and project management
challenges. The main shortcoming was that technical disagreements between the Bank team and
the MOH affected the working relationship between the two sides, but these disagreements were
based on sound technical arguments that the team made in efforts to achieve the Project
objectives. Overall, the team provided strong due diligence support and generally engaged
effectively with the MOH and MOLSS on policy issues.

The new Bank team provided satisfactory support to implementation. First, the team took full
advantage of the MTR, identifying opportunities and resolving key issues such as changes in
Government priorities. Second, the project was officially restructured in July 2007, providing an
opportunity to respond to changes in the political economy and in Government priorities. Third,
the new Bank team was praised extensively by the Government for facilitating project
implementation through effective communication and dialogue. This improved communication
was partly due to frequent missions by the new Bank team, so that any difficulties or challenges
in implementation could be resolved in person in Turkey. Perhaps most importantly, through
project supervision, the Bank team engaged continuously with the MOH and SSI on a wide-
variety of health and social security policy and technical issues.


                                                 28
There were, nevertheless, some shortcomings in supervision after restructuring regarding M&E.
As discussed earlier, there was inconsistent reporting on indicators, and the lack of some baseline
data was never corrected during supervision. The team did, however, work with the PMSU to
regularly report on outcome indicators, which helped to assess the achievement of results.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the analysis above, overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The key reasons are:
   · Continuous engagement by all Bank teams on key health policy issues, ranging from
       family medicine introduction to social security reform to provider payment reform. APL1
       was an important vehicle for policy dialogue on health issues, leading to other health
       sector work such as an extensive OECD-World Bank health system review on Turkey in
       2008, the current health sector performance assessment, and HTSSRP.
   · High-quality background analysis and preparatory work conducted to determine the key
       activities to reform the health system
   · Excellent client engagement and communication after the MTR greatly facilitated project
       implementation and a strong partnership between the Bank and the MOH
   · Proactive due diligence and identification of implementation challenges by all Bank
       teams

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the MOH and MOLSS/SSI are rated Satisfactory. MOH performance was
highly satisfactory as commitment to the health reform and ownership of the project remained
high throughout the life of the Project (except for the brief period when project ownership
declined due to relationship issues with the Bank). Ownership and implementation progress
increased substantially when project management and budget authority were transferred directly
to the line agencies, and the MOH ensured that the units had the key staff and capacity to utilize
project resources. While centralized M&E remains an issue, the MOH was able to effectively
implement the health reform through extensive field visits and monitoring of the M&E
coordination unit.

MOLSS/SSI did have moderate shortcomings in performance, mostly stemming from uncertainty
around organizational design in the early years and then frequent organization and leadership
changes in the later years of the Project.

The Government provided a strong enabling environment, especially politically as several
important laws were passed such as the family medicine pilot law, legislation to monitor quality
as part of the PBSP system, establishment of SSI, establishment of UHI, and more. When some
political reforms could not be met (e.g., MOH restructuring), the MOH focused on incremental
reforms such as strategic planning and improving quality regulation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                                29
Performance of the PMSU, PIU of SSI, and the implementing line agencies is rated Satisfactory.
Implementation was slow in the first two years of the project because of weak capacity for
implementation and lack of qualified staff. PIUs for the MOH and MOLSS were not adequately
staffed until the MTR, and even then project management capacity remained low.

MOH performance improved significantly after the MTR and restructuring with new
implementation arrangements and with a new PMSU director, and the performance of both the
PMSU and the MOH line agencies was highly satisfactory. The PMSU provided timely and
efficient procurement, financial management, and project management support to the line
agencies. With increased ownership under new implementation arrangements, the MOH line
agencies were able to effectively utilize project funds to support their reform activities.

MOLSS/SSI performance remained slow until late in the project, largely due to the organizational
and leadership changes. PIU capacity to utilize project resources was not high and no funds were
utilized until late 2007 when a new Project Coordinator was appointed for the PIU. Thereafter,
performance improved substantially.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the analysis above, overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Several lessons emerge from APL1:

       ·   Strong Government ownership is critical, particularly with health reform projects.
           Health reform not only concerns technical, health-related changes but relies heavily on
           the political process. In APL1, Government ownership and commitment were crucial in
           the passage of key laws such as family medicine and UHI. APL1 was linked entirely to
           the Government's HTP, which helped to build ownership.

       ·   Long-term engagement. Health sector reforms often take 5-10 years, and the Bank should
           adopt a longer-term approach in its support. Instruments such as APLs offer the ability to
           provide long-term support and apply lessons learned from previous phases.

       ·   Policy learning rather than policy borrowing.29 APL1 focused on capacity building and
           technical assistance, rather than a traditional investment project, which had previously
           been implemented poorly in Turkey. Technical knowledge and expertise from
           international experts and the Bank helped to build capacity in Turkey for more
           sustainable achievements in the health sector.

       ·   Results framework indicators should be more specific and applied more consistently.
           Lack of clarity in indicators means that indicators are subject to different interpretations.
           In APL1, some indicators referring to policy achievements or capacity building measures
           could have been more specific. Indicators should not be seen as purely for accountability
           or evaluation; instead, they should be used as a management tool for continuous


29
     This phrase is borrowed from Deputy Undersecretary Sabahattin Aydin.


                                                    30
        performance monitoring and feedback. Similarly, the agreed set of indicators should be
        consistently applied in order to reinforce the objectives of the project.

    ·   Client engagement should be more consistent within the Bank. Individual TTLs have
        great flexibility in the way they engage with Government and other partners. In this
        Project, implementation performance improved dramatically after the MTR, in part
        because of the change in TTL and a better client relationship. While it is natural to expect
        some differences in client interactions with different TTLs, the Bank as an institution
        would benefit from greater consistency in engaging with clients. At some other
        institutions and consulting firms, there is often greater consistency in client engagement,
        thereby reducing the variance that may occur with leadership changes.

    ·   Flexibility in responding to changing demands is an important feature to increase chance
        of results achievements. APL1 was restructured after the MTR when only 7% of the loan
        had been disbursed. Restructuring provided a flexible response to the Government's
        changing priorities. In APL1, there was flexibility in the sequencing of reforms, with
        delays for MOH restructuring and hospital autonomy, while family medicine introduction
        was accelerated.

       of the Strategy Development Presidency came to the agenda
   · With the transition to the strategic plan period and performance-based budgeting, great
       benefits resulted with respect to implementing and auditing the annual activities of the
       Ministry, questioning the success levels and reaching the optimum expenditure level
   · The draft strategic plan for 2010­2014 was taken as the basis for the design of HTSSRP.
       Its objectives were integrated with the draft plan and this facilitated the project and
       increased the success of MOH implementations significantly

     medical devices and submitted to MOH senior management.
  · Adequate trainings were conducted to ensure effectiveness, efficiency and performance
     in implementation after the establishment of the NPMDA.

A.3. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK OF THE AUTONOMOUS
HEALTH FACILITIES

Objectives:
   · To increase the performance and quality of health services to ensure accountability,
       transparency and access to service.
   · To develop and implement the performance-based monitoring and auditing system of the
       health service delivery.
   · To establish a new Hospital Performance Evaluation Unit within MOH to implement this
       system.

Implementation:
   · Provincial performance and quality coordination units were established in Provincial
      Health Directorates.
   · "Health Performance and Quality Directive" was published.
   · Quality standards set were prepared for 112 Emergency Health Services and Mouth and
      Dental Health Centers.
   · Implementation guidelines were prepared to be used by the agencies during the process
      of meeting Service Quality Standards.
   · The implementation of hospital classification through "Ministerial Service Quality
      Document" according to the predetermined standards was initiated.

      Improvement in Hospitals) project, executed by WHO European Region Office, were
      finalized.
   · International Congress of Health Performance and Quality was conducted with the main
      theme of "Staff Promotion and Patient Safety".

Outcome assessment:
   · In order to improve service quality in secondary and tertiary level health facilities in
      HTP, health-specific quality standards were formed, audit structure was designed,
      qualified human power was trained and field implementations were made.
   · Under the leadership of MOH quality coordination unit, preset national-specific health
      standards were developed and trainings were conducted throughout the country.
   · Ministerial central organization, provincial health directorate teams and hospital
      managers audited and reported the activities of the hospital quality units. GD of Curative
      Services planned the training activities according to the outcomes of those audits.



                                               46
    ·   While executing those works, MOH gathered the works in the area of quality and
        performance under one body and established the Department of Performance and Quality
        Development. Shortly afterwards, performance and quality development directive was
        published and each health procedure practiced in health service delivery was graded so as
        to set the basis for the performance-fee, and the health professionals were supported with
        the revolving fund proceeds based on their performance scores they obtained within the
        framework of the services they delivered every month. The hospitals restructured their
        activities according to the performance-based pricing, and paved the way for the full
        participation of the personnel for service delivery improvements.
    ·   Within the scope of HTP, the revolving fund implementation has had a significant
        motivating effect on health professionals. Revolving funds were established in primary
        care just like the secondary and tertiary cares, and performance-based supplementary
        payment implementation was introduced for primary care workers, increasing quality and
        performance of the primary care services.

Gains:
   · Quality improvement was maintained in secondary and tertiary care services in Turkey
       within the scope of HTP.
   · Patients' access to health services got easier, the appointment durations got shorter, and
       total improvements were seen in overall health services. Significant improvements were
       made in staff and patient safety. Patient satisfaction and staff satisfaction increased.
   · Through the revolving funds in secondary and tertiary care, each hospital made its own
       financial plan and organized its expenditures according to its income, which increased
       medical and managerial performance.
   · Hospital managements exhibited more cost-effective works. The hospitals were audited
       periodically within the context of quality and performance, and as a result quality and
       performance improved.

A.4. HEALTH REFORM IMPLEMENTATION AND ESTABLISHING MONITORING
AND EVALUATION CAPACITY

Objectives:
   · To monitor and report the countrywide implementation outcomes of the policies
       implemented under PTH
   · To share the outcomes of the monitoring and evaluation activity performed by the field
       coordination implementation with the ministerial management and to increase the
       decision making capacity.
   · To use the data obtained from regular program monitoring for health service delivery
       improvement through local consultant, international technical assistance and training.

Implementation:
   · M&E Coordination Unit started the field coordination implementation.
   · For the effective monitoring and evaluation of the health services, trainings were given
      by international institutions to build monitoring and evaluation capacity.

Outcome assessment and Gains:
   · The field coordinators who were recruited as national consultants observed the
      countrywide implementation of the activities planned within the scope of the PTH, the
      problems of the regions on site, and evaluated them with the local managers and reported
      them rapidly and informed the senior management of MOH.


                                               47
    ·   As a result of the field coordination work, PTH attained more effective, more rapid and
        more successful implementation outcomes.

A.5. BUILDING HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR THE MOH

Objectives: To develop the data structure and platform of the health information system, to
design the system, to realize the system software and to carry out the pilot tests of this design, to
identify and meet all training needs under this system.

Implementation:
   · Tele-Medicine Project,
   · Disaster Coordination Center
   · Health-NET, (creating electronic health records)
   · Central Hospital Appointment System

The systems above were financed directly with project resources, but the project also indirectly
supported the same consultants, who were separately financed by the MOH on the following
systems:
    · Green Card Information System,
    · Organ Waiting Lists,
    · Newborn Hearing Screenings,
    · Performance Follow-up System
    · Family Medicine Information System,

Outcome assessment:
   · MOH started and activated the Health-Net implementation in order to collect, store and
      provide users with data generated in the provincial health directorates and hospitals
      throughout the country. Various general directorates and departments can obtain the
      information and data they need from this system directly or by forming an interface.
   · Any kind of information pertaining to the MOH personnel is recorded in the electronic
      environment and thus available.
   · The stock status of the MOH hospitals can be reviewed in the electronic environment.
   · The MOH hospitals passed to the uniform accounting system and they are reachable in
      the electronic environment.
   · "National Health Data Dictionary" was formed in order to ensure unity in terminology to
      reach information from data. "Health Indicators Data Dictionary" was formed in order to
      be able to reach the health indicators of service delivery in the electronic environment.
   · The health service data gathered from the field are stored in the electronic environment
      and can be reported when necessary.

Gains:
   · The Department of Information Processing (DIP) is the unit which has recruited the
       highest number of consultants under the project. High-quality human resources who
       could not be recruited from public resources began to serve as consultants, in the MOH.
   · The MOH has had the IT infrastructure, hardware and software which are to ensure great
       benefits for providing health services.
   · It has become the first body which has developed implementations for the "disaster"
       concept in the public sector.




                                                  48
    ·   National standards were formed through Health-Net, and the harmonization with
        international standards was initiated.
    ·   Hospitals were enabled to use joint informatics standards
    ·   All hospitals affiliated to the MOH became online within the scope of the hospital
        information system.
    ·   Any kind of information pertaining to the MOH personnel is recorded in the electronic
        environment and thus available.
    ·   Senior and medium level management of the MOH had easier access to the required data
        with the implementation of the Health-NET, which contributed to policy making.

B. BUILDING INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE FUND AND
UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE

Objectives: To implement social security reform and establish universal health insurance through
capacity building

B.1. CAPACITY BUILDING OF SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION

Implementation: Supporting SSI's capacity building and institutional restructuring including
minimum service package support ; Strategic Planning and developing and implementing
business plan, public relations and IT, for basic health services defining and implementing

C. REORGANIZING THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES

C.1. INTRODUCING FAMILY MEDICINE FOR PRIMARY HEALTH CARE

Objectives:
   · To initiate family medicine implementation in order to:,
       - To modernize PHC services and improve the service quality,
       - To effectively conduct the patient referral from the PHC and to reduce the patient
            burden in secondary and tertiary healthcare,
       - To facilitate the access to PHC services, to establish an effective system for the
            follow-up and treatment of immunization, pregnant follow-up, child health and
            chronic diseases,
   · To conduct the pilot implementations of the family medicine system and to share and
       evaluate the outcomes,
   · To establish the required informatics, legislation and physical infrastructure for the
       transition to the family medicine gradually in the whole country,




                                               49
Implementation:
   · Family medicine pilot implementations were started in Düzce province upon the
      enactment of the family medicine pilot law by the legislative agency. Following one year
      implementation, outcomes were interpreted successfully and transition to the family
      medicine gradually in the whole country was decided.
   · As of 30 June 2009, the date that the 1st Phase of HTP was concluded, family medicine
      was introduced in 33 provinces in Turkey.
   · Significant improvement in health indicators and patient satisfaction was seen in the
      provinces that family medicine was introduced compared to the earlier years.
   · Within the scope of family medicine implementations, the Family Medicine Department
      under the Ministry was planned to conduct the execution of the implementation. A central
      structure was established including 6 branches, 20 personnel which also employ training
      and research coordinators within the scope of the project.

Outcome assessment:
   · The fact that the establishment of provincial units and central units were conducted
      simultaneously in the family medicine,implementation slowed down and reduced the
      auditing activities.
   · Country-wide planning of the family medicine implementations, providing trainings,
      conducting provincial family medicine contracts were learned through experience by the
      Ministry and this led to delays in the implementations.
   · Country-wide implementation was planned to be introduced by 2009 June, but could only
      be put into effect in 33 provinces.
   · The family medicine information system continues to work actively, however, the
      adequate review and reporting of the data in this system could not be conducted yet.
   · The vaccination rates increased, the treatment of acute diseases and the follow-up of
      chronic diseases were conducted more effectively in the provinces where family
      medicine implementation is in effect. It was observed that the pregnant follow-up and 0-1
      age group baby follow-up were improved as qualitatively and quantitatively.
   · Because the number of physicians working under the MOH in Turkey is not adequate it is
      not possible to conduct an efficient patient referral chain network.
   · This implementation obstructed the decrease in the patient burden in secondary and
      tertiary hospitals and affected negatively the objectives of the project within this scope.
      However, this situation which is a result of a political decision of the Ministry's senior
      administration is not stemming from the inadequacy of the project.
   · The 1st phase trainings were meticulously conducted and the certification of the family
      physicians was accomplished in the provinces where the family medicine was introduced.

Gains:
   · Since this was the first time family medicine was introduced in Turkey, administrative
       capacity was initially low. After implementation, medium and low level administrators
       as well as Ministry personnel who did not have a comprehensive training in national and
       international context before, had gained significant administration skills.
   · Significant experience was gained in relation to the auditing of the family physicians'
       services and the reviewing of the reports. Important data were acquired using the family
       medicine information system.
   · As the number of the provinces increased, the family medicine transition rate,
       implementation success and patient satisfaction increased.




                                               50
C.2. INTRODUCING AUTONOMIZATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS

Objectives:
   · To increase the quality and performance of hospital health services,
   · To make the hospital administrations efficient and successful,
   · To ensure the financial management of hospitals to have an autonomous structure,
   · To build administrative and financial control capacity in autonomous hospital structures,
   · To increase the managerial capacity in relation to human resources, medical service
       delivery, finance and accounting performance in autonomous hospital structures.

Implementation:
   · For the purpose of making the MOH's state hospitals autonomous structures, the required
      legal arrangement was prepared by the Ministry and sent to the legislative body. The
      General Directorate of Curative Services started the work on regulatory legislation that
      will be required after the enactment of the draft law.
   · 110 hospitals and 45 dispensaries of SSK were transferred to the MOH in 2005. With this
      implementation, Social Security Institution was taken out from the delivery of service
      and directed to the financing of the service.
   · In relation to the changes that will emerge after the legal arrangement, information
      sharing was performed with the administrative staff of hospitals.

Outcomes:
   · The draft law which was prepared and sent to the legislative body in 2006 and awaiting
      discussion in the assembly has taken longer than expected.As a result, there have been
      delays in project implementation. The passage of the draft law was still pending, as of
      June 2009.
   · All health institutions and organizations were brought together under the roof of the
      MOH throughout Turkey; and so, efficient, productive and qualified service delivery was
      performed. Patient satisfaction increased.

Gains:
   · After the performed works, though no legal arrangement was achieved in the autonomous
       hospital implementation, the ministry and hospitals were ensured to raise awareness on
       this matter.

C.3. PUBLIC AWARENESS AND COMMUNICATION

Objectives: To provide support to the health sector reform and to strengthen the Public Relations
(PR) Unit of the MOH through public awareness and communication interventions.

Implementation: This component was implemented by the Press and Public Relations
Consultancy Unit. The implementations performed to achieve the targets were met from the
MOH's own budget, not from the project resources. Within the scope of the Public Awareness
and Communication, MOH Communication Center (SABIM) was established and media
broadcasts were made to raise public awareness and inform the public.




                                               51
C.4. STRENGTHENING POPULATION HEALTH PROGRAMS

    ·   Population Health Grant Program Operational Manual was renewed in March 2006.
    ·   The meeting on the "Existing Situation, Ongoing Programs and Plans in Turkey on
        Surveillance System and its Compliance with International Institutions and Agencies"
        was held in 23-24 November 2006. The current problems, implementations, plans and
        international standards were discussed at the meeting and information was exchanged
        between the MOH units and the other relevant agencies. This meeting was a step towards
        reviewing and assessing the National Surveillance System, updating the system and
        adjusting it to the current conditions.
    ·   MOH senior management decided not to continue to the activities implemented under
        "Population Health Fund". The Ministry also approved the decision about not
        implementing the grant works that were planned to be implemented by two NGOs.
    ·   Those decisions made by the Ministry were informed to the World Bank officially in the
        Semiannual Progress Report (June 2007).

        the whole country during the II. Phase of HTP.
    ·   Capacity was built to measure and assess the quality of health services.
    ·   New international implementations were adopted by our country as a result of the
        increased international relations; in addition, our country-specific implementations were
        begun to be shared with other countries.

III. PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK

A. MOH

Becoming effective in 28 July 2004, the project was revised and restructured in 2007. As a result
of both the restructuring of the project and changing of the WB team leader of the project and
also the changes within PMSU in 2007, project implementations and the disbursements increased
significantly.

Bank's performance for the I. Phase was considered positive in general; however, the following
feedback was received from the implementing units (responsible for the project components):

    ·   Faster evaluation of the ToRs by the Bank is of great importance for project
        implementation,
    ·   Shortening the time of the Bank's procurement processes will help the project to proceed
        faster,
    ·   Further increased communication in each stage of the project will influence the general
        success of the project in a positive direction,
    ·   Developing different standards in relation to some procurement items (i.e. procurement
        of IT equipments and recruitment of consultants) or doing revisions in some rules or
        procedures will enable the units to reach the required resources faster and in a more
        qualified manner,


                                                55
   ·     In some specific cases, regarding the procurement and obtaining no-objection, the bank
         officials should use their initiative in favor of the Borrower for the functionality of the
         project.

B. SSI

Lack of Technical Support: During the implementation of HTP, the Bank provided
insufficient technical assistance to SSI. At the very beginning of the Project there was not
even an activity plan. As a result, there were gaps and non-directional status during
implementation. Other than support from local Bank staff, lack of major support from the
Bank prevented successful restructuring of the SSI component.

Lack of Coordination: Credibility of decision making staff of SSI was ignored. As a
result of disbursement-centered supervision, thematic and professional credibility could
not achieved. A negative image results which could not be corrected due to none or few
ice-breaking activities. As a result, necessary communication and cooperation could not
be established between the Bank and senior management. Short-term effects have been
observed clearly during the project preparation phase of Health Transition and Social
Security Reform project.

IV. LESSONS LEARNED (FROM SSI)

Management Sustainability: Even though project components and objectives are
established by legal documents, there exists no strategy nor any mechanisms for
management sustainability. The longer a project, the riskier the managerial sustainability.
In HTP, there were major changes in project management during implementation from
every side, including the Borrower and the Bank. Although it was described as a risk in
the PAD, successful risk management was not conducted. Foreseen risks realized to a
great extent, and managerial discontinuity was an issue. Frequent managerial changes and
legislative delays affected the project and caused fractures in the implementation.

Annex 11. Program and Project Indicators

Program Indicators

The original program-level indicators, which were intended to be achieved by the end of Phase II
(FY08-FY11, now HTSSRP) were:
   (i) Maternal Mortality Ratio is on course to reach the target of ¾ reduction by 2015.
   (ii) Child mortality rate is on course to reach the target of 2/3 reduction by 2015.
   (iii) Significant reduction in discrepancy in MMR and IMR by region, urban/rural, and
           income quintiles.
   (iv) Economic barriers to access to and use of essential health services covered by UHI are
           eliminated.
   (v) Outpatient and inpatient service use indicators converge towards EU average by end of
           project.
   (vi) Physicians' choice of family medicine as a mode of practice increased.
   (vii) Increase in total and public health expenditures in line with country's economic
           development.
   (viii) Reliance on subsidy from the consolidated budget for balancing the UHIF budget
           reduced.
   (ix) Institutional and legal framework of the health and social security sector is in full
           compliance with the acquis communautaire as a pre-condition for EU accession.

During the 2007 restructuring, the program indicators were revised as follows:
   (i) Significant reduction in discrepancy in the burden of disease (BOD) for key
         communicable and non-communicable diseases by age, gender, region, urban/rural and
         income quintiles
   (ii) Improved targeting of public resources for health
   (iii) Increased use of cost-effective health services among disadvantaged populations
   (iv) Fiscal sustainability of UHI addressed (no accumulation of debt or arrears, balance
         between revenues and expenditures)
   (v) Increase in total and public health expenditures in line with country's economic
         development
   (vi) Improved allocative and technical efficiency of health services (spending on preventive
         and primary health care services, bed/population ratio, occupancy rate, admission rate)
         Increased user and provider satisfaction with health services

Additional Discrepancies in PDO and indicators

In addition to the discrepancies described in Section 1.2, in the PAD project data sheet, B.3, and
in the initial ISRs, the PDO was also described with the the following "specific objectives": (i) re-
structure MOH for more effective stewardship and policy making; (ii) establish a universal health
insurance fund; (iii) introduce family medicine as the model for the provision of primary health
care services; (iv) ensure financial and managerial autonomy for all public hospitals irrespective
of ownership; and (v) set up a fully computerized health and social security information system.
The ICR does not include these specific objectives as part of the PDO because: (i) these
objectives were not officially part of the PDO as per the original or restructured Loan Agreement,
and (ii) they are similar to the key outcome indicators.




                                                 61
There were unfortunately different sets of outcome indicators in both the PAD and Loan
Agreements. In the attachment to Supplemental Letter No. 2 and Annex 3 of the PAD, a different
set of indicators was listed in the "Arrangements for results monitoring" table when compared to
those in the "Performance Monitoring Indicators" table. The alternative indicators were: (i) A
new MOH organizational model including national drugs and medical devices agency, a policy
and M&E unit, an accreditation and quality assurance unit and reactivated School of Public
Health, (ii) Legal, regulatory and institutional arrangements for the introduction of family
medicine is in place and a pilot model is implemented, (iii) Legal, regulatory and institutional
arrangements for the financial autonomy of public hospitals is in place, (iv) Legal, regulatory and
institutional arrangements for the new universal health insurance fund is in place, (v)
Infostructure agreed upon by all MOH and MOLSS and plot tested.32 These other outcome
indicators had baselines, and the original team monitored these indicators in the first four ISRs
(#3-6). These outcome indicators were dropped by the new project team after the Mid-Term
Review (MTR), and the "Performance Monitoring Indicators " are listed as the "original" in the
Restructuring Paper.

Output Indicators

There were no discrepancies in the original intermediate output indicators:

Intermediate output indicators
1) MOH restructured
2) NPMDA established
3) Quality Assurance and Accreditation systems established
4) M&E System operational
5) Universal Health Insurance established

administration, health economics and financing, flagship programs, rational drug use,
epidemiological intelligence service, and population health
13) The newly developed health and social security information systems are successfully tested.

The revised output indicators are:

Intermediate output indicators

8) Plan for new surveillance system developed

32
  The program indicators also differed in the "Arrangements for results monitoring" table with four
indicators instead of nine.

Annex 15. Restructured Project Components

The "Before Restructuring" allocation is from the PAD and includes the Borrower contribution (an additional 11.86 million), whereas
the "After Restructuring" allocation is from the Project Restructuring Paper which does not include the Borrower's contribution. Thus,
the figures are not directly comparable and should be used for indicative purposes. After restructuring there were additional
reallocations and loan cancellations (see Section 1.7) which would further revise the final percentages. Please note that the Borrower's
contribution to project financing was reduced substantially by a loan amendment in March 2006.
