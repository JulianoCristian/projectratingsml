outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: strong Government ownership is critical,\n            particularly with health reform projects. Health reform not\n            only concerns technical, health-related changes but relies\n            heavily on the political process. In First Adaptable Program\n            Loan (APL1), Government ownership and commitment were\n            crucial in the passage of key laws such as family medicine\n            and Universal Health Insurance (UHI). APL1 was linked\n            entirely to the Government's HTP, which helped to build\n            ownership. Long-term engagement. Health sector reforms often\n            take 5-10 years, and the Bank should adopt a longer-term\n            approach in its support. Instruments such as APLs offer the\n            ability to provide long-term support and apply lessons\n            learned from previous phases. Policy learning rather than\n            policy borrowing. APL1 focused on capacity building and\n            technical assistance, rather than a traditional investment\n            project, which had previously been implemented poorly in\n            Turkey. Technical knowledge and expertise from international\n            experts and the Bank helped to build capacity in Turkey for\n            more sustainable achievements in the health sector. Results\n            framework indicators should be more specific and applied\n            more consistently. Lack of clarity in indicators means that\n            indicators are subject to different interpretations. In\n            APL1, some indicators referring to policy achievements or\n            capacity building measures could have been more specific.\n            Indicators should not be seen as purely for accountability\n            or evaluation; instead, they should be used as a management\n            tool for continuous performance monitoring and feedback.\n            Similarly, the agreed set of indicators should be\n            consistently applied in order to reinforce the objectives of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2010-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
