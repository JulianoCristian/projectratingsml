By means of these\n            measures, the project is expected to reduce the average time\n            to process civil, criminal and other cases in the courts of\n            El Salvador. The project is especially aimed at\n            strengthening the management capacity of the judicial\n            branch, modernizing the court system, promoting access to\n            justice and transparency, developing professional skills\n            among officials and employees; and finally, supporting the\n            management, monitoring and evaluation of judicial processes.\n            The project is expected to improve regulations providing an\n            adequate environment for investment and trade, making\n            justice more accessible to all citizens, especially the\n            poorest. Additionally, better contract enforcement is\n            expected, thereby benefiting small businesses. Salvadorans\n            who live in remote areas will benefit from legal information\n            and assistance \u0096among other services\u0096 which will be provided\n            to them through the Internet page of the judicial branch and\n            accessible local information networks."}, "docdt": "2007-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
