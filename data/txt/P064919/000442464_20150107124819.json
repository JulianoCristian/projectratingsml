Through\n            lending and non-lending operations, the International Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has accompanied\n            this process and continues supporting the country's\n            economic and social agenda. During the recent global crisis,\n            El Salvador was seriously affected due to its strong\n            linkages with the United States (U.S.) economy. As a result,\n            the Salvadoran economy suffered a historic recession and\n            poverty gains were partially lost. The Bank and other\n            multilaterals became critical partners in confronting such a\n            difficult period."}, "docdt": "2010-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
