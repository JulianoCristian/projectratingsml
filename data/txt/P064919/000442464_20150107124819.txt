 El Salvador: Moving Forward
 Government Response to Global Crisis

 SYNOPSIS
  Coming out of a costly decade-long civil war in the 1980s, El Salvador has experienced substantial
  progress in terms of its economic and social performance. Poverty levels were reduced from around 65
  percent at the beginning of the 1990s to 35.5 percent in 2007. Through lending and non-lending
  operations, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has accompanied this
  process and continues supporting the country’s economic and social agenda. During the recent global
  crisis, El Salvador was seriously affected due to its strong linkages with the U.S. economy. As a result,
  the Salvadoran economy suffered a historic recession and poverty gains were partially lost. The Bank
  and other multilaterals became critical partners in confronting such a difficult period.
