                         This ISR reports on progress and issues observed during a supervision mission that took place from September 27th to October8th, 2010. Specific attention was given to the status of
                         critical activities that are being undertaken and need to be completed by the upcoming closing date currently scheduled for November 30, 2010.

                         Most noteworthy issues since the last ISR dated June 2010, are summarized as follows:

                         1. Soyapango Integrated Judicial Center: Despite the significant progress observed during the last mission on the design of an automated case-management system and judicial
                         information framework to support the Center's operations, actual development of the associated software proved to be more difficult than expected and delays are now likely to occur.
                         At this point, considering existing delays, it is likely that the project might not be able to be completed by the loan's closing date. The Bank and authorities have agreed on a detailed
                         work plan in order to complete the project on time but, given the current circumstances, an alternative plan was also discussed. Judiciary authorities have indicated their intention to
                         provide with the necessary resources to complete the project in case an extension is needed. The Bank will continue to provide support although it was agreed the Loan will close as
                         scheduled.

                         2. Other ongoing activities including: a) the Judicial Documentation Center; b) the Access to Information and Transparency project; and c) training and dissemination activities;
                         continue to be on track and will be completed by the time of the project closing date.
