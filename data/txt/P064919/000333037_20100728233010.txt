SUMMARY
The proposed changes consist of distributing the remaining amount between different
categories and increasing percentages of expenditures to be financed, ensuring better
execution. These changes will have no impact on the objective and activities of the
project, but will allow a more efficient use of the resources for the client in the final
stretch of the project.



PROJECT STATUS

A project extension of the closing date from June 2010 to November 30, 2010 was
approved, which is allowing the completion of some critical activities, especially related
to the design and development an automated case-management system to support
Soyapango Integrated Judicial Center.

To date, significant progress is observed with regard to the design and development of an
automated case-management system and judicial information framework to support the
Center´s operations. The contracted consulting firm has successfully completed phase
one (corresponding to the development of a work plan) whereas phase two (analysis of
procedures and work processes of the Integrated Judicial Center) is almost complete and
phase three (system development) is in progress. There is also significant progress in the
implementation of the Design, development and deployment platform for the Judicial
Documentation Centre of the Supreme Court of Justice of El Salvador.

The Government has requested to carry out a reallocation of the funds and change in the
percentage of expenditures for items so to be financed in each Category.


PROPOSED CHANGES
The proposed reallocation of proceeds across expenditure categories and changes in the
percentage of financing for each category consists of distributing the remaining amount
between different categories and increasing the percentages of expenditures to be
financed to 90% in local expenditures of goods, foreign and local expenditures of
consultant services, training and operating costs, in order to cover the costs of activities

under the Action Plan 2010 and to ensure better execution (please see Annex 1 for
specific details).

The proposed reallocation of proceeds across expenditure categories and changes in the
percentage of financing for each category is needed to allow a more efficient use of
remaining funds in the final stretch of the project. These changes will have no impact on
the objective of the project, but will allow a more efficient use of the resources for the
client in the final stretch of the project. Activities to be financed under the new allocation
of funds are in line with agreed action plan for the project.

A project extension of the closing date from June 2010 to November 30, 2010 was
approved, which is allowing the completion of some critical activities related to the
strengthening of institutional management capacity of the Judicial Branch, access to
justice services, transparency and citizen education. At the time of the extension, the
Project, together with the Bank, prioritized activities to be financed, even when it could
not be assured that all the proceeds of the loan would be used.


Therefore, the proposed change in the percentage of financing for each category will not
result in changes in project activities because the action plan projected would not used all
proceeds of the loan. According to recent data of the project, if all activities were
completed, the project would have had a remaining amount of $549,333.21. With the
change in the percentages of financing, they would have a remaining amount of $26.41.
