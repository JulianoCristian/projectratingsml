Its main\n            objective is to provide technical assistance to conduct\n            studies and prepare plans: to rationalize the petroleum\n            refinery to match its production to domestic demand; to\n            improve the refinery's energy and operating efficiency;\n            to reduce losses of crude oil in ocean transport, at the\n            harbor and in the refinery itself; and to improve the\n            product distribution system in the country. The\n            project's second objective is to finance equipment and\n            materials already identified and immediately required for\n            rehabilitation and energy efficiency improvement."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
