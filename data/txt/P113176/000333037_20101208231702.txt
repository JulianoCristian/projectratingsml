A one-tranche development policy operation (DPO), the Economic Management and Governance
Reform Grant II (EMGRGII) supported the implementation of the CAR's poverty reduction
strategy. The grant focused on two main policy areas: (i) strengthening public finance
management; and (ii) improving public sector and economic governance. The operation directly
supported two pillars of the PRSP: (i) promoting good governance and the rule of law (pillar 2);
and (ii) rebuilding and diversifying the economy (pillar 3). In addition, it assisted the Government
in implementing some of the HIPC Completion Point triggers and provided much needed external
resources to ensure timely payment of public sector salaries and external debt service.

Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

Context at Appraisal

At appraisal, the Central African Republic (CAR) had shown progress since conflict ended in 2003 but had
suffered severe exogenous shocks in 2008. Despite its progress, the CAR remained a fragile, low-income post
conflict country, albeit with a rich natural resource endowment. The CAR had successfully re-engaged with
the international community; embarked on a program to restore security throughout the country that begun to
absorb rebel groups; and undertaken reforms in budget procedures and governance in order to create the
conditions for growth and development. Politically, dialogue had led to a consensus Government in January
2009, expectations of a process of reconciliation, and the beginnings of a Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration (DDR) program. Nonetheless, stability and security remained precarious because of spillovers
of the conflicts in Chad and Darfur, rebel activity that left the north of the country outside of firm
Government control, and banditry in the Douala-Bangui corridor.

Poverty affected nearly two-thirds of the population, nearly as many as at the end of the conflict. A Poverty
Participatory Analysis carried out in 2007 attributed the main causes of poverty to poor governance, including
abuse of power by Government officials, and insecurity, including not only the conflicts and the related
displacement of persons but also urban banditry and extortion at road blocks. The 2007/08 UNDP Human
Development Report ranked the CAR 171 st out of 177 countries. Social indicators were extremely poor with
life expectancy at about 39 years and one child in four who had never attended school. It was almost certain
that the CAR would not meet its 2015 MDG targets. In 2007, the Government produced its first Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), covering the period 2008-2010, based on a broad consultative process. It
had four pillars: (i) restore security, consolidate peace, and prevent conflict; (ii) promote good governance and
the rule of law; (iii) rebuild and diversify the economy; and (iv) develop human capital.

Real GDP growth improved somewhat after 2004, but remained below 4 percent annually; in 2008, as a result
of domestic and external shocks, growth dropped to 2 percent. Gains in real GDP per capita were accordingly
modest in 2004-2008. Exports grew significantly up to 2007, but then dropped sharply in 2008, reflecting
falls in the major exports, wood products and diamonds. At the same time, the rises in food and petroleum
prices internationally in 2008 led to a sharp rise in inflation, to 9.3 percent, and a significant deterioration of
real incomes of the poor.

Despite these problems, the CAR had made significant progress in re-establishing macroeconomic stability.
The Bank and the IMF provided support to this process beginning in December 2006. Prior to EMGRGII, the
CAR had established a commitment to reforms in budgetary processes and governance that were supported by
the World Bank's Reengagement and Institution Building Support Program (RIBSUP), the first Economic
Management and Governance Reform Grant (EMGRGI), and various Low Income Countries Under Stress
(LICUS) grants. The reengagement with the donor community had led to substantial support initially but aid
has remained low since then. At the time of appraisal of EMGRGII, the CAR had prospects of moving from
HIPC decision point, attained in 2007, to the HIPC completion point.

A major remaining problem was the low tax revenue: GDP ratio --7.3 percent in 2007. This ratio was among
the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa. The low tax revenue constrained the government's ability to address the
basic needs and security of the population and left spending highly dependent on the declining grant
disbursements of the donors. Problems existed in timely payments of public sector salaries; progress was
made in 2006, but delays occurred again in 2007. A LICUS grant was used in 2008 to pay salaries of teachers
and health workers when donors did not disburse the planned-on budget support. The Government also had
problems honoring its commitment to reduce the six-month salary arrears accumulated since 2003. In addition,
substantial arrears to suppliers had accumulated, notably to the public utilities, although some reduction had
been made. To address the liquidity shortage a Liquidity Committee, chaired by the President, was formed for
short-term cash management.

Original Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The objectives of the Economic Management and Governance Reform Grant II were to improve the
efficiency of public finance management and strengthen public sector and economic governance. The
EMGRGII directly supported Pillar 2 and Pillar 3 of the PRSP. The support for Pillar 2 involved a number of
improvements in budgetary processes and revenue administration, further reduction in the number of non-
Treasury government bank accounts, and improvements in procurement regulations. The support for pillar 3
involved strengthening the legal and regulatory framework of the forestry and mining sectors. This would
help improve economic growth and reduce poverty through increased foreign direct investment, export
earnings, and fiscal revenue.

The operational policy matrix of prior actions included 9 indicators that were expected to improve fiscal and
natural resource management and contribute to reducing corruption and improving governance: (a) better
budget reporting on government operations by adoption of an improved nomenclature and strengthening the
authority and financing of the Court of Accounts; (b) improved efficiency and transparency of the government
accounting system and control of funds by further reducing the number of separate Government accounts in
commercial banks; (c) improved domestic revenue mobilization capacity by assigning identific ation numbers
to many new taxpayers and closer monitoring of customs and tax exemptions; (d) strengthening procurement
and the process for handling bidders' complaints; (e) applying the new mining code to all new permits; and (f)
ensuring forestry tax funds paid to the logging communities followed the thresholds set by the law. These
prior actions are shown in Box 1. In addition, a number of follow-on, indicative actions were expected to be
implemented, including a GAP review of the legal system with regard to international standards on anti-
corruption, a whistleblowers law, and a review of the implementation of the new procurement procedures, as
discussed below.

Revised PDO and Key Indicators

The objectives of the operation were not revised.

Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

Public Financial Management

The new government in 2003 faced complete disarray in public financial management, after years of political
instability, conflicts, and mismanagement. Between 2004 and 2009, the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) and Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) identified serious
shortcomings in Public Financial Management (PFM) and laid out reform priorities; two IDA DPO grants
(RIBSUP and EMGRGI), and LICUS grants provided support for implementing reforms as well as much-
needed fiscal resources. These reforms addressed the (i) lack of a modern legal framework for public financial
management; (ii) weak control of the Treasury over government resources; (iii) lack of transparent and
comprehensive reporting of government operations; and (v) weak domestic revenue mobilization.

The EMGRGII also dealt with improving budget processes and their transparency and was based on these
prior assessments and grants, as well as on the 2007 Joint Interim Strategy Note (JISN) and on the 2009 joint
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Specifically, the EMGRGII supported the timely formulation and
passage of the budget using harmonized nomenclatures, based on a medium-term framework for key sectors.
To improve transparency and accountability, it also supported the review of budget execution by the Court of
Accounts and helped to increase the funding for the Court of Accounts. Regarding improvements in Treasury
control of government funds, the EMGRGII supported continuation of the process of closing the multiple
government accounts in commercial banks. To improve fiscal revenues, the EMGRGII supported an increase
in the number of identified potential-taxpayers, and the set-up of mechanisms to reduce customs and tax
exemptions and make any remaining exemptions in customs and taxes more transparent.

Strengthening Public Sector and Economic Governance

The CFAA and PEFA, as well as a 2006 Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP) identified numerous ways
in which the government could improve governance in the public sector and in the economy generally; the
LICUS grants, RIBSUP, EMGRGI and technical assistance (TA) supported the Government's efforts in these
areas, particularly in the areas of procurement and forestry and petroleum sector policy. The improvements
included (i) making government anti-corruption efforts more effective by linking them to international
standards and measurements; (ii) reforming the legal framework for public procurement and strengthening
related institutions; (iii) improving the management of natural resources; and (iv) strengthening the regulatory
framework in the downstream petroleum sector. Improvements in these areas also contributed to greater
resource mobilization and better use of public resources.

The EMGRGII also built upon these assessments and the previous grants. In particular, the EMGRGII
supported strengthening the Government's fight against corruption by improving the link between the legal
framework and principles of the UN Convention against Corruption. This would involve a GAP analysis of
the legal system relative to these principles and adoption of a whistleblowers' law. To strengthen procurement,
the EMGRGII supported the implementation of the new procurement law, including the set-up of a bidders'
complaint unit. The EMGRGII also supported the set-up of a system for public reporting of exemptions in
taxes and customs.

With regard to the difficult issues of improving governance in the management of natural resources, the
EMGRGII supported the implementation of the new mining code that was in conformance with the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) principles, in particular applying it to all new mining contracts. In
the area of forestry, EMGRGI had supported a new forestry law that was in compliance with the Forestry Law
Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative. The Government had cancelled permits of two
logging companies that were not in compliance with the new law. EMGRGII supported the strong
implementation of the revenue sharing mechanisms in the new law and improvements in transparency through
the disclosure of the forestry revenue sharing between the government and the logging communities and of
the amount of local taxes paid by logging operators to logging communities.

effective on April 20, 2009, and was closed on March 1, 2010. All 9 prior actions, listed below in Box 1, were
met by the time of Board approval and the grant was fully disbursed 1. The EMGRGII built upon the base of
the EMGRGI in pillars 2 and 3 of CAR PRSP. As discussed below in detail, EMGRGII was successful in
supporting the continuation of reforms in the CAR, despite the major shock to trade following the
international financial crisis.

 Actual disbursement totaled US$5.2 million slightly higher than the approved amount (US$5.0 million) due to
movements in the exchange rate.

The EMGRGII was preceded by the EMGRGI of SDR 4.8 million that was approved in May 2008, a US$2
million LICUS emergency operation that was approved in March 2008, and two LICUS grants in August and
December 2008. More recently, grants were made for the Emergency Response to the Food Crisis Project
(US$7 million) in August 2008, and Emergency Energy Project (US$8 million in February 2009). The first
LICUS grant helped the Government pay the salaries of teachers and health workers during a period of severe
cash constraint in the first quarter of 2008, when donors did not disburse budget support on which the CAR
had planned. The next two LICUS grants supported implementation of the EMGRGI and EMGRG II through
TA. The LICUS II grant, which closed in December 2008, provided TA to strengthen the customs and tax
departments, build capacity in the Treasury department, strengthen civil service management and payroll
control system, and improve the public procurement system. The LICUS III grant, approved in August 2008,
provided TA for building capacity in revenue collection, budget preparation, execution, and reporting, and in
designing civil service reforms, as well as strengthening institutions involved in oil sector management and
administration, revising oil sector legislation and pricing. In addition the grant supported the revision of the
2004 mining code, the design of a standard mining form agreement, and capacity building in administration of
the mining sector. The LICUS grants were important in strengthening the effectiveness of government effort
in carrying out the reforms supported by EMGRGI and EMGRGII.

The Central African Republic reached the HIPC Completion Point in June 2009, shortly after EMGRGII
became effective. The firm intent to reach HIPC completion had contributed to the strength of the
Government's commitment to EMGRGII. HIPC Completion reduced CAR's external debt substantially and
made possible additional multilateral debt reductions.

Forestry sector reforms                     By decision of its Minister responsible for forests, the Recipient has
                                            instructed each forest commune to disclose information pertaining to
                                            the forestry revenue sharing mechanism between the Recipient and
                                            the communes, and the amount of local taxes paid by the forestry
                                            operators that accrues to the communities.

Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Major trade and supply shocks in 2008 and early 2009, larger than the declines projected at the time of
EMGRGII, seriously depressed GDP growth, purchasing power, and government revenues. Exports of timber
and diamonds, the mainstays of the formal economy, contracted sharply as a result of falling demand. Overall,
the value of CAR's exports dropped by an estimated 23 percent in 2008 and another 13 percent in 2009, with
diamond and wood product exports falling by 18 percent and 31 percent in volume terms, respectively. These
falls adversely affected the growth of government export revenue. In addition, breakdowns at the major hydro
power plant caused repeated outages with serious economic and social impacts. As a result of these large,
unexpected shocks real GDP growth slowed to an estimated 2.0 percent in 2008 and 1.7 percent in 2009,
compared to 3.7 percent in 2007. Sharp increases in world food and petroleum prices caused inflation to surge
from 0.9 percent in 2007 to 9.3 percent in 2008; although inflation fell back to 3.5 percent in 2009, this was
still far higher than in 2007. The sharp rise in food and petroleum prices, especially in 2008, decre ased real
income for much of the population.


                                                        5
Although the Government had made significant reforms in budget execution and reporting, anti-corruption
measures, and governance in the important but difficult areas of forestry and mining; the lack of capacit y and
resources remained a major constraint to reform implementation. In particular, improving procurement in the
line ministries was hindered by lack of capacity in contracting units, which tended to follow the old
procedures. Another problem was the limited number of firms that would bid for government contracts. In
response, the Government has ensured all the line ministries have the legal documentation for the new code,
implemented a training program for them, and assisted them in preparing procurement plans for budget
implementation. The Bank has supported this effort by accelerating implementation of the IDF grant approved
in the second half of 2009 to strengthen procurement capacity in the line ministries. In the area of anti-
corruption, measures complying with the UN convention include not only the new procurement code but also
such actions as requiring high state officials to declare their assets, establishment of a merit system for the
civil service, and improving transparency in the management of fiscal and mineral revenues, which the
government has implemented. However, the gap-analysis that was needed to move the CAR legal system
closer to the UN Convention against corruption was stalled by the lack of expected foreign support.

On the security front, the UN Security Council had approved in January 2009 the deployment of 5,500 peace
keepers to replace European troops in strife-torn areas in Chad and CAR. The deployment of the UN
peacekeeping Mission in the CAR and Chad, along with the regional peace-building force, helped improve
the security situation in the troubled north-east region. Nonetheless, the Government continued to lack control
over the entire country which limited formal business activity, particularly in the diamond sector in the
Northern provinces.

Factors under government control

The government took important steps to resolve the political problems. In June 2008 the Government signed a
cease-fire with the main rebel group operating near the Chad border. It also extended an amnesty to all rebels
to facilitate a broad-based dialogue. In December 2008, the Government met with all political actors,
including opposition and rebel groups. A new government, including representatives of the opposition and
rebel groups, was formed in January 2009. This improved political stability and a DDR program of former
combatants was launched. Implementation of the DDR program, which is expected to consolidate the peace
process, was slow to start, owing in part to insufficient funding. Nonetheless, the process of including rebels
and rebel groups in the political process continued during EMGRGII.

Adequacy of government's commitment

The Government's strong commitment to the reform program during EMGRGI was sustained during
EMGRGII. In spite of severe external shocks and security concerns, the Government stayed the course on
reforms. It maintained macroeconomic stability and implemented a broad agenda of structural reforms. These
reforms included (i) actions to enhance transparency through declaration of assets by cabinet ministers and
senior government officials; (ii) initiation of civil service reform following measures already taken to
establish a unified payroll and personnel records and eliminate ghost workers; (iii) improvement in the
regulatory framework for forestry and suspension of logging rights for two firms that did not conform to the
new code, (iv) a new mining code, (v) improvements in managing the downstream petroleum sector and
related revenues; and (v) measures to improve outcomes in social sectors, including health and education. As
a result, the Government had fully addressed the prior actions for EMGRGII in March 2009 and, in June 2009,
reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative.

Soundness of background analysis

The background analysis for the EMGRGII was adequate, based on a broad range of analytical work covering
most aspects of the operation and the success of and lessons learned in EMGRGI. Key analytical work
included the CFAA and PEFA reports that were both done in FY08, and the earlier Country Procurement
Issues Paper of FY06 in the area of public financial management. These studies, carried out in close

                                                      6
cooperation with other donors, identified critical steps in the short and medium-term for the reform of
budgetary procedures and procurement. The 2007 update of the forestry sector assessment provided the
underpinnings for reforms in the sector. In particular, the update highlighted the need for further
improvements in increasing transparency and competition in timber harvesting rights and enhancing tax
collection and management systems. A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) carried out in FY07
identified the lack of resources for infrastructure maintenance as a major issue and outlined measures to
improve the government capacity to mobilize revenues. Anti-corruption surveys and reports prepared by the
UNDP, in collaboration with Transparency International, provided a basis for the formulation of measures
supported by EMGRGI and EMGRGII in that area.

The social and environmental aspects of EMGRGII were adequately analyzed. Corruption and poor
governance were identified as a major cause of poverty in the Participatory Poverty Analysis of 2007.
EMGRGI and EMGRGII helped support the use of increased revenues in programs aimed at improving
CAR's low social indicators by emphasizing improved transparency, accountability, and strengthened public
revenue mobilization, as well as the links between public spending and the priorities of the Government's
poverty reduction strategy (PRS). The reforms in the forestry and petroleum sectors were expected to have
favorable environmental impacts as well as increase revenues. In the forestry sector, the reforms would
contribute to a better monitoring of forestry management, increased involvement of local communities in the
decision making process and the sharing of revenues, as well as enhanced protection of th e resource. In the
petroleum sector, the reforms and support from a LICUS grant and EMGRGI would ensure stricter
compliance with quality and security standards, and higher revenues.

Assessment of the operation's design

Building upon the satisfactory implementation of EMGRGI and the prior grants and assessments,
EMGRGII's reform agenda aimed at further improving public financial management and governance. The list
of 9 prior actions directly followed and strengthened the key next steps in EMGRGI and the HIPC
completion point. The EMGRGII's prior actions and its key next steps were in many cases related to the
further implementation of the Government's earlier actions, for instance, in the areas of prompt budget
execution, auditing of the budget, procurement, reduction of exemptions in customs and taxes, and better
management of mining and forestry resources, as well as improved transparency and reducing corruption

Relevance of risk analysis

The EMGRGII outlined adequately the substantial security, political, macroeconomic, and sustainability risks,
as well as the issues of institutional capacity and fiduciary risk facing the CAR, and ways to mitigate them.
The security situation was described as tenuous, despite the cease fire agreement with the main rebel group
and the deployment of UN and African peacekeepers. Security issues remained because of persisting conflicts
in Chad and Sudan and spillovers from Ugandan rebels, as well as banditry. Political instability is always an
issue in post-conflict countries. Despite the political gains in the CAR, the EMGRGII appropriately expressed
concern if major changes were to occur in the political landscape or commitment waned. Macroeconomic
risks from the deteriorating world economy were recognized but underestimated, as they were worldwide and
because of the lack of up-to-date data in the CAR. The EMGRGII pointed out the possibility of these
problems affecting revenues and the risk of fiscal slippage. Sustainability risks were considered to reflect
vested interests' resistance to the reforms. Weak institutional capacity was a major constraint, as well as a risk
to implementation of the reform program, despite the support for improved capacity post-2005. Finally,
fiduciary risks were recognized as high, due to weak financial controls indicated by the CPIP, the CFAA and
the PEFA reports. Problems in the Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) that had been identified by the
IMF were also recognized.

Mitigation of the security risks fell outside the scope of the operation. Mitigation of political risks was tied to
continuation of the Government's on-going political changes and the reforms in public financial management
and public sector and economic governance supported by EMGRGII, as well as larger, more budget-
harmonized donor inflows. In addition, strengthening transparency, as supported by the EMGR GII, would
lead to greater accountability of and public confidence in the Government. Mitigation of macroeconomic risks
was expected to come from a combination of policy adjustments and greater donor inflows. The incentive of
reaching the HIPIC completion point represented an incentive to avoid slippages. The risks from vested
interests were to be mitigated by up-front actions in the EMGRGII regarding procurement and Government
fiduciary controls. The risks from weak institutional capacity were expected to be mitigated by the focus of
the EMGRGII on areas where capacity has improved and continued TA. Finally, fiduciary risks were
expected to be mitigated by the improvements in fiduciary controls and the reduced number of government
bank accounts, which was a prior action in the grant. The concerns about the BEAC were expected to be
mitigated by creating a dedicated account at the BEAC for the grant.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Design, Implementation and Utilization

Prior to EMGRG II, the Government had designed an M&E framework to monitor and evaluate the
implementation of its PRSP. A program oversight committee was also established to monitor implementation
of the EMGRGI and was continued for the EMGRGII. It included representatives of the line ministries,
directorates and agencies involved. Since August 2009, all sectoral committees have used a standard format to
report their poverty activities, which facilitates evaluation of progress and any problems. Since October 2009,
budget support from the Bank, AfDB and the European Union, and France uses a common harmonized
framework to improve the predictability of aid, facilitate administration of donor support, and improve its
focus. These actions are important steps in ensuring monitoring of progress and coordinate support.

EMGRGII followed the procedures of EMGRGI in reaching an up-front agreement upon reform activities
with the government, including key indicators to assess progress and which could be incorporated in
subsequent EMGRGs. For EMGRGII, a subset of five key indicators was selected from the policy matrix.
These included the timely review of the budget by the Court of Accounts, verification of the tax and customs
exemptions and publication of them by the CICEFD, percentage of the investment budget using competitive
procurement procedures, number of mining permits in compliance with the new mining code, and compliance
with the new law in the distribution of forestry revenues (stumpage fees and reforestation tax) to the logging
communities. Four supervision missions assessed performance on these indicators and completed two
implementation status reports (ISRs).

Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

To continue support for the CAR's reforms and given the country's still-low resources, the Bank is preparing
an EMGRG III. This proposed grant would build on EMGRGII, help provide fiscal space, and limit the
impact of the global economic crisis on poverty. It would focus on further improvements in: (i) budget
execution, reporting, and procurement; (ii) revenue administration; and (iii) forestry, mining and petroleum
sector regulatory reforms; as well as (iv) the business environment, particularly reducing the cost of doing
business. The proposed operation recognizes the significant risks facing reforms in the CAR.

Assessment of Outcomes

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of EMGRGII were important in supporting the CAR's continuation on the path of economic
rehabilitation and reform. Building on progress already supported by RIBSUP and EMGRGI, EMGRGII's
objectives were intended to further strengthen public financial management practices, improve domestic
revenue, and address key public sector and governance issues. The objectives of EMGRGII were fully aligned
with the PRSP and the CPS, and followed up EMGRGI's key actions. They attempted to strike a balance
between focusing on the Ministry of Finance and involving other ministries and institutions, such as the Court
of Accounts, the Inter-ministerial Committee on Tax and Customs Duty Exemptions (CICEFD), and the
National Anti-Corruption Committee (CNLC), where limited institutional capacity and financial resources
represented risks. The EMGRGII objectives also included supporting further efforts in the management of
national resources and the environment -- mining and forestry-- and ensuring the benefits of income from
logging were being distributed according to the new forestry law.

Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The EMGRGII largely achieved its development objectives through the prior actions and government
achievements in relation to key outcome indicators. Despite a difficult economic environment, the reform
program remained broadly on-track. (Table 1, below, provides selected economic indicators for 2007-2010.)
Continued improvements in the tax revenue ratio, coupled with a tight control over expenditures, helped the
government reach its domestic revenue and primary surplus target. In December 2009, the IMF Board
completed the fifth review of the arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF); the sixth and final
review was delayed, owing largely to safeguard problems at the BEAC, but was completed in August 2010.
Outcomes under the program supported by the EMGRGII are discussed next and detailed in Annex 2.

Objective 1: Improve the efficiency of Public Finance Management

Significant progress was made in improving transparency in government operations. Reconciliations between
fiscal and cash accounts improved substantially and are now undertaken daily. Until 2009 this procedure did
not apply to the 70 or more Government accounts in commercial banks. In 2009, the Government closed all
but three of these accounts that are necessary to carry out Treasury activities with the commercial banks.
Reporting on budget execution had already improved substantially under EMGRGI but the quarterly budget
execution reports did not include expenditures at the payment stage. During the period of EMGRGII, the
computer systems of the treasury and budget departments were integrated, making it possible to generate
detailed and comprehensive budget execution reports.

The Government has adopted comprehensive accounting nomenclatures following OHADA norms and
carried out the harmonization of the budget and accounting nomenclatures. The Government's 2010 budget,
approved by Parliament in December 2009, used the harmonized budget and accounting nomenclatures. The
use of functional, administrative and economic classifications has improved the clarity and transparency of
the budget. The 2010 budget was also based on an overall medium-term framework; fully incorporating such
a framework at the ministerial levels will depend on on-going improvements in their capacities.

The Ministry of Finance submitted in March 2010 government accounts covering the year 2008 to the Court
of Account ­ Supreme Audit Institution. The Court of Accounts is undertaking a detailed verification of the
2008 government accounts and will issue a report which will include a general declaration of conformity. This
report will provide the basis upon which Parliament will vote on the corresponding budget execution law that
the Ministry of Finance is preparing. The 2008 budget execution law and the Court of Accounts' report on it
are on track to be submitted to Parliament in December 2010, at the same time as the 2011 draft budget law.

Domestic revenue mobilization capacity increased substantially despite the recent difficult environment.
Tax revenue reached 8.0 percent of GDP in 2008 and 8.7 percent of GDP in 2009, exceeding the key indicator,
and compared to 7.3 percent in 2007. The tax revenue ratio is projected to rise to 8.9 percent of GDP in 2010.
Revenues increased noticeably from taxes on profits and property and on goods and services; much of the
increase reflects better management of the petroleum sector. To improve revenue further and reduce the
potential for corruption, the Minister of Finance has required Customs and the Tax department to report all
exemptions to the Inter-ministerial Committee on Customs and Tax Exemptions (CICEFD), which reviewed
and published data on all such exemptions in 2009, as supported by EMGRGII.

Objective 2: Strengthen public sector and economic governance

The Government has strengthened the public procurement system. EMGRGII supported an evaluation of its
results that is on-going and establishment of a committee to deal with bidders' complaints, which has resolved
disputes satisfactorily during 2009 and 2010. Preliminary data provided by the Directorate General of Public
Procurement (DGMP) indicates that about 29 percent of contracts awarded in 2009 followed the new
procurement procedures which promote competitive bidding and, of these, about 10 percent were based on
single source approved by the DGMP; however, about 71 percent of the awarded contracts continued to
follow the old procedures based on the former procurement code. To correct this, the DGMP has assisted
contracting units in key line ministries in preparing procurement plans that are consistent with the new rules
for the execution of the 2010 budget with support from the IDF grant provided by the Bank to strengthen
capacity in procurement.

The Government made substantial progress in reforming the procedures for managing the mining sector. The
new mining code established in April 2009 was implemented using a new standard form for agreements. Two
conventions for exploration have been signed with international investor groups, using the new standard form.
In addition the Government has made good progress in preparing the EITI report for 2007, 2008, and 2009
which covers revenues from diamonds as well as other minerals, such as gold.

The Government also made substantial progress in the forestry sector under the new forestry code. The
Government strengthened compliance with the new code in 2009 by requiring each logging community to
disclose the tax sharing mechanism between the logging communities and the Government and the amounts
of local taxes paid by the logging companies to the logging communities. The Government also implemented
its action plan to move the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) agenda forward. Formal
negotiations with the European Union (EU) have advanced on three of the four key phases and the voluntary
partnership with the EU is expected to be completed in December 2010.

The Government has made progress in formulating, coordinating and monitoring a legal framework for the
fight against corruption but has been hindered by lack of resources and institutional capacity. An anti-
corruption strategy is being prepared through a broad consultative process. An initial draft of the strategy was
made available to external partners in June 2009 and updated and validated by the Anti-Corruption
Committee in September 2010. The EMGRGII supported a GAP analysis of compliance of the CAR's laws
with the UN Convention. This process was begun by compiling all the laws and regulations against corruption.
The ultimate objective was to move the CAR legal system closer to the UN convention against corruption.
However, these activities have been limited by lack of resources, internal and external, and by limited
institutional capacity. The Government has indicated its commitment to adopt a law protecting
whistleblowers, but such a law would depend on the prior revision of the legal code against corruption.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Moderately Satisfactory

Results achieved under the EMGRGII prior and expected follow-on actions were largely satisfactory,
despite a major external shock. Tax revenue rose, and the HIPC completion point was reached in June
2009.The improved revenue mobilization reflects reforms of the petroleum sector and its taxation, collection
of taxes on profits and property and VAT, and better administration of customs revenues and exemptions. The
identification of additional taxpayers will contribute to efforts to raise revenues in the future.

Regarding budgetary processes, the 2010 Budget was delivered to and approved by Parliament in December
2009; it reflected the harmonized budget and accounting nomenclatures and was based broadly on a medium-
term framework. Government accounts in commercial banks have been reduced to one in each bank, the
minimum necessary to conduct transactions through each bank. This reduction in accounts effectively created

                                                      11
a Treasury single account and provided much better control over cash flows and fiscal and cash reconciliation.
The prompt reconciliation of accounts was also facilitated by the use of a new computer system. The Court of
Accounts is reviewing the 2008 government accounts which will be presented to Parliament in December
2010 along with the 2011 Budget Law.

Regarding public sector and economic governance, action continues on forestry management and formal
negotiations with the EU on a voluntary partnership arrangement in forestry are moving along well. The
analysis of the disposition of tax revenues in forestry between the Government, forestry companies and the
logging communities was carried out and is consistent with the law. The new standard mining agreement
form was established and two contracts for exploration were signed under it. A draft EITI report covering
revenues from the production of diamonds and gold over the last three years has been prepared, and the
independent auditor has determined that CAR is on track to achieve country compliant status in 2010.

Success was less in areas where capacity and financial resources were limited. A revised anti-corruption draft
strategy is available and the Government is seeking TA to ensure its compatibility with international
standards. The attempt to carry out a GAP analysis of the CAR laws relative to the UN Convention on
Corruption was limited to collection of the relevant laws by the National Anti-Corruption Committee (CNLC).
The CNLC lacked the capacity and resources to carry out the GAP analysis and the expected foreign support
was not provided. As regards procurement, the government adopted new conditions for contracts, set up
functioning arrangements for bidders' complaints, and reduced the recourse by line ministries to single source
procurement. However, institutional capacity problems and lack of resources slowed implementation of the
new procurement procedures. A large number of contracts awarded in 2009 continued to follow the
procedures of the old procurement code, in part because line ministries were most familiar with them. The
Bank is accelerating the implementation of the IDF grant designed to strengthen capacity in public
procurement and, with support from the grant, the DGMP has assisted contracting units in key ministries in
preparing procurement plans that are consistent with the new procedures for the execution of the 2010
investment budget, based on competitive bidding.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty impacts, gender aspects and social development

The EMGRG II contributed to efforts to alleviate poverty and improve social outcomes through increases in
domestic revenue, which in turn have allowed the government to sustain budget allocations to priority sectors
despite the crisis. They represented 34 percent of total expenditures in the 2009 budget and 36 percent in 2008.
Improvements in the PFM system are helping to ensure that the allocation of budgetary resources to sectors
and programs are in line with government priorities as set out in the PRSP. Recent achievements in education
include the construction of 568 new primary school classrooms, the rehabilitation of existing 417 classrooms,
and the distribution of learning materials to more than 49,000 pupils and 985 teachers across the country. In
health, 22 new community health centers have been constructed and equipped throughout the country, and 12
existing health centers have been equipped. These investments are expected to contribute to efforts to improve
health and education outcomes. It is also worth noting that efforts in forestry during EMGRGII have ensured
that forest revenues are going to logging communities in accordance with the law. And the Government and
the EU are close to a voluntary environmental agreement in forestry.

Institutional change/strengthening

The institutional development impact of the reforms implemented under the EMGRGII was generally
significant. The program improved budget classification, budget preparation, and tax administration. It also
improved the framework for procurement and reducing tax and customs exemptions. The publication of key
government reports and exemptions in taxes and customs duties on its websites is contributing to
strengthening the institutional framework for the fight against corruption. Lack of institutional capacity in the
line ministries is being addressed through TA and support by the DGMP to procurement units in the line

                                                       12
ministries. The draft Anti-Corruption Strategy and the adoption of laws that could be used against corruption
represent a start in this area, although the lack of institutional capacity and external support has prevented
implementation of the GAP analysis of compliance of CAR laws with the UN Convention against Corruption.
In the forestry sector, the enforcement of the new Code, the closer monitoring of forestry revenues and the
advanced negotiations for a voluntary partnership agreement with the EU should promote a more sustainable
development of the forestry sector and better treatment of the incomes from forestry. In the mining sector, the
new code and standard form agreement have been used in granting of two new contracts for exploration,
although these contracts are not yet readily available on the Ministry's Web site.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

Not applicable.

Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Significant

The EMGRGII's assessment of the high risks in the CAR and ways of mitigating them was moderately
satisfactory. Currently, security risks remain substantial, given the continued conflicts in neighb oring
countries and the issues with demobilizing and reintegrating the remaining rebel groups in the CAR.
Moreover, the UN peacekeeping mission has begun winding down. Political risks also remain. EMGRGII was
appraised in the hopeful context of a new government, agreement with the largest rebel group, and start of a
National Dialogue. However, since then, a splinter rebel group has not been integrated and the elections
originally scheduled for April 2010 have finally been rescheduled for January 2011.

The macroeconomic risks from the crisis were underestimated, as they were worldwide, but the Government
demonstrated its commitment to the reform program and increased tax revenues. Nonetheless,
macroeconomic risks remain. First, continued low growth in the world economy will keep CAR's growth low.
Low growth of industrial countries may also limit donor funds. This scenario will test the CAR Government's
commitment to reforms. Other risks are that having reached the HIPC completion point, the Government may
be less inclined to further reforms and changes in the Government may change priorities. Also, the elections
now set for early 2011 may lead to an easing of the reforms, or even change the commitment needed to
improve governance and strengthen the PFM system. Since many of the reforms were done by decrees,
changing them will be easy. Furthermore, the capacity to enforce existing regulations, particularly in the area
of natural resource management, remains weak despite recent progress and TA. Various interest groups may
take advantage of those weaknesses. Moving beyond improvements in PFM to delivery of needed social
services will be difficult because of the weak institutional and delivery capacity.

Several considerations provide hope that the current reforms may be sustained. The Government has
established a track record, even in the face of external and domestic shocks, and this may indicate a
continuation of reforms under the next government. Despite a succession of shocks in 2008 and 2009 the
CAR avoided major macroeconomic imbalances. A key future issue here will be the management of any
sharp food price crises and continued payment of public sector salaries. The repair of the hydropower
generation facility will have a positive impact. Next, the institutional strengthening and capacity building in
budget execution and reporting realized under the EMGRGI and EMGRGII is expected to help improve the
overall control and sustainability of public finances. Similarly, the satisfactory asset disclosure of senior
government officials represents an important milestone in the fight against corruption on which to built future
efforts. Third, the Government is coordinating with donors operating in CAR to harmonize the structural
reform program and ensure its continuity. However, more donor funding and higher GDP growth will be
needed to improve the low social indicators and high poverty rates.

Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank Performance

Quality at entry

Satisfactory

At entry, EMGRGII focused on key issues for further improving public sector management and strengthening
governance in the public sector and the management of mining and forestry resources. It built upon the
achievements of RIBSUP, the LICUS grants, and EMGRGI. The design of EMGRGII was simple; a grant
disbursing on prior actions by the Government, with further discussion and action on follow-up steps
occurring within the life of the operation. The prior actions and key follow-up indicators were well focused,
underpinned by good analytical work, and took into account the Government's limited institutional capacity;
they provided the potential for further actions in a follow-up operation. The risk analysis was satisfactory,
pointing out the substantial risks that the CAR faced. Lessons learned from previous operations and other
IDA projects were taken into account. These included, for instance, the need in post -conflict situations to
focus on reforms that were feasible in the context of limited capacity and could set the stage for better
resource mobilization, better management of fiscal resources, and better governance in procurement and
natural resource management. The actions continued the process of breaking clearly with pre-2003 corruption
and mis-management. The EMGRGII IDA grant provided needed resources to a fragile, low income country
that was making progress but facing a major external shock and a decline in other donors' funds that could
reverse this progress.

Quality of supervision

Satisfactory

Four supervisions were undertaken of EMGRGII with two ISRs. Owing to resource constraints, three of the
missions were in conjunction with the final supervision of EMGRGI, the IMF's Article IV consultation and
the appraisal of EMGRGIII. Together with the economist in the resident mission, the supervisions missions
helped the authorities deliver the reform program supported by EMGRGII and meet the triggers for the HIPC
completion point. Video-conferences on HIPC and preparation of EMGRGIII also helped to supervise
EMGRGII. Aide-memoires on performance were prepared in close consultation with the authorities. The
policy matrix was updated each time. Through close coordination with other donors, the t ask team worked to
help the Government obtain technical and financial resources for implementing the work program. Additional
resources were provided through LICUS and IDF grants. Bank management was highly supportive of the
team.

Borrower Performance

Satisfactory

The Borrower was strongly committed to the reforms of EMGRGII operation, as noted. Despite an external
shock that was much worse than anticipated, the Government generally implemented the program of
improving public financial management, increasing domestic resource mobilization, and strengthening public
sector and economic governance supported by the EMGRGII. This grant was intertwined with the CAR's
reaching the HIPC completion point in June 2009 and the Government took a substantial interest in both,
particularly the Finance Ministry. The Government was well prepared for the EMGRGII supervision missions
and the dialogue was productive. The Government's evaluation of the operation is presented in Annex 3.




                                                     14
Lessons learned

After a long period of internal conflict, international support is likely to be needed for some time, both in
terms of security forces and financial resources. Demobilizing non-government armed forces takes time and
requires resources. The population typically suffers from a major deficiency in basic needs. Focused reforms
are needed to restore the government's basic financial functions and increase their transparency. The reforms
and outcome indicators need to be realistic, consistent with the government's capacity, and supported by TA
as needed.

A Development Policy Operation is an effective instrument for addressing key issues in restoring a functional
government and contributes to setting the stage for deeper reforms. TA should be available to help implement
the reform program and build up capacity in key areas. A close dialogue with the government should be
maintained, through frequent supervision missions and field presence. A series of DPOs allows the
government to take on the parts of a program outlined in the PRSP and the CPS that are appropriate in time
and manageable. This approach may be better than laying out a lengthy, strict, programmatic series of credits
which may be incompatible with changing circumstances and could lead to an inappropriate sense of non-
achievement. The documentation of each DPO should indicate clearly ultimate objectives and achievements
in prior operations.

Donors should work together closely and, if possible, use the same or similar instruments, and close
coordination should be maintained with the IMF. Donors' timely TA can ensure implementation of the
program. The General Framework for Budget Support to the PRSP (CGAB-DSRP), agreed recently between
the Government and donors operating in CAR, will help improve the predictability of aid and facilitate the
administration of donor support.

Reaching the HIPC completion point was a strong incentive for moving the reform agenda. The risk now is
that the Government may slow down the reform process, especially as a result of the political issues
associated with the upcoming, rescheduled elections. Economic and political shocks always develop and
generate temptations to reverse reforms and improvements in transparency and governance. The CAR
sustained the reform momentum despite the major economic crisis and the still fragile security situation.
However, the risk of falling back into conflict remains high if the Government does not reintegrate conflicting
groups, show progress, and improve social outcomes. Because of the lack of resources and capacity in
countries like the CAR, even after improved fiscal resource mobilization and debt relief, further budget and
TA support from the international community is needed to help the Government continue on the path toward
economic and social development.

Introduction

The World Bank approved the IDA grant in the amount of 3.4 million SDR in 2009 to support reforms
aimed at improving the efficiency of public finance management and strengthening public sector and
economic governance. Following the grant agreement, the Government designated the CTP/PAS to serve
as the implementing unit. This project has helped to strengthen public finance management and promote
economic governance.

Context

Program implementation took place in a difficult context, marked by: a fragile economy, external shocks
in 2008 and 2009 reflected in weak external demand and a steep decline in the price of raw materials;
with CAR's main export commodities, diamonds and timber, declining respectively by 18 and 31 percent
in volume terms in 2009. Sustained economic activity in the primary sector, notably in food crops and
animal husbandry, compensated somewhat for the negative external shocks, owing to the gradual
improvements in security in the producing areas and good weather conditions. Credit to the private sector
fell slightly reflecting mainly the slowdown in commerce. The banking sector has not been directly
affected by the global financial crisis and the liquidity position of most commercial banks was reinforced
by the early repayment of government debt at the end of 2009. Overall, the economic rebound faded, as
demonstrated by the slowdown in economic activity with a reduction in real GDP growth from 2.0
percent in 2008 to 1.7 percent in 2007.

Budget management has significantly improved since 2006, although the mobilization of domestic
revenues remains low at 10.8 percent of GDP in 2009. Despite the global economic crisis, the ratio of
fiscal revenues has improved and stood at 8.7 percent of GDP in 2009, against 8.0 percent of GDP in
2008. This sustained improvement has been made possible by the improvements in tax administration,
which is now more efficient, and the reform of petroleum taxation, which is an important source of
budget funds. The implementation of these structural reforms and especially the continuation of the
efforts aimed at enlarging the tax base will help to render the budget more resistant to negative shocks.

On the expenditure side, and in response to the worldwide economic recession, fiscal policy in 2010 aims
to support aggregate demand while remaining prudent and to adhere to the commitments made to various
macroeconomic stabilization programs. The Government is continuing to pay wages and salaries on a
regular basis, and a substantial proportion of the wage and salary arrears accumulated has been cleared.
However, the capital expenditures financed from domestic resources have been considerably delayed and
executed only at a level of 50 percent of the programmed expenditures, this notwithstanding the revision
of the budget in September 2009.

Implementation

The project was prepared with a high degree of realism. The Government departments concerned by its
implementation were involved from the beginning and the prior actions as well as the key follow-on
actions were well defined and in consultation with the authorities. The project objectives have had
positive effects on public finances, including resource mobilization and public expenditure management,
as well as on the macroeconomic framework.

Results

The measures that contributed to strengthening and improving public financial management in 2009
included:

          The harmonization of accounting and budgetary nomenclatures in conformance with OHADA
          norms.
          A computerized and integrated management system of expenditures from commitment to
          payment which was fully achieved in January 2010.
          The compilation of the government 2008 accounts was finalized and the accounts were submitted
          to the Court of Accounts. The corresponding budget execution law will be submitted to
          Parliament at the same time as the draft 2011 budget law.
          Implementation of the Treasury Single Account. Treasury accounts have been reduced to one per
          commercial bank to maintain transactions through banks along with three transit accounts.
          The monitoring and control of tax and customs exemptions has permitted the mobilization of
          additional resources. The Inter-Ministerial Committee in charge of tax and customs exemptions
          (CICEFD) makes recommendations on requests for exemptions that should be approved or
          rejected. The exemption requests reviewed by the CICEFD are available to the public.
          The alignment of the national chart of investment is based on the regional chart in the general
          fiscal code.

Regarding economic governance in the public sector, the authorities took and implemented the following
measures:

          The strengthening of the legal framework for the fight against corruption in coherence with the
          UN convention against corruption.
          The setting up of the legal framework for procurement has encouraged suppliers to participate in
          the bidding process for government contracts. The Regulatory Procurement Authority (ARMP) is
          undertaking an audit of procurement and will carry out corrective measures to addr ess
          deficiencies in the procurement system.
          The new permits awarded in the mining sector are in accordance with the new standard form
          agreement based on the new mining code.
          The implementation of the EITI principles reflects the voluntary adherence of the Government of
          CAR to the extractive industries and transparency initiative. The second EITI report covering the
          years 2007, 2008 and 2009 has been prepared; it will be published on government websites and
          disseminated throughout the CAR territory.
          The reinforcement of governance in the forestry sector is reflected in the publication in forestry
          communities of the revenue sharing mechanism of forestry revenues between the Treasury, the
          Ministry in charge of forests and communities. In addition, the Government is developing and
          will adopt in December 2010 a framework document for a national tracking system and a system
          of verification of the legality of timber productions in the context of the FLEGT process.

Other results

Concerning the other measures undertaken and the next steps, the Government is pursuing public
financial management reforms, focusing on the following priorities: (i) strengthen treasury management;
(ii) improve the monitoring of expenditure and budget management; (iii) enhance debt management; and
(iv) increase transparency in public finances. Accordingly, the Government intends to implement the
following measures in 2010:

                                                     21
        Improve the efficiency of the public expenditure management system (GESCO) by incorporating
        into GESCO ministries' spending on own resources and the revenue agencies and, in addition,
        severely limit the recourse to exceptional expenditure procedures.
        Continue the quarterly publication of budget execution reports.
        Undertake an audit by the Inspectorate General of Finance (IGF) of the arrears accumulated
        between 2008 and 2009 and add the validated arrears to the debt database.
        Increase the transparency of the system for the repayment of expenditure arrears.

The Government will continue to improve the financial performance of the public utility companies by
paying all of its current utility bills, requiring State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to adopt comprehensive
action plans that would lead to medium-term sustainability underpinned by performance contracts signed
with SOE management to monitor the implementation of the action plans and ensure an efficient use of
additional resources. In order to reduce interest costs, the government will prioritize the payment of the
commercial bank debt on behalf of these companies to whom the Government is in a debt situation. The
improvement of the financial situation of the public utility companies should enable them to pay their
current tax obligations, because their tax arrears were eliminated in the context of the public sector cross-
debt clearance exercise.

Securing and increasing electricity supply are essential for growth. Owing to the financial and technical
support from the World Bank (US$10 million) and the French Development Agency (Euro 4.2 million),
reforms undertaken would reduce short-term supply problems and produce substantial economic benefits.
Moreover the Chinese authorities intend to strengthen electricity generating capacity with the supply of
two turbines for Boali II, which will increase electricity production by 10 megawatts. Finally the
Government is committed to improve the business and investment climate with the objective of attracting
major new investment projects and facilitating the generation of employment opportunities, and will
continue to pursue efforts to enhance communication with the business community, as well as remain
vigilant with regard to the proper application of tax and investment legislation and the regulations
governing economic activity.

Program supervision

The unit in charge of program monitoring ­ CTP/PAS ­ was also in charge of monitoring budget support
by other donors, including the IMF supported Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The follow-up operation
has been supervised in the same way and results are satisfactory. In the future, the Government intends to
continue using the same arrangement for monitoring implementation of programs supported by donors.
This will enable the Government to capitalize on experience gained.

Introduction

La Banque mondiale a accordé le Don IDA de 3,4 millions de Droits de tirages Spéciaux (DTS) à la RCA
à titre de l'année 2009 en appui aux administrations fiscales pour l'amélioration de l'efficacité de la
gestion des finances publiques et le renforcement du secteur public ainsi que la gouvernance économique.
Suite à l'accord de don H474-CF y afférant, le Gouvernement a désigné le CTP/PAS comme l'unité de
mise en oeuvre. Ce projet a permis de renforcer essentiellement la gestion des finances publiques et
promouvoir la gouvernance financière.

Contexte

La mise en oeuvre s'est déroulée dans un contexte interne difficile caractérisé par: une économie fragile,
les chocs externes en 2008 et 2009 qui ont pour corollaire la faiblesse de la demande extérieure et la forte
chute des prix des matières premières s'est traduite par la baisse des principaux produits d'exportation, le
diamant et le bois, qui ont progressivement reculé en volume de 18 et 31 % respectivement en 2009.
L'activité soutenue dans le secteur primaire, notamment l'agriculture vivrière et l'élevage, a quelque peu
atténué les chocs exogènes négatifs, grâce à des conditions climatiques plus favorables et à une plus
grande sécurité dans les zones de production. Le crédit au secteur privé a baissé légèrement en 2009
reflétant vraisemblablement la contraction du commerce. Le système bancaire n'a pas été directement
affecté par la crise financière mondiale et la liquidité des banques commerciales a été renforcée par le
remboursement anticipé des prêts consentis à l'Etat à la fin de 2009. De ce fait, l'élan de reprise a été
contrarié comme le démontre le ralentissement de l'activité économique avec une nette réduction des taux
de croissance de 2.0 % en 2008 à 1,7 % en 2009.

La gestion budgétaire s'est nettement améliorée bien que la mobilisation des recettes intérieures reste
faible soit 10,8 % du PIB en 2009. Malgré la crise économique mondiale, le ratio de recettes fiscales s'est
amélioré en se situant à 8,7 % du PIB en 2009 contre 8% en 2008. Cette amélioration soutenue a été
rendue possible grâce à l'amélioration de l'administration fiscale devenue plus efficace et à la réforme de
la fiscalité pétrolière, qui constitue une source importante des ressources budgétaires. La mise en oeuvre
de ces réformes structurelles et notamment la poursuite des efforts visant à élargir l'assiette fiscale
contribuera à rendre le budget plus résistant aux chocs négatifs. Du côté des dépenses et en réponse à la
récession économique mondiale, la politique fiscale vise à soutenir la demande globale tout en maintenant
la prudence et en restant conforme aux engagements pris dans les différents programmes de stabilisation
macroéconomique. Le gouvernement continue de payer régulièrement les salaires et un montant
substantiel des arriérés de salaire accumulés a été apuré. Cependant, les dépenses en capital financées sur
les ressources internes ont été considérablement retardés et exécutées à hauteur de 50% des dépenses
programmées et ce malgré la révision du Budget en Septembre 2009.

Mise en oeuvre des composantes du Don IDA-H474-CF

Le projet a été préparé avec beaucoup de réalisme. Les services internes concernés par la mise en oeuvre
ont été bien impliqués dès le départ et les déclencheurs tout comme les mesures clés pour les prochaines
étapes étaient bien définis en accord avec tous les responsables. Les objectifs du projet ont des
implications directes positives sur les finances publiques notamment en matière mobilisation des recettes,
la gestion des dépenses et le cadre macroéconomique.

Résultats et déclencheurs du don IDA-H474-CF

Les mesures concourant au renforcement et à l'amélioration de la gestion des finances publiques au cours
de l'année 2009 sont:
        L'harmonisation des nouvelles nomenclatures comptables et budgétaires conformément aux
        normes de l'OHADA
        Un système informatique de gestion intégré des dépenses de l'engagement au paiement a été mis
        en place en Janvier 2010
        le compte de gestion 2008 a été finalisé et soumis à la Cour des Comptes. La loi de règlement y
        afférant sera soumise au Parlement en même temps que le projet de loi de finance de 2011
        La gestion rationnelle de trésorerie de l'Etat se traduit au niveau de Trésor par le maintient d'un
        compte courant dans chacune des banques commerciales. A cela s'ajoute trois comptes
        transitoires dans trois banques commerciales.
        La mobilisation additionnelle des ressources est le fait du suivi et du contrôle des exonérations
        fiscales et douanières. Le CICEFD émet des avis sur chaque demande d'exonération accordée ou
        rejetée. Tous les dossiers de demande d'exonération revus par CICFED sont accessibles au grand
        public
        L'alignement de la Charte nationale d'investissement est fait sur la Charte régionale dans le Code
        général des impôts.

S'agissant de la Gouvernance économique dans le secteur public, les autorités n'ont ménagé aucun effort
pour prendre et mettre en oeuvre les mesures suivantes :
        Le renforcement du cadre légal de lutte contre la corruption en cohérence avec la convention des
        nations Unies par la mise en conformité des textes
        La mise place du cadre réglementaire de passation des marchés publics incite les fournisseurs à
        postuler pour la commande publique. L'opérationnalisation de l'Autorité de Régulation des
        Marchés Publics (ARMP) qui se traduit par l'élaboration régulière des rapports de conformités
        permet d'identifier des mesures correctives à toute irrégularité qui survienne dans le processus de
        passation de marchés
        Les nouveaux permis octroyés dans le domaine minier sont en conformité avec la convention type
        prescrite par le nouveau code
        La Mise en oeuvre des principes d'ITIE traduit l'adhésion volontaire de la République
        Centrafricaine à l'Initiative pour la Transparence des Industries Extractives (ITIE). Ainsi le
        deuxième rapport amélioré d'ITIE qui couvre les exercices 2007, 2008 et 2009 est publié sur les
        sites WEB officiels du Gouvernement et la dissémination du rapport sur le territoire national
        Le renforcement de la gouvernance dans le secteur forestier se traduit par la publication
        systématique dans les communes forestières du mécanisme de partage des revenus forestiers
        entre le Trésor, la caisse d'affectation spéciale du Ministère en charge de la forêt et les
        communautés. En outre, le Gouvernement a mis en chantier un programme national de traçabilité
        et de vérification dont l'adoption sera effective fin-décembre 2010 dans le but de mettre en place
        un système de vérification de la légalité des productions de bois d'oeuvre, dans le contexte du
        processus d'Application des réglementations forestières, gouvernance et échanges commerciaux
        (FLEGT).

Autres réformes d'approfondissement.

Concernant les autres mesures entreprises et leurs prochaines étapes, le Gouvernement s'est engagé dans
les réformes de gestion des finances publiques en se focalisant sur les priorités suivantes : i) renforcer la
gestion de la trésorerie ; ii) améliorer le suivi des dépenses et la gestion budgétaire ; iii) améliorer la

                                                     24
gestion de la dette ; et accroitre la transparence des finances publiques. A cette fin, nous avons l'intention
de prendre les mesures énoncées ci-dessous en 2010 :
        Améliorer l'efficacité de GESCO en y intégrant les ministères qui dépensent leurs propres
        ressources et les régies de recettes et limiter rigoureusement le recours aux procédures de
        dépenses exceptionnelles
        Poursuivre la publication trimestrielle des rapports d'exécution budgétaire
        Procéder à un audit des arriérés accumulés entre 2008 et 2009 par l'Inspection générale des
        finances et intégrer les informations sur la dette validée dans la base de données de la dette au
        cours du mois de septembre 2010
        Renforcer la transparence dans le système de remboursement des arriérés intérieurs.

Le gouvernement tient à l'amélioration des résultats financiers des sociétés de service public, par le
règlement intégral des consommations publiques, la mise en place des plans d' action détaillés devant
conduire à leur viabilité financière à moyen terme qui se traduit par la signature des contrats de
performance avec la direction de ces sociétés, ce qui permettra de suivre I' exécution des plans d'action
afin de veiller à l'utilisation judicieuse des ressources additionnelles. En vue de réduire les frais financiers,
le gouvernement considérera comme prioritaire le remboursement des dettes bancaires détenues par les
entreprises publiques envers lesquelles l'Etat est débiteur. Le redressement de leur situation financière
devrait déjà leur permettre de s'acquitter de leurs obligations fiscales courantes compte tenu de
l'annulation de leurs arrières d'impôts dans le cadre du programme d'apurement de la dette croisée du
secteur public.

La sécurisation et l'augmentation de l'approvisionnement en électricité sont indispensables à la
croissance. Grâce a une aide financière et technique de la Banque mondiale (10 millions de dolla rs E.U.)
et de I' Agence française de développement (4,2 millions d'euros), les reformes engagées permettraient
d'atténuer les problèmes d'approvisionnement à court terme et procurerait de grands avantages
économiques. En outre, les autorités chinoises projettent de renforcer les capacités de production
d'énergie électrique, avec la fourniture de deux turbines destinées à Boali Ill, afin d'augmenter de 10
mégawatts la production d'électricité.

Enfin le Gouvernement s'engage à améliorer l'environnement des affaires et des investissements afin
d'attirer de nouveaux grands projets d'investissement afin de favoriser la création d'emplois, et compte
poursuivre ses efforts dans le sens d' une meilleure communication avec le secteur privé et à veiller à
l'application judicieuse de la législation en matière d'imposition et d'investissement ainsi que des
dispositions régissant l'activité économique.

Supervision de la mise en oeuvre du don IDA-H474-CF

La même unité de supervision du Don en l'occurrence le CTP/PAS était chargé de superviser les appuis
budgétaires des autres bailleurs y compris le programme de réforme soutenu par l'ECF du FMI. L'appui
budgétaire qui a suivi le présent don a été supervisé de la même manière et les résultats sont encore
satisfaisants. Dans le futur, le Gouvernement entend utiliser le même dispositif pour suivre la mise en
oeuvre des programmes soutenus par les prochains appuis budgétaires. Le Gouvernement pourra
capitaliser ainsi cette expérience.
