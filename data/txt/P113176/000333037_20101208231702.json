"Ratings for the Second Economic\n            Management and Governance Reform Grant Project for Central\n            African Republic were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: after a long period of internal conflict,\n            international support is likely to be needed for some time,\n            both in terms of security forces and financial resources.\n            Demobilizing non-government armed forces takes time and\n            requires resources. The population typically suffers from a\n            major deficiency in basic needs. Focused reforms are needed\n            to restore the government's basic financial functions\n            and increase their transparency. The reforms and outcome\n            indicators need to be realistic, consistent with the\n            government's capacity, and supported by Technical\n            Assistance (TA) as needed. A Development Policy Operation\n            (DPO) is an effective instrument for addressing key issues\n            in restoring a functional government and contributes to\n            setting the stage for deeper reforms. TA should be available\n            to help implement the reform program and build up capacity\n            in key areas. A close dialogue with the government should be\n            maintained, through frequent supervision missions and field\n            presence. A series of DPOs allows the government to take on\n            the parts of a program outlined in the Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Country Partnership Strategy\n            (CPS) that are appropriate in time and manageable. This\n            approach may be better than laying out a lengthy, strict,\n            programmatic series of credits which may be incompatible\n            with changing circumstances and could lead to an\n            inappropriate sense of non-achievement. The documentation of\n            each DPO should indicate clearly ultimate objectives and\n            achievements in prior operations."}, "docdt": "2010-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
