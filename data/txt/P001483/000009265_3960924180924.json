The Bank's\n            supervision efforts were not sufficient. The project has not\n            only failed to achieve the objectives established at\n            appraisal but also those of the rehabilitation plan proposed\n            in the 1983 amendment of the financing agreement.\n            Borrower's performance during project implementation\n            was less than satisfactory. The lack of managerial\n            capabilities, the shortage of qualified and motivated staff\n            and the declining commitment of the borrower towards the\n            project hampered the achievement of the project's\n            development goals. The main lessons learned from this\n            experience are the following: it should have been recognized\n            at appraisal that the trend in country conditions raised\n            serious questions about the suitability of the technical and\n            managerial design of the existing and proposed Mangoky project."}, "docdt": "1990-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
