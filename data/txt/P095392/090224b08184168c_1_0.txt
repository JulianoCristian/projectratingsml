                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) contribute to GOE's program of switching consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for natural gas through investment in
                         new connections; and (ii) exploit the scale economies in transportation of natural gas relative to LPG in very densely populated areas, thereby reducing the cost of gas
                         provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The procurement and construction activities related to the gas distribution and connection component has been progressing well. As of September 30, 2012, a total of 358,862 new
                         households have been connected and converted to piped natural gas, representing 120% of the original project target. Construction of the 10,000 m3/day Pressure Reduction Station
                         (PRS) at El Tebbin is completed. The civil work for the 150,000 m3/day PSR at El Tebbin actually commenced in November 2012. However, the construction of the PRS in New Cairo
                         and El Haram has been further delayed, although the delay only affects additional gas connection in the surrounding areas of the PRS sites.
