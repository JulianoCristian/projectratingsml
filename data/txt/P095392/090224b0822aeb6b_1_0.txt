                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) contribute to GOE's program of switching consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for natural gas through investment in
                         new connections; and (ii) exploit the scale economies in transportation of natural gas relative to LPG in very densely populated areas, thereby reducing the cost of gas
                         provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The procurement and construction activities related to the gas distribution and connection component are complete . As of March 31, 2013, a total of 358,862 new households have
                         been connected and converted to piped natural gas, representing 120% of the original project target. In the past 12 months, no new connections were made under the project. The
                         construction of the PSR in El Haram and New Cairo was delayed considerably due to site issue. Construction in New Cairo has now commenced. The delayed completion of these
                         PRS has not impacted the gas supply of the households connected under the project. All connected households have been supplied with piped gas without any interruption so far.
                         But once they are completed, they will further increase system reliability and allow additional gas connection in the surrounding areas of the PRS sites to be made. The loan closing

                         date has been extended by one year to provide sufficient time for the PRS to be completed and commissioned. A social impact assessment study conducted by a consultant shows
                         that the connected households and the community clearly feel and appreciate the benefits of piped natural gas as compared with LPG, such as improved reliability, increased safety
                         and reduced labor.
