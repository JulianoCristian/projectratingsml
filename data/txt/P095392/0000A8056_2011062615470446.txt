                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) contribute to GOE's program of switching consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for natural gas through
                         investment in new connections; and (ii) exploit the scale economies in transportation of natural gas relative to LPG in very densely populated areas, thereby
                         reducing the cost of gas provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All procurement activities under the original procurement plan are completed, and more than 70 contracts with a total value of more than $ 60 million are signed and under execution.
                         Construction of the distribution facilities started in October 2009 and is still in progress. As end of March 2011, a total of 181,976 new households have been connected and
                         converted under the project. Town Gas has developed a plan to use the remaining over $10 million to purchase additional goods and materials to fulfill the task of making about
                         300,000 new connections. An updated Procurement Plan (PP) has been agreed with the Bank and procurement activities are being launched. Environmental and social management

                         However, the construction of the four Pressure Reduction Stations (PRSs) have not started due to either permitting issue and land fee issue among the different government entities,

                         although all equipments have been delivered. The delayed construction and commissioning of these PRSs have not affected Town Gas's gas supply to existing and newly connected
                         households so far, but will start to impact Town Gas's future expansion plan if the PRS in New Cairo is not operational by end of 2011.
