                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) contribute to GOE's program of switching consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for natural gas through
                         investment in new connections; and (ii) exploit the scale economies in transportation of natural gas relative to LPG in very densely populated areas, thereby
                         reducing the cost of gas provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The procurement and construction activities related to the gas distribution and connection component has been progressing well. As of September 30, 2011, a total of 261,344 new
                         households have been connected and converted to piped natural gas, representing 87% ofthe original project target. Construction permits were obtained for the El Tebbin sites and
                         construction of the two Pressure Reduction Stations (PRS) at these sites has commenced.

                         However, the construction of the PRSs has not started due to permitting and land fee issue among the different government entities, although all equipments have been delivered.
                         The delayed construction and commissioning of these PRSs could start to impact Town Gas's future expansion plan soon in these areas.
