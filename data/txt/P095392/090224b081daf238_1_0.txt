                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) contribute to GOE's program of switching consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for natural gas through investment in
                         new connections; and (ii) exploit the scale economies in transportation of natural gas relative to LPG in very densely populated areas, thereby reducing the cost of gas
                         provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The procurement and construction activities related to the gas distribution and connection component are complete . As of March 31, 2013, a total of 358,862 new households have
                         been connected and converted to piped natural gas, representing 120% of the original project target. Construction of the 10,000 m3/day Pressure Reduction Station (PRS) at El
                         Tebbin is completed. The construction of another 150,000 m3/day PRS at El Tebbin is still ongoing. The Implementing Agency, Town Gas, indicated that the fee issue for the public
                         land is largely resolved and the construction of the PRS in El Haram and New Cairo is expected to commence shortly. The delayed completion of these PRS has not impacted the
