                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) contribute to GOE's program of switching consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for natural gas through investment in
                         new connections; and (ii) exploit the scale economies in transportation of natural gas relative to LPG in very densely populated areas, thereby reducing the cost of gas
                         provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The procurement and construction activities related to the gas distribution and connection component has been progressing well. As of March 31, 2012, a total of 331,773 new
                         households have been connected and converted to piped natural gas, representing 110% of the original project target. Construction of the 10,000 m3/day PRS at El Tebbin is
                         completed and construction of the 150,000 m3/day PRS at El Tebbin is on-going.

                         However, the construction of the Pressure Reduction Stations (PRS) in El Haram and New Cairo has not started due to land fee issue among the different government entities,

                         of the required land sometime ago.
