Both the Bank and the Borrower\n            received satisfactory performance ratings for their\n            respective roles in the project. There were no\n            restructurings or significant changes in the design of the\n            project, neither on its implementation arrangements or\n            funding allocations. In 2013, the closing date of the\n            project was extended by one year to provide sufficient time\n            to complete the construction of some pressure reduction\n            stations (PRS). Three main lessons were learned from this\n            project and include the following: (1) implementing a\n            project that focuses exclusively in the deployment of\n            physical investments has the advantage of being less\n            dependent on the political economy of the country compared\n            to a project which tackles delicate institutional reforms,\n            (2) Making an effective use of the timespan in between the\n            approval of a project and its effectiveness can be very\n            useful to avoid unnecessary project delays, and (3)\n            embedding a Bank financed operation into a key strategy of a\n            client government strongly increases the likelihood of a\n            smooth implementation and a successful outcome."}, "docdt": "2015-04-22T10:42:02Z"}
