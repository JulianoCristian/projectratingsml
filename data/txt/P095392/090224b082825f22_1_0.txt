                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to (i) contribute to GOE's program of switching consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for natural gas through investment in
                         new connections; and (ii) exploit the scale economies in transportation of natural gas relative to LPG in very densely populated areas, thereby reducing the cost of gas
                         provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Except for two small components, all other project components are completed and operational. A total of 358,862 new households have been connected and converted to piped
                         natural gas, of which 333,000 are directly attributed to Bank financing, representing 110% of the original project target. All connected households have been supplied with piped gas
                         without any interruption since connection, despite the overall gas shortage in the country. The conversion of these households is contributing to GoE's objective to reduce energy
                         subsidy. The project development objective is being fully achieved and the project's sustainability is very likely. The last two small components of the project, the Pressure Reduction
                         Station in El Haram and New Cairo, representing about 7% of the total project cost, are in the final stage of installation. Both PRS are expected to be commissioned by October 31,

                         2014. The delayed completion of these PRS has not impacted the gas supply of the households connected under the project. But once the PRS are commissioned, they will further
                         increase system reliability and allow additional gas connection in the surrounding areas of the PRS sites to be made, and contribute to the project's sustainability in the long term. A
                         social impact assessment study conducted by a consultant shows that the connected households and the community clearly appreciate the benefits of piped natural gas as compared
                         with LPG, such as improved reliability, increased safety and reduced labor.
