{"cdata!": "The Health Sector Programme of Work\n            (POW-II) serves as a plan for the whole sector and describes\n            more in detail those health activities funded through public\n            resources, including Government budget, donor financing, and\n            Internally Generated Funds. For the Second POW, a broader\n            definition of the health sector has been adopted to include\n            government health services, traditional and non-government\n            providrs, civil society, and community groups. The objective\n            for the period 2002-2006 is to continue to improve the\n            health status of the population while focusing efforts on\n            reducing inequalities in health. Furthermore, the Ghana\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) outlines the following key\n            objectives for 2002-2004: 1) Bridge the equity gap in access\n            to quality health and nutrition services; 2) Ensure\n            sustainable financing arrangements that protect the poor and\n            3) Enhance efficiency in service delivery. This project\n            specifically supports the Government in achieving the\n            abovementioned objective and supports the Ministry of Health\n            in implementing its 2002-2006 POW through financing a\n            portion of the combined Government and external assistance\n            budgets for policy development and operational program\n            activities. The Ministry of Health will focus on ten areas:\n            1) strengthening priority health interventions; 2)\n            developing human resources for health services; 3) enhancing\n            infrastructure and support services; 4) fostering\n            partnerships for health; 5) improving regulation; 6)\n            reforming organizational arrangements; 7) improving health\n            sector financing; 8) improving financial management systems;\n            9) further strengthening management information systems and\n            performance monitoring; and 10) linking with traditional medicine."}, "docdt": "2003-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
