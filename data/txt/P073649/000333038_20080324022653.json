satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            With the completion of HSPSP-II's support to\n            Ghana's health sector-wide approach (SWAp), reflection\n            on its achievements as well as weaknesses reveals several\n            lessons. One lesson is that a stronger analytic base is\n            needed even when things appear to be going well, as was the\n            case when the HSPSP-II was approved. In-depth analysis and\n            debate concerning equity of health services and outcomes,\n            efficiency of health services, and institutional analyses\n            would have been particularly helpful in anticipating\n            problems and furthering the agenda set by the program of\n            work (POW-II) and the Ghana poverty reduction strategy\n            (GPRS). It is also clear that donor behavior is critical to\n            the success or failure of a SWAp. Donors need to be\n            disciplined about their funding support to a sector and hold\n            other donors accountable for their actions. Donors can\n            easily revert back to earmarked, off-budget funding that\n            compromises the Government's attention to the\n            SWAp's implementation and success, while tempting other\n            donors to follow suit and push for their own agendas as\n            well. Other development partners moved towards budget\n            support, which can also cause disruptions at the sectoral\n            level. Safeguards should be instituted to ensure that shifts\n            to general budget support are upheld by processes to ensure\n            a smooth transition in financing modalities. Donor shifts to\n            budget support are in line with the Paris declaration;\n            however, countries need to be ready for this transition\n            ahead of time to ensure that the predictability of funds is\n            not interrupted."}, "docdt": "2007-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
