environmental and social\n            impacts of the Health Sector Program Support Center Project\n            are discussed in this report. The constructional phase will\n            be characterized by transfer and prefabricated materials,\n            equipment/machinery, and transport of workers to the site.\n            These activities will affect the already heavy vehicular\n            traffic, and pose accident risks resulting from occupational\n            hazards as well. Transport of soils and materials will\n            generate dust. Heavy construction vehicles and equipment may\n            generate noise. Solid waste in the form of debris and\n            topsoil will be carried off to sites. As the site is cleared\n            in preparation for construction, there will be loss of fauna\n            and flora. During the occupational phase, potential hazards\n            would be posed by exposure to hazardous health care waste.\n            Hazardous waste comprises infectious agents, hazardous\n            chemicals like disinfectants or obsolete pesticides, and\n            pharmaceuticals, genotoxic waste such as cytotoxic drugs,\n            radioactive materials, and sharps. There is a particular\n            concern that infection with immunodeficiency virus (HIV),\n            and hepatitis B and C could be transmitted through health\n            care waste, that is, injuries from syringes contaminated by\n            human blood or through secretions. After weighing various\n            options, the report concludes that the best disposal methods\n            for treated health care waste are controlled disposal at a\n            proper sanitary landfill and burial in cemeteries or a\n            crematorium. Some waste should be incinerated first."}, "docdt": "2002-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
