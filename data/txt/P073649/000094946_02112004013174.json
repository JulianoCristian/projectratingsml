"This resettlement policy framework\n            includes safeguards to address potential economic, social,\n            and environmental risks that may arise from involuntary\n            resettlement and to mitigate impoverishment risks. The\n            category of affected persons are defined as those who stand\n            to lose, as a consequence of the program, all or part of\n            their physical and non-physical assets, including homes,\n            communities, productive lands, resources such as range\n            lands, farm lands, or important cultural sites,\n            commercial/business properties, tenancy, income-earning\n            opportunities, and social and cultural networks and\n            activities. An entitlement matrix sets the standards for\n            compensation as follows: For loss of arable and grazing\n            land, non-arable land, or non-residential land, provide\n            either equivalent land or full compensation. Farmers or\n            landowners losing arable and grazing land can also opt for\n            assistance for land intensification and diversification.\n            Full compensation will be paid to the owner, workers, and\n            operators or those businesses or commercial and industrial\n            activities can be relocated to acceptable sites. Full\n            compensation will cover the loss of structures or income\n            during the period the affected person could not reap any\n            income, or the structure will be relocated to an acceptable\n            site. Loss of standing crops and livestock will be fully\n            compensated. Compensation paid for loss trees and plants\n            will depend on tree type, age, and diameter and/or\n            equivalent land will be given for replanting."}, "docdt": "2002-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
