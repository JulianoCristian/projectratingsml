INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE ISLAI4IC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE LAHORE ;JATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to U.S. $1.75 million
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to finance the initial stage of a
program of rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply, sewerage and
drainage system for metropolitan Lahore.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Lahore is the second largest city in West Pakistan and the
capital of the Province. At present its population is approximately
1.5 million; its estimated population growtlh rate is 4 percent per
annum. Lahore is fortunate to have a large source of ground water
beneath the city, but there is need to develop this for municipal use.
There is also need for rehabilitation and expansion of the existing
facilities.
3.        For the second time, the Kingdom of Sweden is joining the
International Development Association in financing an IDA project. The
first project in which the Kingdom of Sweden participated with IDA was
the Foodgrain Storage Project in East Pakistan (Credit No. 83 PAK). The
ratio of IDA-Swedish financing for this project was 80-20 and the
respective amounts were $19.2 million and $4.8 million. In the proposed
project the ratio is 50-50. IDA and the Kingdom of Sweden would each
lend $1.75 million.
4.        Negotiations with representatives of the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, the Province of West Pakistan and the Lahore Improvement Trust,
and the Kingdom of Sweden were held in Washington from November 21 to
December 1, 1966. Mr. Shah Mahmud Sulaiman, Economic and Financial
Minister, Embassy of Pakistan, represented the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan and Mr. Inayatullah, Chairman, Lahore Improvement Trust, the
Province of West Pakistan. Mr. Sheikh Abdur Rawoof, Project Director,
Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Project, Lahore Improvement
Trust, also participated. Mr. Goren Bundy, Economic Counsellor, Embassy
of Sweden, headed the Swedish delegation.
5.        The Bank has made 22 loans to Pakistan totalling about
$412 million, of which 13 are fully disbursed. The Association has made
22 credits totalling about $329 million, of which two are fully disbursed.
The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to
Pakistan as at March 31, 1967:

6.        IFC has made six investments in Pakistan totalling $12,608,469.
Of this amount $11,2h1,406 has been disbursed as of March 31, 1967. The
principal areas of investment have been the cement, paper and jute
industries and development banking. IFC is presently considering invest-
ment applications for fertilizers and additional jute and paper projects.
The IFC operations in Pakistan are thus far proceeding satisfactorily.
7.        In my report to you, No. P-519 dated December 14, 1966, I
commented on the slow rate of disbursement of IDA credits to Pakistan.
Since that time some progress has been made as reported to you in my
report No. P-529 dated ilarch 1, 1967. We are continuing to keep this
matter under careful review.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
8.        Borrower:         Islamic Republic of Pakistan, acting by
its President
Beneficiary:      Lahore Improvement Trust, through the
Province of West Pakistan
Amount:           U.S. $1.75 million in various currencies
Purpose:          To assist in financing the foreign exchange
and part of the local currency cost of the
initial two-year phase of a proposed five-
year (1968-1972) program to improve the
organization and management of the Lahore
Improvement Trust and to rehabilitate
existing, and to construct new, facilities
for water supply, sewerage and drainage in
metropolitan Lahore.
Amortization:     The development credit would be for a period
of 50 years, repayable in semi-annual
installments commencing June 1, 1977, and
ending December 1, 2016; each payment up to
and including the payment due on December 1,
1986 to be 1½ percent of 1 percent and each
payment thereafter to be 1½ percent of the
principal amount.
Service Charge:   3/4 of 1 percent per annum
Relending Terms:  The Borrowerwould relend the proceeds of the
credit to the Province of West Pakistan on
the same terms and conditions, except that
the principal amount of, and service charge
on, the credit would be denominated in
Pakistani rupees. The Province would relend
the funds to the Lahore Improvement Trust at
3½2 percent per annum for a period of 25 years,
including a 51 year grace period.



PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled "Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage
and Drainage Project - West Pakistan" (TO-551b) is attached.
10.       Because of the rapid growth of population and inadequate
planning, the water supply, sewerage and drainage systems have proved
increasingly inadequate to serve metropolitan Lahore. Heretofore, the
water supply system has been improved and expanded by the establishment
of unconnected wells and reservoirs. As a result, the supply is not
reliable and pressures are low. In addition, because of poor maintenance
and control, it is estimated that 40 percent of the water produced is
wasted.
11.       The combined sewerage and drainage system of the city is based
on a plan prepared in 1937 and consists of a number of interconnected
sewage and drainage channels. Serious drainage problems occur in Lahore
during the monsoon season because the countryside is flat, and flood
protection works and an irrigation canal create artificial barriers to
drainage. It is necessary to dispose of most of the storm water by
pumaping.  The existing equipment is inadequate and in a state of disrepair,
channels are silted up and overloaded, and the facilities require urgent
rehabilitation, maintenance and major expansion.
12.       The water supply, sewerage and drainage system was until recently
operated by the Lahore Municipal Corporation, an elected body. In order
to ensure more efficient operation of the system, the Provincial Government
has handed over the responsibility of running it to the Lahore Improvement
Trust (LIT), a semi-autonomous body which has been successfully inavolved
in the preparation and execution of programs for land improvement and
development in the city of Lahore and environs. Legislation under which
LIT has assuaed responsibility for the system was discussed during
negotiations and has been promulgated by the Governor of lWest Pakistan.
During negotiations, the Province undertook to cause LIT to take the
steps necessary to set up an effective organization for operation of the
WIater Division.
13.       The proposed project provides for the construction of a new
well center and about six miles of distribution mains to improve the
existing water supply and to provide water for certain newly developed
areas; construction of about five miles of sewers with three sewage
collection centers; and of about three miles of unpaved drainage
channels and two xnain drainage pumping stations.
1h.       These works are expected to be completed in about two years and
would constitute the first stage of a long-range program. Funds would be
provided under the credit for employment of management consultants to
assist LIT in the establishment of an efficient organization, and for the
employment of engineering consultants to supervise the execution of the
work included in the project and to design a six-year program of
rehabilitation and extension of services.

15.       The total cost of the proposed project, excluding interest and
working capital, is estimated at about $5.8 million equivalent. The
proposed IDA credit of $1.75 million (together with the proposed Swedish
credit of a like sum) would amount to about 60 percent of the estimated
total cost. This would represent the entire foreign exchange component
of about 45 percent of the total cost, and some 27 percent of the local
currency cost. The rest of the local currency cost would be covered by
loans from the Provincial Government. The terms of the Swedish credit
have not yet been decided. However, the credit will be for at least
20 years including a five year grace period at 2 percent per annum.
16.      Wdater, sewerage and drainage rates to be collected by LIT have
been set so as to yield sufficient revenues to cover operating and
maintenance cost, interest, depreciation and debt repayments, as well as
repayments on long-term indebtedness exceeding depreciation, cost of
normal extensions and about 15 percent of the cost of the future major
expansion of the system. This has required an average increase in rates
of about 90 percent for all three services. These increased rates were
instituted on February 16, 1967, by an ordinance promulgated by the
Province of West Pakistan.
17.       All civil works contracts of $75,000 equivalent or more as well
as all contracts for procurement of goods and equipment in the amount of
$25,000 equivalent or more will be reviewed by IDA and awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding following the procedures set
forth in the "Guidelines relating to Procurement under World Bank Loans
and IDA Credits" dated January 1967.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       (1) The Draft Development Credit Agreement between the
Association and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the
Draft Project Agreement between the Association and the
Province of West Pakistan, the Draft Administration
Letter between the Kingdom of Sweden and the Association
and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
(2) The credit documents contain the provisions customary
where there is a co-lender with the Association.
(3) The Administration Agreement provides for concurrent
but separate disbursements by the Association and
Sweden in the ratio of 50-50.
