The project would help BRPM to\n            (i) complete the exploration of producing areas where\n            marginally economic production prospects are likely to\n            exist, and (ii) assess the petroleum potential of basins yet\n            unexplored and develop \"leads\" which could attract\n            private foreign investors to the development of\n            Morocco's oil and gas reserves. It covers a\n            three-and-a-half year slice of BRPM's on-shore\n            exploration program. In addition, it provides for studies to\n            help BRPM to assess several options regarding the\n            development of the country's oil shale resources."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
