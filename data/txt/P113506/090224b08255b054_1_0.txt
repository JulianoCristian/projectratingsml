                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Emergency Demobilization and Transitional Reintegration project is now nearing completion. All activities for the project have been completed and the beneficiaries for the 150
                         houses are being moved into their new homes, all with an identified caretaker.

                         Major issues to be addressed prior to the close of the project include, (i) the hand-over of a caseload of 29 severely disabled ex-combatants who still require hospitalization, (ii) the
                         transition from the project team to the Government the management of 555 permanently disabled ex-combatants who require on-going care, and (iii) the follow-up of the 150
                         beneficiaries that have received houses to ensure that they have integrated with their new community.

                         The Government should be congratulated for completing all activities on time, particularly the construction of houses in an extremely short time frame.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project needs to ensure the completion of hospital care for 29 severely disabled ex-combatants.

                         The project must hand-over files and responsibilities to appropriate authorities in the Government, particularly a technical focal point for the houses, and a focal point on the medical
                         care and follow-up for disabled ex-combatants.
