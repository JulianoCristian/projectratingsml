                         The current phase of transitional economic reintegration is characterized as a period of consolidating the impact of this component for project beneficiaries. The project has continued
                         its support to ex-combatants by providing individual and group follow-up. Anecdotal evidence is demonstrating that the additional follow-up and mentoring is providing more success
                         in terms of sustainable transitional economic reintegration.

                         During the last six months,transitional social reintegration support to ex-combatants has continued with information,sensitization and reconciliation activities for ex-combatants and
                         host communities. There has been a specific focus on cultural and sports activities– and particularly those aimed at the inclusion of women. Training on the management of rumors
                         and peaceful resolution of conflicts has continued, with at least one such training having been conducted by implementing partners in each zone.The project is implementing the
                         initiation of the training on conflict management skills: ‘Mediation, Negotiation, ConflictResolution andCommunicationin partnership with the Burundian Leadership Training Program
                         (BLTP). This training was initiated in response to some escalation of violence at the community level and intimidation of beneficiaries observed during the previous mission, and the
                         risk this presents in terms of negatively affecting the project's efforts to foster social reintegration.

                         Support provided to disabled ex-combatants has seen improvement during the last six months, with increased numbers of referrals. A new tracking sheet was agreed upon and
                         monthly meetings between the TCT and the implementing partner will be held to closely monitor and review forward momentum for referrals.

                         There is overall progress with the implementation of the gender action plan, in particular the concerted effort to include women in community sports and cultural activities, continuation
                         of training on women's leadership and household budget management as well as the introduction of GBV training.

                         Psychosocial support is continuing well with identification and treatment being conducted in parallel. Treatment continues to be conducted at an individual, family and group level as
                         appropriate with home visits to particularly vulnerable cases including disabled ex-combatants and female-headed households.
