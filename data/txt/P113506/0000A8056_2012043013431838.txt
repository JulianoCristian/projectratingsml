                         The consolidation phase of transitional economic reintegration of ex-combatants continues with most recent endeavors being concentrated on reinforcing and strengthening ex-
                         combatants attempts to consolidate their economic reintegration through individual support. A concerted effort has gone into supporting economic associations of ex-combatants and
                         other community members resulting in reported success. The additional training and mentoring provided is enhancing the probability that these associations are likely to become
                         sustainable ventures beyond the lifespan of the project. Immediate action to sustain these gains must include a continuation of follow-up with individual ex-combatants as well as

                         associations, training and exposure to micro-finance organizations.

                         Social reintegration activities are progressing. While some tension remains between project beneficiaries and the Government of Burundi in certain localities, this is often mitigated by
                         the role of staff within the project. In areas where there have been no problems, project activities continue to successfully reinforce peace building.

                         Although still requiring focused attention and key interventions, the mission was satisfied with the forward development during the last six months of the support provided to disabled
                         ex-combatants. The mission, however, urged the TCT to focus attention on the provision of upper limb prosthetics, the large case load of surgeries, and the operational support
                         through the Implementing Partner (IP), AMK, to Project beneficiaries.

                         Gender. The project developed a gender action plan and this plan continues to be integrated into the overall work plan of the project.

                         Psychosocial cases identified have increased by 40 percent since the last mission, largely attributed to community sensitization activities and home visits made by Psychosocial
                         Assistants (PAs). Treatment activities are continuing at the individual, family and group level in parallel with continued identification of new cases.

                         Following recommendations from the mid-term review carried out in December 2010, as well as follow-up discussions with the Government of Burundi, participating donors to the
                         MDTF and World Bank management, a non-cost extension was processed for both IDA and the MDTF. The current closing date of the project is December 31, 2012.
