                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In August 2013 the Board approved an Additional Financing for the project. This additional financing will maintain the same PDO. The project has been extended until June 30, 2014.

                         The component for transitional economic reintegration has completed its individual support to ex-combatants. The focus has now shifted to support to associations that are

                         comprised of ex-combatants and community members. The Implementing Partners (IPs), who are local NGOs that assist the project to implement activities across the country, are
                         now focused on providing technical support to local associations. From now until the close of the project a focus in transitional economic reintegration will also be to further support
                         those associations that demonstrate potential to scale-up their activities and to become cooperatives. i

                         The component for social reintegration will continue, with an emphasis on completing conflict mitigation training for ex-combatants. This focus on reconciliation and conflict resolution
                         at the local level specifically addresses the potential for violence and intimidation in communities through a the conflict mitigation activity. The social reintegration component has
                         successfully addressed the gender dimension in the project in parallel with communications support that also emphasizes the role of women and gender in reintegration
                         programming.

                         Support provided to disabled ex-combatants continues to be a strong focus of the project, ensuring that the full caseload of disabled ex-combatants will receive appropriate care. The
                         additional financing will reinforce this component with the construction of houses for the most severely disabled ex-combatants.

                         Psychosocial support is continuing well with identification and treatment being conducted in parallel. Treatment continues to be conducted at an individual, family and group level as
                         appropriate with home visits to particularly vulnerable cases including disabled ex-combatants and female-headed households.
