Transitional Reintegration Project for Burundi were\n            satisfactory with substantial risk to the development\n            outcome. The performances by both the Bank and the Borrower\n            were satisfactory. Given the satisfactory performance of the\n            project, strong commitment from the GoB to provide housing\n            for severely disabled ex-combatants as well as the\n            availability of resources (MDTF balance), the GoB requested\n            Additional Financing (AF) from the Bank to provide housing\n            for severely disabled ex-combatants among other activities\n            aimed at strengthening support to vulnerable groups. An AF\n            of US$ 7.9 million (US$4.25 million funded by MDTF and\n            US$3.63 million by the GoB) was approved by the Executive\n            Directors on August 26, 2013 and became effective on\n            November 26, 2013. During project preparation it was\n            foreseen that the project would be funded through a US$10\n            million IDA grant and a US$12.5 million MDTF. The IDA\n            allocation was increased to US$15 million prior to the Board\n            meeting to cover a potential short-term shortfall of donor\n            contributions to the MDTF. An MDTF Grant of US$ 12.5 million\n            became effective on April 21, 2010, covering the full\n            project cost. Pursuant to Section 6.03, paragraph 6 of the\n            General Conditions of the Financing Agreement, the Country\n            Director (CD) approved the cancellation of the equivalent of\n            US$5 million from the IDA Grant on April 20, 2010."}, "docdt": "2014-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
