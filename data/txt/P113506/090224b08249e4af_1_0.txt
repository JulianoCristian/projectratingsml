                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The first months (December 2013 - March 2014) of the additional financing for the Emergency Demobilization and Transitional Reintegration project has commenced well, overall.
                         The implementation period is seven months, which places pressure on the project team to deliver. The construction of 150 houses for severely disabled ex-combatants was initiated
                         with slight delay, placing a completion date of June 20, 2014. Once the houses are complete the project must still ensure that all beneficiaries are moved in and given the necessary

                         support to ensure sustainability in a new house and community.

                         One major issue is the late treatment by the project team of safeguards mechanisms - essentially commencing the full ESMF document after effectiveness. Additionally, the project
                         must now build three houses for Batwa families in Makamba to respect the Bank resettlement guidelines.

                         Support to associations to scale them up to cooperatives is progressing well, as is the activity for conflict mitigation training.
