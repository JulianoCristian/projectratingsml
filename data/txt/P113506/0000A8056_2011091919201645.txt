                         The economic reintegration of ex-combatants is now in the consolidation phase with over 99 percent having received their benefits and either engaged in their chosen economic
                         activities or sold these benefits to pursue a different agenda. Increasingly, ex-combatants are either creating or joining associations, which overwhelmingly include other members of
                         their communities. Early indications are that these are working out well, but that additional efforts by the project are necessary to consolidate and build on this early success. More
                         training and capacitation will be necessary to ensure that a sustainable reintegration effort remains after the Project exits.

                         The social reintegration of ex-combatants can be said to be almost complete and although there remains a culture of blame and entitlement in some areas, this is declining and with
                         an additional communications drive should be eradicated altogether. Activities promoted by the Project have been successful in reaching out to male ex-combatants, but less so to
                         their spouses and female ex-combatants, and it will be necessary, in addition to continuing with the current strategy, to ramp up that for women.

                         Assistance to disabled ex-combatants. The sub-component disabled ex-combatants is still the biggest challenge for the project. The component of the disability is feasible if: (i) the
                         number of final beneficiaries is correctly identified at the end of July, (ii) references to health care facilities are planned on the basis of the priorities of care for disabled and the
                         capacity of each health facility and the establishment of an efficient transport system of the disabled, and (iii) the production of prostheses is accelerated. In addition, although the
                         project made good progress in identifying the need for specialized psycho-social support, the project needs to accelerate delivery of this type of support.

                         Gender. The project developed a gender action plan and this plan has been integrated into the overall work plan of the project.

                         Extension of the project. Following the results of the mid-term review, the Government of Burundi has requested the Bank to a project extension until 31 December 2012, including
                         both the IDA and multi donor trust fund. This extension is intended to ensure that all objectives and results, will be completed as planned by the project. The expansion will focus on
                         the following areas: (i) support for disabled ex-combatants, and (ii) providing quality assistance to the reintegration transition, both in terms of economic and social reintegration,
                         including psychosocial support. The state of the current financial situation of the project shows that the necessary resources for the extension are available in the current budget of
                         the project. All donors of the MDTF, namely the EU, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway have expressed their support for the proposed extension. I
