"This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Gas Distribution Project in Indonesia.\n            . The project's main objectives were (i) to bring about\n            institutional changes and policy modifications to facilitate\n            the penetration of natural gas in the domestic economy; (ii)\n            to support Government of Indonesia\u2019s (GOI) efforts to\n            improve its energy pricing policy; and, (iii) to accelerate\n            the utilization of natural gas in high-value uses in the\n            domestic market. Overall, the Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. The Government, as Borrower, generally\n            performed well. The key lessons learned were: (a) the\n            importance of using a twinning arrangement for institution\n            building in parallel with project implementation, and\n            careful selection of the twinning partner; (b) the key to\n            State Gas Corporation rapid sales growth was the\n            introduction of market development techniques; (c) gas sales\n            contracts should be in place before construction of the gas\n            pipeline commences, otherwise the consumer has a significant\n            advantage over the distribution company; (d) sequencing of\n            distribution network construction should be geared towards\n            maximizing economic gains early on; (e) a component\n            shouldn't be included in the Project without sufficient\n            Borrower commitment and preparation, as was the case with\n            the customer conversion component; (f) an appropriate legal\n            and regulatory framework is needed (and still is needed) to\n            enforce delivery of contracted gas supplies; and (g) avoid\n            hiring consultants about whom there are considerable\n            technical reservations, as was the situation during the\n            Energy Pricing Policy Study."}, "docdt": "1995-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
