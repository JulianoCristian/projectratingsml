This will include new supply lines, local\n            distribution pipelines, regulator stations and customer\n            metering stations. The loan would also provide for the\n            rehabilitation of Perusahaan Umum Gas Negara's (PGN)\n            existing unsafe gas distribution networks and the\n            establishment of a program to assist industrial users in\n            plant conversion for natural gas use. A centerpiece of the\n            Gas Distribution will be the \"twinning\" of PGN\n            with an established gas utility to develop PGN's\n            managerial and technical expertise through close\n            collaboration with a similar, more experienced operating entity."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
