project would (a) pursue the\n            strengthening and expansion of maintenance capacity\n            undertaken under a first project; (b) initiate a high\n            priority reconstruction program for primary and secondary\n            roads with 150 km of road reconstruction and the completion\n            of final design studies of an additional 300 km of road\n            reconstruction; (c) demonstrate the application of labor\n            based techniques with the construction and improvement of\n            200 km of rural access roads; (d) upgrade SEOPC maintenance\n            personnel through training; and (e) strengthen SEOPC's\n            planning and programming capacity through the establishment\n            of a special unit entrusted with that task. The\n            project's major risk is the limited maintenance and\n            reconstruction capability of SEOPC, which could be strained\n            by the urgent reconstruction requirements resulting from the\n            recent hurricanes. The rural roads program has a somewhat\n            higher level of risk than other project components because\n            of its experimental nature."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
