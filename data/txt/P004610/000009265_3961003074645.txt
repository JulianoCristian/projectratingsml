)IENORANDUM AND RECOMMS[DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVF DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF 'HILIPPINES
FOR A POVER TRANSMISSION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the National Power Corporation (NPC) with
the guarantee of the Republic of Philippines for the equivalent of US$110
million to help finance a Power Transmission and Rehabilitation Project. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
20 years, including five years of grace. The Government of Philippines would
charge a guarantee fee of 0.5 percent per annum on the outstanding amount of
the Bank loan.
2.        Country/Sector Background.  Power demand growth in the Philippines
has been uneven, largely following variations in GDP growth; in the last two
years growth h. been severely restricted due to supply constraints.
Nevertheless, power sales increased 6% p.a. between 1986-91. Once adequate
power supply is restored, sales are expected to increase by 8X p.a. until the
year 2000 because of increased industrialization, an increased number of
households connected, and improvement of living standards of the population.
However, the annual per capita demand for power in the Philippines is low (375
kWh) --equivalent to just a couple of weeks of the per capita use in developed
countries. Even considering the effect of ongoing or proposed energy
conservation programs and using conservative estimates of the GDP growth, in
order to meet the increased demand the current generating capacity would have
to be doubled by the year 2000 to 8,170 MW. This would require considerable
investments,   sound  financial  policies,   and  increased  private  sector
participation.
3.         The present strategy of steadily increasing the private sector role
in power generation and operational management is adequate. Private sector
participation in the energy sector in the Philippines is substantial. Energy
exploration is private and oil refining and distribution are carried out by two
private companies (CALTEX and Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation) in
addition to Petron (the oil subsidiary of PNOC), which will be privatized in
1994. With the exception of NPC, which is responsible for power generation and
transmission, and a handful of municipal distribution utilities, all power
distribution and retailing is done by private utilities, including MERALCO in
Manila (which uses about 60% of the power generated by NPC) and 120 rural
electrification cooperatives. Furthermore, the Philippines is a pioneer with
private sector participation in power generation. There are fifteen contracts
signed and several others under negotiation with the private sector for the
construction, financing and operation of power plants using Build-Operate-and
Transfer (BOT) or Build-Transfer-and-Operate (BTO) systems. The total power
generation contracted with the private sector amounts to about 601 of the
present reliable capacity (of which 1,000 MW will be in operation by end of
1993) and the private sector is expected to finance most new power generation.
A USAID-funded study identified options to privatize NPC, but additional
detailed studies will be needed to solve constitutional, financial and
commercial constraints and set implementation procedures to ensure a successful
privatization. NPC's Board of Directors has already decided that practically
all new generation plants will be bid out as BOT projects. The best alternative
seems to be for NPC to become responsible for national transmission, some power
generation and the overall power dispatch, with power generation becoming fully



competitive under improved bidding procedures. In accord with the Energy Sector
Plan (ESP), a decision on NPC privatization will be taken by end-1993 (para.
6). In the interim, ways and means are needed to improve policies and reduce
the uncertainties and risks faced by the private sector as well as encourage
even wider private participation.
4.        The Power Crisis and the Project.  The Philippines is currently
experiencing an acute power shortage. This poses a grave threat to its economic
recovery because of prolonged outages which are hampering its industrial and
commercial activities. Consequently unemployment is increasing and economic
losses are running at an estimated level of $600-$800 million per year.
Conventional power supply projects (coal, geothermal and hydro) require
construction times of three to six years, and would not be able to provide
relief in the short term. The Government has, therefore, embarked on a "fast-
track" generation expansion program and has contracted with the private sector
for the financing, implementation and operation of several combustion turbine
or diesel-engine driven systems. These systems are operationally more expensive
than base load plants, but are the only power sources that can be commissioned
within one year. The project would provide the transmission facilities required
for this additional power. Under the "Electric Power Crisis Act of 1993", the
President has been given special powers to solve the power crisis including
facilitating tariff increases, speeding-up project approvals and increasing
technical salaries in the sector.
5.        Institutional Issues. While a major cau2e of power shortages in the
Philippines has been a record drought during the last three years, which has
seriously curtailed hydro capacity, poor institut4fonal performance has also
contributed to the crisis. There have been prolonged delays in environmental
approvals for new power projects and financial and institutional weaknesses in
NPC's performance have prevented it from making the needed investments. NPC's
finances deteriorated severely in 1991 when, partially because of high local
oil prices resulting from the Gulf War and the suspension of a tariff increase
by the Supreme Court, its financial performance was not satisfactory and
required substantial cash contributions from the government. A reform program
was then agreed with the Bank and its implementation has since resulted in
considerable institutional improvements, substantially reduced the need for
Government cash contributions and forced tariff hikes that increased the rate
of return from 3.4X in 1991 to 71 in 1992. Moreover, NPC's net income increased
from minus P3.1 billion in 1991 to p4.6 billion in 1992. Nevertheless, NPC
equity needs to be increased to support large future investment, and the
Congress  approved    a  03  billion  equity  infusion  from  the  Oil  Price
Stabilization Fund (OPSF) surplus for 1993, as well as 101 (about P300 million
per year) of the revenues for the next five years of the Philippine Amusement
and Casino Corporation. NPC has already implemented major institutional and
operational improvements. These include: (a) streamlining its structure by
halving the number of top managers, which eliminated 17 vice presidencies and
about 20 department managers and reduced the staff from 16,056 to 14,256
between 1991-92 and further improvements are being implemented under NPC's new
management;  (b)  rationalizing  functions   and  providing   for  g_eater
decentralization (particularly for maintenance, watershed management and
accounting); (c) introducing standardized bidding specifications, establishing
a contracts committee a-d delegating responsibilities for procurement to the
regional ma.agers; (d) establishing programs and targets to improve combustion
efficiency; (e) improving project implementation and (f) pursuing better
internal audits and rotating staff who exercise critical financial functions.



- 3 -
A comprehensive review of NPC s institutional aspeczs is being undertaken under
an "Efficiency and Operational Improvement Study", which has been contracted by
the Bank and is finaneed by a Japanese grant. The study would provide
recommendations and improvements to be implemented under the project (para.
1).
6.        The Energy Sector Plan (ESP). Sector reform and improvements are the
highest priority of the new administration, and, as a result its dialogue with
the Bank, the Government prepared and approved in January 1993 the ESP, a "road
map" charting the course of actions that the Government would take to improve
the operations of the energy sector as a whole. The ESP sets out adequate
improvements and implementation schedules in all areas of concern, particularly
for sector coordination, regulatory framework, private sector participation,
power and oil pricing, environmental management, energy conservation,
operational efficiency and project implementation. The Government, NPC and the
Bank will exchange views on the implementation of the ESP. Some key actions of
the ESP have already been implemented, including the establishment of the
Department of Energy (DOE). ESP's actions to improve NPC's finances include a
tariff increase to yield an 8X rate of return on revalued assets in 1993. Under
the project, other tariff improvements have already been approved by NPC's
Board and are being reviewed by the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) for
implementation in the second `alf of 1993. These will include: (a) a total fuel
cost adjustment mechanism to compensate for variations in fuel and the cost of
purchased energy, which would make future tariff adjustments largely automatic;
and (b) the implementation of a restructured tariff introducing demand charges
to reduce peak demand.
7.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. From 1957-75, the Bank
financed three hydro projects, two thermal plants, one transmission project and
a rural electrification scheme. Three loans were also approved for coal, oil
and geothermal exploration. Project Performance Audit Reports were prepared for
two projects with NPC (the fourth and seventh projects, PPAR No. 0980 and PPAR
No. 8574). The major problems identified in the PPARs were implementation
delays and cost overruns due to project design changes, cumbersome contract
award procedures and weak project management. Because of a disagreement on
sector policies, the Bank discontinued lending until 1988 when it approved a
geothermal generation project (Bacon Manito-Loan 2969). In 1988-89, two other
projects were approved: One was for MERALCO's power distribution in Metro
Manila and another was for the Energy Sector (Loans 3163-PH, 3164-PH and 3165-
PH). These projects financed sector investments and supported improved sectoral
policies regarding investment strategy, financing and coordination. They are
generally being implemented satisfactorily, but the completion of the Bacon
Manito project is delayed about one and a half years, and NPC recently had
problems in achieving the covenanted rate of return. These problems have been
factored into the design of the proposed project.
8.        Rationale  for Bank Involvement.  The government requires  strong
support from the Bank to solve the country's power supply crisis in the near
term, and to establish sound sectoral policies that would enable the large
investments needed in the medium to long term. Ensuring adequate power supply
is the most critical problem in the country's economic development and is a
priority for the Bank's lending strategy for the Philippines. The proposed
project would help alleviate a grave power supply situation, with the private
sector providing the additional generating capacity, and NPC expanding and
reinforcing its transmission system. Bank intervention in the power sector has



- 4 -
been critical in defining improved policies and actions through the formulation
of an Energy Sector Plan and in strengthening NPC's finances, improving its
efficiency, promoting actions to enhance private sector generation of power and
establishing the DOE. Bank support is also critical to balance the country's
need for energy development with sound environmental practices. These are
crucial elements in the process of solving the ongoing power crisis in the
Philippines and preparing the sector for effective implementation of its energy
program.
9.        Prolect Objectives. The main objectives of the proposed project are
to: (a) alleviate power shortages in Luzon, through a transmission system
expaision and reinforcement program needed to bring power to Kanila from the
"fast track" generation plants and the rehabilitation of the Bataan thermal
generating plant; (b) improve the performance of the energy sector through the
approval by the Government, in consultation with the Bank, of an Energy Sector
Plan covering policies, institutions and implementing mechanisms (para. 6) and
key improvements by NPC; (c) ensure the financial viability of NPC to undertake
a massive and long-overdue itnestment program; and (d) improve NPCGs
institutional setup (para. 5).
10.       Prolect Desc;iption.  The proposed project will have the following
major components:
(a) Expansion of the transmission system in the Bataan/Batangas areas west of
Metro Manila, to facilitate transmission of almost 1000 MW of new "fast-
track" generation capacity planned at Limay and Subic power station sites;
.b) Provision of goods and materials (conductors, insulators and supports) to
reinforce the transmission system;
(c) Rehabilitation of the two units (Unit #1, 75 MW and Unit #2, 150 MW) of
the Bataan oil-fired thermal power plant. Unit 2 already operates at less
than 43% capacity and both units experience frequent outages. The
rehabilitation would ensure continued operation at rated capacity and
improved heat rate and plant availability at a fraction of the cost of a
new plant; and
(d) Consulting assistance for project preparation and implementation of a
master plan to develop the 500 kV extra high voltage (EHV) system, detail
the scope and optimization of the rehabilitation work for the Bataan
thermal plant and improve NPC's institutional systems (para. 5).
11.       Project Implementation. The implementation of the proposed project
would be carried out by NPC. The project cost is estimated at US$144.8 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$126.1 million equivalent
(871), and taxes and duties are estimated at about US$5.7 million equivalent.
The total financing required, including interest during construction, is
US$159.8 million, of which the Bank would finance US$110 million equivalent
(87% of the foreign exchange cost and 76% of the total project cost, excluding
interest during construction). The project includes transmission lines,
presently under implementation, which are critical to the success of the "fast
track" generation program and restoring power supply in 1993. However, the
Board presen'ation had to be postponed by six months until tho required tariff
improvements were implemented. Under these exceptional circumstances the
recommended retroactive financing has been increased to US$22.0 mi.lion (20X of



-5-
the loan) for payments made prior to the date of the loan agreement but after
September 1, 1992. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 10996-PH, dated June 3, 1993 is being distributed
separately.
12.       Project Sustainability.  Effective formulation and implementation of
the ESP would provide a sound environment for the se:.tor and the strengthening
of NPC's organizational, planning and financing capabilities. NPC has already
made important improvements in its organization and procedures to delegate
greater responsibility and exact clear accountability from its regional
managers. This will ensure improved project implementation and more effective
plant maintenance. The financial improvements included in the project would
provide NPC with the resources needed to help finance its huge investment
program.
13.       Agreed Actions. The following actions have been taken prior to Board
presentation: approval of an ESP satisfactory to the Bank; implementation by
NPC of a tariff increase to achieve a rate of return of 8X in 1993, and
approval of an indexing mechanism for NYC's tariffs to compensate for changes
in prices of petroleum products. The approval by ERB of an automatic tariff
indexing mechanism to change NPC's tariffs in relation to all fuel costs and
purchased energy and the presentation to ERB of a satisfactory application to
introduce demand charges to MERALCO will be a conditions for loan
effectiveness. A satisfactory rehabilitation and environmental plan is a
condition of disbursements for the rehabilitation of the Bataan plant. The
following have been agreed with the Government and NPC: (a) introtction of
demand charges for all NPC's customers by December 26,  1993  (to foster
efficiency and reduce peak demand); (b) achievement of an after-tax rate of
return of 8% on revalued fixed assets; (c) maintaining a debt service ratio
higher than 1.3; (d) reviewing not later than December 31, 1993 of the
"Efficiency and Operational Improvement Study" and implementing thereafter the
agreed recommendations from the study; (e) completing by December 31, 1993 a
valuation of NPC fixed assets in operation, and an annual revaluation
thereafter; (f) appointing not later than December 31, 1993 consultants for the
Bataan plant rehabilitation; (g) securing by December 31, 1993 the
environmental clearance certificate for the Bataan Plant; (h) reviewing
annually with the Bank NPC's Power Development Program; and (i) implementing
improved procedures for private sector participation in energy generation,
including standardized bidding documents not later than December 31, 1993.
14.       Environmental Asgects. The proposed project is not expected to have
any significant adverse impacts on the environment. Transmission lines will be
routed along existing roadways and run on poles, causing minimum infringement
upon the line corridor. Substation expansions will take place within existing
substation premises. The Government and NPC have confirmed that no population
would be resettled as a result of the project. However, in case some
resettlement is required, agreement was reached at negotiations that NPC would
take adequate measures for the resettlement and rehabilitation of all persons
involuntarily displaced. NPC will procure necessary Environmental Clearance
Certificates from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (which is
the regulating authority).   The component for rehabilitation of the Bataan



- 6 -
thermal power plant is expected to result in a aignificant decrease in
particulate  emissions,  due  to  more  complete  combustion  after  boiler
rehabilitation. The improved heat rate would reduce fuel oil consumption and
consequently gaseous emissions. Further cost effective options to improve the
environmental performance of Bataan will be explored by the consultants.
15.       Proiect Benefits. The project would alleviate an acute power shortage
in the country, reducing or eliminating large economic losses resulting from
prolonged (3 to 10 hours) outages in Luzon. Moreover, the ESP done in
preparation for this project has established a sound base for sector
development and specific implementation plans. The projec.t will also
substantially improve the institutional and financial operations of NPC.
16.       Risks. Althrough  the Government  is forcefully pursuing a  large
expansion of its power generation from the private sector, its implementation
could be delayed on financial grounds. This risk is minimized by the number of
projects and Zhe diversity of the contractors. Should extensive delays occur
the power supply situation would continue to remain critical and the consequent
curtailment of demand would have an adverse impact on the economy. The risk of
delays in the implementation of the project's transmissioi program has been
minimized by an advanced and effective procurement program being monitored
monthly by the Bank. There is also a risk that tariffs would not be increased
in the future. However, this risk is reduced because of the recent decisions of
the Energy Regulatory Board approving the principles for NPC tariffs and
because of the automatic tariff adjustments to be implemented. Moreover, the
new admin'stration in the Philippines has targeted energy problems as its top
priority.
17.       Reconmen_4tio.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
