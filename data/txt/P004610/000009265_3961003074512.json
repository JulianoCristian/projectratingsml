{"cdata!": "The main objectives of the Power\n            Transmission and Rehabilitation Project are to alleviate\n            power shortages in Luzon, through:  (a) a transmission\n            system expansion and reinforcement program needed to bring\n            power to Manila from the fast track generation plants; and\n            (b) the rehabilitation of the Bataan thermal generating\n            plant.  It will also improve the performance of the energy\n            sector with an Energy Sector Plan covering policies,\n            institutions and implementing mechanisms.  In addition it\n            will ensure the financial viability of the National Power\n            Corporation (NPC) to undertake a massive and long-overdue\n            investment program and improve its institutional setup.  The\n            project will have the following major components: (a)\n            expansion of the transmission system in the Bataan/Batangas\n            areas west of Metro Manila; (b) provision of goods and\n            materials (conductors, insulators and supports) to reinforce\n            the transmission system; (c) rehabilitation of the two units\n            of the Bataan oil-fired thermal power plant; (d) consulting\n            assistance to prepare a master plan to develop the 500 kV\n            extra high voltage system and rehabilitate the Bataan\n            thermal plant; and (e) improvement of NPC's\n            institutional systems."}, "docdt": "1993-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
