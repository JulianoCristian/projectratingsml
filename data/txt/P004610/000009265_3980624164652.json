Rehabilitation\n            Project in Philippines. The project's main objective,\n            as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), was to\n            alleviate the power shortages in Luzon, caused by a power\n            crisis that had begun in 1991. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The most important lesson to be learned from this project is\n            that in case of conflict the specific provision of the loan\n            agreement prevails. To illustrate, It has been noted that a\n            contract for the supply of transmission line insulator\n            assembly was denied funding under the loan by the Bank due\n            to conflict in the procurement procedure followed by NPC\n            against Bank's guidelines on procurement process,. The\n            transmission line projects under the loan were completed\n            generally on schedule This happened because there was a\n            common appreciation of the situation that there was power\n            crisis besetting the country. That situation has brought\n            together all concerned NPC functional groups to a very\n            coordinated effort that resulted to the completion of\n            critical transmission line projects generally on schedule. A\n            well defined objective combined with cooperation and proper\n            coordination are key factors in the project implementation."}, "docdt": "1998-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
