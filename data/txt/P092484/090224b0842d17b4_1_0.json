Timor-Leste\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was negligible to low, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: consistency and stability of personnel are\n            important. In this case, turnover of both\n            consultants/advisors and task team leaders negatively\n            impacted project performance at various stages of\n            implementation. A modest initial project scope, producing\n            quick and demonstrable wins, can be preferable to early\n            ambition. In this case, the complexity of planned activities\n            and results matrix overwhelmed staff with limited capacity,\n            necessitating restructuring to streamline. Deliberate and\n            focused attention to balancing the implementation and\n            capacity building roles of external technical advisors is\n            critical for long-term success. In this case, the advisors\n            frequently assumed direct implementation roles in response\n            to a demanding government agenda, delaying absorption of\n            skills and capacity among local, permanent staff."}, "docdt": "2016-03-23T01:20:02Z"}
