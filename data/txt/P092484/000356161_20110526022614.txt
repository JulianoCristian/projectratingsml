                         Extension of Closing Date
     TIMOR-LESTE — PLANNING AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CAPACITY
                          BUILDING PROGRAM
                                P092484
                 IDA GRANT NO. H210-TP AND TF NO. 093959

                                  Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date of both the IDA-Grant and the MDTF trust fund no. TF093959
supporting the Timor-Leste Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building
Program (PFMCBP): P092484, will be extended to November 30, 2012.

2.      Implementation progress since early 2008 has been strong after a slow start
following Program effectiveness in 2006. PFMCBP was formally restructured in early
2010 to align its objectives to emerging priorities and to reduce the scope and complexity
of the Program. PFMCBP has been the main coordinating mechanism around PFM since
early 2008, when MOF’s workload leaped with petroleum receipts and the 2006 crisis.

3.      A Mid-Term Review (MTR) in June 2010 found that the Program had contributed
significantly to building up capacity across MOF. It helped to respond to urgent needs
but also address long-term objectives, including: a major reorganization of MOF;
significant upgrades to the Integrated Financial Management Information System
(IFMIS); strengthening revenue administration; and the development of a policy analysis
capability. These reforms have enabled a rapid rise in Government spending to address
urgent needs, whilst also improving transparency. MOF’s organizational restructuring
have increased clarity over roles and responsibilities, and promoted greater
communication, gradually building up a strong management cadre. Although the
Program is focused on MOF, it has had a positive impact on engagement with the line
ministries, the Council of Ministers, and the Parliament.

4.       The proposed extension is necessary to start the implementation of MOF’s
Strategic Plan (SP), which was recently finalized after extensive work following the
MTR, to identify priority capacity development needs across MOF. The SP provides a
detailed roadmap to strengthen MOF capacity for prudent, effective and accountable
planning and management of public finances. It recommends priorities based on MOF’s
critical role in the implementation of Timor-Leste’s Strategic Development Plan. The
extension period will enable MOF to start preparations for any follow on program of
support beyond November 2012, to be based on its Strategic Plan. The extension also
takes into account the need to provide a smooth transition during the Presidential and
Parliamentary elections scheduled in 2012.

5.      This will be the first extension of the PFMCBP.
