                         The Public Financial Management Capacity Building Project (PFMCBP) closed on January 31, 2014. The project has been under implementation for 7 years and 2 months. The
                         project was approved in May 2006, became effective in November of 2006. It has been restructured two times to align project interventions to the Government's National Strategic
                         Plans and strengthen support during a rapid expansion of the role of government, and the budget, to deliver economic growth and access to public services.

                         The final year of implementation has coincided with a step improvement in the institutional and management capacity of the Ministry of Finance, and continued policy achievements,
                         with direct support from the project.

                         Noteworthy policy achievements include the publication of the first full series of national accounts to 2011, Timely submission of the 2014 budget within a prudent fiscal envelope and
                         reduced reliance on external advisers, preparation of financial regulations, a budget preparation manual, settling of payment arrears, a clean up of databases for taxpayers, the
                         preparation of a customs code and infrastructure for border-crossings, and the completion of only the second time release study for port cargo.

                         These achievements occurred during a Ministry re-structuring and the preparation of a new organic law following the 2012 parliamentary elections and aimed at delivering the
                         Ministry's Strategic Plan. Senior Management positions have been re-filled through robust merit-based recruitment. Clear job descriptions and key performance indicators have been
                         prepared, drawn from the Ministry's Annual Action Plan and Strategic Plan. A Young Professionals stream has absorbed project-funded scholarship returnees and external talent. In
                         essence, Senior management in the ministry are now working to the same set of goals, and are being held fully accountable for their delivery through an individual and ministry-wider
                         performance monitoring framework. The project, and in particular its engagement with the Directorate General of Corporate Services, directly supported this.

                         The results achieved through project component activities help deliver the PDO, for instance:
                         - Improvements in budget execution over time (with the exception of 2012) reflect continued high growth in nominal spending, which translates into high non-oil GDP growth, and
                         poverty reduction, especially in Urban areas. Government spending accounted for 7 percentage points of 9.5 percent non-oil growth measured in 2010.
                         - More effort on domestic revenues has resulted in actual revenues systematically exceeding budget targets, together with an improving non-oil fiscal deficit, demonstrate a maturing
                         of the government's PFM system, and notably a step up in revenue management.
                         - A legal and HR unit have been created and strengthened by a recent ministry-wide staff and task mapping exercise, directly building both institutional capacity, as well as individual
                         capacity.
                         - the compilation of national accounts, and training in the macro-framework, and the preparation of an agreed statistics workplan for government, have provided essential data for
                         policies to plan and protect high growth rates.
                         - While it still takes too long overall, improvements in releasing financial accounts, coupled with more timely submission of the budget to Parliament with much fewer consultant
                         inputs, greatly strengthen the government's accountability and the likelihood that PFM reforms will continue.

                         At closure, the key issues raised in the last ISR have been addressed, thereby helping ensure the sustainability of project results achieved, and an orderly administrative closure of
                         the project, including robust reporting:

                         (i) Although the funding modalities under PFMCBP come to a close, the sustainability of gains has been ensured as the Government program continues with own funding, and a

                         direct financing arrangement from Australia and the EU, ready to begin immediately. The fact that the Ministry will now receive direct assistance akin to budget support from key
                         development partners, shows a level of confidence in Ministry systems, strengthened over time with project support. In addition, the World Bank has been invited to remain formally
                         engaged in the identification of reform priorities, and advisory services to deliver these priorities.

                         (ii) All PFMCBP consultants being retained, have been contracted, and key project support (PIU) staff have been absorbed into corporate services Directorate General. Their job
                         descriptions include completing project closure, the last audit, and financial and operational reporting.

                         (iii) The Ministry's own comprehensive performance mapping and assessment of all technical assistants, including those hired under PFMCBP, will be completed in March. This will
                         be a valuable input to the project Implementation Completion Report.

                         (iv) At closure, the project will have executed ca. 98 percent of its $32.1 million funding. The balance is due to currency gains and natural lags in filling consultant positions that fell
                         vacant during the final 14 month extension of the project.

                         Any remaining (in progress) closure issues will be captured in the Implementation Completion Report due before the Project's end disbursement date of 31 July 2014.
