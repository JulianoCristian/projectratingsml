 follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the high turnover of international and national advisors in\n            the project impacted on the efficient and smooth\n            implementation of the project. Based on the results assessed\n            in stage two compared to stage one, dedicated Project\n            Implementation Unit, or PIU is highly desirable in a low\n            capacity and post conflict environment. Equally the high\n            turnover of World Bank task team leaders has contributed to\n            difficulties in managing the project. Capacity building\n            initiatives should be closely followed with an effective\n            monitoring mechanism that can flag issues as they occur.\n            Integration of national PIU staff to the Corporate Services\n            should start early in the process to maximize mentoring and\n            transfer of knowledge and skills. PIU effectiveness enhanced\n            when members have clear responsibilities and are co-located\n            with relevant counterparts. During consultant selection,\n            emphasis should be placed on demonstrated teamwork,\n            communication skills, and capacity building skills in\n            adviser selection criteria, together with relevant\n            professional and technical skills. Quality at entry, a more\n            modest scope at entry to ensure quick wins may have been\n            more prudent and cost effective."}, "docdt": "2014-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
