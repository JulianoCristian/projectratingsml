                         This ISR (Sequence number 9) is a partial update of the April 2013 ISR (Sequence number 8), with a focus on results indicators and preliminary findings from a recent
                         Implementation Support mission, timed in mid October at the government's request in order to coincide with discussions on a successor donor project.

                         A new ISR (sequence number 10) will shortly be entered to incorporate full findings from that mission, in particular relating to overall implementation progress and risk rating. That will

                         be the last ISR before the project closes in January 2014.

                         Highlights since ISR number 8, to be fully captured in ISR sequence number 10 include:
                         - Continued progress across the results areas during the extension period, with noteworthy deliverables including budget preparation with much less external assistance than
                         previous years, publication of the 2000-2011 National Accounts, draft tax and customs codes, financial regulations, and treasury operations manual.
                         - The World Bank continues to be represented on the Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Finance - the MoF's regular Senior Management Meeting - now formally also
                         representing all donors.
                         - A number of initiatives have significantly strengthened MoF management, including updated Annual Action Plans with key performance indicators to implement the MoF Strategic
                         Plan and the new government 5 year plan, MoF task and staff mapping exercises, a skills gap analysis, and a formal process for identifying training needs, candidates and courses.
                         - Results reporting strengthened by linking the programme results framework to the Ministry of Finance's results framework.
                         - Quick replacement of the senior programme manger, although a lack of handover has meant the loss of some institutional memory as we prepare for project closure.
                         - Good use of the Programme Implementation Unit staff to build capacity of counterparts in the Directorate General for Corporate Services.
                         - Good coordination between the World Bank and donors to prepare the follow-on programme of support to the Ministry of Finance, although uncertainty remains around the nature
                         and timing of this, and the technical assistance requirements.
