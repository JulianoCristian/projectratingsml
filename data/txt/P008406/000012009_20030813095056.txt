   OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellence and independenceinevaluation.


About this Report
      The OperationsEvaluationDepartmentassessesthe programsand activitiesof theWorld Bankfor two
purposes: first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank'swork is
 producingthe expected results,and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough
the disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As partof this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lendingoperations.Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those that are
innovative,large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations;those for which
ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhaverequestedassessments;and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluation
studies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report(PPAR) is based on a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine projectfiles and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
OED studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers' comments are attachedto the document that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the OED Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-main page.html).
      Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectivesare consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expectedto be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance.Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency:The extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Sustainability:The resilienceto risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitableand sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition,stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictabilityof institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate,which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     BankPerformance:The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (includingensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operationof the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibilityto ensure
quality of preparationand implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of developmentobjectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Performance Assessment Report (PAR) for the Haapsalu andMatsaluBays
Environmental Project, costing US$8.4 million, that was approved inApril 1995 for an
IBRD loan o fUS$2.0 millionand confinancing with US$3.85 million from the EU,
Denmark, Finland, Sweden, World Wide Fundfor Nature and the Ramsar Convention
Bureau. The project closed inJune 2000 one year behind schedule.
        This report is based on the ImplementationCompletion Reports (ICRs) prepared
by the Europe and CentralAsia Region, the Memorandaand Recommendations o fthe
President, Staff Appraisal Reports, loan documents, project files, and discussions with
Bank staff. An Operations Evaluation Department (OED) mission visited Estonia and met
stakeholders inFinland, Sweden and Denmark inJuly 2002 to discuss the effectiveness
o f the Bank's assistance with the govemment, development and financing partners,
project implementing agencies, private sector agencies, and non-governmental
organizations. The cooperation and assistance o f central government officials,
management, staff o f the Haapsulu water utility and Matsalu State Nature Reserve, non-
governmental stakeholders and other interestedparties are gratefully acknowledged.

        This PPAR is part o f a regional assessmentthat included similar projects inLatvia
and Lithuania. It provides an assessment o f the outcome o f the Bank's assistance, in
partnership with several confinanciers, to enable Estonia to reduce pollution to the Baltic
Sea and reform a water and wastewater utility.

        Followingstandard OED procedures, this draft PAR was sent to the borrower and
cofinanciers for comments before it was finalized. N o comments were received from
them. Inaccordance with the Bank's disclosure policy, the final report will be available
to the public following submission to the World Bank's Board o f Executive Directors.

 Summary

         The HaapsaluAnd MatsaluBays EnvironmentalProjectcosting US$8.4
million was approved inApril 1995 for a loan o f US$2.0 million. Itwas cofinancedwith
US$3.85 millionbythe EU, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and World Wide Fundfor
Nature. The project closed inJune 2000 - one year behind schedule.
         The project was formulated following agreement under the 1992 Baltic Sea Joint
Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme (JCP). This identified a series o f
priority actions for the control o fpoint and non-point source pollution draining to the
Baltic Sea and measures to improve water quality management o f surface and
groundwater, and support management o f coastal lagoons and wetlands. The main
project objective was to reduce water pollution discharge to the Baltic Sea at two
pollution "hot spots." These were Haapsalu, a town o f 14,000 on Estonia's west coast,
and the watershed draining into Matsalu Bay, an environmentally important wetlands
twenty kilometers south. Sustainable pollution reduction was to be achieved through
improvement inthe quality, reliability and cost efficiency o fwater supply and wastewater
disposal and increases inwater and wastewater tariffs, thus making it financially viable.
Significant technical assistance and twinning arrangements via cofinancing partners
supported the modemization o fthe utility's management to increase operational
efficiency. Secondary objectives were to support implementation o f the Matsalu State
Nature Reserve and to improveplanning and management o f conservation programs and
eco-tourism.

         The outcome was satisfactory. Relevance was substantial giventhe agreement to
clean-up the Baltic Sea under the JCP, Estonia's drive for EUaccession, harmonization
with EUenvironmental standards and dwindlingpublic resources to subsidize inefficient
utilities. Institutional development was substantial although there are still political
barriers to establishing economic water tariffs. The project supported the government's
devolution o fwater and wastewater service provision to the HaapsaluWater Company
(HWW), an autonomous and commercially-viablejoint-stock company ownedbythe
municipality, and successfully improved HWW's operation, maintenance and financial
management. As a result, the quality o f water and service provided to consumers
increased, and the quality o ftreated wastewater effluent achieved the appraisal targets for
discharge to the Baltic Sea. Other environmental management activities supported by
other donors achieved satisfactory outcomes although those dealing with conservationof
biodiversity continue to rely on large central subsidies. It i s unclear how these subsidies
will continue when EUaccession takes place. An integrated coastal zone management
framework and plan was developed, butproblems remain because o f the strong
separation o f sectoral, local agencies and regional planning organizations, and because
reliance on extemal grant-funded experts may have lessened local ownership.

        The financial rate o f retumfor the Haapsaluwater and wastewater component
was only 4.5 percent because o fhigher than anticipated debt servicing (due to exchange
rate appreciation o f a single currency loan) and an unexpected decline inwater demand
followingpost-Soviet industrial closure and higher water charges. Despite this, the
economic rate o fretumi s likely to be higherwhen environmental benefits are included
and thus efficiency is ratedmodest. Highborrower ownership and regional stakeholder

                                               X



support fiom EUandNordic development partners ensures sustainability which i s rated
likely.

        Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory. While the Bank's performance i s also
rated satisfactory, it should be noted that total supervision costs (which included
significant use o ftrust funds) were almost twice the Bank's average.

There are three lessons from this experience:

    P Regionally-sponsored environmental initiatives inresponseto inter-governmental
        action plansprovide good opportunities for the Bank to exercise its comparative
        advantage inleveraging institutional reformthrough targetedlending. When linked
       with grant fbndingfiom bilateral development partners it provides apowerful and
        influential lobby for reform.

    P Whendesigningand implementingregional environmental initiatives andtheir
        specific projects, significant benefits can be achieved by addressing infrastructure
       investments, environmental management activities and capacity buildinginan
       integrated manner.Multiplier effects will be achieved by careful attention and
        support for development o f local institutions and their human resources.

    P Itis important to fully understand the interests andinstitutional capabilities ofthe
       various local stakeholders, specifically for community based activities, and to
       factor insufficient time and resources to build a consensus for reform and
       agreement on issues and longer-term objectives. Care should taken to avoid
       project activities beingdriven by external partners andwhich can undermines
       local ownership.

 1.         Background

 1.1        Estonia i s the most northerly and smallest o f the Baltic Countries with a population o f
 1.4 million andborders Russia on the east and Latviaon the south. Significant economic and
institutional reform followed the 1988 declaration o f sovereignty by the Estonia's Supreme
 Soviet, reform that was accelerated by restorationo f independence in 1991. At that time, the
Bank's overall strategy inEstoniawas to support the country's efforts to accelerate structural
reforms leading to a full transition to a market-based economy and support efficient
investment inhighpriority sectors. Estonia also aspired to membershipo f the European
Union, and much o f its reform agenda involved harmonization o f environmental policies and
quality with EUnorms. The project being assessedi s the sixth, and at US$2.0 million, the
smallest Bank loan to Estonia.' It i s the thirdina program o f four environmental institution-
building and clean-up for the Baltic statesez

 1.2       Haapsalu and Matsalu are two bays located on the west coast o f Estonia, and the
regional town o f Haapsalu, a former Soviet air base, has a populationo f about 12,000.
Haapsaluwas famous for its curative marine mud-spa. Inthe 19thCentury it was frequented
as a summer resort by the Tsar o fRussia andother notables such as composer Pytor Ilyich
Tchaikovsky. InSoviet-times access to the coastal area was severely restricted, Haapsalu
became a major military airbase andwas the last town inEstoniato receive basic sewage
treatment which served only 30 percent o fthe population. Matsalu Bay i s the biggest nature
reserve inEstonia and includes unique wetlands o f international importance to the East-
Atlantic flyway listed under the Ramsar Convention.

1.3        At the time the project was prepared, untreated or inadequately treated sewage had
heavily polluted the Haapsalu bay causing a ban on swimmingand contamination o f
therapeutical muds from the bay. At Matsalu, polluted drainage from agricultural and small
settlements caused eutrophication and organic enrichment resulted inthe expansion o freed
bedswhich was bringingabout damaging changes to the Bay's ec~logyPoor infrastructure                . ~
restricted access and limited tourism potential. Both areas needed to strengthen
environmental management institutions and organizations. These problems hampered
government's attempts to reintegrate this previously semi-closed region into the national
economy, reestablish tourism, harmonize environmental quality with EUnorms, and meet
commitments under the Helsinki Convention.

1.4       As a contracting partyto the Helsinki Convention, the Government agreed to
implement national programs to clean-up the Baltic Sea under the Joint Comprehensive
Environmental Action Program (JCP) launched at Ronneby, Sweden in 1990. The program was
devised to restore the Baltic Sea to a sound ecological balance, support the objectives of the

($38.4 million), and financial institutions development ($10 million) all in 1994; and health ($18 million) in 1995.
2. The other environmental projects were: Latvia-Liepaja and Lithuania-Klaipeda signed December 1994; this project April
1995 and Lithuania-Siauliai December 1995.

strategic approach was approved at the 1992 HelsinkiDiplomatic Convention. Arrangements for
implementation inthe countries o fthe Baltic Sea drainage basinwere supported by national and
local governments, the EU, six bilateral agencies, five international financial institutions (IFIs) -
including the Bank - and the World Wide Fundfor Nature and were discussed at Gdansk,
Poland in 1993. Haapsalu and MatsaluBays were two o f 12 Estonianpollution "hot spot"
identified for priority clean-up under the JCP where significant demonstration effects could be
reaped at low cost5


2.         The Project

2.1        Objectives.The overall aim o fthe project was to support Government o fEstonia's
decentralization o fresponsibility for environmental services to municipal governments,
reduce the State's role inthe economy by strengthening local authorities, and to restructure
and modernize the water and wastewater sector. The global objective was to strengthenthe
MinistryofEnvironment's capacity to coordinate andimplement environmentalprojects.
Six specific objectives were to be achieved through two main components, Table 1.

2.2      Although there were cost savings on works carried out during implementation
compared with appraisal estimates, overall costs increased because Haapsalu Water Works
carried out additional works to extend the water supply and sewerage network. As a result, at
the endo fthe project water supply coverage rose for 66 to 90 percent o f the population.

2.3      Apart from the Bank, most o f the project financing by the other seven partners was in
the form o f grants, Table 2.

3.       Implementation

3.1      The lead agency, the Ministryo f Environment (MOE), adopted a decentralized
approach to project implementation retaining only essential oversight activities including
liaison and approval o f terms o f reference. While M O E directly managed the environmental
activities, management o f the water andwastewater management improvement components
was devolved to Project ImplementationUnit established within the Haapsalu Water Works
(HWW), a 100percent municipally-owned, limitedjoint stock company responsible to the
municipalities for service standards.6However, at the start both enterprise and municipalities
were new to market-oriented operational and financial management practices as evidenced
bythe low level o fcapital and labor productivity whichwas 20-30 percent o finternational
best practice.' A twinning agreement betweenHWW and a Swedish water utility,Haninge
Gatukontoret MWW, financed by Sida was signedinOctober 1995.

3.2      The project took a year to become effective (April 1996) because o fproblems with
the Subsidiary LoanAgreement.At negotiationsit was agreedthat the Bank's loanproceeds
were to beusedonly by HWW. The Ministryo f Finance, however, later insistedthat there

govemments.InJanuary 1, 1995, the Estoniangovernmentpassedownership of all water and wastewater assets to Haapsalu
Town Govemmentandthey, in February1995, give ownership of these assets to the municipal enterpriseHaapsaluWater
Waterworks which was converted, inDecember 1996, to ajoint stock company whose shares were wholly ownedby the
municipality.

was no provision inEstonianLaw to lendto a pseudo-private sector entity and proposed that
Haapsalu Town Governmentshould receive the loan with signatory powers vested inthe
Mayor. After several refusals by the Bank, eventually it was agreed that HaapsaluTown
Government would be a loan guarantor for HWW.

3.3        Implementation was generally smooth even though there were delays which required
an extension o f closing by one year to June 2000. Initially, procurement posed problems
because o f the unfamiliarity with Bank requirements on tendering(despite training), but most
o fthese problems were resolved after the National Procurement Agency was established in
1996 and enabling laws enacted in 1997. The complex mix o fbilateral grants, tied-aid, and
untied Bank loans created substantial administrativeproblems for the six Estonian ICB
contractors who subcontracted supply o f electro-mechanical equipment to Swedish and
Finnishcontractors, an arrangement that took "4-5 months o finfighting."*Despite this, civil
works were completed on time and within budget although there were problems with sand
pumpingdueto faulty constructionbythe local contactor, andincorrect tolerances insome
locally-built plant for electro-mechanical equipment. While the twinning arrangement
delivered on technical issues, HWW felt they had little to learn from the partner on financial
or management issues because, unlikethe municipally-managed Haninge partner, they
operated on commercial principles. Despite this, early inthe project the twinningpartner
became a "technical trouble-shooter" inaddition to their training role because it took time for
HWW's staffto throw off "one-man, one-job" syndrome prevalent inSoviet-times.

3.4        Onthe environmental management component, costs marginally exceeded appraisal
estimates. The Matsalu catchment management activities that were grant-financed by
Denmark and Sweden were increased to include installation o fseven small wastewater
treatment plants and a pilot program implementedby the SwedishAgricultural University to
reduce nutrient run-off from farmsegWithin the water and wastewater component, only seven
percent o f the budget for international consultants was utilized and that for the tariff study.
The US$0.44 million saved plus savings of US$0.22 million on the construction o fthe
wastewater treatment plane and US$0.16 million on smaller equipmentwas used to further
extend the sewerage and water supply network which now connects 90 percent o f the
population.

3.5        The only real problem duringimplementation was coping with the appreciation o f the
US$ against the EstonianKroon. Instead o f staying with the DeutschMark (to which the
Koonwas pegged), consistent with the other Bank loans, the government under the guidance
o f the Ministryo f Finance decided to take the loan inUS$. At appraisal the US$1.OO was
equal to EEK 12.66, on completion this hadrisen to EEK17.00. The difficulties this caused
for loan repayment were enhancedby reduced income from lower than anticipatedwater
sales. Inconsequence, HWW renegotiated its subsidiary loan from the Ministryo f Finance
andsigned a new deal inMarch, 2002.

4.         Results

EnvironmentalQualityWas SubstantiallyImproved.

4.1        Pollutionwas Reduced.The extension and rehabilitationo f sewerage and pumping
stations, and commissioning o f the WWTP inlate 1998, enabled reduction o fpollutant
volume inthe discharged effluent to Haapsalu Bay to below target levels. Total volumetric
Biochemical Oxygen Demand(BOD) fell by more than 97 percent from 271 tons/year in
 1994 to 7.4 tondyear in 1999 and has remained around that level. Total Nitrogen (N)
released was reduced from 70 to 23 tondyear, while Phosphorus (P) discharges fell by over
90 percent to 0.9 tondyear. While no standards for concentration o f these pollutants inthe
WWTP effluent were specified at appraisal, BOD andP were betterthan HELCOM
standards, but Nconcentrations are about twice the acceptable levels.'O However, given the
much reduced volume o f effluent due to lower demandfor water and closure o fmilitary
bases and industry, this i s a fairly minor problem on a regional or national scale. Evenso, the
M o E i s concerned about meeting its HELCOM obligations and EUstandards. Inmitigation,
HWW discharges its effluent into reedbeds that provide a biological bufferto polluting the
bay.

4.2        Sludge disposal works were not included inthe project at appraisal when a strict
prioritization based on Haapsalu's priority needs and loan repayment capacity was carried
out. Fortunately, HWW came up with an innovative solution and solved the problem." As a
senior govemment official stated: "the cleaned-up bay does not smell any more because o f
the significantly less pollution; SwedishandFinnishpensioners are attracted to live in
Haapsalu and the number o ftourist i s steadily rising."12A follow-up surveyo f beneficiaries
bythe Bank in2002 found that 58 percent o frespondents thought that the WWTP had
improved environmental conditions inthe Haapsalu area (32 percent "didn't kn0w").l3

4.3       Measures supported by the project to control point and non-point pollution have
contributed to improved quality o f the River Kasari catchment andreducedpollution to
Matsalu Bay. But it i s likely that the impact o fproject-induced infrastructure improvements
is small incomparisonto the long-term effects o f reduced use o f fertilizer inagriculture and
less intensiveland use (Figure l),            and successful project-sponsored implementation o fthe
catchment area management plan.

4.4       Duringappraisal, it was anticipatedthat the focus ofsewage andwastewater
treatment at secondary point sources would be on `ecological engineering.' However, due to

10. HELCOMstandardfor BOD is 15 mg/l, project achieved 8.7 mg/l;Pstandardis 1.5 mgil, projectachieved 0.9 mgil; N
standardis 12mg/l,project achieved26 mg/l.

11. Sludge is subjectedto a two-stagetreatment.After thickeningit is compostedwith peat and sawdustfor a year from
whence it is soldas fertilizer. Thus 3,000 m3/yearof sludge produces600-700 tons of saleable fertilizer.At the time of
assessment, HWWwas unaware of any soil toxicity hazards fromprolongeduse eventhough industrialwaste is also
processedat the WWTP.

 the local preferences, only conventionalwastewater treatment plants were constructed. The
 project assisted installation o f a sewageworks inLihula, one o f the two small towns inthe
 catchment. and provided wastewater treatment works to six o f the 10 smaller settlements - o f
 these five were operational at the time o f OED's evaluation and the sixth at Kirbla was out o f
 commission because o f a leaking sewerage system. There i s concern inM O E that the small
 WWTP needbetter managementthan they are currently receiving - and a solution proposed
 is to place all small facilities under HWW's control. Currently, O&M requires a 50 percent
 subsidy from the center, and the Centre for Ecological Engineering at Tartu University
 estimates that O&M costs (particularly electricity for pumping) could be significantly
reduced ifion filters were usedto scrub out P andN.

renovated headquarters buildingand nature museum at Penijde Manor, and receives
considerable grant support from local andinternational environmental agencies and
govemment agricultural subsidies because o f its status-it was the only Ramsar site inthe

projects - for example the World Wide Fundfor Nature -Finland supports monitoring o f
white-fronted geese. Meeting management plan objectives to build support for conservation
 activities within the community, MSNRhas involved four municipalities and more than 10
village societies and local schools inactivities such as open days, cleaning andmaintaining
 cut-back around holiday homes. An environmental newspaper i s produced as are multi-
 lingual guidebooks and maps. Project funds enabled construction of eight nature and wildlife
 observation towers throughout the reserve, and a change inthe Tourism Law (2001) put
tourism firmly on the agenda. Inconsequence, the number o f visitors - a third o f them
 foreign - rose from 4,600 in 1999 to over 6,000 in2001 and this significantly benefited the
 local economy though bed-and-breakfast accommodation.

4.7         HighBiodiversityEcosystems Are BeingMaintained.Traditionally, grazing and
mowing, intensifiedinSoviet-times for dairy production, had maintained a unique semi-
natural system o fmeadows, coastal wooded meadows and wetlandmeadows. With the
substantial post-independence decline in agriculture, lessening o f these controls on the
landscape ledto encroachment o f scrub andbush, loss o f meadowland and a decline in
habitats for threatened species. The project provided tractors and mowing equipmentwhich
supplemented subsidies for livestock and mowing. Together, these measures increased
                                                                      l6
mowedwetland meadows from zero in 1995 to 2,500 ha in2002 while grazed coastal
meadows accounted for another 1,135 ha. About 100ha o f cleared woodland meadows are
underdemonstration. Several initiatives to reintroduce sheep and cattle on a large-scale have
met with mixed success because o f their highcost, restricted local markets for produce, and
an uncertain future. Shortcomings identifiedby Estonianstakeholders are that the speed to
implement the management plan and active intervention by foreign NGOs displaced local
capacitybuildingand some ownership - and the reliance on subsidiesto maintain the
meadows may not be sustainable inthe longer-term.

crafts and livestock. Three small societies formed and a handicraft for locally-produced wool i s active in Lihula despite
initial set-backs from predation by wolves and there are 10 sheep farms. Potentialbeef farmers undertook a Swedish study
tour in 1997 and ten o f them formed a society "keepers o f semi-natural areas" based on sound ecological principles and
mixed herd o f Abedeen Angus, Herefords and Highland cattle are being established, the high-class breedstock being the
property o f the MSNR.EU(Life) has indicatedthat it is prepared to enter into 5-year contacts for a further 50 cattle. Some
Estonian farmers privately import Limousin stock to graze the coastal marshes. While grazing helps to maintain the
meadows, the small scale o f the present effort requires central subsidies o f the order EEK 10 million (USrS0.55 million) a
year. Current subsidies are EEK 650ha for floodplain meadows, EEK 1,000iha for coastal and EEK 2,000ha for wooded
meadows.

achieve cost savings ina number o f components (Annex Bl). Savings were usedto extend
service coverage andmodernize pumpingplant which ledto higher efficiencies. Overall
pumpingcosts increased, however, becauseo fthe demands o fthe oversized WWTP andthe
extended supply and sewerage system eventhough water sales declined (Annex B2). Billing
and collection rates are highbut other financial indicators are not wholly satisfactory, Table

actual demandfell from 170 l/din
1994 to 80 l/d in2001, and despite an
increased customer base, overall
water and WWT sales fell by more
than 40 percent. This was because o f
a substantial decline inindustrial
demand following independence, and
a reduction indomestic demand as
householders' replaced defective
sanitary ware and repaired leaks in
response to higher water costs. The
proportion o fnon-revenue water was                              Source: Kari Homanen (2002)

reduced from 26 percent in 1999 to
20 percent in2000. Staffing levels are near international norms for the number o f household
connections. Despite substantial real increases inthe water tariff (which exceed S A R
expectations but i s less than that for Tallinn) this has beenoffset by increased debt servicing.

                                                      9


 As a result, the tariff would needto increase to EEK 38.53 (US$2.11) per cubic meter to
 break-even. The Municipality o f Haapsalu has been unwillingto agree further tariff increases
 since 1999 because o fpolitical considerations even though an increase (given the reduced per
 capita consumption) is affordable according to generally accepted criteria (Figure                 ,).I7
Underlyingthe tariff issue i s that there is not an independentnational-level regulatory regime
to oversee private service-providers. The present system allows municipal gatekeepers who
have conflicts o f interest - the current Competition Law i s flawed inthat respect and needs
reform.

5.1       The OED rating systemi s explained at the front o fthis report.


Outcome

5.2       The outcome is rated satisfactory as it achieved most of its relevant objectives with
minor shortcomings. The overall ratings are based on the relative importance o fthe
objectives, the basic principle beingthat untilpollution i s preventedina sustainable manner
-throughfinanciallyviablewastewatertreatment-noneofthemoreglobalobjectivesis
achievable. A key factor i s that account has been taken o fpositive impacts on pollution
reduction to the Baltic Sea. These ratings o f objectives are elaborated inthe following
sections and summarized inTable 4.

Relevance

5.3       Overall relevance is substantial. The Bank had identified Haapsalu and Matsalu
Bays as a site for a potential environmental management project duringthe course o f field
based studies conducted by staff and consultants during 1991- 1993 inthe context o f the
studies for the Baltic Sea Program and the environmental section o fthe Country Economic
Memorandum. This area was viewed as a priorityby the Government for environmental
investments to support its reintegration after prolonged restricted access; to protect the waters
o fthe Baltic Sea; restore recreational, health and nature based tourism; and support nature
conservation.

5.4      The project was highly relevant to the concems o f the Baltic Sea littoral states as it
was designedto assist Estonia to implement the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive
Environmental Action Program (JCP, para 1.4). Inthe first phase o f the JCP (1993-97),
Haapsalu was one o f ten pollution "hot-spots" identified inEstonia- although interms o f
overall pollution it was at the bottom o f the list.

5.5      The project was substantiallyrelevant to the recommendationson environmental
investmentinthe Bank's 1994Public ExpenditureReview which gave first priority to cost-

 5.6       The project was also relevant to the Bank's 1994CountryAssistance Strategy whose
 primary objectives were to foster economic growth to alleviate the sharp decline inaverage
 incomes, and assist with design and implementation o fpolicies, programs and projects that
 would improve the living standards o f those left behind inthe transition process. By fostering
 commercialization o fwater andwastewater services, the project was highlyrelevant to
 implementation o f government's policy to decentralize management o f state enterprises and
 wean local government o f f central subsidies.Inthe current situation, the project remains
 substantially relevant. While preventative and regulatory actions account for 72 percent o f
 the Estonia's National Environmental Action Plan 2001-2003, over 65 percent o f NEAP
 resources are directed towards clean-up actions to accord with EUaccession requirements o f
 which wastewater treatment systems are a significant element.lg

 projects designed to protect and improve biodiversity, unless such projects can be funded from highly concessional loans o f
 grants designed specifically for such projects"
 19. It should be noted that the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project was the second o f three projects the Bank
 supported to address urban and rural environmental issues inEstonia. The District Heating Rehabilitation Project (1994),
 which was the top priority concern inthe energy sector, contributed to improved urban air quality during the longheating
 season, reduced water losses and supported the environmentally responsible use o f biomass for fuel. The Agriculture Project
 (1996) supported improved drainage practices, wetlands management and preparation o f a national wetlands inventory.

Efficacy.

5.7       Efficacy is rated as substantial. Highgovernment and regional stakeholder
ownership ensuredthat actions to achieve pollution reduction objectives were successfully
implemented for both components o fthe project. HWW i s moving towards financial
sustainability which demonstrates substantial institutional development and strengthening
The more global objectives to restore the Baltic Sea and enhance Estonia's surface and
groundwater quality and bringabout integrated coastal zone management to improve the
environment were too ambitious and unrealistic inthe project's time frame. Given the
relatively small level o f investment, physical and institutional focus o f the projects on the
utilities, and the fact that most water pollution derives from non-point sources, these are
objectives that are likely to take decades to achieve because o f the large number o fnational
and international stakeholders involved.


Efficiency

5.8       Project efficiency is rated as substantial. Although the ICR estimated the financial
rate o freturn (FRR) for HWW to be only 4.5 percent, there were significant environmental
andhumanbenefits resultingfrom reduced pollution plus added biodiversity andtourism
benefits inthe Matsalu Bay area. Attempts to capture the total economic value o f
environmental services -using contingent valuation methods -have been applied to the
Baltic Sea inSweden, Poland and Lithuania to estimate the perceived value o f reduced
eutrophication'20'21'   22The results from Sweden indicate that individuals were willing to pay
about 0.5 percent o fnet income eventhough, unlike Haapsalu, water quality did not impose
limitations on swimmingand recreation. On the basis o f only Haapsalu's population, the ICR
estimated the economic rate of retumto increase to 7.8 percent. Given that tourism has
substantially increased since the late 1990sand Nordic pensioners use the Haapsalu-Matsalu
areas for bothmedium and short stay healthtreatments and for summer retreats, the affected
population i s considerably larger and richer than average, thus probably nudgingthe ERR
upwards towards 10percent. Inaddition, it i s highlyprobable that the willingnessto pay in
Estoniawas significantly larger than inSweden because improvements were more dramatic
(e.g. cancellation o f swimmingbans, reduction o f smell, increased use o f health treatment
facilities and tourism). Therefore this evaluation supports the argument inthe ICR that the
ERR couldbe larger than 12percent.

5.9       The project's success suffered from the impact o fthe unrealistic demand projections
that were utilized inthe design. This was a common problem inthe ECA transition
economies at that time andwas extensively discussed duringproject preparation and
appraisal. However, the utility's and the governments unwillingnessto utilize decreasing

water demand forecast ledto an oversized WWTP facility and overoptimistic projections o f
revenuefrom sales o fwater and sewage services, as anticipated by the Bank. During
appraisal, the compromise that was reached was a constant water demand forecast scenario.
Inconsequence, the lower cash flows were unable to generate acceptable FRR, asituation
made more difficult by the exchange o fthe loanrepayment because o f exchange rate
escalation. However, an oversized WWT facility i s not a fatal flaw giventhe large influx o f
summer visitors which more than doubles the population, and insome countries, for example
inthe Seychelles, tourist hoteldfacilities payhigher water tariffs.23


Institutiona1Development

5.10      The overall institutionaldevelopmentimpactis ratedas substantial. There was a
highlevel o fdevelopment as evidenced by successful reorganization, computerization,
information systems, skills upgrading and strategic planning - greatly enhance by technical
assistance from Nordic utilities under the twinning arrangement and donors' support for
environmental management. The process to establish realistic tariffs i s a notable achievement
and needs further refinementto enable the utilities to become financially sustainable.
Offsetting this, HWW appear unwilling to expand their area o fmanagement to include other
small towns and villages inNorth Western Estonia thus bringing improved management and
economies o f scale inoperations. The regulatory environment needs improvement,
particularly for utilitytariff setting. Control andmanagement o f air and water pollution will
have to move from the current emissions-based approach to an overall environmental impact
framework inline with EUDirectives.

5.11      The unwillingness to go aheadwith piloting ecologically-basedWWTP inthe River
Kasari catchment was the only real institutional failing o f the project, particularly as the
traditional chemical and concrete WWTPs installed are proving difficult and expensive to
maintain. There i s a growing body o f evidence that ecological approaches to WWT in
Estonia are feasible and economic.24

5.12      The Matsalumanagement plan initiated a capacity buildingprocess concerning cost
effective and relevant nature protection and management inEstoniawhich has been as base
for adoption o fthe EUnature protection scheme (NATURA 2000).25

5.13      The mix of instruments offered to manage pollutionand the environment needreview
as they may offer the wrong incentives. Specifically, the willingness o f the Nordic agencies
to use grants to achieve HELCOM objectives, and government's willingness to give grant
support to fill the gap created by inadequate tariffs, may undermine the resolve to reform and
local institutional development. Evenso, there is adequate evidence that Estonia i s
successfully managing many o f its pollution problems - without outside direction - by the

25. WWF Sweden have commented that the three different project components (Haapsalu WWTP, agricultural runoff
management and Matsalu nature reserve management) appeared not to be coordinated and recommended a national steering
group to do so (see Annex C).

marked progress towards meetingJCP hotspot targets. Good examples include installation of
a new WWTP at Paide incentral Estonia and the substantial reduction o fwater and air
pollution from the Kehra Pulp and Paper Plant located innortheast Estonia.26

Sustainability

5.14      Sustainability is rated likely. Government, municipal and utility ownership i s high,
and continued grant support from Nordic development partners and central government to
meet HELCOM and EUaccession targets is highly likely. The WWTP technology at
Haapsalu carries few risks and the capacity i s large enough to cover any foreseeable increase
indemand for treatment capacity. Apart from the medium-term loanrepaymentproblem
(which may be solved by either a central government grant or increases to the water tariff)
HWW is soundly and effectively administered. IfHWW responds to government pressure
and extends its operational area to cover the eastem region, the economies o f scale would
increase its profitability.

Bank Performance

5.15      Bank performance is rated satisfactory. Prior to the Bank's engagement, Nordic
development partners and EBRD were working with M O E and the Municipality o fHaapsalu
on measures to provide new infrastructure and technical assistance to enable Haapsalutown
to meet HELCOM environmental standards. In 1993 EBRD's potential support for
Haapsalu's WWTP fell though, and this provided an opportunity for the Bank to step inas
coordinator and link Baltic Sea clean-up efforts inEstoniato similar Bank-funded projects in
Latvia and Lithuania. The Bank's rationale was that its convening power and knowledge on
environmental clean-up, utility management and institution-building would catalyze reform.
The history o fthe project supports this premise.

5.16      Some informants interviewed by OED stated that the Bank may have chosen the
"easy options" at Haapsalu and Maatsalu compared with the much greater severity pollution
problems o f the northeast and other regions. The evidence does not support this assertion as
the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project was the second project the Bank
supported to address urban andrural pollution issues inEstonia. The District Heating
Rehabilitation Project (1994) was the top priority concem inthe energy sector and
contributed to improved urbanair quality duringthe long heating season, reducedwater
losses and supported the environmentally responsible use o fbiomass for fuel.

5.17     Inaddition, apotentialBank-supported environmentproject to address environmental
management issues inthe oil shale based miningandpower industries inNortheast Estonia
was the subject o f studies supported by Finland, Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) andUNDP
over the period 1991-94. This proposal was followed up by several field missions, including
ajoint Bank-NIB mission in 1995, to examine various aspects o f the technical feasibility and
costs for this project. These activities ended when the Government o f Estonia, consistent

with its overall policy o fpromotingprivatesector investment, entered into negotiations with
NRG(a utilitybased inthe United States) to privatize these facilities. Whenthese talks ended
unsuccessfullyin2002 the northeast situationwas little improved. However, there i s now
 interest by the NIBand KfW o f Germany to make possible investments inmodernization o f

 5.18      All major stakeholders -government, MOE, municipalities, utilities andtheNordic
donors - independently told the assessment team that the Bank was very effective increating
(and sustaining through supervision) a framework which enabled financially-viable
environmental clean-up and management, and that it demonstrated the effectiveness o fmulti-
sectoral programs even when all environmental management activities were independently
supported by government and other development partners. This would not have beenpossible
without Nordic partners' grant-funding o f the twinning arrangements and reciprocal visits
within the region, all o fwhich enhancedEstonia's technicalknowledge and capacity, butwas
less effective at accelerating managerial improvements(para 3.3).

5.19       But some aspectso fthe externalpartners' involvement were criticized. Government
officials felt that dependence on their advisors displaced local skills and knowledge thus
lowering local ownership: "it would have beenbetter to slow down andbuild local capacity
than import consultants to direct us." The Bank's involvement inHaapsalu and Maatsalu i s
perceivedmore an effort to get its foot quickly inthe door and catch-up with EBRD and
expand its Baltic Sea program than develop a coherent approach to all Estonia. As a result,
the Bank's impact is perceivedas localized, confinedto hardware solutions andneglectfblo f
sector-wide institutional development that requiredmore time and patience.28

5.20      Highsupervision cost ofthe Haapsalu and Maatsaluproject mayhave squeezedout
other environmentally-focused activities. Incomparison to the size of loan o f $2.0 million,
Bank costs were $0.78 million. Annual supervision cost was quite highfor a relatively simple
localizedproject - $115,000 a year.29It should be noted that the Bank's supervision budget
was below average which requiredthat significant consultant trust funds were added to
provide implementationsupport. Thus the total cost o f the Bank's supervision services was
significantly higher than the Bank average.

6.         Findings and Lessons

Findings

6.1        Estonia i s well on the way to achieving regionally agreed water quality emission
standards to the Baltic Sea. While the upgraded wastewater treatment facilities provided had
a significant impact on reaching these targets locally, reduced economic and industrial
activity and the constraining effect o f increased water tariffs on demandalso made a major
contribution. Regional planning on the principles of integrated coastal zone management was
initiated but was frustrated by the present administrative set-up that rigidly separates sectors,
services and planning.There is a need to move from an emission-control regime to one that
considers the effects o fpollution within an environmental impact assessment framework;
only thus can clean-up and control priorities be objectively prioritized. It i s possible that had
such a framework been inplace, Haapsalu may not have been a priority for Bank intervention
(para 5.14). Indeed, government's parallel successesincleaning up municipal wastewater
pollution and commercializing water utilities with support from EBRD andNordic donors
indicates that the Bank was not really needed after the first 2-3 years.

pollutants to the Baltic, and rained-out aerosols from industry and power stations account for
a considerable share o fpollution. Within the Baltic Sea, the minimalrate o f exchange to the
Atlantic Ocean favors trapping and stocking o fnutrients and hazardous chemicals. It i s
expected, however, that regional efforts should reduce the effects o fmore readily controlled
biochemical oxygen demand and thus the extent o f toxic algal blooms. There i s a well-
developed regulatory structure and use o f economic instrumentsto control pollution in
Estonia and other FSUstates but the charges are not yet highenough to be effective -a task
made less palatable by the precarious state o f industry and the need for the employment it
sustains.

6.3      The regulatory environment for water tariffs needs reform to remove municipal gate-
keepers who have a political interest inkeepingtariffs low. The current regulatory set-up
would benefit from review. Government should ensure a mechanism for settingpredictable
and transparent subsidies to meet social objectives and disburse them independently o f the
utilities' financial accounting.

Lessons

There are three lessons from this experience:

     9 Regionally-sponsoredenvironmentalinitiativesinresponseto inter-governmental
         actionplans provide good opportunities for the Bank to exercise its comparative
        advantage inleveraging institutionalreform through targeted lending.When linked
        withgrant fundingfrombilateraldevelopment partnersitprovides apowerful and
        influential lobby for reform.

     9 Whendesigningandimplementingregionalenvironmentalinitiatives andtheir
        specific projects, significant benefits can be achieved by addressing infrastructure
        investments, environmental management activities and capacity buildinginan
        integrated manner. Multiplier effects will be achieved by careful attention and support
        for development o f local institutions and their humanresources.

     9 Itis importantto fullyunderstandthe interestsandinstitutional capabilitiesofthe
        various local stakeholders, specifically for community based activities, andto factor
        insufficient time andresources to buildaconsensus for reform and agreement on
        issues and longer-term objectives. Care should taken to avoid project activities being
        drivenby externalpartners andwhich can undermineslocal ownership.

WWF Sweden supervised the Matsalumanagement planwhich thenwas usedas a base for
the Matsalu IntegratedCoastal Management planunderthe auspices o fHELCOM.
The implementation o f the plan has gained support from WWF Sweden and Sida,under the
Vainameri project.


Page20-5.10
The Matsalu management plan initiated a capacity buildingprocess concerning cost effective
and relevant nature protection andmanagement inEstoniawhich has been as base for
adoption o f the EUnature protection scheme (NATURA 2000).
Inmanyprojectsthe differentenvironmental "sectors"(the technical brownhlueandthe
more soft green) are separated due to the fact that institutional arrangements. This causes in
many cases problems or ,at least, weakens the total project impact outcome.
The project portfolio contained 3 different packages-the HaapsaluWWTP, agricultural run
off andrelevant protection measures and managemento f the Matsalunature reserve.
The efficiency o f the this project would have been strengthened ifthese hadbeenbetter co
ordinated inEstonia via a national steering group. This had effected the legal and
administrative systems more effectively as well as made the effects o f outreach activities
stronger.
