Lessons\n            emphasize that the cooperative planning, and implementation\n            of the project - based on mutual trust between the Bank, and\n            Borrower - allowed the transfer of new ideas, and approaches\n            to project planning, and management, as well as for\n            supporting infrastructure investments. This was conducive to\n            a shift from a \"reactive\", to a\n            \"proactive\" approach, in the development of the\n            strategic plan for the Haapsalu Veevark, and the management\n            plan for the Matsalu State nature reserve. Additionally, the\n            integration of targeted infrastructure investments (focused\n            primarily on water, and wastewater services improvement in\n            urban areas), but with broader environmental goals,\n            successfully achieved the selected environmental management\n            activities in adjacent coastal areas, which allowed\n            collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewaters to be\n            linked with an improved coastal management, and,\n            strengthened as well, the management of protected areas. The\n            suitability of the participatory approach during the initial\n            project implementation, supported by the environmental\n            management component, not only increased ownership among\n            local communities, and stakeholders in the management of\n            protected areas, but the skills gained through these\n            participatory activities, can be widely applied in\n            environmental development measures. Finally, the project\n            demonstrated the beneficial aspects of adjusting project\n            objectives, to comply with international environmental\n            agreements, namely the Helsinki Convention on Protection of\n            Baltic Marine Environment, the Ramsar Convention, and,\n            further enhanced the accession process to the European Union."}, "docdt": "2001-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
