This\n            will include assistance for tariff restructuring/tariff\n            planning and financial operations. The EMC will consist of:\n            a) technical and financial support through the Ministry of\n            Environment (MOE) for the implementation of selected\n            elements of the Management Plan for Matsalu State Nature\n            Reserve by coordinating and providing funding for identified\n            investments such as access roads, observation towers, and\n            information boards; b) design and implementation of a\n            program of cost-effective activities to reduce point and\n            non-point source pollution of Matsalu Bay from small\n            settlements and agriculture; and c) support for planning and\n            management of eco-tourism."}, "docdt": "1995-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
