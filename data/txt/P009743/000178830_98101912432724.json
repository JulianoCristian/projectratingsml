implement a five-year time slice of on-going\n            irrigation development programs implemented by existing\n            institutions. The project would: increase quantity,\n            reliability and equitable distribution of irrigation water\n            through modernization of major and minor irrigation systems\n            and undertake studies and introduce pilot demonstration\n            schemes for on-farm works. In addition, it would provide\n            funds to GOI for the preparation of irrigation projects\n            throughout India. The project is designed to increase food\n            production and the standard of living of the farmers in Punjab."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
