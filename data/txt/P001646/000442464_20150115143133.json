To address these shortcomings, the World Bank\n            together with other donors in 1991 launched a Second Health,\n            Population, and Rural Water Project. By 1998, nearly 300 new\n            community health centers had been built, one-third of which\n            were directly financed by the project. The percentage of the\n            population living within 15 kilometers of a health facility\n            more than doubled from 17 percent in 1995 to 39 percent in\n            1998. The community clinics have been largely successful in\n            improving service coverage and client satisfaction. In\n            addition, community management committees were established\n            for some government clinics, although staffs continue to be\n            employed by the government."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
