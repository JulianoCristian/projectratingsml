     Re:  Credit No. 2220-MAI (Population, Health and Nutrition
          Sector Credit) Amendment
Dear Honorable Chimango:
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated May 31,
1991 between the Republic of Malawi (the Borrower) and the
International Development Association (the Association) for the
above-referenced Project.
     Representatives of the Borrower's Ministry of community
Services have bought to the attention of the Association's
representatives that in order to facilitate the implementation of
the women-in-development component under Par A of the Project, it
would be appropriate to provide for the establishment of a second
Special Account exclusively for this component.  We, therefore,
propose that the Development Credit Agreement be amended as follows:
1.   Section 1.02 (g) is amended to read:
     "Special Account" means any of the Accounts referred to in
     Section 2.02 (b) and (c) of this Agreement.
2.   Section 2.02 (b) is amended to read:
     The Borrower shall, for the purposes of Parts A.1, A.2, A.3
     A.5, B, C and D of the Project open and maintain a special
     deposit account (hereinafter referred to as Special Account
     "A") in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory
     to the Association, including appropriate protection against
     set-off, seizure or attachment.  Deposits into, and payments
     out of, the Special Account shall be made in accordance with
     the provisions of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.
3.   A new Section 2.02 (c) is added to read:
     "The Borrower shall for the purposes of Part A.4 of the
     Project open and maintain in dollars a special deposit account
     (hereinafter referred to as "Special Account B") in a
     commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
     Association, including appropriate protection against set-off,
     seizure or attachment.  Deposits into and payments out of the
     Special Account shall be made in accordance with the
     provisions of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.
4.   Section 2.02 (c) is renumbered as Section 2.02 (d).
5.   Category 5 of the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the
Development Credit Agreement is amended to read:
