From a project\n            implementation viewpoint, the project succeeded in\n            implementing almost all the programmed activities, notably\n            the completion of an ambitious civil works program and\n            expansion in the supply of community health workers.\n            However, inappropriate project design and lack of supportive\n            policy environment led to a situation where satisfactory\n            implementation of activities did not lead to desired\n            outcomes. Thus, access to quality and effective health care\n            remains generally difficult due to continuing shortage in\n            key inputs such as drugs, other medical supplies, and\n            trained health professionals. As a result, the\n            project's long-term development objectives remained\n            largely unmet by project's end. The Bank appraisal team\n            apparently did not recognize the inappropriateness of a\n            multi-focal, multi-component, multi-implementor project\n            design for a country with limited management capacity. The\n            flawed project design haunted the project throughout its\n            life. Very few staff in the implementing agencies were\n            trained to have a noticeable effect on the capacity of these\n            agencies over the long term."}, "docdt": "2001-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
