Among\n            the lessons drawn from the project, it is suggested that,\n            sometimes, a crisis situation can generate success, as was\n            the development of the water user associations (WUAs), which\n            as a result of collapsing cooperatives, and state farms into\n            unorganized private farms, produced a consensus among\n            policymakers, and farmers to initiate participatory\n            irrigation management, further enabling strong community\n            participation. The uniqueness of the WUAs in Albania, lies\n            in their private voluntary approach, de facto, a community\n            ownership of irrigation, isolated from political pressures,\n            which provides incentives for increased administrative\n            transparency, with promising results. Although the project\n            provided technical assistance for irrigation practices, it\n            was made clear that WUAs should finance major equipment,\n            professional, and maintenance services, which strengthened\n            the communes' governance. The government's\n            commitment for a supportive legal framework, enabled the\n            development of WUAs, which might have otherwise been\n            hampered by political pressures, and interference from water enterprises."}, "docdt": "2000-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
