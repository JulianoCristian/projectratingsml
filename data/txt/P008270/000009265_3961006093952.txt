MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ALBANIA
FOR AN IRRIGATION REHIABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Albania for SDR7.1 million (US$10.0 million equivalent), on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity, to assist in the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems in
seven coastal districts, to assist in the development of the institutions responsible for operating the
systems, to assist in sectoral policy reforms, and to support project implementation.
2.    Background. Albania is predominantly an agricultural country. The sector's contribution
to GDP was close to 35 percent during the 1980s and reached about 50 percent in 1993 due to the
sharp decline in industrial output. Some 50 percent of the labor force are employed in agriculture
and forestry, two-thirds of the population live in rural areas. Albania is mountainous, and only about
25 percent of its 29,000 km2 are arable. Water resources are abundant. Of the 702,000 ha of arable
land, about 417,000 ha are equipped with irrigation and drainage facilities. There are 639 pumping
stations and 653 reservoirs with a storage capacity of 558 million i3. This water, together with 450
m3 diverted from rivers and lakes, constitutes the present volume of 1.0 billion m3 available for
irrigation from surface water. Irrigation is of great importance for agriculture in the fertile lowlands
because rainfall is limited between spring and autumn. Drainage is required in the winter months
to evacuate excess water during the rainy season. There are major opportunities for increasing the
productivity of the small private farms that have emerged from the recent land reform in Albania.
3.    Prior to the 1991 democratic revolution, irrigation and drainage schemes were constructed
with the objective of maximizing agricultural output; cost recovery and economic sustainability were
no consideration. In view of their high cost of operation and maintenance, many of the mountain
irrigation schemes, involving high pumping for small irrigated remote areas, appear not sustainable.
On the other hand, systems in the fertile and high-potential coastal plains are economically attractive
candidates for immediate rehabilitatiown. Social upheavals and the rapid dissolution of the cooperative
sector since 1991 resulted in substantial damages to the infrastructure. At the same time, regular
maintenance of already depreriated systems came to a virtual halt due to lack of funding. In
addition, the process of dismantling cooperatives, liquidating state farms and pnvatizing all arable
land created the major challenge of contracting water delivery with a multitude of small farmers, a
task for which the existing institutions are not prepared. As a result, only some 80,000 ha were
actually irrigated in 1993 (130,000 ha in 1992), accounting for a mere 19 percent of the irrigation
command area (31 percent in 1992), o0 11 percent of arable land (18 percent in 1992). This is a
dramatic development in light of the urgent need for a rise in farm productivity in order to ensure
the viability of the new smallholder agriculture in the country.
4.    The Land, Water and Rural Development Department (LWRD) within the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food ,MoAF) supervises the irrigation sub-sector, including 36 district-based Water
Enterprises (WEs). In the past, WEs were merely responsible for water delivery to Agricultural
Cooperatves and State Farms which maintained and operated most secondary and all tertiary and
quaternary canals in their respective area. WEs had a limited role of operating and maintaining
primary and some secondary canals only, including irrigation and drainage pumping stations and
reservoirs. Today, WEs face the major challenge of (a) delivering water to some 400,000 small



- 2 -
private farmers and collecting water charges from them, and (b) taking over operation and
maintenance of secondary and selected terdary canals in the country.
5.    Sector Strategy. The Government's overall objectives in the agriculture sector include:
sustained growth through improvements in yields and productivity; conversion from subsistence
agriculture towards marketing of surplus on domestic and export markets; reduction of rural poverty
and prevention of rural-urban migration through creation of productive employment opportunities in
rural areas; and food security. The Government is fully aware that irrigated and drained agriculture
will be a cornerstone to achieve these goals since some 80 percent of agricultural production value
stems from areas under irrigation. Therefore, the Government aims at restoring irrigation system
delivery capacities quickly; ensuring efficiency and sustainability of past and future irrigation and
drainage investments; promoting the involvement of private farmers in modernizing and maintaiing
on-farm structires; and, eventually, expanding irrigation to non-covered high-potential areas. To
achieve these objectives, Government has developed a comprehensive sectoral strategy framework
for irrigation and drainage. Required actions to implement this strategy would be supported by
various bilateral and multilateral donors, with IDA taling a leading role in coordinatng this external
assistance provided to the sector.
6.    Bank/IDA Imgation and Drainage Sector Experience. The proposed credit would be the
Association's first full-scale operation in the sector in Albania. There is significant relevant
Bank/IDA experience from some 200 irrigation and drainage projects which has recently been
reported by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department.' Overall operational performance has
been above agricultural projects but has in general been poorer than anticipated at project appraisal.
Critical factors for project success inchlde: quality and adequacy of system design; quality of
construction works; achieved levels of cost recovery; quality of operation and maintenance; and
unexpected shifts in output prices and macroeconomic distortions. Borrowers often disengage too
early from projects, leaving irrigaton and drainage systems incomplete and land development
unfinished. Other issues leading to poor performance are related to: lack of complementary services,
such as extension and marketing; unde estimated costs due to lack of sufficiently advanced
engineering design at appraisal; cost overruns due to delays in completing designs and tender
documents; slower-than-estimated civil works construction and equipment delivery times; and lower-
than-estimated water use efficiencies due to deterioration of the infrastructure. Furthermore, the
record of cost recovery in Bank-financed irrigation projects has been unsatisfactory. In most cases,
no capital costs were recovered and in two-thirds of reviewed projects the covenant requiring that
cost recovery fully satisfy funding for system operation and maintenance had not been met,2 with the
proportion of respective costs recovered generally reaching only a range of 15 to 45 percent.
Inadequate operation and maintnance is generally attributed to such poor cost recovery. However,
the 1993 OED Review suggests that improved cost recovery will only result in better system
performance if revenues from water charges are clearly earmarked for operation and maintenance
and if service-providing irrigation agencies are directly accountable to water users. Furthermore,
entities collecting water fees must be able to use them directly to oversee operation and maintenance.
/  1993 OED Review of World Bank Irrigation Experience, Operations Evaluation Departnent, 1993.
2/  The tbree main reasons for non-compliance have been: unreliable water supply due to poor operadon and ma_eane;
the often heavy burden of direct and indirect taxes already imposed by goverments on the trming sector; and lack of
government commitment to recover costs. See World Bank Lending Conditnality: A Review of Cost Recovery in
Irrigation Projects, OED, OPS No. 6283, 1986



-3 -
The latter often implies financial decentralization of irrigation agencies from the central government
budget, and partial or total transfer of responsibility for fee collection and system operation and
maintenance to water user groups at the farmer level. These experiences have been taken into
explicit consideration in the design of the proposed Project.
7.    IDA Experience in Albania. Limited experience in Albania's irrigation sector stems from
IDA's first operation in Albania, the Critical Imports Project (FY92, total cost US$55 million) which
includes an Irrigation Component of US$6.8 million financing equipment, spare parts and materials
for selected repairs of the infrastructure, and providing consultant services to set up Water User
Associations (WUAs) on a pilot basis and to draft a Water Code and regulations for WUAs. An area
of 18,455 ha has benefitted from rehabilitation works by end-1993, a further 43,000 ha is planned
to be affected by rehabilitation works in 1994. One key lesson learned from this operation is the
importance to ensure that sufficient budgetary provisions are available for WEs to cover the cost of
locally procured items such as cement for construction works and fuel for vehicle operation.
Experience from estabiishing the first WUAs in the coastal districts of the country shows that farmers
are keen to join into water user groups if this guarantees more reliable we r 'supply by WEs and
better maintenance of systems below the secondary level. Local agronomists ..the extension service
network under MoAF maintain a good contact with private farmers and appear to be well suited to
promote WUAs. WEs are equally interested in the creation of WUAs in order to wholesale
irrigation water to them and to collect water fees from them, rather than having to deal with
imdividual farmers. Villages are the only widely accepted basis for WUAs, and farmers see an
opportunity to develop WUAs in parallel with recently emerging, largely village-based Private
Farmers Associations which are aiming at common supply of inputs and joint marketing of produce.
8.    Project Objec-;ves.  The Project's main objectives would be to increase agricultural
production by raising tarm productivity through rapid rehabilitation of the existing irrigation and
drainage infrastructure; to alleviate poverty by increasing income of small private farmers and
creating employment opportunities for dependent farm labor in nrual areas; and to ensure the long-
term sustauability of irrgation and drainage investments through farmer participation in operation
and maintenance, efficient system management and adequate cost recovery.
9.    Project Description. The technical, organizational and policy challenges towards adapting
the irrigation sector to the new structure of smailholder agriculture are substantial. At the same time,
available budgetary resources are scarce and the capacity to implement required institutional changes
is limited. To maximize economic benefits, dhis first project in Albania's irrigation sector would,
therefore, concentrate on the rehabilitation of the existing irrigation and drainage infrastructure to
restore as-designed capacities quicldy. Improvements in the conveyance system would be undertaken
only in selected cases where the net benefit of expanding delivery capacities is very high. An
extensive modernization of systems aiming at correcting insufficient water supply and improving flow
control would be left to a further stage of development when economically justified by an increase
in cropping intensities, by a clear shift towards cash crops, and after the establishment and
functioning of WUAs. In addition to infrastructure investments, the Project would support institution
building and key policy reforms through investments, technical assistance and training.
10.   Project Area. Since it is the objective of Government to maximize the Project's impact on
agricultural production and farm income, rehabilitation works would be carried out exclusively in
areas with high agro-potential located in the fertle coastal plains. A second criterion for selecting



- 4 -
project areas are demonstrated good prospects for farmer participation in establishing WUAs. The
experience under the Irrigation Component of the Critical Imports Project provides evidence of
strong interest in setting up WUAs among farmers located along the coastal districts where financial
returns from irrigation are high. Based on theses criteria, selected irrigation and drainage systems
in a total of seven adjacent districts along the coastal plairs would form the project area for
rehabilitation works. An incremental area of 28,467 ha would return to irrigation while 45,019 ha
with currently partly operational systems would receive improved irrigation under the Project. The
incremental area for drainage is equal to 17,935 ha, with an additional area of 81,369 ha benefitting
from improved drainage. The project area represents 51 percent of the irrigation command area and
58 percent of the drainage comunand area in the seven districts. Schemes to be rehabilitated under
the Project have been selected following a least cost-per-ha approach within each district. The
Project would focus on the rehabilitation of large irrigation and drainage schemes to maximize the
economic impact of works. Small irigation schemes of less than 100 ha, mostly located in hill areas
and involving high pump lift of more than 50m, would be excluded from works under the Project.
11.  International Waterways. One of the irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated under the Project,
in the southern district of Fier, is located along the Vjoses River which is an international waterway,
entering Albania from its south-eastern neighbor Greece, and leaving Albania into the Adriatic Sea.
Two-thirds of the catchment area of this river lie within Albania, the rest lies in Greece. The
irrigaton scheme in question, the so-called Vjoses-Levan-Fier (VFL) scheme, covers an irrgated
area of 28,000 ha, of which 9,500 ha would benefit from rehabilitation works under the Project.
The scheme takes about 50 percent of the available water in the Vjoses River. In accordance with
OD 7.50, a notification of Greece for the activities under the Project is not required for the following
two reasons: (a) the Project will finance only rehabilitation and upgrading of existing systems. As
the VFL scheme is located downstream from the other riparian, it will not have any adverse affect
on the quantity of water flows to others, nor will water quality be affected as a result of the
rehabilitation works. In addition, the Project will not involve any increase in water extraction; and
(b) a review of international agreements and arrangements that exist between Albania and Greece on
the sharing of international waters tlat m.Aght be affected by the Project has shown that none of these
agreements would require notification for the activities to be carried out under the Project.
12.   Project Components.  The main components of the proposed Project are: (a) system
rehabilitation of 21 irrigation schemes and 18 drainage schemes, covering a command area of 73,486
ha for irrigation and 99,304 ha for drainage, inchlding a demonstration scheme for canal control
covering 1,000 ha of irrigation command area; (b) institutional development and capacity building,
involving equipment, technical assistance and traming for improved system operation and
maintenance, enhancement of the domestic design capacity, establishment of WUAs, and for an on-
farm water management program; (c) policy support, through studies and programs, including the
regulatory framework for irrigation, small system turnover, WUA consolidation, settng of water
charges, and the enabling environment for private investments into surface and groundwater
pumping; and (d) project implementation support through provision of office equipment, technical
assistance and training.
13.   Project Implemenation. The Project was prepared by the Institute for Study and Design of
Water Works (ISDWW) in collaboration with MoAF. It would be implemented by the Project
Management Unit (PMU) within the new Irrigation Division of the Directorate of Services for
Natural Water Resources, currently being created within MoAF upon recommendation by IDA.



-  -
Under financing from a PPF and a Japanese Grant, four foreiga consultants have been engaged to
assist PMU in preparing fmal designs and bidding documents, to advise on the introduction of proper
cost accounts for WEs, and to prepare for the establishment of WUAs under the Project.
Construction supervision would be assisted through qualified experts financed under the IDA credit.
14.   Environmental Aspects. The overall impact of rehabilitation works and institutional and
policy reforms on the natural environment would be positive. The Project would reduce surface
water and soil contamination stemming from agricultural runoff through a reduction in irrigation
water losses by improving system conveyance and flow control. Pesticide run-off would be further
reduced through dissemination of information to farmers on the safe use of pesticides, following IDA
regulations on techniques for integrated pest management, in conjunction with the On-farm Water
Management Program supported under the Project. Improvements in system conveyance and on-
farm irrigation water distribution would diminish the potential for soil salinity built up through water-
logging caused by water losses. Rehabilitation of major drainage systems along the coastal districts
would further improve flood control and reduce salinity-related problems without threatening valuable
natural wetlands or habitats since all areas were drained previously. While Albania has not yet
developed a comprehensive water resources development and management plan, preparatory steps
have been taken by the Government to develop such a plan, and IDA staff is currently involved in
mobilizing support for this effort. The proposed Project would fit well into a new water resources
management plan since this plan would include substantial investments for rehabilitating water
development works. Furthermore, there are currently no water allocation issues between economic
sectors since water resources exceed by far current water requirements, and seasonal variations can
be balanced through the existing reservoir storage capacity.
15.   The Droject would improve the country's capacity of monitoring soil and surface water
quality through provision of equipment and technical assistance to the Soil Institute in Tirana.
However, given the potentially serious water quality problems in the country, an environmental
evaluation would be prepared for each irrigation and drainage scheme prior to invitng the first works
contract bid for each respective scheme.3 This evaluation would address, inter alia, (a) contamination
of irrigation water upstream caused by domestic and industrial wastes; (b) pollution downstream
caused by drainage water discharge; and (c) proposed measures to mitigate any such environmental
impacts. In addition, the overall environmental impact of the Project would be assessed during the
Mid-Term Review. The Project's environmental classification is "B". Therefore, a formal
environmental assessment was not made.
16.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. Inadequate irrigation and drainage are causing significant
reductions in crop yields and farm output and are the cause of negative environmental impacts.
Technically straightforward system rehabilitation works, combined with key institutional and policy
reforms, will yield high economic and fmancial returns and have substantial environmental benefits.
By its presence, IDA can promote institutional development and policy changes and ensure that
limited resources are utilized in the most efficient manner. The seven districts along Albania's fertile
coastal plains form the core area of agricultural production in the country and are a good starting
place for IDA to demonstrate what can be achieved with limited resources.
2/  A first environmental screening has been undertaken by ISDWW and WEs durng project preparaton in order to exclude
schemes witb any serious water quality issues from rehabiliaion under the proposed Project



- 6-
17.   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Albania was discussed by the Board on
September 14, 1993 and the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project was specifically mentioned in the CAS.
The Project is linked to the CAS emphasis on the rehabilitation of Albania's dilapidated basic
infrastructure, and on support for the development of private agriculture through infrastructure
improvements and creatior. of proper pricing incentives. The Project also addresses poverty
alleviation and eiwironmental improvement, areas of special emphasis under the CAS.
18.   Agreements Reached. Agreement has been reached on the following during negotiations:
a. on the submission of Annual Work Plans for all rehabiliation works, by November 15
of the preceding year staring with the work program for calendar year 199 .
b. on a comprehensive Mid-term Review by December 31, 1996;
c. that the Govermnent would cover all applicable dutes and local taxes;
d. that the Government would provide funding to cover any fnancing gap in the event that
sufficient cofinancing could not be secured by October 31, 1995;
e. that guidelines, reviewed by IDA, for comparative price quotations in the award of civil
works contracts of lesser value than US$250,000 would be followed;
f. that Government would undertake annual independent audits of Water Enterprises in the
project area for rehabilitation works, with terms of reference acceptable to IDA;
g. on the annual review and adjustment of water charges, by March 31 of the following
year, to achieve full coverage of actual operatig costs of WEs in the project area by
1998, and to recover the full cost of investments under the Project and of associated
replacements starting in 1999;
h. that Government would ensure that annual budget provisions for WEs, over the
implementation period of the Project, include sufficient funds to cover the portion of
recufrent costs for system operation and maintenance not recovered through water
charges;
i. on an environmental evaluation to be prepared, and submitted for review by IDA, for
each irrigation and drainage scheme prior to inviting the first works contract bid for each
respective scheme;
j. on the submission to IDA of independent audits of all project accounts.
19.   Conditions of Board Presentation. The following conditons have been met prior to the
presentation of the Project to the Board of Direors of IDA: (a) passage of the new Irrigation Code
by Parliament; and (b) clearance of arrears in energy charges that have been billed to the seven WEs
in the project area by KESH, the Albanian power utility.



- 7 -
20.   Condition of Effectiveness. Enactment of WUA Regulations through a decision by the
Minister of Agriculture and Food would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.
21.   Benefits. The Project would cause an increase in crop Yields and a &iift in cropping patterns
towards high-value cash crops, resulting in a significant increase of physical production and output
value, mainly for wheat, maize, vegetables, milk, fodder, and industrial crops such as cotton. Most
incremental production would initially be for self-consumption until a rise in domestic purchasing
power and improved export prospects would enhance prospects for marketing of surplus produce.
Annual net cash income of 56,800 benefitting farm families, after on-farm consumption, would
exceed US$500 by year five of the Project, compared to US$200 without the Project. The Project
would provide the basis for a sound water pricing policy aimning, over a five-year period, at the full
recovery of operation and maintenance costs borne by WEs, and the recovery of investment and
replacement costs borne by the Government, through cost-covering water charges payable by water
users. Strengthening the role of women in irrigation management through their active involvement
in WUAs would be a focus of training activities under the Project.
22.   Project Sustainability. Making the Project sustainable will require institutional changes at
the local, regional and national levels. The Project would address the local changes by supporting
the establishment of WUAs in some 536 villages in the project area, affecting about 100,000 farm
families, in order to ensure farmer participation in system O&M and for on-farm investments. At
the regional level, the Project would strengthen the operations of WEs through provision of
maintenance equipmient and technical assistance; at the same time, the efficiency of the operations
of WEs would be monitored and improved through independent external audits. The introduction
of a new Irrigation Code and changes in the national tariff policy would contribute to institutional
and financial sustainability at the national level. During negotiations, the Government agreed to the
most important national policy change for the financial sustainability of the Project, the increase of
the price of water to cost-covering levels over a five-year period.
23.   Risks. There are three significant risks to the successful implementation of the Project. The
first is that the limited implementation capacity of the various Government institutions involved
would cause delays in design, procurement and construction of rehabilitation works.  The
comprehensive technical assistance and training program under the Project, already successfully
initated under the PPF, would help reduce these risks. The second risk relates to potential delays
in securing all required cofinancing, despite the strong interest shown by various donors. However,
given the fully modular design of the Project, with independent rehabilitation works to be carried out
in seven different districts, such delays would have no major impact on the economic rate of return,
since financing of all required institutional development and implementation support would be
ensured through proceeds from the IDA credit. The petential lack of funds to cover local costs of
37 percent of total project costs is a third risk but would be limited since 80 percent of local costs
would be financed through participation of IDA and other cofinanciers. During the. Mid-term
Review, a broad assessment of project implementation and financing would be undertaken with the
view of addressing and resolving any remaining risks.

Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
