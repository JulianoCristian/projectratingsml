outcome is\n            satisfactory, while project sustainability is likely. Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances were satisfactory\n            overall. This project has demonstrated that sustained\n            Borrower commitment as well as continuity were critical to\n            the success of reform, and also, that, within the basic\n            program strategy, flexibility is necessary to adapt actions\n            to changes, unforeseen difficulties, or political\n            opposition. Even if immediate solutions are not optimum,\n            they are preferable to delays or abandonment of the process,\n            particularly when inefficiencies can be remedied later\n            through complementary measures. Other lessons included:\n            Formulating conditions regarding liquidation/closures more\n            precisely; establishing regulatory agencies as soon as\n            possible so that they can build capacity before\n            privatization starts; governing the essential\n            characteristics of state regulatory agencies by federal law\n            in order to avoid the reversal or challenge to decisions\n            made by these state agencies; completing the\n            municipalization of services to accelerate and promote the\n            emergence of small and medium size private sector firms\n            willing to provide services and secure financing for\n            investments; agreeing to compensation payments before the\n            actual transfer of systems; avoiding ill-suited lending\n            instruments that complicate project implementation; and\n            requiring legal opinions to report any Senate-imposed\n            limitation to loan agreements."}, "docdt": "2002-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
