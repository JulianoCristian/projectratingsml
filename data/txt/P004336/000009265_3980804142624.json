The overall outcome is assessed as satisfactory.\n            Overall, implementation was very good and the specific\n            objectives set for the project were achieved. Excellent\n            consultant input to the procurement and construction\n            supervision process ensured virtually trouble free\n            implementation of major infrastructure development on a\n            remote green field island site. Narrowly defined,\n            sustainability of this, the major component, is very likely.\n            Implementation of the technical assistance component was\n            varied, as is also the likelihood of sustainability.\n            Performance of the borrower and its agencies was\n            satisfactory; overall, government actions were generally\n            supportive, demonstrating full commitment to the project and\n            sector. Bank performance, while generally satisfactory, was\n            less so in identification and preparation, where the sector\n            strategy adopted was suboptimal. Partial export\n            liberalization in the sector, just prior to appraisal,\n            insufficiently accounted for in project design, had a\n            negative impact on the main project entity; but it vastly\n            improved income generation for beneficiaries as well as\n            overall sector efficiency. Positive lessons point to careful\n            selection of consultants, as well as the prior in-country\n            experience of these."}, "docdt": "1998-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
