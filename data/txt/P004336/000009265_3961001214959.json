Fishing is the most\n            important primary activity in the Maldivian economy. In\n            order to maintain this industry, the project will: 1)\n            increase fish production, government revenue, and foreign\n            exchange earnings at a lower processing cost; 2) increase\n            the income of fishing households to alleviate relative\n            poverty; 3) reduce migration to the capital city, Male,\n            through balanced regional growth; and 4) create the\n            environment for increased private sector participation in\n            the fisheries sector. The Third Fisheries Project will meet\n            these goals by: 1) constructing a port at Kooddoo in Gaafu\n            Alifu in Southern Maldives for fishing boats and collector\n            vessels; 2) building a fish freezing/cold storage complex on\n            the same island; 3) strengthening the atoll wide fish\n            collection system; and 4) providing technical assistance.\n            These new improvements will help to strengthen the fishing\n            industry of Maldives."}, "docdt": "1991-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
