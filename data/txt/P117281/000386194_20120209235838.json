satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: The main lesson is that a\n            well designed, non-programmatic series of stand-alone\n            operations can form a basis for reasonably predictable\n            policy-based support, even in highly uncertain political\n            environments such as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. This operation has\n            facilitated progress even as it faced major risks. Second,\n            the identification of a single counterpart from the\n            Government side offered a strong advantage in implementation\n            of reforms. This has eased the return to the reform agenda\n            after the crisis, many of the counterparts on the government\n            side have remained in place. Third, the operations relative\n            success in difficult circumstances illustrates the need,\n            underlined in the good practice principles referred to\n            earlier, for parsimony and selectivity in choosing prior\n            actions, outcome indicators, and targets. A more complex\n            design, a longer list of actions and targets, or a broader\n            set of areas of intervention would likely have resulted in a\n            less satisfactory operational impact."}, "docdt": "2012-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
