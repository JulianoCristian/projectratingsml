"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Education System\n            Realignment and Strengthening Program Project for Georgia\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. The project contributed to\n            strengthening technical capacity within the sector through\n            extensive training of the core staff in the National\n            Curriculum and Assessment Center and the Teacher\n            Professional Development Center. Strong technical capacities\n            were built in the areas of curriculum, pedagogy, assessment\n            of learning outcomes and textbook evaluation, which remain\n            highly important and relevant for the management of the\n            education sector in the long run. The project supported a\n            major shift from ad-hoc teacher training towards the design\n            of system-wide teacher polices, such as the development of\n            professional and subject standards for teachers, the new\n            professional development framework for teachers, mechanisms\n            for the accreditation of teacher training programs and\n            teacher certification system, all of which have been\n            institutionalized in the Education legislation and are\n            playing an important role in regulating the teaching\n            profession. Some lessons learned included: the project was\n            implemented during a period where reforms in public finance,\n            procurement and anti-corruption measures were ongoing, the\n            majority of them supported by World Bank financed\n            operations. Such reforms indirectly supported project\n            implementation as they strengthened governance in the\n            education sector. This Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was\n            supposed to be the second of a three-phased program, to be\n            implemented over 10 years. Whereas at the time of design\n            this seemed the optimal instrument to support a long-term\n            education reform and provide reassurance to the Government\n            of the Bank's commitment to it, by the time the second\n            phase was wrapping up the Government was not interested in\n            pursuing a third phase as it wanted to focus the Bank's\n            support in other sectors. A follow-up lesson to the one\n            above is that education projects that seek to close down\n            schools need to consider the difficulties of rationalizing a\n            school network and should built into projects appropriate\n            mitigation measures to gain support from stakeholders and\n            also avoid hurting certain groups."}, "docdt": "2012-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
