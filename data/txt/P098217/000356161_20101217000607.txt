Extension of Closing Date 
 
GEORGIA 
—
EDUCATION SYSTEM
 REALIGNMENT & STRENGTHENING 
PROGRAM (APL #2) 
P098217 
 &  
PHRD GRANT TF057515 
 
Restructuring Paper 
 
1. The closing date for 
Georgia Education System Realignment & Strengthening 
Program
 (APL #2)
,
P098217, and co-financing PHRD Grant, TF057515, 
will be 
extended
 
from December 31, 2010 until August 31, 2011.   
2.  The implementation of the Project is well underway and activities under the IDA 
credit supporting the reconstruction of schools in emergency conditions are expected 
to be finalized by the current Closing Date.  
3.  At the same time, the proposed extension is necessary to allow for the completion of 
ongoing activities under the complementing PHRD Grant, which finances key reform 
elements directly linked to the achievement of several outcome indicators.  The 
activities financed by the PHRD Grant suffered delays due to several reorganizations 
at the Ministry of Education and Science and at the two implementing agencies, the 
National Curriculum and Assessment Center (NCAC) and the Teacher Professional 
Development Center (TPDC). The concerted efforts of the new management team 
over the last six months have produced tangible results under the Grant. 
 
Notwithstanding, due to above delays, without the proposed extension the Project will 
not satisfactorily achieve its development objective as some essential activities need 
additional time to be completed. Namely, national assessments in grade four 
Mathematics and Georgian Language and Literature, strengthening of the existing 
teacher professional development opportunities, and finalization of teacher 
professional development framework.    
4. 
The Association received assurances from the Ministry of Education and Science that 
all activities would be completed by August 31, 2011.  The Borrower has developed 
and agreed with the Association an action plan for the extension period. The 
Association will closely monitor the implementation of the action plan and inform 
management in a timely manner about the progress.  
 
5.  This will be the second closing date extension for the project with cumulative 
extensions of 20 months. There are no outstanding audit reports under the project. 
Audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 both for the 
Education System Realignment & Strengthening Project Credit (Credit No. 4246) and 
PHRD (TF057515) were submitted to the Bank. The auditor issued unqualified 
(clean) opinions on the implementing entities and project financial statements.
