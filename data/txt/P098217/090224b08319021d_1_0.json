The staircase into\n            the old schoolhouse in Jugaani was missing steps. Inside the\n            building were cracked ceilings, peeling walls and rickety\n            desks. Many Georgian schools were so dilapidated that fixing\n            them would have cost more than replacing them. Education\n            System Realignment and Strengthening Project implemented a\n            range of reforms to improve education in Georgia. They\n            included classrooms tailored for interactive teaching and\n            learning, libraries, well equipped gyms and recreation zones\n            for meetings, improved access for children and adults with\n            disabilities, and other provisions to ensure inclusive\n            education. Newly reconstructed schools have become assets to\n            their communities, offering resources and space, to support\n            learning and access to new technologies for the greater community."}, "docdt": "2012-04-09T04:40:02Z"}
