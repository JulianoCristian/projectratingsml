                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Credit proceeds have been fully disbursed and the new schools financed by the Project are now operational including ensuring the adequate supply of utilities. Significant progress
                         has been made on advancing core activities under the PHRD grant including the follow up rounds of national assessments and teacher certification. Despite earlier implementation
                         delays, it is expected that the bulk of the envisaged activities in the area of curriculum and teacher development will be finalized by the closing date of August 31, 2011.

                         respect to most of the original outcome indicators despite modest shortcomings in the achievements of project objectives. Achievement highlights include the fact that 80% of
                         students are currently learning according to the improved national curriculum, compared to the 70% target; with the completion of the last three school (out of 38) rehabilitations/
                         constructions in the next few months, all of students attending schools previously identified as in emergency condition will be attending schools considered safe; 90% of schools have
                         autonomy in managing funds received through the per capita formula and have managed within budget, only 10% short of the project's goal; and a share of teachers have been
                         certified according to new standards, though far less than project targets. The one indicator where there is a clear shortcoming is the increase in the student-teacher ratio, which
                         remains at 10-1, an actual increase from the 12-1 baseline at the start of the project. This is not surprising as the Project did not finance any activities that would have a direct impact
                         on altering this ratio.
