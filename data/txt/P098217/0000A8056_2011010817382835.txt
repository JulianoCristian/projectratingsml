                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Development Objective of APL 2 is to increase the quality and efficiency of primary and secondary education in Georgia through the implementation of the
                         institutional and policy framework developed under APL 1, as well as the reconstruction of schools in dire physical condition. The key performance indicators of
                         the project are, therefore, focused on the relevant measures of quality and efficiency.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Significant progress has been made under the infrastructure component of the project in addressing existing implementation bottlenecks and in supplying utilities to the new schools.
                         The bulk of the credit proceeds have already been disbursed and all seven schools financed by the project are expected to be operational by December, 2010. Important efforts have
                         also been made over the last six months to accelerate the progress under the PHRD grant evidenced in piloting and implementation of the new general secondary education
