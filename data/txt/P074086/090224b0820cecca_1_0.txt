                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following the recent supervision mission (Sept 30-Oct 11, 2013) the Project has made good progress in achieving intended objectives and implementing recommendations from the
                         last SPN mission to improve project implementation. The targets for Component A (Development of Commercial Agriculture) are now achieved, namely the end-of- project target for
                         rice yielding (target 4,4 tons/ha , achieved 4,4 tons/ha - baseline 2,7 tons/ha). Implementation of Component B (Development of Irrigation) is mainly focused on the rehabilitation of
                         one large irrigation scheme in Andapa amounting US$ 7 million. A detailed action plan has been developed to ensure that this rehabilitation be completed before the closing date in
                         June 2014 and contracts management are closely monitored. Implementation of activities under Component C (Watershed Development) is well advancing and end-of project targets
                         are likely to be achieved.
