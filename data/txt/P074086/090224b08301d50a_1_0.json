Management Project for Madagascar were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, global environment objective\n            (GEO) outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, risk to GEO outcome was high,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project did not achieve all its\n            planned outcomes but built a strong basis on which new\n            operations can be (and are being indeed) prepared. Regarding\n            institutional arrangements, the project demonstrated that it\n            is possible, and recommended, to rely on the Ministry of\n            Agriculture\u2019s structure, reinforced with adequate technical\n            assistance (TA) and the support of an external financial\n            management agency, to implement agricultural projects. The\n            project also demonstrated the validity of the integrated\n            watershed approach and the strong interest that\n            beneficiaries take in that approach. The multiannual\n            performance contract (PC) approach and the montant d\u2019apport\n            pr\u00e9alable estim\u00e9 r\u00e9aliste (MAPER) combined with the\n            formalization of Dina proved to be useful tools to generate\n            ownership and mobilize the irrigation scheme users and to\n            consolidate their Water User Associations (WUAs). In a\n            context of an ever increasing fragmentation of land in\n            irrigated areas, a strong emphasis should be put on\n            agricultural intensification and diversification in uplands.\n            Future projects should also be more gender sensitive in\n            order to draw on the generally observed dynamism of women\n            and women associations in soil conservation,\n            intensification, diversification, marketing, and processing\n            activities. More attention has to be paid to establishing an\n            adequate monitoring and evaluation (M and E) system that is\n            able to define and correctly monitor useful output and\n            outcome indicators and that does not neglect the evaluation\n            aspect, in order to provide project management with impact\n            and sustainability assessments that may induce shifts in\n            strategies and resources during the project life."}, "docdt": "2015-06-24T03:06:02Z"}
