                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As the Project is scheduled to close on June 30 , 2014, the team had been conducting the last Implementation Support Mission from March 17 to 28. The Project continues to make
                         good progress in achieving intended objectives. The number of direct beneficiaries has been surpassed (target 13130, achieved 14,991) and targets for Component A (Development
                         of Commercial Agriculture) have been achieved namely for irrigated rice yielding (target 4,4 tons /ha, achieved 4,4 tons/ha, baseline 2,7 tons /ha) and rain-fed rice (target 2,6 tons/ha,
                         achieved 3,3 tons /ha, baseline 1,4 ton/ha). As for Component B (Development of Irrigation) an extension of 6 months of the project closing date is required to finalize, test and fully
                         finance the remaining essential irrigation works which have been halted by heavy and long lasting rains in the Project sites. Regarding Component C ( Development of Watershed)
                         key indicators are surpassed namely the number of beneficiaries adopting Sustainable Land Management (target 2400, achieved 11769), and surfaces under sustainable land
                         management systems (target 2051 ha, achieved 2148 ha). The Government of Japan has approved the PHRD grant of 12,6 M, complementary financing to the IDA Credit, in
                         December 2013. The Grant was signed in March 2014 between the Government of Madagascar and the World Bank.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government of Japan has approved in December 2013 the PHRD grant of US$ 12,6 M, complementary financing to the IDA Credit. While the BVPI-IDA/GEF is expected to close
                         in June 2014 with uncertainty on the materialization of the second phase, the design of this PHRD Grant has been programed to ensure its alignment and coherence with the newly
                         approved Madagascar Emergency Food Security and Social Protection Project which includes similar irrigation and watershed development activities.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
