                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has made good progress in achieving its intended objectives. The targets for Component A (Development of Commercial Agriculture) are near to be achieved.
                         Implementation of Component B (Development of Irrigation) has seen some delays for the infrastructure rehabilitation works but the capacity building activities to strengthen Water
                         Users Associations (WUAs) are advancing well. Implementation progress under Component C (Development of Watershed) has been particularly affected by the unavailability of
                         GEF funds. This component has seen however some significant progress, specifically, some sites vitrines have been completed with all initial investments for afforestation, treatment
                         of lavakas, and agro-ecological sub-projects.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Following the signing of the GEF grant agreement, a second restructuring of IWMP APL1 has been processed to accommodate the GEF funds (US$ 5,9 M) , with which the IDA
                         funds are fully blended. The second restructuring was approved by RVP in September 2012 with the following changes: (i) extension of the Project closing date to June 30, 2014 ;
                         (ii) adjustment of the Results Framework; and (iii) reallocation of the credit proceeds.

                         2. The approval of the PHRD grant of US$ 12,6 M, complementary financing to the IDA Credit, by the Government of Japan has been delayed. The Bank team has now developed a
                         new revised timeline for effectiveness , which is now tentatively scheduled for June 2013.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
