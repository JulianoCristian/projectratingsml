                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A Mid Term Review (MTR) was carried out from September 19 - October 7, 2011. During the MTR mission, the World Bank team confirmed the continuing relevance of the Project
                         Development Objective, the technical components, and the project implementation arrangements. The Project has made good progress in implementing the action plan designed to
                         accelerate activities whose implementation lagged during the prolonged disbursement freeze. The disbursement rate has not increased as much as expected, however. A new action
                         plan was discussed and agreed with the PIU to speed up implementation of activities. It was agreed that Strategic Partners with international expertise will be asked to recruit
                         additional staff to accelerate the implementation of the three technical project components. The GEF grant agreement was signed on December 30, 2012, and the grant became
                         effective in January 2012. In parallel to the MTR, an identification mission was conducted to prepare a parallel-funded CARD-PHRD operation in the amount of US$ 12.6 million. A
                         joint implementation support mission for BVPI IDA and GEF / preparation mission for BVPI CARD-PHRD was conducted from April 2-13, 2012 to follow-up the recommendations that
                         emerged from the MTR and pre-appraise the CARD-PHRD operation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The GEF grant agreement was signed on December 30, 2012. Following the signing of the GEF grant agreement, the IDA credit needs to restructured a second time to take into
                         account the additional resources of US$ 5.9 M. The proposed restructuring will bring thefollowing changes: (i) extension of the Project closing date ; (ii) adjustment of the Results
                         Framework; and (iii) reallocation of the credit proceeds.

                         2. Following the pre appraisal mission to prepare the CARD-PHRD operation, the Bank team agreed with the Malagasy counterparts and with JICA that the proposed operation will
                         work in three sites (Lac Alaotra, Itasy, and Marovoay) out of the four sites in which the IDA/GEF project operates. The CARD-PHRD operation will however work on different irrigation
                         schemes within these three sites. The mission also confirmed the PDO, Project costs in the amount of US$12.6 million, the Project components and activities, and institutional
                         arrangements. It was agreed that a new component focused on research activities will be prepared in addition to the three technical components already being supported under the
                         IDA/GEF operation.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
