 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

  All in all, the Project has achieved its intended objective and the Project towards achievement PDO and GEO rated
 "satisfactory". All end-of-project targets have been met and most of them surpassed. The end-of-project target for the APL is
 achieved namely the rice yielding (target 4, 4 tons/ha, achieved 4, 4 tons/ha - baseline 2, 7 tons/ha). All PDO and GEO targets are even surpassed at
 project closing namely (i) Areas provided with irrigation and drainage services (14,029 ha achieved out of 13,362 ha planned) (ii) Direct project
 beneficiaries (22,790 achieved out of 13,130 planned of which 27% female out of 20% planned); (iii) Area cultivated with improved technologies
 and/or inputs provided through the sub-projects (6122 ha achieved out of 5175 planned) ; and (iv) Area under sustainable land management in the
 targeted project intervention areas (3018 ha achieved out of 2051 planned)

               Comments
               The unit of measure has been changed from percentage to amount in Malagasy Ariary (Dollar equivalent) at the second restructuring on
               September 9, 2012. Amount of fees collected is more appropriate than percentages.
