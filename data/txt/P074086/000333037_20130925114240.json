The report\n            assesses the risks to human health and the environment\n            associated with acquiring, storing and maintaining, and\n            disposing of and using pesticides; discusses risk prevention\n            through training and education of workers and the public,\n            protective equipment for workers, and regulation and\n            legislation. It also evaluates the capacity of\n            Madagascar's institutions to control and regulate\n            pesticides while assigning roles and responsibilities; and\n            identifies pest types and discusses strategies to control\n            their spread-especially the control of mosquitoes and the\n            prevention of malaria. Specific risks it identifies include\n            soil contamination and water resources contamination,\n            including leaching leading to water table pollution, and\n            groundwater and underground water pollution; as well as\n            accidental ingestion of chemicals, inhalation by residents\n            of fumes and dust, and skin contact with the actual\n            substances. Beyond those measures already mentioned, the\n            report recommends an integrated approach to pest management,\n            installing emergency procedures in case of accidents,\n            promoting the effective use of alternatives, and\n            environmental monitoring. Also addressed are those issues\n            related with regional environmental and social assessments\n            for each project site - Maravoay, Itasy, Andapa, and Alaotra\n            - (v. 2 through 5), and its mitigation measures."}, "docdt": "2013-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
