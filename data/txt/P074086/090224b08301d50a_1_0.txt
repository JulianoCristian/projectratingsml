1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Context

1.      Madagascar was one of the poorest countries in the world at the time of appraisal and
remains so at closing, with per capita GDP of about US$281 in 2006 and US$271 in 2013 (both
figures in constant 2005 US$). The economy continues to be basically rural, with rural
population representing 66 percent of total population and agriculture accounting for
26 percent of GDP in 2013 (respectively 71 and 28 percent at appraisal in 2006). Poverty
headcount ratios have also remained largely unchanged throughout the project life: the poor
were estimated to represent 75 percent of total population and 82 percent of rural population
in 2010, against 75 and 81 percent in 2005.1

2.       After contested presidential elections in 2001-2002 that led to the collapse of the
economy and the discontinuation of many public social services, Madagascar was experiencing
some political stability at the time the project was being appraised. The Government of
Madagascar (GoM) strategy was embodied in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP,
July 2003), which had the objective to reduce poverty by half in ten years. In agriculture, the
PRSP aimed at “ensuring food security and making optimal use of resources” through, inter
alia, increased agricultural productivity and cultivated areas (about one-half of Madagascar’s
land area is cultivable, but little more than 5 percent was - and still is - under temporary and
permanent crops). The GoM was also in the process of finalizing its second-generation
strategy, the Madagascar Action Plan 2012 (MAP) that was a direct follow-on from the PRSP
and assigned renewed priority to rural and agricultural development. A significant growth
potential, yet to be reaped, was rightly identified in a number of sectors, including mining,
construction, tourism and, most important for the poor, agriculture.

Sector Context

3.       At appraisal, about 40 percent of arable land, about 1.1 million hectares, was under
irrigation in both traditional and more developed schemes.2 Again, this proportion remains
unchanged as of 2015. Rice, about 90 percent of which was irrigated, was the main staple crop,
accounting for about 40 percent of total gross agricultural production value and 50 percent of
total calorie consumption. In 2006, it was noted that annual production of paddy had virtually
stagnated over the previous ten years, stabilizing between 2.3 and 3.0 million tons, while
imports of rice had increased from an average of 52,000 tons (equivalent to about 78,000 tons
of paddy) per year in the 1990s to an average of 195,000 tons (equivalent to about 291,000 tons
of paddy) per year in the first six years of the 2000s. Area planted to paddy had increased by
only 0.4 percent per year from 1970 to 2004. Yields had increased by 0.7 percent per year over

the same period, much slower than in other major rice producing countries, and were remaining
low, averaging about 2.6 tons per hectare at the national level.

4.       The disappointing performance of the agriculture sector in previous years, despite the
liberalization of the economy, the sharp devaluation of the exchange rate, and the privatization
of state enterprises, was seen as a major cause of the deep poverty in rural areas and was
explained by at least six factors: (i) Farming systems were still very traditional, with two-thirds
of all rural households living at subsistence level and very low yields; (ii) Weak infrastructure
was hampering the transport of produce, whether for export or for the domestic market;
(iii) Agricultural productivity was hampered by poor access to agricultural technology, inputs,
and agricultural services; (iv) In particular, extension services were all but lacking, having
failed to have a significant impact on productivity levels due to a bias towards technical
messages, a too centralized approach leaving little room to accommodate regional variations,
inadequate consideration for the economic constraints farmers were facing, insufficient
capacities and unrealistic expectations about the volume of public (human and financial)
resources available; (v) Only 1.5 percent of Madagascar’s small farmers had access to credit,
and just 5 percent of total lending was going to agriculture; and (vi) Traditional land tenure
systems were not providing farmers with sufficient security.

5.      At the end of 2005, the GoM adopted a National Rural Development Program (NRDP)
which was centered around five strategic axes: (i) to make the institutional framework more
effective by completing public administration reform and decentralization; (ii) to facilitate
access to capital and production factors; (iii) to improve food security and production through
increased productivity, diversification, and risk management; (iv) to promote better natural
resources management; and (v) to develop markets and promote a value chain approach by
encouraging public-private partnerships.

6.      Since the 1950s, irrigation had benefited from public investment. However, the impact
of these investments on rural incomes was mixed, and their sustainability was far from certain.
The rapid degradation of infrastructure required frequent rehabilitation, and many schemes
were caught in a vicious circle of poor yields and limited ability on the part of water users to
pay for operation and maintenance (O&M). This inability to pay was compounded by low
willingness to pay, and reinforced by the institutional weakness of Water Users’ Associations
(WUA), as well as a lack of support from local authorities. The erosion of upstream watersheds
was moreover weighing heavily on the costs of maintaining downstream irrigation schemes.

7.        At the time of appraisal in 2006, a clear consensus was therefore emerging regarding
the need to adopt a new approach to the development of irrigation in Madagascar. The need
for a broader and more inclusive strategy of agricultural intensification that would reach
beyond the rehabilitation of infrastructure and extend to promoting a more integrated and
participatory approach had been emphasized in a number of recent studies.3 Such an approach
would include: (i) promotion of green revolution and agro-ecological technologies in order to
boost productivity; (ii) enhanced access to finance, inputs, equipment, and markets;
(iii) establishment of an appropriate incentive and financing framework for efficient O&M of
irrigation infrastructure; (iv) financial mechanisms to mitigate the damages caused by the

frequent cyclones that affect the country; and (v) soil and water conservation in upper
watersheds.

8.      These lessons and the need to adopt a long-term, comprehensive approach to irrigation
development were fully reflected in the GoM’s new Lettre de Politique de Développement des
Bassins Versants et Périmètres Irrigués (Irrigation and Watershed Management Policy Letter)
that was issued in 2006 and operationalized through the establishment of the National Irrigation
and Watershed Management Program (NIWMP) the same year.4 The Irrigation and Watershed
Management Project (IWMP), appraised in 2006, was therefore fully consistent with the
principles underpinning the NRDP and in line with the GoM’s new irrigation and watershed
management strategy.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

9.       The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Madagascar at the time of appraisal was
designed to support the implementation of the PRSP. For this purpose, the CAS was organized
around three key priorities: (i) improve governance; (ii) promote broad based growth; and
(iii) provide human security. The IWMP was to contribute to the second priority.

10.     In addition to being seen as the lead GoM partner for poverty reduction, the Bank had
a comparative advantage in funding the IWMP due to its active role in the support of reforms
in the irrigation sector since the early 1990s. Specifically, the privatization of public and
parastatal irrigation organizations, the rationalization of public expenditures for maintenance,
the transfer of the management of irrigation schemes to WUAs, and capacity building had been
supported by past Bank investment operations. More recently, the Bank had supported the
GoM in establishing the Irrigation Scheme Maintenance Fund or Fonds d’Entretien des
Réseaux Hydro-Agricoles (FERHA).

11.     By promoting sustainable land management across the watersheds, the project was also
consistent with the GEF Operational Program 15 concerning the mitigation and prevention of
land degradation. Because Madagascar was eligible for GEF support, it was decided the project
would be co-financed by IDA (US$30.0 million) and GEF (US$ 6.0 million), on a fully blended
basis.



1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

12.     The IWMP was conceived as the first phase of a three phase, 12 year program to be
financed through an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The APL program objective was “to
sustainably improve the living conditions and incomes of rural populations in six main
irrigation sites and their surrounding watersheds, and the management of natural resources.”
The program objective was to be measured by four indicators related to (i) the productivity of
irrigated and of rainfed rice in project areas (both in mt/ha) as a measure of the increased
intensification resulting from the improved water management and expanded use of the crop

intensification packages; (ii) the non-rice irrigated area as a measure of the increase
diversification of the cropping pattern which was considered a condition for sustainable
improvement of incomes in a context of ever decreasing size of the farms; and (iii) the area
under production in irrigated areas during the dry season, which is another dimension of crop
intensification.

13.     In the context of the broader APL objective described above, the Project Development
Objective (PDO) of the APL first phase (the IWMP) was “to establish a viable basis for
irrigated agriculture and natural resources management in four main irrigation sites and their
surrounding watersheds: (i) Andapa (Sava Region), (ii) Marovoay (Boeny Region), (iii) Itasy
Region, and (iv) Lac Alaotra (Alaotra Mangoro Region)” and the Global Environment
Objective (GEO) was “to improve the environmental sustainability of land management
practices in four targeted watersheds.” The project outcome was to be measured against the
dissemination of innovative technologies (number of people), the area under improved water
management (hectares), the number of sub watersheds under improved management and the
increased public expenditures for agricultural intensification, and for the global environment
objective the increase in vegetation cover and in the area under sustainable land management
practices.

14.    Triggers for moving to the second phase of the APL included attainment of the
following targets:

        •    Watershed Master Plans (WMP, including Scheme Development Plans – SDPs -
             and Watershed Development Plans - WDPs) and associated Performance
             Contracts executed satisfactorily;
        •    an acceptable institutional mechanism for the funding of non-transferable

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/justification

15.     The APL program objective and the PDO/GEO remained unchanged throughout the
project life. However, most key performance indicators were adjusted, and some of them
dropped, during the first two project restructurings that took place in 2011 and 2012.5 When
the project was restructured for the first time in February 2011, baseline values that were not
precisely known at appraisal were corrected and the definitions of several indicators were
revised to facilitate measurement and allow better assessment of project achievements, while

 A third restructuring was approved in 2014 to grant a six month extension exclusive of any other change.

                                                  4
the target values of some indicators were reduced to take into account the non-availability of
GEF funds (see section 2.2). Three project outcome indicators were dropped: the indicator
related to improved management of eight watersheds; the indicator related to increased public
expenditure; and the indicator related to increase in vegetation cover.6 When the project was
restructured for the second time in August 2012 after the signing of the GEF Grant Agreement,
the end-of-project targets were modified again, maintaining the definitional changes made in
February 2011. According to the Restructuring Paper, the target values were mostly restored
to their original value, though adjusted to reflect that GEF resources did not finance irrigation-
related activities and rice intensification sub-projects that used chemical fertilizers. In addition,
some indicators were highlighted as core.

 Although the reasons for dropping these indicators are not spelt out in the Restructuring Paper, we can
assume that the reasons were the lack of precise definition for the first one (number of improved
watersheds) and the fact that the indicator was not attributable to the project for the second one (increased
public expenditure). There is however no obvious reason for dropping the third one related to vegetation
cover.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

16.     At appraisal, the first phase of the APL program was planned to cover about 21,780
hectares of irrigation schemes (out of a total of 66,000 hectares for the six sites to be included
in the overall APL program). Direct beneficiaries would include about 30,000 smallholder
households producing irrigated and rainfed crops, and farmers’ groups and private operators
providing services, selling products, and performing various functions in the value chain.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

17.     The project had three technical components and a management component. (See Annex
2 for a more detailed description.)




                                                     6
Component A – Development of Commercial Agriculture (Total cost US$12.7 million, i.e.
31% of total project cost, including IDA US$ 7.5 million (59%), GEF US$2.7 million
(21%) and beneficiaries US$2.5 million (20%))

18.     The objective of this component was to lay the foundations for improved market access
and sustainable intensification and diversification of irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems
in the project’s watersheds. It was planned that the component would include the project area
as a whole, both irrigated and upland areas, and would achieve its specific objective through
an approach focused on market-driven demand, agricultural technology development and
dissemination, private sector initiative and vertical integration of supply chains, as well as
promotion of partnerships among stakeholders (including public-private partnerships (PPP)).
The component included two sub components: (i) Support to agricultural services, and
(ii) Support to private investment, through a cost sharing mechanism.

Component B – Irrigation Development (Total cost US$17.5 million, i.e. 43% of total
project cost, including IDA US$15.7 million (90%) and beneficiaries US$1.8 million
(10%))

19.      This component aimed to lay the foundations for improved management, maintenance
and sustainability of irrigation services provision in four large-scale irrigation schemes
through rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure, capacity strengthening of stakeholders and
clarification of roles and responsibilities, and establishment of an appropriate incentive
framework. The component included two sub-components: (i) Support to irrigation
development and (ii) Irrigation investments. (i) Support to irrigation development entailed
supporting the participatory preparation of Scheme Development Plans (SDP) and annual
Performance Contract (PC), negotiated between WUAs, the DRDR and the Communes, as part
of broader Watershed Master Plans (WMP). The SDPs and PCs would provide the overall
framework for support to irrigated agriculture, including possible investments in the
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. The project would also support stakeholders during
implementation of the PC, through capacity strengthening, mobilization of water users, annual
evaluation of performance indicators and user satisfaction surveys. Studies would be conducted
into O&M costs and cyclone damage to irrigation infrastructure among other matters. (ii) The
Irrigation investments sub-component would support the rehabilitation of irrigation and
appurtenant infrastructure, including technical design studies, implementation of works, and
their supervision.

Component C – Watershed Development (Total cost US$4.3 million, i.e. 11% of total
project cost, including IDA US$1.8 million (42%), GEF US$2.4 million (56%) and
beneficiaries US$0.1 million (2%))

20.     The objective of the component was to lay the foundations for sustainable management
of watersheds including irrigated and rainfed agriculture, the conservation of the natural
heritage, and improved productivity of the natural resources. An integrated and participatory
approach to watershed management would be adopted to make rural populations more
accountable and encourage them to manage land and natural resources more sustainably. This
component included the following two sub-components: (i) Planning and capacity building for
sustainable management of watersheds, including (a) preparation, as part of WMPs, of WDPs
in the four project areas; (b) preparation of participatory plans for managing approximately
eight sub-watersheds (each between about 10 and 500 km2); (c) support to communication and


                                              7
negotiation platforms, (d) training and capacity strengthening of SLM groups; and (e) support
to improvement of land tenure security; and (ii) Sustainable investments in watersheds, to be
determined through participatory negotiations, local strategies for controlling erosion, arresting
gullies and reducing the sediment load of river runoff. The project would finance investments
in strategic anti-erosion works (through biological and other methods); and (b) interventions,
through matching grants, on communally owned land to improve plant cover, reforestation and
pastures through strengthened technologies and management transfer of natural resources.

Component D – Program Management (Total cost US$4.3 million, i.e. 11% of total
project cost, including IDA US$3.5 million (79%) and GEF US$0.9 million (21%))

21.      This component aimed to manage and use resources in accordance with the project’s
objectives and procedures, and to put in place a policy framework that would be favorable to
upscaling of the project to the national level. It was foreseen that this component would finance
the following subcomponents: (i) Management of the project ; (ii) Support to national policies,
including support to the development of major national policies, regulations, and plans
considered critical to the GoM’s PN-BVPI, and support to emerging professional groups; and
(iii) Monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

1.6 Revised Components

22.    Although they were not formally revised, the scope of activities planned under
Components A (Development of Commercial Agriculture) and B (Irrigation Development)
was adjusted during the two main restructurings, followed by a third one in May 2014.

    (i)     The first restructuring in February 2011 occurred when the delayed processing of
            the GEF grant prompted a reallocation of funds from the first two components to
            the Watershed Development Component, component. This reduced the number of
            sub-grants and focused investments under the sub-grants on production-related
            activities only, including seed production, distribution of inputs and support to
            community granaries. Under the second component, the target for rehabilitation of
            irrigated areas was reduced from 21,000 ha to 15,000 ha. The objective was to free
            up funds to start the implementation of the Watershed Development Component
            which was getting pushed back due to the delayed processing of the GEF grant (see
            section 2.1 regarding GEF grant delayed approval).

    (ii)    The second restructuring in August 2012, after the GEF agreement had been finally
            signed in December 2011, increased the number of sub-grants but did not
            reintroduce the market access-related and other support investments to avoid the
            risk of the funds getting too thinly spread over a wide range of activities. Along the
            same lines, it was decided that production-related activities in irrigated schemes
            would focus exclusively on rice, thus leaving out diversification support.
            Additionally, the irrigation rehabilitation area target was increased to 19,000 ha.




                                              8
1.7 Other Significant Changes

23.    A third restructuring in May 2014 pushed the closing date back to the end of the
calendar year.

   (i)     A third restructuring took place in May 2014 to complete some critical irrigation
           activities (Ankaibe weir and primary canal construction) that had been delayed by
           adverse climatic conditions, a six month extension to the closing date to December
           31, 2014 was granted. Total elapsed project implementation period aggregated to
           8 years.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     The project preparation team made commendable use of rich analyses of previous
investment operations in the irrigation sector in Madagascar and the reasons for their
historically disappointing performance (see section 1.1). The IWMP was prepared at the same
time that a new irrigation development paradigm was being formulated with the GoM that
materialized in the Lettre de Politique de Développement des Bassins Versants et Périmètres
Irrigués and the corresponding NIWMP (both 2006). This process accounted for the longer
than usual project preparation time (2 years) but as a result, the IWMP was conceptually fully
consistent with the GoM’s new strategy.

25.     During preparation though, a reduced IDA allocation prompted a change in project
design from a SIL to an APL, which resulted in a less than ideal design with a shorter four year
project period for a rather complex project incorporating market-, production-, infrastructure
rehabilitation- and land conservation-related investments - all with cost-sharing mechanisms,
capacity and institutional building, land titling, etc., and planning to use a fair amount of
consultant inputs to support the project in all these areas. With the benefit of hindsight, it
appears clear that the project was too ambitious with respect to its new format and had little
probability of being able to move to a consolidation phase after four years, even without the
delays generated by the late processing of the GEF grant and the political crisis.

26.     The GEF grant was originally included together with the IDA credit in one single
package, and the two sources of funds were supposed to be fully blended. However changes
in the processing of GEF grants related to sustainable land management, which had to follow
a newly established strategic planning process at country level. These changes resulted in a
split approval process by which the IDA credit was first approved in November 2006 and the
GEF grant was processed as a separate package. The GEF grant was finally approved on
November 6, 2008. Shortly thereafter, in March 2009, and before the GEF grant agreement
could be signed, Madagascar experienced a non-constitutional change in government and
operations in the country were suspended (OP/BP 7.30). On May 6, 2010, the World Bank’s
senior management authorized the resumption of disbursements for selected projects, amongst
which the IWMP, on humanitarian grounds. In April 2011, World Bank senior management
authorized the signing of the GEF grant agreement, which was done in December 2011.




                                             9
27.     Another deficiency was the design of M&E. Outcome indicators (table 2) were rather
qualitative (“dissemination of innovative technologies…”, “improved management…”,
“increased support…”, etc.). Though the PDO contained a clear dimension of sustainability
and replicability (“establish a viable basis for irrigated agriculture and natural resources
management”), PDO level indicators bore little relation to impact or sustainability. In addition,
a number of indicators were poorly defined, in particular those expressed as a percentage
increase of a baseline situation that apparently was never assessed afterwards. The revision of
the result framework during the restructurings of 2011 and 2012 allowed a better quantification
of the PDO level results indicators (table 2). However, a large number of the PDO level
indicators introduced at restructuring proved to be rather redundant with the component outputs
indicators and therefore, impact and sustainability remained understated (see detailed
discussion of result framework and achievements on indicators in Annex 2).

28.     By contrast, a very relevant choice that was made during the design stage was to
implement the project through the GoM structure. The overall coordination of the project was
insured by the Ministry of Agriculture itself, through the coordination unit (Cellule de
Coordination, CelCo) that had been established to oversee the PN-BVPI, while the Regional
Directors for Rural Development (DRDR) were responsible for project coordination in their
respective regions. The CelCo and the DRDRs were reinforced with technical assistance (one
international TA at central level and one national TA at each DRDR level) and the support of
an external financial management agency. 7 Although seen as not being exempt of risk at
appraisal (see below), this option allowed the Ministry of Agriculture and its regional
directorates to be fully involved in project implementation and to greatly enhance their
capacities. Such an organizational setting was also instrumental in ensuring the preservation of
project assets during the 2009-2010 disbursement freeze period.

29.     The potential risks of the project that were identified at appraisal are presented in
table 2 below, together with the mitigation measures that were envisaged and their actual
effectiveness. In retrospect, it can be concluded that the operational risks that were identified
at appraisal were real and proposed mitigation measures valid. However, the project failed to
apply some of these mitigation measures and the failure of the M&E system (see section 2.3)
did not allow the introduction of corrective measures. Two major risks were omitted at
appraisal: the risk of low rate of adoption of new technologies also in irrigated schemes
(implying that the matching grant approach would fail to produce its expected results), and
more generally, the risk for the project to somehow revert, during implementation, to some of
the shortcomings that had characterized previous irrigation development experiences (see
section 2.2).

    Total TA cost amounted to Ar 4.2 billion, i.e. 6 percent of total project costs.

2.2 Implementation

30.     The two main elements that combined to adversely affect implementation were
arguably the very late entry into effect of the GEF grant, the limitations put on dialogue with
the Government and Ministry officials and the 18-month freeze of disbursements due to the
political crisis in 2009. Concretely, the political crisis and ensuing response from Bank
management generated significant hurdles for project implementation:

   (a) Institutional costs: loss of the capacity that had been built up in the Ministry-led PIU
   and reversal of the institutional reforms the project had started supporting.
   (b) Direct economic costs: several contracts had to be suspended with subsequent
   demobilization and remobilization costs; some contractors/suppliers requested early
   termination of their contracts that had to be paid by the client and the retendering of those
   contracts came at a higher price. Note that some SMEs with which the Project had
   developed partnership went bankrupt because they could not sustain the delayed payments.
   (c) Indirect economic costs: postponement of the benefits to be expected from the sub-
   projects which will not be completed or will be completed at a later date.
   (d) Impact on sustainability and effectiveness: At the time of the disbursement freeze, about
   12 Water User Associations had already been selected and had deposited their 20 percent
   upfront contribution (equivalent to the cost of US$2 million rehabilitation works) on local
   bank accounts. Once OP 7.30 was lifted and the project resumed disbursements, most
   farmers did not want to contribute upfront anymore since the farmers who had borrowed
   from local microfinance institutions to pay their contribution had been put in a difficult
   financial situation.
   (e) Impact on supervision: all Bank task teams had been instructed not to communicate in
   writing with government officials (including people working for PIUs) and to avoid going
   to Ministries and participating in meetings called by Ministry officials. This situation was
   particularly difficult for the Bank task team was being implemented through the
   MINAGRI’s existing structure.

31.      Beyond the time and resources used in restructurings, the late entry into force of the
GEF grant and the disbursement freeze period were very prejudicial to the project outcomes
for at least two reasons: (i) in order to free funds to be reallocated to Component C (Watershed
Development), very important elements of Component A (Development of Commercial
Agriculture) were dropped, such as support to diversification and support to non-farm
investment projects (upstream and downstream investments, microfinance, etc.); at the end,
having concentrated on agricultural intensification (with the exception of the support extended
to ASCs that achieved limited results though, see section 3.2), Component A as it was
implemented is the only one that looks very different from what was envisaged at appraisal
and made explicit in its name (Development of Commercial Agriculture); and (ii) because of
the delays incurred, most of the project achievements were obtained in the last few years of
implementation and could not be consolidated before the end of the project.




                                             12
32.       The evaluation of project outcomes also suggests that project appraisal underestimated
the risks of somehow reverting, during implementation, to some of the shortcomings that had
characterized previous irrigation development experiences, in particular: (i) focus on technical
extension messages with little attention paid to the economic constraints farmers are facing and
little effort to differentiate between farmers (e.g. subsistence, commercial, etc.) in order to
develop a range of messages, technologies, and accompanying modes better adapted to each
farmer category; (ii) insufficient emphasis put on issues such as land tenure security, access to
credit and markets and diversification that are critical for sustainable and replicable
productivity enhancement; (iii) insufficient attention paid to the human and material resources
needed, during and after the project, to accompany the beneficiaries and their associations until
they can possibly be weaned off external support without jeopardizing sustainability; and
(iv) insufficient attention paid to the importance of feeder and main road infrastructure status
to maximize project outcomes. While road rehabilitation was not within the project scope
(though it was stated in the PAD that the Regions and Communes would be responsible for
critical inter-communal roads rehabilitation and maintenance of the roads within the schemes),
it is clear that the deteriorating state of the access roads to some of the project sites (in particular
the road leading to the Lac Alaotra area, which is Madagascar’s main rice basket) and of feeder
roads within the irrigation schemes is likely to weaken any achievement on the agricultural
productivity side.

33.     The limits of the matching grant approach adopted under Component A (Development
of Commercial Agriculture) for improved dissemination of agricultural technology became
evident during implementation. Intensification sub-projects (rice intensification in irrigated
schemes and under-cover cultivation on uplands8) were to be implemented over a 3 year cycle,
with a project subsidy decreasing from 80 percent in Year 1 to 50 percent in Year 2 and
20 percent in Year 3. The dropping-out rate proved to be extremely high at 32 percent between
Year 1 and Year 2 and 86 percent between Year 2 and Year 3 for subprojects in irrigated
schemes, where only about 10 percent of all sub-projects financed completed the 3 year cycle.
Drop-out rates were even worse in uplands where 82 percent of under-cover cultivation sub-
projects did not make it to Year 2, and no sub-project reached Year 3. Clearly, farmers took
advantage of the opportunity they were given to use heavily subsidized new technologies in
Year 1 but, due to the risks incurred and/or lack of labor and/or lack of access to finance,
preferred (or had no other choice than) stepping down to less capital intensive cropping
practices in Year 2 and especially in Year 3, generally continuing to apply the improved
practices that do not entail cash outlays (such as earlier and in-row transplanting, etc.). A
program associating demonstration plots, more intensive support (lower ratios of farmers to
extension agents), message/type of support differentiation across farmer categories and
microfinance access enhancement for the technically/commercially more advanced farmers
could certainly have brought about better results in terms of sustainable adoption of improved
technologies.

34.     The project as it started being implemented was also too ambitious in terms of
beneficiary contributions to the rehabilitation works. While the PAD had advised that a


8
  Cultivation under vegetative cover represented 58 percent of the subprojects implemented on uplands.
Other intensification subprojects on uplands, such as fruit tree farming (32 percent) were implemented on a
1 year cycle (possibly spread over 2 years), with a 80 percent subsidy.


                                                   13
preliminary study “would provide guidance on what farmers can reasonably be asked to pay
in terms of O&M and the annual contribution to the PC,” beneficiary contribution was initially
set at 20 percent of total work costs, to be collected upfront, and this resulted in most of the
planned works being upheld. At Mid-Term Review (MTR) in September-October, 2011, only
10 percent of component B2 relative to irrigation scheme rehabilitation had been disbursed.
The MTR usefully introduced the concept of Montant d’Apport Préalable Estimé Réaliste
(MAPER), upfront contribution considered realistic, as actually originally planned by the PAD,
and it was decided that from then onwards the MAPER would no longer be a contribution to
the works but a contribution to infrastructure maintenance. The MAPER, along with other Gros
Entretien et Renouvellement (GER - major repairs and replacement)9 contributions collected
by the WUA over the duration of its PC (that was also extended from 1 to 5 years by the MTR),
was lodged in a bank account jointly operated by the WUA and the DRDR.

35.     Another key factor that positively affected project implementation was arguably the
contracting in April 2011of two strategic partners (SP), 10 in order to accelerate the
implementation of activities in the four regions and to compensate for the multiple delays
during the prolonged disbursement freeze. These strategic partners were local consultant firms
with international experience working under the direct supervision of the DRDR in each region.
They provided the field technicians and support staff that were necessary to ensure the day-to-
day assistance (training, monitoring, technical support) to the various groups of beneficiaries
under the three project components, and were the right arm of the DRDR in implementing the
project activities. To enable them to cope with the amount of work, especially the high interest
expressed by farmers to participate in sub-projects, a reinforcement of the SPs’ human
resources had to be financed by the project and it was also decided to select and train relay
farmers to serve as intermediaries between the SPs’ agents and farmers groups. A total of
125 relay farmers were trained, equipped with bicycles and small equipment, and given
allowances to help convey extension messages to their peers. Similarly, as of 2013 the project
supported, in the form of a 100 percent subsidy the first year and 50 percent the second year,
the hiring by the WUAs of a technician (generally one of their members) to coordinate the
distribution of water and O&M works in their perimeter. Both systems proved successful,
although the continuation of the former could not be guaranteed after the end of the project.

36.      The last and most important single realization of the IWMP that necessitated the final
six month extension of the closing date and consumed two-thirds of the expenditure on
Component B (Irrigation Development), and 21 percent of total project cost, was the
construction of the weir and the feeder canal of the Ankaibe irrigation scheme in Sava region.
The Ankaibe irrigation scheme, of a total area of 2,100 ha, had been supplied by a pumping
station in the past and had been in disuse since the breakdown of that pumping station. The
construction of the Ankaibe weir and feeder canal was not originally included in the project
since it was decided at preparation stage to focus on already functional irrigation schemes. Its
inclusion in the project was decided in early 2012 as a response to the low disbursement rate
of Component B (10 percent at the end of 2011), due to various delays in studies, beneficiaries’

    BRL in Itasy and Andapa, GERCO in Marovoay and Lac Alaotra. Total SP cost amounted to Ar 7.2 billion,
i.e. 10 percent of total project costs.

contribution mobilization (especially before the introduction of the MAPER in 2011, see
above), tenders, and works.

37.     Government commitment was rated Satisfactory in ISRs until October 2011 and
Moderately Satisfactory from then onwards. Overall, as a result of the project being
implemented through GoM’s structure, GoM’s ownership of the project appears to have been
satisfactory both at central and regional levels. Similarly, the many participatory approaches
that were implemented for all activities, through the use of tools formulated and validated in a
participatory manner (WMPs, WDPs and SDPs, PCs, etc.) and the creation and/or
strengthening of a myriad of effective beneficiaries’ groups (WUAs, sub-project groups,
GGDTs, GOGEs, etc.), resulted in a level of ownership among the project beneficiaries
evaluated as Satisfactory. Finally, the Government contributed a substantial budget towards
the implementation of the Ankaibe weir and feeder canal resettlement action plan.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.     M&E was the responsibility of a dedicated unit in the CelCo. The project M&E system
was downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory in ISRs from end-2008 to end-2010 owing to
the prolonged difficulties the project encountered in establishing a logical sequence of
indicators that could be easily measured to assess results and ensuring consistency between the
reports produced by the project and the M&E manual. The M&E system rating was restored to
Moderately Satisfactory in March 2011, and remained so until the end of the project, on the
grounds that the results framework had been updated and the M&E system was reportedly
producing data needed to track progress, and the data was being used by project management.

39.      As already pointed out in section 2.1, the project M&E quality at entry was low and
that was only partially corrected later on with support from the Bank. The project M&E also
suffered from weak capacities that resulted in several shortfalls: (i) figures were gathered and
endorsed by the M&E unit without much questioning and double-checking, while some of
them obviously looked over-optimistic and were bound to attract skepticism (see discussion of
results indicators in Annex 2); (ii) the M&E system focused on gathering quantitative data in
terms of project outputs (monitoring) but largely failed to produce more qualitative data in
terms of project impact and sustainability (evaluation) that would have been useful throughout
the project life to possibly reorient some of the project activities.

40.     Two evaluations of project output and impact indicators had been planned at appraisal,
one at MTR and one at the end of the project, but only the latter was carried out (Altec 2014).
Deficient M&E did not permit a meaningful evaluation of outcomes at project closing.

2.4. Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Social and Environmental Safeguards

41.     The project had been categorized as a Category A project, since three of the project
sites were located in areas with globally important biodiversity resources. Five Safeguard
Policies were triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01); Natural Habitats (OP/BP
4.04); Forests (OP/BP 4.36); Pest Management (OP 4.09); and Involuntary Resettlement
(OP/BP 4.12). Overall safeguard compliance was rated either Moderately Satisfactory or
Satisfactory throughout the project life and was rated Satisfactory at the end of the project. It


                                              15
was noted that the project had made a significant effort to implement the safeguards action
plans agreed upon during the various implementation support missions. It was also noted that
the capacity of the project team to manage environment and social safeguard activities had
been strongly enhanced through clinics and on-the job-training, as was illustrated by the
successful formulation and implementation of Environment and Social Impact Assessments
and Resettlement Plans.

42.     It was noted during the preparation of the ICR that one of the target irrigation schemes
(Sahamaloto) was supplied by a dam of less than 15 m in height but of more than 3 million m3
in volume. Under the current interpretation of OP4.37 “Safety of dams,” the water volume of
this dam would lead to its classification as a large dam. The project did not undertake any
construction works on the dam itself but it rehabilitated an irrigation network of primary and
secondary channels, mostly dredging irrigation channels and reinforcing embankments, that is
dependent on the dam. Under the current definition of OP4.37, the policy should have been
triggered.11 Paragraph 8 and subsequent paragraphs of OP4.37 require an independent safety
review and if necessarily, other safety measures.

43.     The potential adverse environmental and social impacts of the rehabilitation works on
the primary and secondary channels were limited due to their localized, small scale and site-
specific nature. Although the project is rated as a Category A, the impacts observed during
regular supervision missions and managed on the Sahamaloto schemes are typical of category
B projects.

44.     During the ICR Review meeting, it was agreed that since the ongoing PURSAP project
would be financing follow-up activities on the same dam and the irrigation scheme, PURSAP
should trigger OP 4.37 “Safety of Dams.” This will be done through a Level 1 restructuring.
In parallel, the panel of dam experts required under OP4.37 (consisting of a geotechnical expert
and a dam structure/safety expert based on TORs approved by the Association) will be
established to review and assess the Sahamaloto dam. The said panel would identify measures,
if required, to comply with the OP, and those identified measures would then be agreed for
implementation under that project.

Financial Management.

45.     Financial management was rated Satisfactory during most of the project life and this
rating was confirmed by the last supervision mission of December 2014. An experienced
external financial management agency was hired from the outset, the project had a sound
manual for internal procedures, and an internal auditor was recruited in August 2011. These
three elements allowed management to considerably reduce fiduciary risk and to produce
timely and high quality financial reports.




11
   Paragraph 7 of OP4.37 indicates the types of existing dams which should trigger the policy, such as
"......where failure of the upstream dam could cause extensive damage to or failure of the new Bank funded
structure; and irrigation or water supply projects that will depend on the storage and operation of an
existing dam for their water supply, and could not function if the dam failed."



                                                   16
Procurement

46.     Procurement rating varied between Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory over the
project life and was synthetized as Satisfactory by the last supervision mission in December
2014. Although some difficulties were experienced, the project team, both at central and DRDR
level and with the support of the central administration, always reacted swiftly in solving
problems and improving procedures. The last supervision mission confirmed that all
procurement under the project had complied with the Bank’s rules and procedures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

47.      Most of the triggers for moving to the planned second phase of the APL program (see
section 1.2) have been met, at the exception of the establishment and operationalization of an
institutional mechanism for the funding of non-transferable irrigation infrastructure (FERHA).
Following the country’s return to constitutional order in early 2014, it was decided jointly with
the Ministry of Agriculture to continue supporting the sector with a combination of IPF
operations, one of which is focused on a more sustainable watershed and irrigation
management and the other supports the development of agricultural value chains and land
titling. Both operations are under preparation and build on the lessons emerging of the BVPI
and similar projects in other countries.

48.      In the short run, some achievements of IWMP are in urgent need of consolidation:
(i) all IWMP supported WUAs need continued assistance to gain autonomy and become fully
viable entities; (ii) the outstanding works on the Ankaibe perimeter must be finalized and
support extended to WUAs and farmers in order to derive the full benefits of the Ankaibe
diversion weir and feeder canal investment; (iii) in the perimeters where the works planned in
the PCs have not been, or only partially, implemented under IWMP12, an approach has to be
urgently defined in order to meet GoM’s commitment and avoid losing the beneficiaries’ trust;
(iv) for IWMP soil conservation investments (afforestation, improved pasture, etc.), long-term
arrangements have to be developed with local populations in order to ensure the maintenance
and sustainability of the investments; (v) continued assistance should be extended to the five
IWMP supported guichets fonciers to ensure that they effectively start delivering land
certificates; (vi) the monitoring of paddy yields on the irrigation schemes that benefited from
IWMP must be continued; and (vii) the FERHA must be operationalized.

49.     Some of the above activities will be supported by a Bank funded emergency operation
that was launched in September 2014, the Projet d’Urgence pour la Sécurité Alimentaire et la
Protection Sociale (PURSAPS, Emergency Food Security and Social Protection Project,
US$65 million); its IWMP-like component (about US$24.5 million) is being implemented in
eight regions including the four regions that benefited from IWMP. PURSAPS is planned to
help consolidate IWMP’s results through: (i) continuation of assistance to the IWMP supported
WUAs whose PCs have not yet completed their 5 year cycle; and (ii) implementation of some


12
  This is in particular the case for the sectors 4 and 5 of Marovoay, where most of the works planned in the
PCs have not been implemented and where PURSAPS does not plan to take over, and Sahamaloto, where
PURSAPS plans to finance only a minor part of the outstanding works (see Annex 2 Appendix 2).

Annex 2 Appendix 2).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

50.      Rating: High. As already seen in section 1.1, the PDO was – and still is – highly
relevant. Over the past decades, increases in rice yields have not kept up with the high rate of
population growth, putting pressure on land and other resources and explaining in part the
persistent high rates of poverty. Paddy production continues to be characterized by extremely
low levels of productivity, resulting from a combination of factors, including limited uptake of
improved technology, land tenure insecurity, lack of access to credit, inadequate storage
facilities, and deficient transport infrastructure. In addition, most irrigation schemes are far
from being fully operational, often due to high sedimentation and lack of maintenance. The
IWMP’s integrated approach encompassing agricultural intensification and better water users’
organization in the irrigation schemes and SLM activities in the uplands was and remains
therefore fully justified.

51.     Similarly, most of the project’s major design features and implementation modalities
as they were defined at appraisal and as they evolved over the project life were highly relevant.
In particular, the choice of implementing the project through the GoM’s structure (Ministry of
Agriculture’s CelCo at national level and DRDRs at regional level) was arguably the most
risky and ambitious in terms of capacity building and ownership and chances of sustainability,
and it proved to be a success with adequate assistance (TAs, SPs and external financial
management agency). The highly participative way the project was implemented is also
considered a success to be built on in future operations. The introduction of SPs and MAPER
were decisive in accelerating implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

52.      Several key development indicators were reportedly achieved at project closure, but
due to the weakness of the project M&E framework, many of these indicators are marred with
uncertainty while others had had a somewhat evolving definition and/or target values. The ICR
authors therefore had to revisit many of the final indicator values announced by the project (see
Annex 2) and the assessment of PDO achievement is based on the new values obtained. When
targets were reduced in the course of project implementation without convincing explanation
provided in the Restructuring Paper, the ICR team considered both the original and the final
values and gave more weight to the earlier. In addition, the authors had to interpret the set of
results used to assess the PDO using all the information available knowing that, as noted above,
the M&E system largely failed to produce more qualitative data in terms of project impact and
sustainability.

Achievement of PDO in irrigation activities: Rating: Modest.

53.      The objective was to establish a viable basis for irrigated agriculture in four main
irrigation sites. Basically, the foundation for this objective is rooted in these four specific
outputs under the project: (a) improved irrigation and drainage service; (b) incremental number



                                              18
of farmers adopting new technologies; (c) increased area cultivated during the dry season;
(d) increased area cultivated with non-rice crops (diversification). In terms of viable operation,
there are three key actions: (a) operational CSAs linking farmers to service providers;
(b) WUAs operational and providing for O&M; and (c) establishment of regional FERHA for
O&M. The results of the watershed management component were also to have an impact on
irrigation scheme viability by reducing the maintenance requirements (desilting).

54.      Although the average yields in the project area have undoubtedly increased, the extent
of this increase is likely to be lower than reported by the M&E system. The farm level financial
returns from the intensification packages disseminated by the project on the irrigated schemes
were not sufficiently attractive to ensure a widespread uptake of the new technologies, as
demonstrated by the high drop-out rate between Year 1 and Year 3 of the subprojects cycle as
subsidies were phased out and further confirmed by the financial analyses included in this ICR
(section 3.3). Farmers and technicians in all three regions visited by the ICR mission (Itasy,
Boeny and Lac Alaotra) concurred that 25 to 40 percent of the irrigated schemes area is now
cultivated using the technologies introduced by the project, with the exception of fertilizers.
The average yields that the project claims to have achieved were therefore applied to 30 percent
of the schemes area whereas it was assumed that the remaining 70 percent of the schemes still
apply traditional technologies and thus have unchanged yields. Under this scenario, the average
yield at the end of the project would be 3.4 tons/ha, giving a 41 percent achievement of the
objective of an increase from 2.7 to 4.4 tons/ha and a 26 percent increase in absolute terms.
The result is certainly not negligible but remains modest compared to the original objective.

55.      Moreover, the original focus on crop diversification and increase in cropping intensity
was lost in the course of project implementation. Since this is an important component of
irrigated agriculture viability in the context of an ever increasing fragmentation of the land,
this part of the “viable basis for irrigated agriculture” is certainly missing.

56.     The increase in the area with reliable water control was estimated by this ICR to be of
the order of 7,500 ha over a baseline at project start of about 5,000 ha (see Annex 2). This is a
50 percent achievement against the original target value which is substantial.

57.     The number of beneficiaries remains difficult to assess since farmers had access to
various types of benefits that were loosely interrelated. Assuming an average area of 0.9 ha per
farmer, the beneficiaries of improved irrigation and drainage services would be 8,300. There
were 12,331 beneficiaries of intensification subprojects on irrigated areas. These numbers are
modest to substantial when compared with the total number of water users in the four sites
(22,790). No explanation was provided in the PAD with regard to the original target for the
entire project (30,000) but it is clear that the target related to irrigated agriculture could not
have been higher than the total number of farmers in the four sites.

58.     Regarding the requirements for viable operations, the five ASCs were established but
their impact remained limited and was mostly focused on collecting and making available to
farmers input and output prices in their respective region and assisting the farmers in organizing
themselves in order to access the project services. Results in terms of linking farmers to
suppliers, produce collectors, and finance institutions were lower than planned. The irrigation
scheme management by WUAs, although significantly strengthened by the project as
demonstrated by the 30-fold increase of irrigation service fees collected, remains fragile and
requires further support to be consolidated in a financially viable undertaking. O&M charges


                                              19
recovered in 2014 amounted to 53 percent of the Ar 540 million target – which may just have
been over-ambitious (see Annex 2 for details). The FERHA was not established at project
closing.13

Achievement of PDO in watershed management activities: Rating: Modest.

59.     The objective was to establish a viable basis for natural resources management in the
surrounding watersheds of the four irrigation sites. The achievement of this PDO is premised
on the following main actions: (a) development of Watershed Management Plans and related
Sub-watershed Management Plans; (b) erosion control and reforestation; and (c) beneficiaries
adopting Sustainable Land Management practices. In terms of viable operation, five Guichets
Fonciers were to be strengthened to secure with land certificates the investments made in the
watershed areas.

60.     The main outcome as indicated is area under SLM practices. The original target from
the PAD is not known in the absence of a baseline, and the final achievement rate varies from
59 percent against final target value set at second restructuring to 147 percent against the target
value set at first restructuring. This achievement is very modest in absolute value compared to
the watershed total area (less than 5 percent). In addition, the drop-out rate for under-cover
cultivation sub-projects on uplands was 100 percent between Year 1 and Year 3, making the
lack of interest of farmers for this SLM technique evident. The area under vegetation cover
which was the second key indicator in the PAD was dropped after the first restructuring and
the original target is not known either.

61.     Based on the revised values estimated by the authors for the intermediate outcome
indicators (see Annex 2), two of the six component C outputs were achieved. Another two were
achieved with qualification, meaning that although the actual value meets or exceeds the target
the results are to be considered with caution and remain fragile. The last two outputs were not
achieved when compared to the original targets from the PAD.

62.     Five guichets fonciers were established and supported as planned, but apart that of
Marovoay that was also supported by the Programme de Lutte Anti-Erosive (PLAE, Anti-
Erosion Program), they were not in a position to deliver land certificates until after seven years
of project implementation due to delays in the acquisition of aerial photography. It appears that
some of the communes involved in the project are not maintaining their guichet foncier any
longer, meaning that the investment in terms of capacity building may be partially lost. Hence
the achievement here should also be considered as modest.

63.     Overall, there are only modest indications that a viable basis was established for
sustainable watershed management and maintenance of the erosion control and afforestation
works implemented by the project.




13
  The project supported the revision of the Law 90-016 regarding the management, maintenance and police
of the irrigation networks (République de Madagascar 1990). The new Law 14-042 that in particular provides
for the establishment of FERHA at national and regional levels was finally adopted by the Parliament in
December 2014 and promulgated in January 2015 (République de Madagascar 2015).


                                                  20
64.     Overall achievement of the PDO is therefore rated as Modest: “a viable basis for
irrigated agriculture and natural resources management” was established in terms of
validated approaches and tools (project management through GoM structure, WMPs, WDPs
and SDPs, PCs, MAPER, relay farmers, etc.) but more work remains to be done in terms of
adapted technical packages including diversification. The same rating applies to the GEO based
on the assessment of Component C outcomes.

3.3 Efficiency

Project costs

65.     The project used 96 percent of IDA resources and 89 percent of GEF resources. The
contribution by beneficiaries was estimated at Ar 4.2 billion – about US$2 million, (details in
Annex 3), i.e. 45 percent of their originally planned contribution. This is due to the fact that
the project did not eventually finance sub-projects at downstream value chain level (storage,
processing, marketing), for which it was originally planned that beneficiaries would contribute
over US$ 1 million, and that the project financed at 100 percent a number of non-transferable
infrastructures that were not included in the initial project design, amongst which the Ankaibe
weir.

66.     The distribution of actual spending across components was slightly different from that
originally planned (table 5). Principally due to three time extended project duration,
Component D (Project Management), with 28 percent of total project costs, exceeded its
originally planned share, mainly at the expense of Component A (Development of Commercial
Agriculture) and Component B (Irrigation Development).

67.     The distribution of actual spending within Component B (irrigation) also differed
greatly from what was planned at appraisal. Various delays in studies, beneficiaries’
contribution mobilization (especially before the introduction of the MAPER in 2011, see
section 2.2), tenders and works resulted in only a minor proportion of the rehabilitation works
planned to be implemented. In particular, the level of financial realization of the rehabilitation
works planned in feasibility studies is estimated at 12 percent for the four regions, Ankaibe
excluded (see Annex 2 Appendix 2 and Annex 3 for details). As a result, while it was planned
that the works on the Sahamaloto perimeter would represent two-thirds of total rehabilitation



                                                   21
investments and that the average cost per hectare would be about US$ 700, the rehabilitation
works on all the project perimeters, Ankaibe excluded, only accounted for one-third of
Component B infrastructure investments, at an average cost of at US$ 175/ha14. The works on
the Ankaibe weir and feeder canal that were not originally included in the project made up for
the remaining two-thirds, allowing the financial envelope for irrigation rehabilitation to be used
up at the very end of the project.

Financial analysis at beneficiary level

68.     Despite being repeatedly emphasized by the supervision missions as a critical issue that
warranted more in-depth analysis, the feasibility and profitability of the technology packages
that were promoted by the project were apparently never given much attention by the project
M&E unit. The need for more analysis was especially pronounced with regards to additional
labor and financing requirements. Most of the financial analyses that were carried out in the
irrigated rice intensification sub-project applications displayed a Value-Cost Ratio (VCR)
around 2 or below. This is confirmed by calculations based on two “standard” SRI and SRA
models (see Annex 3) using quite optimistic yields (6.3 tons/ha for SRA and 8.0 tons/ha for
SRI) and post-harvest loss allowance (10 percent only) and not taking into account equipment
amortization, for which VCRs of 1.9 were obtained. A widely held convention is that in
“normal” risks situations, a VCR greater than 2 is necessary to provide sufficient incentives
for naturally risk-adverse farmers to adopt fertilizer and in especially risky production
environments, a minimum VCR of 3 to 4 may be needed.15 While profitable in theory, the
packages promoted by the project, were therefore unlikely to be attractive to farmers in general,
and even less attractive in the areas affected by poor water control. This, combined with
possible labor shortage and lack of access to credit, certainly accounts for the very high drop-
out rates observed between sub-project cycles, as the element of subsidy decreased (see
section 2.1), and for the widespread observation that follower farmers around sub-projects
generally adopted only the “soft” elements of the packages (such as earlier and in-row
transplanting, etc.) and not the fertilizer element.

69.      Drop-out rates were even worse for intensification sub-projects on uplands (mostly
under vegetative cover cultivation, see section 2.1), reflecting here again the lack of
attractiveness of the proposed packages to farmers in the absence of a subsidy element.


Economic analysis

70.    Economic rates of return (ERR) and Net Present Values (NPV) were computed for
each region (table 6), as was done at appraisal, using a slightly different methodology to
account for the variations between the plans that were made at appraisal and actual
implementation (see details in Annex 3). In particular, while at appraisal benefits arising from
investments on the uplands and reduced siltation were taken into account, only the incremental


14
   Or about US$ 400/ha if only areas with reliable water control are taken into account. By way of
comparison, irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation projects currently funded by the African Development
Bank in Madagascar have a cost per hectare of US$ 2,000 to US$ 3,000 and favor concrete coated primary
canals on durability grounds.

                                                  22
paddy production in irrigated areas was considered here, in view of the limited results achieved
on the uplands. Consequently, only the costs directly related to investments in the irrigated
areas were taken into account in this ICR’s economic analysis. Also, whereas project benefits
and costs were computed on a 20 year period in the economic analysis at appraisal, a 10 year
lifespan for project investments was used here, to reflect the much lower intensity of the
rehabilitation works that were actually carried out.

71.     As regards paddy yields, the same assumption used to assess the PDO achievement
(section 3.2) was applied: the average yields that the project claims to have achieved were
applied to 30 percent of the schemes area whereas it was assumed that the remaining 70 percent
of the schemes still apply traditional technologies and thus have unchanged yields. For
Marovoay, the average yield announced by the project (2.6 tons/ha) was applied to 100 percent
of the area as it seems realistic and was confirmed during discussions with beneficiaries. For
Ankaibe, it was assumed that yields similar to those on other Sava region IWMP rehabilitated
schemes would be obtained on 100 percent of the area after the completion of the rehabilitation
works by PURSAPS in 2016. The cost of the additional works needed to make Ankaibe
perimeter fully usable was factored in.

72.     It is interesting to note that though it was not planned at appraisal, the Ankaibe
diversion weir and feeder canal construction boasts the highest ERR and enables the project as
a whole to display an ERR of 15 percent, just higher than the overall project ERR that had been
calculated at appraisal. Moreover, the Ankaibe ERR proves to be very robust against lower
than expected yields: even if the average yield on the Ankaibe scheme were not to exceed the
baseline yield of 2.5 tons/ha that was observed in the Sava region at the onset of the project,
the Ankaibe ERR would still be high at 21 percent, and the overall project ERR above the
opportunity cost of capital at 12 percent. Therefore, not only has the Ankaibe diversion weir
and feeder canal construction allowed the project to use up its rehabilitation works credits and
to gain considerable visibility, but it has also contributed much to its overall economic
profitability.

73.   Given the limited results in terms of profitability for farmers and the fragility of the
economic viability of most of the irrigation schemes, as reflected by the 7 percent ERR without
Ankaibe, overall efficiency is rated as Modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

74.     Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory, based on relevance rated as High, PDO and GEO
achievement rated as Modest and efficiency rated as Modest. There is a disconnect here with
the rating of the last ISR (Satisfactory) that was based on the low quality indicator values
provided by the M&E unit.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

75.    The proportion of women among the beneficiaries of the sub-projects financed under
Components A (Development of Commercial Agriculture) and C (Watershed Development)
was relatively high at 44 and 42 percent respectively, and constant through cycles and
throughout the project life. In addition, women represented 27 percent of the WUA members
supported by the project (details in Annex 2). However, no gender oriented activities were
planned under the project, which was a lacuna that should be filled in future similar operations.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

76.     An evaluation by the beneficiaries of the project was carried out by a consultant in
December 2014 (SAVAIVO 2014), based on a survey of the participants in 301 intensification,
erosion control and afforestation sub-projects (i.e. about 8 percent of total sub-projects under
Components A (Development of Commercial Agriculture) and C (Watershed Development)).
A vast majority of the beneficiaries (82 percent) indicated that the project had contributed
greatly to the resolution of their production constraints and confirmed the validity of the
watershed approach. 85 percent rated the technology packages promoted by the project as very
appropriate. Only 33 percent agreed with the financing modalities, the main causes of
disagreement being the matching grant declining pattern and the sometimes late availability of
funds in relation to the cropping calendar. The support services provided by the SPs were
judged of high quality by 91 percent of the surveyed OPs, although the insufficient availability
of the support agents and low frequency of visits were raised as important issues. Another
important issue raised by the beneficiaries was their own involvement, perceived as
insufficient, in the identification of their sub-project and the elaboration of its budget. Overall,
around 60 percent of beneficiaries indicated they were generally satisfied with the project.

77.      As regards project impact, 41 percent of the respondents reported a moderate impact
on productivity. The non-adequate control of water was reported as a persistent issue, with only
77 percent of the beneficiaries in the irrigation areas judging their infrastructure as functional
at the end of the project against 68 percent before the project. The main changes brought about
by the project were felt to be on beneficiaries’ capacities (83 percent of respondents), followed
by general standards of living (73 percent), household income (72 percent), productivity
(56 percent) and food security (53 percent). Only 24 percent of beneficiaries reported greatly
improved access to credit at the end of the project. The level of definitive appropriation of the
new technologies was estimated at around 70 percent, although the exact impact of the often
incriminating high input prices versus beneficiaries’ limited financial capacities on the
continuation of the use of the technology package after the end of the sub-project remained
unclear. The project ripple effect among neighboring farmers was estimated as important by
39 percent of the beneficiaries for intensification sub-projects and 26 percent for anti-erosion
and afforestation sub-projects.



                                               24
78.     The surveyed beneficiaries’ main recommendations for future similar operations
included the need for: (i) more intensive support to the OPs during and after the project in order
to further enhance management and organizational capacities; (ii) a more participatory
approach to ensure that sub-projects really respond to local priorities; (iii) a better assessment
of beneficiaries’ financial capacities; and (iv) greater attention to increased access to credit.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

79.     Rating: High. All evaluation reports16 concur to emphasize the five main weaknesses
of the project in terms of the sustainability of its development outcomes.

     (i)     The WUAs that were supported by the project have not reached a level of maturity
             that would enable them to take over the O&M of the rehabilitated schemes 17 .
             Consequently, the amounts collected as water use fees and GER funds will not be
             adequate to cover O&M needs and this suggests a very substantial risk that the
             rehabilitation investments may not be maintained, all the more since they were
             mostly low intensity works thus likely to be subject to relatively rapid degradation.
             The fact that the FERHA, supposed to take care of non-transferable infrastructure
             maintenance, is not operational yet is another source of concern.

     (ii)    There is also a substantial risk that in the absence of sustainable, affordable and
             accessible financing mechanisms, part of the technology packages that have been
             promoted may be partially dropped, in particular the mineral fertilizer component.
             This would cause the yields to go down to some intermediate level between the
             baseline and the sub-project level and the reduced profitability would in turn
             hamper further the water use fees recovery.

     (iii)   In most afforestation and pasture improvement sites, the project came to an end
             without having clarified the responsibilities for the maintenance and future
             exploitation of the newly vegetated areas.18

     (iv)    As mentioned earlier, one of the main achievements of the project was to
             considerably enhance the technical capacities of the DRDR in the four regions that
             participated. The DRDR supervised the field activities implemented by the SPs to
             establish and consolidate the various OPs both in irrigated areas and on the uplands.


16
   Altec 2014 and MINAGRI 2014.
17
   The AFD funded BV-Lac project in the Lac Alaotra region has demonstrated that a much longer support
period, of 10 to 15 years, is needed before a WUA can be considered as standing a reasonable chance of
being sustainable, with in particular water use charges recovery rates above 80 percent.
18
   For example, about 1,000 ha were afforested in the Sahamaloto watershed on lands belonging to the State,
under an agreement between the Regional Environment Directorate and the IWMP. The works were carried
out by a myriad of Groupements de Gestion Durable des Terres (GGDT, sustainable land management
associations) that were also in charge of maintaining the plantations during their first year. It is likely that
most GGDTs were mostly constituted of poor people looking for an immediate income and not interested in
longer-term benefits. If longer-term arrangements are not established between the Regional Environment
Directorate and local populations for the maintenance and future exploitation of these plantations, there is a
very substantial risk that they may not be protected and may disappear soon.


                                                     25
           However, the DRDR do not have the resources necessary to conduct the very
           demanding field work that was done by the SPs despite having been allocated
           additional means by the Ministry of Agriculture. More time was required for the
           SPs to bring the OPs to a more advanced level of autonomy at the end of the project
           than they actually were and to leave them under the more distant supervision of the
           DRDR. The same applies to the ASCs and the relay farmers that were identified
           and trained by the project to help promote the improved technologies amongst their
           peers.

   (v)     Finally the uneven but generally low involvement of communal authorities in the
           project also hampers its sustainability. Had they been more strongly engaged and
           more committed, the Communes could have continued supporting some of the
           project activities after its end (support to WUAs and GGDTs, clarification of
           responsibilities for the O&M of the various investments, extension, land tenure
           securisation through the maintenance and operation of the guichets fonciers, etc.).

80.     As mentioned in section 2.5, the PURSAPS will take over some of the tasks needed to
consolidate IWMP’s achievements. However, it appears that consolidation of IWMP’s
investments in afforestation and pasture improvement was not included in PURSAPS’
mandate, and even for the activities that were, the extent to which PURSAPS will be able to
allocate resources to IWMP’s results consolidation is not clear yet.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

81.      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. As seen in section 2.1, the project preparation
team made commendable use of rich analyses of previous investment operations in the
irrigation sector in Madagascar and the reasons for their historically disappointing performance
and the IWMP was anchored into GoM’s new strategy for irrigation and watershed
development. The choice that was made at design stage to implement the project through the
GoM structure, reinforced with TA, proved very relevant. However, some important
shortcomings of project preparation were very prejudicial to the attainment of the PDO:
(i) preparation overlooked the risk of somehow reverting, during implementation, to some of
the shortcomings that had characterized previous irrigation development experiences, in
particular too much focus on technical messages with little attention paid to the economic
constraints farmers are facing, little effort to differentiate between farmers, insufficient
emphasis on critical issues such as land tenure security, access to credit and markets, rural
roads, diversification, and human and material resources needed to accompany project
beneficiaries on the long-run; and (ii) more importantly, by failing to produce a quality result
framework, preparation failed to put the project on a sound track in terms of M&E.

(b) Quality of Supervision

82.    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Supervision was regular and constructive and
helped the project to make substantial progress in a difficult environment. The difficulties



                                             26
included a 15 month disbursement freeze and high political instability during the transition
period until the elections which were eventually held during the final months of the project. In
particular, supervision initiated a number of strategic decisions that proved critical to
facilitating project implementation (see section 2.2). These decisions included the introduction
of the MAPER concept to lift the deadlock created by the original beneficiary compulsory
20 percent upfront contribution to the works, and the recruitment of SPs with international
experience and the use of multiannual PCs to turn the project performance around when it was
coming out of the disbursement freeze period, having lost all the trust of its intended
beneficiaries. Moreover, the choice, in the final years of the project, to use a significant share
of the project resources to build one single structure – the Ankaibe diversion weir and feeder
canal – was a good decision as demonstrated by the results of the economic analyses presented
in this ICR. The team also had an enormous amount of extra work beyond simple supervision
due to the delayed approval of the GEF grant, which led to the need for a separate approval
process for the latter and for two subsequent restructurings of the IDA-funded project –
although the two projects were supposed to be fully blended.

83.      Supervision however missed the opportunity to improve the component design. In
particular, important issues such as diversification, value chain approach and land tenure
securisation appear to have been largely sacrificed on the altar of implementation
simplification and disbursement acceleration due to the delays the project had accumulated.
Supervision also missed the opportunity to improve the project M&E, in particular in its
evaluation dimension, leading to a rather uniform and top-down approach during project
implementation and a lack of impact and sustainability indicators at the end of the project (see
section 2.3). Follow up on the MTR findings in this regard was insufficient. Inadequate
attention was also paid to the quality of the monitoring and final assessment of the various
project indicators by the M&E unit, resulting in a substantial number of indicators being largely
over-estimated and an over-optimistic rating of project performance (leading to a disconnect
between the final ISR and ICR PDO achievement ratings). Finally, supervision also missed the
opportunity to trigger the dam safety safeguard in relation to the Sahamaloto dam.19

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

84.    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory, on the basis of the above and taking also into
account the fact that the very late entry into force of the GEF grant, approved two years after
the project had started, created a considerable amount of disruption in the project
implementation (see section 2.2).

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance




19
  Note that at the time of project approval, the project design didn’t meet the requirements for OP4.37 to
be triggered. OP4.37 has since been refined (in 2011 and 2012).



                                                    27
85.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, the GoM demonstrated relatively high
ownership and commitment to the successful implementation of the IWMP. In particular,
adequate human resources were assigned to the CelCo and the project always received high
management support when needed. However, the GoM’s performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory in light of the political instability that triggered a prolonged disbursement freeze
in 2009-2010 and in light of the lack of additional resources extended to the DRDRs at the end
of the project to enable them to continue, consolidate, and possibly expand the project activities.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

86.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The project was implemented in a very dynamic way
by the CelCo, the Director of which remained the same throughout the project life. Project
implementation through the CelCo and DRDRs within the Ministry of Agriculture, assisted by
TA at the national and regional levels, SPs at field level and an external financial management
agency, proved to be a very efficient arrangement that was instrumental in taking the project
to its end despite the difficult times it went through. In general, the CelCo reacted promptly to
the supervision missions’ recommendations. Financial management and procurement were
rated as Satisfactory and Moderately Satisfactory throughout most of the project life, both at
central and DRDR levels. In addition, the project produced a wealth of documents, reports,
leaflets, videos, and other media to publicize its methodology and achievements. However, it
failed to produce quality monitoring of the project indicators and impact and sustainability
assessments, hence the Moderately Satisfactory rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

87.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory, based on the above considerations.

6. Lessons Learned

88.      The project did not achieve all its planned outcomes but built a strong basis on which
new operations can be (and are being indeed) prepared. The comprehensive nature of the
project design and the introduction of innovations for Madagascar (e.g. adoption of new
technologies through a phasing out productive investment, performance contract for
management of irrigation schemes) imply that achievement of objectives relied on the
repetitive testing of approaches, intensive demonstration and capacity building.

89.      Regarding institutional arrangements, the project demonstrated that it is possible, and
recommended, to rely on the Ministry of Agriculture’s structure, reinforced with adequate TA
and the support of an external financial management agency, to implement agricultural projects.
The use of SPs providing a cadre of experienced field technicians working directly with the
beneficiaries proved instrumental in injecting momentum into project implementation and
illustrating the way such a project should be implemented at field level. However, GoM should
commit greater human and material resources to DRDRs during and after project
implementation, and SP support should be designed in the future in such a way as to ensure a
progressive phasing out of their intervention while the capacity of DRDRs and of the
beneficiary OPs increases. The Project has built the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture’s
structures both at the central and regional levels to allow them to ensure overall responsibility
for project coordination and management. IWMP’s institutional and implementation



                                               28
arrangements have now served as a model for other Bank-funded projects. Other development
partners (AFD, JICA, etc.) are also considering using the same institutional arrangements for
their future operations.

90.     The project also demonstrated the validity of the integrated watershed approach and
the strong interest that beneficiaries take in that approach. It successfully tested a series of tools
like WMPs, WDPs, SDPs, etc. However, project results suggest that erosion control/soil
conservation interventions in uplands should be allocated greater resources in order to be
implemented at scale in order to demonstrate their impact on the downstream areas. In
particular, erosion control/soil conservation measures (lavaka stabilization, afforestation,
improved pasture management, etc.) should be carried out in a much more systematically and
on a larger scale, with the full involvement of the other administrations concerned (Ministry of
Environment), and ensuring sustainability through formal maintenance and exploitation
arrangements with local populations.

91.     As IWMP’s comprehensive design was geared towards tackling multiple
constraints in a simultaneous fashion within a given watershed, the project ensured that
project activities were indeed selected in a manner that ensures that the whole of these
actions was more than the sum of the individual parts. Doing so required that the selection
of project activities was not just be based on the merits of the individual activity on its own,
but on its contribution to the wider agenda pursued by the project in a given watershed.

92.     The multiannual PC approach and the MAPER combined with the formalization of
Dina proved to be useful tools to generate ownership and mobilize the irrigation scheme users
and to consolidate their WUAs. This requires a progressive implementation of rehabilitation
works which in turn result in a progressive enhancement of the irrigation and drainage service.

93.     A clear and objective measurement of the quality of irrigation and drainage service
based on objective criteria is warranted in order to closely monitor the service improvements
brought by the rehabilitation works. Technical and financial norms related to water control and
durability should be defined in this regard by the Direction du Génie Rural (Rural Works
Directorate).

94.   Implementation of the rehabilitation works would be eased if flexible multiannual
framework contracts could be used to reduce procurement delays and lower construction cost.

95.      In terms of agricultural intensification, the main lesson of the project may be
synthetized as “less emphasis on inputs, enhanced and more adapted support.” Intensification
packages have impressive results when subsidized but they need to be tailored to better respond
to the actual farmers’ needs. The matching grant approach proved less efficient for agricultural
intensification with the exception of its initial demonstration effect. The economy of the
targeted farms should be analyzed in a holistic way in order to formulate more adaptive and
differentiated support strategies that take into account the constraints the various categories of
farmers face (labor and finance availability, technical capacity, land tenure, level of water
control, etc.). The ratio of farmers per extension agents need to be reduced. Their reach can be
usefully increased by using relay farmers and technicians recruited within the OPs. OPs
(WUAs, etc.) need to be accompanied in the long run. Commercial farmers and those having




                                                29
the potential to become commercial farmers should be supported in accessing credit and
improving marketing.

96.      WUAs have been established as credible partners of the Government in ensuring
sustainable irrigation management. The empowerment of WUAs in taking charge of
management, operations and maintenance of irrigation systems was defined in a manner
that put WUAs truly in the driver’s seat, while at the same time ensuring that the interests
of all farmers, including tenants, are properly represented. The project was instrumental
in updating the irrigation related legal framework with the aim to ensure that participation
of tenants in the management, operation and maintenance of irrigation systems is effective.
Longer term support is definitely required to ensure their long term viability. Five years is a
bare minimum to seriously consolidate these organizations and set them on a viable path.

97.   In a context of an ever increasing fragmentation of land in irrigated areas, a strong
emphasis should be put on agricultural intensification and diversification in uplands.

98.     Communes should be engaged on a systematic way (support to OPs, conflict resolution
and clarification of responsibilities for the O&M of the various investments, extension, land
tenure management, etc.), incentivized and held accountable for fulfilling their commitments.

99.     Land tenure management must be built in as an essential part of any similar project in
the future. Tangible results have to be achieved.

100. Future projects should also be more gender sensitive in order to draw on the generally
observed dynamism of women and women associations in soil conservation, intensification,
diversification, marketing, and processing activities.

101. More attention has to be paid to establishing an adequate M&E system that is able to
define and correctly monitor useful output and outcome indicators and that does not neglect
the evaluation aspect, in order to provide project management with impact and sustainability
assessments that may induce shifts in strategies and resources during the project life.

102. The CelCo of PN-BVPI should play a greater role in coordinating the various initiatives
in the field of integrated watershed management, including those being implemented outside
the umbrella of the PN-BVPI, and ensuring that experiences are shared and positive results are
capitalized upon.

103. Last but not least, greater attention must be paid to transport infrastructure and GoM
should ensure that any zone where a project such as IWMP is implemented has an acceptable
road and feeder road network that does not negatively affect the terms of trade farmers face.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

104. In its comments, the implementing agency highlighted the challenges faced during
project implementation due to the political instability and disbursement freeze. These resulted
in dropping some important activities – notably the support to diversification – in favor of


                                             30
greater simplicity which was necessary in the given conditions to accelerate disbursement. The
strengths of the project, including safeguards and fiduciary processes, need to be emphasized
as much as its weaknesses. Sustainability suffered from the absence of APL Phase 2. Overall,
the client considers that this project deserves a Satisfactory rating (see details under Annex 7).

(b) Cofinanciers

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

106. An evaluation regarding of the Irrigation and Watershed Management National
Program including the IDA/GEF-funded project object of this ICR as well as two AFD-funded
projects was conducted in 2014-2015. The findings of this evaluation are detailed under
Annex 8 and are fully consistent with the conclusions of this ICR.

Annex 2. Project Outcomes and Outputs by Component

Discussion of Program and PDO Level Indicators

1.      The project M&E suffered from rather low quality at entry that was not fully corrected
later on despite two rounds of improvement (restructurings 1 and 2). In particular, as shown in
table 2.1 below, a large number of the program and PDO level results indicators defined at
restructuring in 2011 and 2012 did not encompass enough the notions of impact and
sustainability but were rather somehow redundant with the component outputs indicators (and
in some cases between themselves).

  However, statistics provided by the Observatoire du Riz (paddy and rice price observatory at Prime
Minister’s Office level) indicate that the price effect may have been limited, paddy prices having varied little
over 2011-2014 (intra-annual variations were important, but not inter-annual variations).

4.      Although most of the key development indicators were reportedly achieved at project
closure (table 2.4), some of these indicators are marred with uncertainty and others have had a
somewhat evolving definition and/or target values. These M&E issues cast some doubts over
the reported achievement.

      5.       Program level indicator 1: Average yield of irrigated rice in project-rehabilitated
      irrigation sites: 4.4 mt/ha. Degree of target achievement: 41%. The average yields that the
      project claims to have achieved are, in all regions but Boeny, extremely high given the
      relatively low level of technology most farmers in the participating schemes are still using.
      While yields observed on intensification sub-projects (table 2.5) sound realistic and are
      consistent with anecdotal evidence gathered during field visits, yields outside the sub-projects
      in all sites but Marovoay (Boeny) appear to be over-estimated, especially in view of the fact
      that not all farmers on the irrigation schemes have adopted the new technologies demonstrated
      in the sub-projects (and when they have, it is in most cases without the fertilizer component).



      21
           Baseline and original target are a weighted average of the site specific target yields provided in the PAD.

The farm level financial returns from the intensification packages disseminated by the project
on the irrigated schemes and on the watershed areas were not sufficiently attractive to ensure
a widespread uptake of the new technologies, as demonstrated by the high drop-out rate
between Year 1 and Year 3 of the subprojects cycle as subsidies were phased out and further
confirmed by the financial analyses included in this ICR. In addition, all the rehabilitation
works that were planned could not be fully completed (see Appendix 2), leaving the irrigation
and drainage services below the quality standard required to allow the adoption of the full
intensification packages by the farmers on the entirety of the irrigation schemes area. It is
doubtful that yields could go up from about 3.1 mt/ha to 5.1 mt/ha on average (in the three
regions excluding Boeny) with such limited use of fertilizer and average rehabilitation costs of
US$ 175/ha only. In Boeny the data looks more realistic.

6.      However, the ICR mission could not identify a priori any methodological shortcoming
that could have led to over-estimated yields, to the extent that the guidelines that were
elaborated by the project to measure paddy yields were applied correctly22. It will be important
to continue monitoring the yields on the schemes that benefited from the IWMP as the results
will necessarily influence the design of any similar future operation.

7.       According to the project management, the reasons accounting for the lower yields
observed in Boeny (Marovoay scheme) were threefold: (i) high incidence of sharecropping in
Marovoay that limited interest for intensification; (ii) the fact that at the time of the yield
survey (2013), works were still on-going in the sector 4, and that most of the downstream part
of that sector was affected by bad water control due to drainage issues; and (iii) the fact that
the works planned for 2013 in the sector 10 had been postponed (and will be taken care of by
PURSAPS in the near future, see Appendix 2). On the other hand, Marovoay could well be the
only region where the yield gains announced by the project reflect the reality of the project's
results. Indeed, in contrast with the other regions, Marovoay was the only region where the




22
  Guidelines for paddy yield surveys were elaborated by the project (CelCo BVPI, undated) based on the
carré de rendement method (square meter method, enumerator harvesting sample squares in randomly chosen
plots). The guidelines stipulated that to estimate yields outside the sub-projects, the survey had to be carried
out on plots of farmers that had never taken part in a sub-project before. The extent to which this was
respected could not be verified with precision.



                                                     37
beneficiaries and technicians met by the ICR mission concurred with the project announced
yields23.

8.       Although the average yields in the project area have undoubtedly increased, the extent
of this increase is therefore likely to be lower than reported by the M&E system. Farmers and
technicians in all three regions visited by the ICR mission (Itasy, Boeny and Lac Alaotra)
concurred that 25 to 40 percent of the irrigated schemes area is now cultivated using the
technologies introduced by the project, with the exception of fertilizers. The average yields
that the project claims to have achieved were therefore applied to 30 percent of the schemes
area whereas it was assumed that the remaining 70 percent of the schemes still apply traditional
technologies and thus have unchanged yields. Under this scenario, the average yield at the end
of the project would be 3.4 tons/ha, giving a 41 percent achievement of the objective of an
increase from 2.7 to 4.4 tons/ha.

9.      Program level indicator 2: Average yield of rainfed rice in surrounding
watersheds: 2.6 mt/ha. Degree of target achievement: Unknown. The yield reported by the
project was measured at Andapa only, and on sub-projects only (hence not really “average
yields in surrounding watersheds” as specified in the indicator formulation).

10.     Program level indicator 3: Average value of the additional rice production in
project-rehabilitated irrigation sites: Ar 0.480 million/beneficiary/cycle in the rainy
season and Ar 0.620 million/beneficiary/cycle in the dry season. Degree of target
achievement: Unknown. Here again, the values reported by the project were calculated on
sub-projects only (hence not really “average value of the additional rice production in project-
rehabilitated irrigation sites” as specified in the indicator formulation).

11.     Program level indicator 4: Average yield of non-rice crops supported by the
project: maize 1.7 mt/ha, etc. Degree of target achievement: not known. This indicator was
not followed any longer after diversification activities were discontinued. The original focus
on crop diversification was lost in the course of project implementation, while this is a critical
component of irrigated agriculture viability in the context of an always increasing
fragmentation of the land.

12.     PDO level indicator 1: Area cultivated with improved technologies and/or inputs
provided through the project: 5,175 ha. Degree of target achievement: 118%. Total area
of intensification sub-projects amounted to 6,122 ha (5,456 ha on irrigated schemes and 666 ha
on uplands). This indicator was introduced at the first restructuring with a target value of
4,050 ha, target which was later increased to 5,175 ha at second restructuring when the GEF
funds were made available (and IDA funds consequently reallocated to Component A which
supports this indicator). There was no explanation provided for the original target value
introduced at first restructuring. Another indicator related to the “dissemination of innovative
technologies and equipment to 30,000 beneficiaries” was dropped at first restructuring.
However, the latter indicator still appears in the revised result framework as “number of direct
project beneficiaries” and it is commented below (PDO level indicator 4).


23
  On Sahamaloto perimeter (Lac Alaotra), the estimation of the water users’ representatives met during the
ICRR mission was that the average yield on the entire perimeter had gone up from 3.5 mt/ha to about 4 mt/ha
with the project (versus 5.2 mt/ha according to the project M&E unit).


                                                   38
13.      PDO level indicator 2: Area provided with improved irrigation and drainage
services by the project: 13,362 ha. Degree of target achievement: 50 to 56%. The reported
achievement for this indicator was not properly measured. This indicator was meant to measure
the area with reliable water control. The original target in the PAD was set at 21,780 ha (total
area of the irrigation schemes targeted by the project, which was later revised to 20,000 ha –
see Appendix 2). However, the baseline value was set at zero, while the area with reliable water
control was later reported to have been estimated at 5,058 ha before the project start. This new
baseline was introduced after the SPs were mobilized and started monitoring the quality of the
irrigation and drainage services in a participatory manner with the water users. The definition
of “area with reliable water control” was that irrigation water could be brought to the fields and
excess water could be drained at will by the farmer. In some instances specific criteria were
defined with the water users to characterize the quality of service (using for example the date
of the first irrigation in the cropping season24). Although the methodology to measure the
reliability of water service was not fully consistent across the various project sites, it is
considered that it still gives a fairly reliable picture of the situation of the schemes. Considering
the baseline value of 5,058 ha, the real outcome of the project would hence be an increase of
8,971 ha in the area with reliable water control, to be compared with the original target of
15,000 ha (after deducting the baseline value) and a revised target of 13,362 ha. This would be
a 60 and 67 percent achievement compared to original and revised target.

14.      However, this may still be an over-optimistic assessment given the very low intensity
and geographical dispersion of the rehabilitation works that were carried out under IWMP and
knowing that rehabilitation works were only partially implemented due to delays in studies,
beneficiaries’ contribution mobilization (especially before the introduction of the MAPER in
2011), tenders and works (see Appendix 2). Given that of the total proposed investment in
irrigation scheme rehabilitation (Ankaibe weir excluded), only about 30 percent had been spent
at project closure (see Annex 3), and assuming a proportional result, it could be argued that a
conservative estimation of this indicator would be 30 percent of the 15,000 ha not having
reliable water control at the beginning of the project, i.e. about 4,500 ha. This would gives an
achievement of 30 and 34 percent respectively against the original and revised targets.

15.     The Ankaibe weir is a special case since it allowed the project to bring a 2,100 ha
scheme back under irrigation. Although the area with reliable water control after construction
of the weir is not known for sure, since additional small remedial works are required within the
scheme which had not been operational for the past several years, the construction of the weir
was a major breakthrough to bring this scheme back to life and to restore hope within the users.
Although anecdotal, it is worth mentioning that the President of the Republic himself
inaugurated the Ankaibe weir. Based on the respective construction cost for the weir and for
the remedial works within the schemes 25 it could be considered that 90% of the target is




24
     The first irrigation is an important parameter for the farmers since it defines the entire cropping schedule.

25
     Ankaibe weir: 15.1 million Ar; remedial works: 1.1 million Ar (see Appendix 2).



                                                        39
achieved for these 2,100 ha. This would result in an additional 800 ha to be added to the area
with reliable water control (a 5 percent addition).

16.     One further consideration related to the rehabilitation works is that the scope of works,
although limited (only 30% of planned investment was spent at project closure), was very well
targeted thanks to the participatory planning process supported by the SPs. Farmers had to
contribute a percentage of the rehabilitation works and made sure to only pay for those works
that were the most vital to improving the quality of service. Hence it is believed that the area
with reliable water control is not directly proportional to the rehabilitating budget disbursement
rate.

17.     Considering all of the above, the range of achievement for this indicator is 35 – 65
percent of the original target with a lower probability for the lower part of the range. The
achievement value for the indicator “area provided with improved irrigation and drainage
service” is finally set at 7,500 ha by the ICR team being 50 percent of the original target value
of 15,000 ha and 56 percent of the revised target value.

18.     PDO level indicator 3: Area cultivated during the dry season in the irrigation
schemes targeted by the project: 4,150 ha (25%). Degree of target achievement: not
known. Introduced originally as program level indicator 4, this indicator was not followed any
longer after diversification activities were discontinued, although it does not specifically refer
to diversification areas. Besides, this indicator, if measured, would likely be more influenced
by the annual hydrological conditions determining the water availability in dry season than by
the impact of the project.

19.      PDO level indicator 4: Direct project beneficiaries, of which female: 13,130, 20%.
Degree of target achievement: 69 to 120%, 220%. The achievement for this indicator was
not properly measured. Firstly, a much higher target value could be derived from the original
PAD which refers to the dissemination of innovative technologies and equipment to 30,000
beneficiaries. Secondly, the correct achievement value for this indicator which was meant to
measure the number of beneficiaries of intensification sub-projects should be 15,725 (12,331
in irrigated areas and 3,394 on uplands), of whom 44 percent female as reported under
intermediate results indicator 2. We have therefore a 52 percent achievement against the
original target and a 120 percent achievement against the revised target. Regarding the
participation of women we find a 220 percent achievement rate. Instead, the project
management team chose to use the total number of users of the irrigation schemes (22,790
people) as a proxy indicator for the project total number of beneficiaries, on the assumption
that most beneficiaries of activities on uplands also cultivate in the irrigated areas. Since not
all users of the irrigations schemes have actually benefited from the project, as explained above,
the ICR team decided to use the original definition. However, the original target appear to be
unrealistic and should be corrected to reflect the total number of scheme users, which leads to
a revised achievement rate of 69 percent against the original target. The range for the
achievement rate is therefore 69 to 120 percent for respectively the original and revised targets.

20.    PDO level indicator 5: Area under SLM practices in project intervention zones:
2,051 ha. Degree of target achievement: 59 to 147%. The area under SLM practices at the
end of the project (3,018 ha) is made up of the area of the intensification sub-projects on
uplands (666 ha) and that of afforestation sub-projects (2,352 ha). The degree of target
achievement is therefore 59 percent against the original target introduced at first restructuring


                                              40
(5,100 ha) and 147 percent against the revised target from second restructuring (2,051 ha). The
reduction of target area between first and second restructuring was not explained in the
Restructuring Paper26. The original target from the PAD was expressed as a percentage increase
of the area under SLM (target: 20 percent) and a similar percentage increase of the area under
vegetation cover (target: 15 percent), but the baseline is not known and no comparison with
the original PAD target can be made. If the baseline areas were small, it may be the case that
original PAD targets are exceeded.

21.      However, this achievement is very modest when compared to the watershed total area
(less than 5 percent), and there is no indication that long term, viable arrangements are in place
for long term watershed management and maintenance of the erosion control and afforestation
works implemented by the project (a large portion of the newly afforested land is in fact
Government land27). In addition, the drop-out rate for under-cover cultivation sub-projects on
uplands was 100 percent between Year 1 and Year 3, evidencing the lack of interest of farmers
for this SLM technique.

Achievement of Project Intermediate Results Indicators

22.      Component A – Development of Commercial Agriculture. The objective for this
component was to lay the foundations for improved market access and sustainable
intensification and diversification of irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems in the project’s
watersheds. It was planned that the component would include the project area as a whole, both
irrigated and upland areas, and would achieve its specific objective through an approach
focused on market-driven demand, agricultural technology development and dissemination,
private sector initiative and vertical integration of supply chains, as well as promotion of
partnerships among stakeholders (including public-private partnerships, PPP). The component
aimed at improving, all along the targeted supply chains:

         •   Access to market and marketing systems in order to reduce costs and increase farm
             gate prices;
         •   Added value through diversification into higher added value products and agro-
             processing;
         •   Capacities of farmers, farmers groups and professional organizations;
         •   Agricultural productivity through better access to extension, improved technology,

   We would have expected an increase since the GEF funds were reintroduced in the overall project budget
at the second restructuring.

  For example, about 1,000 ha were afforested in the Sahamaloto watershed on lands belonging to the State,
under an agreement between the Regional Environment Directorate and the IWMP. The works were carried
out by a myriad of Groupements de Gestion Durable des Terres (GGDT, sustainable land management
associations) that were also in charge of maintaining the plantations during their first year. It is likely that
most GGDTs were mostly constituted of poor people looking for an immediate income and not interested in
longer-term benefits. If longer-term arrangements are not established between the Regional Environment
Directorate and local populations for the maintenance and future exploitation of these plantations, there is a
very substantial risk that they may not be protected and may disappear soon.

23.    The component included two sub components: one involving activities that largely
depended on public/collective initiative; the other one depending essentially on demand from
stakeholders:

    (i)     Support to agricultural services. The sub-component aimed at improving access
            to markets and supporting the development of commercial agriculture value chains,
            through innovative technologies for production, storage and processing, and a
            stronger enabling environment at the site level. It was planned that activities would
            be adjusted to specific needs of each site, and would include the following:
            (a) support to the development of dynamic market-driven supply chains,
            particularly by creating and strengthening links between producers and markets,
            (b) building up of farmers capacities and strengthening professional organizations,
            as well as establishing Agricultural Service Centers (ASC), and (c) dissemination
            of technologies for agricultural intensification and diversification, including
            support and advisory services for the implementation of agroecological and
            agroforestry techniques in the upper parts of the watersheds. These services would
            be provided by strategic partners and specialized service providers.

    (ii)    Support to private investment. It was planned that this sub-component would
            provide demand-based support to private investment by operators, farmers and
            farmer groups at all levels of the agricultural activity. The sub-projects funded
            under this sub-component would be essentially private in nature and would be
            initiated upon request by a farmer, a farmer group or a private sector operator, with
            financial support from the project if Government considered them a priority and
            wanted to promote them. Project support would be provided to priority new
            investments through a cost sharing mechanism according to a pre-established
            positive/negative list. Sub-projects considered could include investment in
            collective storage, market research and supply chain development, technical and
            managerial advisory services, new technology demonstration and dissemination
            (including agro-ecological cultivation techniques), support to seed production,
            private distribution networks for inputs and equipment and microfinance
            institutions, and support to contract farming and integrated sub-projects initiated
            by commercial or agro-industrial partners and involving small scale producers. The
            project would take a gender sensitive approach and would specifically support
            vulnerable groups in their demands. In addition to investment in infrastructure and
            equipment, it was planned that sub-projects could include studies and market tests
            and research, extension and advisory services, applied research, training, and study
            tours.

24.     Due to the late entry into force of the GEF grant that prompted a reallocation of funds
from Components A and B to Component C and the delays accumulated because of the
disbursement freeze, it was decided to drop some very important elements of Component A,
such as support to the development of dynamic market-driven supply chains, support to
diversification and support to non-farm investment projects (upstream and downstream
investments, microfinance, etc.); at the end, having concentrated on agricultural intensification
(with the exception of the support extended to ASCs), Component A as it was implemented is
the only one that looks very different from what was envisaged at appraisal and made explicit
in its name (Development of Commercial Agriculture). Table 2.6 shows the degree of
achievement of intermediate outcome indicators.

25.      Intermediate results indicator 1: 5 ASC established and functioning. Degree of
target achievement: 100%. Four ASCs (Miarinarivo, Andapa, Marovoay and
Amparafaravola) were established and supported by the project that provided for offices,
equipment and running expenses in their first year (2008). A fifth ASC (Soavinandriana) only
benefited from training. ASCs played an important role in collecting and making available to
farmers input and output prices in their respective region. However, it appears that their impact
in terms of linking farmers to suppliers, produce collectors and finance institutions was much
more limited than planned and that most of their intermediation activity consisted in assisting
farmers to organize themselves in order to access the project services. In addition, some ASCs
suffered from erratic funding from the Ministry of Agriculture, while others apparently did
not28, for a reason that the ICR mission could not fully clarify (some element of performance
was reportedly taken into account in the budget attribution process, but precise decision criteria
could not be found).

26.     Intermediate results indicator 2: 25,300 farmers have adopted an improved
agricultural technology promoted by the project on irrigated schemes and 6,830 on
uplands. Degree of target achievement: Unknown. The number of subproject beneficiaries
was 15,725 (12,331 in irrigated areas and 3,394 on uplands). The targets for this indicator were
calculated based on the assumption that each participant to a sub-project would induce the
adoption of the technology by a follower farmer. In the absence of a field survey to assess that
ripple effect, the same assumption was used to produce the end of project values that thus
remain very theoretical. Strangely enough, both the target and the achieved figure for the
irrigated areas exceed the total number of farmers on the participating schemes (22,790).
Considering the large dropout rate between years 1 and 3 of the subprojects as input subsidies
were phased out, it is highly unlikely that a large proportion of scheme users have adopted the
improved technologies. Based on anecdotal evidence reported during the ICR mission we


28
  For example, the history of funding the ASC in Itasy experienced throughout the project life was as follows:
2008: funding by the project; 2009: running costs (including salaries) funded by Government, but funds
available only in the 4th quarter; 2010: only half budget received, also in the 4th quarter; 2012-2013: no
budget at all; 2014: a one-year budget received in October; 2015: at the time of the ICRR mission’s visit (end
of February), the ASC had not received its budget yet. By contrast, the ASC in Lac Alaotra region did not
report any financing problem.


                                                       43
consider that 25 to 40% of the schemes area is cultivated using improved techniques (without
the fertilizers – see comments made on the indicator related to paddy yields). This same range
could be applied to the number of farmers who have adopted an improved technology, thus
resulting in a 5,700 to 9,100 range value. The range of achievement rate is therefore between
20 and 30 percent (applicable go both original and revised target values which were similar –
30,000 people in PAD under the indicator “Number of beneficiaries having benefited from
innovative technologies and equipment” and 32,130 people after second restructuring).

27.    Intermediate results indicator 3: 1,560 sub-projects financed and implemented.
Degree of target achievement: 124%. The project financed a total of 1,935 sub-projects
(counted as cycle 1 only), of which 1,508 on irrigated schemes and 427 on uplands.

28.     Intermediate results indicator 4: 6 technologies demonstrated by the project.
Degree of target achievement: 133%. Eight technologies were demonstrated: improved seed,
SRI, SRA, hybrid seed, granulated urea, under-cover cultivation, nursery management and
field management.

29.     Component B – Irrigation Development. This component aimed to lay the
foundations for improved management, maintenance and sustainability of irrigation services
provision in four large-scale irrigation schemes through rehabilitation of irrigation
infrastructure, capacity strengthening of stakeholders and clarification of roles and
responsibilities, and establishment of an appropriate incentive framework. By doing so the
component would thus put in place a more favorable environment for agricultural
intensification and diversification.

30.     It was planned that the project would adopt a contractual approach that would empower
stakeholders and clarify their respective roles, based on the principle that investments in
infrastructures enhance and at the same are conditioned by the performance of stakeholders.
To that end, it was planned that Performance Contracts (PC) would be signed between WUAs,
regional directorates for rural development (Directions Régionales du Développement Rural,
DRDR) and local authorities (Communes) that would specify mutual rights and
responsibilities. Investments would be allocated competitively among the four sites, providing
more resources to sites where targets were more ambitious and where key indicators were being
met.

31.         Specifically, the project would finance the following sub-components:

      (i)      Support to irrigation development. The project would support the participatory
               preparation of Scheme Development Plans (SDP) and annual PCs, negotiated
               between WUAs, the DRDR and the Communes, as part of broader Watershed
               Master Plans (WMP). The SDPs and PCs would provide the overall framework for
               support to irrigated agriculture, including possible investments in the rehabilitation
               of irrigation infrastructure. The project would also support stakeholders during
               implementation of the PC, through capacity strengthening, mobilization of water
               users, annual evaluation of performance indicators and user satisfaction surveys.
               Studies would be conducted, among others, into O&M costs and hurricane damage
               to irrigation infrastructure.




                                                 44
      (ii)      Irrigation investments. The project would support the rehabilitation of irrigation
                and appurtenant infrastructure, including technical design studies, implementation
                of works, and their supervision. As many as possible of these contracts would be
                co-signed by WUAs. Investments would be determined in a competitive way
                between the sites, with those sites performing better (in terms of O&M cost
                recovery and DRDR expenditures for irrigation) benefiting from higher investment
                levels. It was proposed that the project would also promote low-cost individual
                irrigation technologies. Eligibility criteria for support under this component would
                include pre-project recovery levels for overall O&M costs, existence and
                functioning of a WUA, and current Government (including DRDR and
                Communes/Districts) expenditure levels in support of irrigation.

33.      Intermediate results indicator 5: 20,278 water users provided with improved
irrigation and drainage services. Degree of target achievement: Target and achievement
dubious. According to the result framework as revised in 2011 and 2012, improved irrigation
and drainage was to be measured through two indicators: (i) an area indicator at PDO level
(target: 13,362 ha), and (ii) a number of beneficiaries indicator at intermediate outcome level
(target: 20,278). The final value for the latter was derived from a theoretical calculation rather
than a field survey: it was assumed that since the target was 20,278 beneficiaries on 13,362 ha,
an estimated area of 14,029 ha with reliable water control at the end of the project implied a
number of 21,290 beneficiaries. However, it appears that the two target figures, 20,278
beneficiaries and 13,362 ha, were marred by inconsistency from the beginning since there are
in total 22,790 water users for 20,051 ha on the participating irrigation schemes. Both the target
and the calculated achievement for this indicator are thus to be considered dubious.

34.      In addition, a number of 21,290 beneficiaries would actually sound very unrealistic
since it would mean that over 90 percent of the total number of water users (22,790) would
now enjoy reliable water control, which is definitely not supported by the evidence gathered
during the field visits for this ICR.

35.     The area with reliable water control is estimated by this ICR to have increased by
7,500 ha (see above comments on project development indicator 2). Based on an average of
0.9 ha per farmer for the four project sites (22,790 farmers on 20,051 ha – see Appendix 1),



                                                    45
the number of beneficiaries from improved irrigation and drainage services could thus be
estimated at about 8,300, leading to a 40 percent achievement rate against the target.

36.     Intermediate results indicator 6: 78 operational WUAs. Degree of target
achievement: 113%. Operational WUA was defined as the fact of having an internal
regulation and a budget. Sustainability remains however at risk: the AFD funded BV-Lac
project in the Lac Alaotra region has demonstrated that a much longer support period, of 10 to
15 years, is needed before a WUA can be considered as standing a reasonable chance of being
sustainable, with in particular water use charges recovery rates above 80 percent. Water Users
Associations have thus been established as credible partners of the Government in ensuring
sustainable irrigation management, but further support is definitely required to ensure their
long term viability.

37.    Though it was not a project indicator, it is worth noting that women represented
27 percent of the WUA members supported by the project (table 2.8).

38.      Intermediate results indicator 7: Ar 540 million collected as O&M fees. Degree of
target achievement: 53%. When this indicator was revised at the second restructuring in
2012, the amount of fees collected was deemed more appropriate than their percentage of the
total O&M needs. Yet, the amounts of fees collected remained far below total needs estimates
throughout the project life. Indeed, although irrigation service fees collected increased 30-fold
during the project life (figure 2.1), they are still insufficient to cover basic O&M costs, as
illustrated in table 2.9.

39.      In addition, it must be noted that the achievement relative to this indicator was not
properly assessed by the project M&E unit. While the indicator was intended to be a measure
of water users’ annual contribution to routine O&M, both in cash and labor, the project M&E
unit actually indicated the cumulative amount of cash O&M fees collected by the WUAs over
2010-2014. The right achievement for this indicator should read Ar 284 million, as indicated
in table 2.3 above, and the degree of target achievement is therefore 53 percent.

40.      Several factors account for WUAs’ weak capacity to collect O&M fees: (i) first of all,
the boost given to the elaboration of the PCs in 2011/12 following the recruitment of the SPs
raised a lot of expectations in terms of rehabilitation works (hence the strong increase in the
amount of fees collected in 2012) that were later partly disappointed, only a minor part of the
works planned in the PCs and the corresponding studies having been eventually implemented
(see section 3.3 and Annex 2 Appendix 2); water users that did not see any major improvement
in their level of water control were reluctant to go on contributing; (ii) the permanence, though
illegal, of sharecropping arrangements on some perimeters, especially in Marovoay, renders
the collection of fees more complicated; (iii) although signatories of the PCs together with the
WUA and the DRDR, most communes did not assume a leading role in sensitizing WUA
members on the merits of O&M fees, resolving conflicts and enforcing the WUA dina (internal
regulation) amongst all their members, especially bad payers; and (iv) some water users
complained about the lack of transparency in the management of the fees collected. It is
reported that fee collection has regressed since the end of the SPs’ mission (June 2014), but the
ICR mission could not ascertain this fact.

41.     Intermediate results indicator 8: FERHA established in one region. Degree of
target achievement: 0%. The project supported the revision of the Law 90-016 regarding the
management, maintenance and police of the irrigation networks. The new Law 14-042 that in



                                              47
particular provides for the establishment of FERHA at national and regional levels was finally
adopted by the Parliament in December 2014 and promulgated in January 2015.

42.      Component C – Watershed Development. The objective of the component was to
lay the foundations for sustainable management of watersheds including irrigated and rainfed
agriculture, the conservation of the natural heritage, and improved productivity of the natural
resources. It was planned that an integrated and participatory approach to watershed
management would be adopted to make rural populations more accountable and encourage
them to manage land and natural resources on a more sustainable manner. The component
would contribute to: (i) protect watersheds by reducing erosion and sedimentation; (ii) increase
the productivity and sustainability of agricultural production based on agroecological and
agroforestry technologies; and (iii) strengthen the management of natural resources to improve
the environment and living conditions. The component would concentrate on investments with
long-term environmental impacts, and support to SLM groups.

43.          This component included the following sub-components:

      (i)       Planning and capacity building for sustainable management of watersheds,
                including (a) preparation, as part of Watershed Master Plans (WMP), of Watershed
                Development Plans (WDP) in the four project areas; (b) preparation of
                participatory plans for managing approximately eight sub-watersheds (each of
                about 10-500 km2); (c) support to communication and negotiation platforms,
                (d) training and capacity strengthening of SLM groups; and (e) support to
                improvement of land tenure security;

      (ii)      Sustainable investments in watersheds, including (a) determining, through
                participatory negotiations, local strategies for controlling erosion, arresting gullies
                and reducing the sediment load of river runoff. The project would finance
                investments in strategic anti-erosion works (through, among others, biological
                methods); and (b) interventions, through matching grants, on communally owned
                land to improve plant cover, reforestation and pastures through strengthened
                technologies and management transfer of natural resources. Eligibility criteria for
                support under this component would include the severity of land degradation, and
                the willingness of stakeholders to cover part of the associated investment costs.

45.      Intermediate results indicator 9: 4 WDP developed. Degree of target achievement:
100%. The four WDPs were formulated in 2007/08 together with the SDPs and validated by
all stakeholders.

46.     Intermediate results indicator 10: 13 sub-watershed management plans developed
and signed. Degree of target achievement: 130%. The objective was exceeded due to the
fact that the DRDR in Itasy chose to establish a sub-watershed management plan for each
perimeter or cluster, without increasing the total area covered by these plans. As a result, the
distribution of sub-watershed management plans across regions was as follows: Itasy: 8; Sava:
3; Boeny: 3; and Alaotra: 3. At the level of each sub-watershed, a Comité de Gestion (COGE,
management committee) was organized, in charge of establishing and implementing the sub-
watershed management plan.

47.      Intermediate results indicator 11: 2,400 beneficiaries adopting SLM. Degree of
target achievement: 59 percent. A total of 18,645 beneficiaries (3,394 for intensification sub-
projects on uplands and 15,251 for afforestation sub-projects) was recorded in the last ISR.
This high number reflects the success of the 2013/14 afforestation campaign especially in
Sahamaloto watershed. However, afforestation project beneficiaries who were paid to do the
work were not really “beneficiaries adopting SLM”. Moreover, a substantial number of farmers
amongst the 3,394 beneficiaries of intensification subprojects did not really adopt SLM either.
The drop-out rate for under-cover cultivation sub-projects that represented 58 percent of
subprojects on uplands was 100 percent between Year 1 and Year 3, evidencing the lack of
interest of farmers for this SLM technique. Even if we assume a 100 percent adoption rate for
other types of subprojects on uplands from the 42 percent remaining subprojects, we derive an
actual value of 1,425 farmers which represents a 59 percent achievement rate and is certainly
a maximum.

48.     Intermediate results indicator 12: 64 mechanical anti-erosion measures
implemented. Degree of target achievement: 81 to 183%. These 117 anti-erosion measures
included: lavaka biological and mechanical stabilization (81), river banks stabilization (14),
canals and drains reinforcement (19), and sand deposits stabilization (3). They were financed
entirely by the project. It is to be recalled that the original target value from PAD was 145. We



                                                     49
therefore have an 81 percent achievement rate against original target from PAD and a 183
percent achievement rate against revised target.

49.     Intermediate results indicator 13: 80% reforestation success rate. Degree of target
achievement: 99%. This is the value achieved at the end of the project. However, in most
afforestation and pasture improvement sites, the project came to an end without having clarified
the responsibilities for the maintenance and future exploitation of the newly vegetated areas.
For example, about 1,000 ha were afforested in the Sahamaloto watershed on lands belonging
to the State, under an agreement between the Regional Environment Directorate and the
IWMP. The works were carried out by a myriad of GGDTs that were also in charge of
maintaining the plantations during their first year. Most GGDTs were probably mostly
constituted of poor people looking for an immediate income (the sub-projects were entirely
financed by the project) and not interested in longer-term benefits. .

50.      Intermediate results indicator 14: 5 operational guichets fonciers. Degree of target
achievement: 100%. This value needs however to be qualified. First of all, it must be noted
that the Law 2005-019 creating the guichets fonciers in September 2005 had only given them
the responsibility for managing traditional (non-titled) land. Consequently, the guichets
fonciers could not intervene on irrigated areas, most of which are already titled. The SPs played
an important role in identifying the water users on the various perimeters and delineate their
plots but this activity, having no legal background, cannot be assimilated to land securisation.
Second, to become operational, a guichet foncier needs to have a Plan Local d’Occupation
Foncière (PLOF, communal land use plan). Considerable delays were incurred in the delivery
of the aerial pictures needed and the recruitment of the operator in charge of establishing the
PLOFs. Apart from the guichet foncier of Marovoay that effectively started operating in 2008
using older aerial pictures, because it was also supported by the Programme de Lutte Anti-
Erosive (PLAE, Anti-Erosion Program), all the others guichets fonciers only got their
respectisve PLOF in March 2014, seven years after the project start and just before a new
regulation was issued in July 2014 that stipulated that land certificates could not be issued any
longer in the absence of a Schéma d’Aménagement Communal (SAC, communal development
plan). Most communes not having the financial and technical means to establish a SAC, the
work of most guichets fonciers came to a halt before having started29. It appears that some of
the communes involved in the project are not maintaining their guichet foncier any longer,
meaning that the investment in terms of capacity building may be partially lost. The land tenure
security activities under the IWMP obviously suffered from inadequate attention from project
management and supervision, to be related to the fact that they were a very minor (in size of
funding) sub-component of the project.




29 In reality, the new regulation of July 2014 specifies that the guichets fonciers can continue delivering land
certificates for areas below 5 ha but apparently most guichets fonciers were not aware of that exception and
discontinued their activity.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Project costs

1.      The project consumed 96 percent of IDA resources and 89 percent of GEF resources.
Beneficiaries’ contribution was estimated at Ar 4.2 billion 30 (about US$ 2 million), i.e.
45 percent of their originally planned contribution. This is due to the fact that the project did
not eventually finance sub-projects at downstream value chain level (storage, processing,
marketing), for which it was originally planned that beneficiaries would contribute over
US$ 1 million, and that the project financed at 100 percent a number of non-transferable
infrastructures that were not included in the initial project design, amongst which the Ankaibe
weir and feeder canal.

2.      The distribution of actual spending across components was slightly different from that
originally planned (table 3.1). Principally due to three time extended project duration,
Component D (Project Management), with 28 percent of total project costs, exceeded its
originally planned share, mainly at the expense of Component A (Development of Commercial
Agriculture) and Component B (Irrigation Development).

greatly from what was planned at appraisal. Various delays in studies, beneficiaries’
contribution mobilization (especially before the introduction of the MAPER in 2011, see
section 2.2), tenders and works resulted in only a minor proportion of the works planned in the
PCs and the corresponding studies to be implemented (table 3.2, see details in Annex 2
Appendix 2). Levels of realizations were even less if compared with what was planned in the
WMPs (in Sahamaloto for example, the WMP had advised works be carried out to increase the
capacity of the dam that has been halved due to sedimentation, which was not done). In all
perimeters where the works planned in the PCs have not been implemented, the WUAs are

                                                  However, it must be kept in mind that the works completed in
                                                  2013/14 in the sectors 4 and 5 essentially concerned infrastructures
                                                  included in the two WUA federations’ PCs (works on primary
Marovoay (Boeny)                                  canals). Most of the works planned for in the 23 WUAs’ PCs have

                                                  not been subject to studies and their cost is thus unknown. The level
                                                  of realization is thus much less than 46% if measured against the

 4.      As a result, while it was planned that the works on the Sahamaloto perimeter would
 represent two-thirds of total rehabilitation investments with a cost per hectare of about
 US$ 1,600 (table 3.3), the rehabilitation works on all the project perimeters, Ankaibe excluded,
 only accounted for one-third of rehabilitation investments. The works on the Ankaibe weir and
 feeder canal that were not originally included in the project made up for the remaining two-
 thirds of the project actual spending on infrastructure rehabilitation, allowing the financial
 envelope for irrigation rehabilitation to be used up at the very end of the project (figure 3.1).
 Consequently, the average cost per hectare was much lower than that initially planned at
 US$ 17531 (Ankaibe excluded). This may have had important consequences in terms of degree
 of water control and investment durability that were not evaluated.

    Or about US$ 400/ha if only areas with reliable water control are taken into account. By way of comparison,
 irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation projects currently funded by the African Development Bank in
 Madagascar have a cost per hectare of US$ 2,000 to US$ 3,000 and favor concrete coated primary canals on
 durability grounds.

          Financial analysis at beneficiary level

          5.      Although they were all labeled SRA or SRI, there was a wide variation in the packages
          tested by the various groups of participants in rice cultivation intensification sub-projects. For


                                                                                                                57
example, SRA could mean NPK/urea combinations, expressed in kg/ha, as different as 150/50,
100/50, 0/75, 0/25, etc. This wide variation, however, did not correspond to a deliberate
intention of the project to test and identify different packages adapted to different conditions
(in particular, no soil analysis was carried out) or farmers’ economic conditions, but rather
reflects the wishes expressed by farmers’ groups, probably based mainly on their assessment
of their contribution capacity. The actual yields obtained with these various combinations were
not monitored.

6.       Despite being repeatedly emphasized by the supervision missions32 as a critical issue
that ought to deserve more in-depth analysis, the feasibility (especially in terms of additional
labor and financing requirements) and profitability of the technology packages that were
promoted by the project were apparently never given much attention by the project M&E unit.
Most of the financial analyses that were carried out in the irrigated rice intensification sub-
project applications displayed a Value-Cost Ratio (VCR) around 2 or below. This is confirmed
by calculations based on two “standard” SRI and SRA models (table 3.4) using quite optimistic
yields (6.3 tons/ha for SRA and 8.0 tons/ha for SRI) and post-harvest loss allowance
(10 percent only) and not taking into account equipment amortization, for which VCRs of 1.9
were obtained. A widely held convention is that in “normal” risks situations, a VCR greater
than 2 is necessary to provide sufficient incentives for naturally risk-adverse farmers to adopt
fertilizer and in especially risky production environments, a minimum VCR of 3 to 4 may be
needed33. While profitable in theory, the packages promoted by the project, in their entirety,
were thus likely to be little attractive to farmers in general, and even more so in the areas
affected by poor water control.

7.      This, combined with possible labor shortage and lack of access to credit, certainly
accounts for the very high drop-out rates observed between sub-project cycles, as the element
of subsidy decreased34, and for the widespread observation that follower farmers around sub-
projects generally adopted only the “soft” elements of the packages (such as earlier and in-row
transplanting, etc.) and not the fertilizer element.

8.      More in-depth work will have to be carried out on this issue, differentiating between
farmers’ agro-ecological and economic conditions, if similar projects are to be prepared in the
future.

   Intensification sub-projects (rice intensification in irrigated schemes and under-cover cultivation on tanety)
were to be implemented over a 3 year cycle, with a project subsidy decreasing from 80 percent in Year 1 to
50 percent in Year 2 and 20 percent in Year 3,. The dropping-out rate proved to be extremely high at
32 percent between Year 1 and Year 2 and 86 percent between Year 2 and Year 3 for subprojects in irrigated
schemes, where only about 10 percent of all sub-projects financed completed the 3 year cycle.

9.      Drop-out rates were even worse for intensification sub-projects on uplands (mostly
under vegetative cover cultivation)35, reflecting here again the lack of attractiveness of the
proposed packages to farmers in the absence of a subsidy element. Here again, no analysis was
carried out by the project M&E unit and more in-depth work would have to be carried out in
order to identify viable technology packages for future similar projects.

Economic analysis

Methodology

10.      Economic rates of return (ERR) and Net Present Values (NPV) were computed for
each region, as was done at appraisal, using a slightly different methodology to account for the
variations between the plans that were made at appraisal and actual implementation. In
particular, while at appraisal benefits arising from investments on the uplands and reduced
siltation were taken into account, only the incremental paddy production in irrigated areas was
considered here, in view of the limited results achieved on the uplands. Similarly, no benefits
from diversification were included since diversification activities were discontinued early in
the project life.

11.     Consequently, only the costs directly related to investments in the irrigated areas were
taken into account in this ICR’s economic analysis. All costs related to the establishment of
rice intensification sub-projects under Component A and irrigation rehabilitation under
Component B were included. Costs of Component C were excluded. Logically, only two-thirds
of project management and TA costs were included.

12.      More specifically, as regards irrigation rehabilitation, the costs of the studies that were
not followed by corresponding works under IWMP were excluded (table 3.5). By contrast, the
costs of the works financed by the EU funded PARECAM project in Itasy and Lac Alaotra
during the period of IWMP disbursement freeze were included (table 3.6), since the studies for
these works had been financed by IWMP and these works directly contributed to the project
results. Similarly, for Ankaibe perimeter, the costs of the works that were financed by GoM on
internal resources in 2013 and 2014 and the costs of the works planned to be implemented by
PURSAPS in 2015-2016 were included, since they are necessary to achieve reliable water
control on the entirety of that perimeter, which is a condition for attaining the average yields
that were assumed for that perimeter in the future. Finally, the cost of the emergency works
carried out in 2008 on the dyke of the Anony perimeter in Lac Alaotra region (Ar 377.7 million)
was excluded since their related benefits were not valued.

the financial analysis section were used and a third budget was established to reflect the

15.          As regards paddy yields, two scenarios were considered (table 3.8):

      (i)           a scenario using the yields announced by the project; to calculate the overall
                    incremental cost of inputs used, it was assumed that these average yields were the
                    result of 20 percent of the farmers practicing the new technology package (SRA in
                    Itasy and Sava, SRI in Lac Alaotra) and 60 percent of farmers having adopted the

                follower simplified package (with 20 percent of the farmers not having adopted
                any new technology); in Marovoay, where the reported average yield is much
                lower, it was assumed that the follower package was being applied on half the
                scheme area, with the other half not having adopted any new technology;

       (ii)     a less optimistic but maybe closer to reality (and more consistent with the anecdotal
                evidence gathered during field visits) scenario whereby the average yields that the
                project claims to have achieved were applied to 30 percent of the schemes area
                whereas it was assumed that the remaining 70 percent of the schemes still apply
                traditional technologies and thus have unchanged yields; under this scenario,
                average yields at the end of the project would be 3.4 tons/ha on the schemes in the
                Itasy region, 4 tons/ha on the Sahamaloto perimeter and 3.3 tons/ha on the schemes
                in the Sava region, Ankaibe excluded; to calculate the overall incremental cost of
                inputs used, it was assumed that these average yields were the result of 30 percent
                of the farmers applying the follower package, the remaining 70 percent not having
                changed technology levels.

16.     For Marovoay, the average yield announced by the project (2.6 tons/ha) was used in
both scenarios and applied to 100 percent of the area as it seems realistic and was confirmed
during discussions with beneficiaries.

17.     For Ankaibe, it was assumed that yields similar to those on other Sava region IWMP
rehabilitated schemes (5.0 tons/ha under scenario 1 and 3.3 tons/ha under scenario 2) would be
obtained on 100 percent of the area after the completion of the rehabilitation works by
PURSAPS in 2016.

18.    The following cropping intensities were used: Itasy: 140 percent; Sava: 200 percent;
and Boeny and Lac Alaotra: 100 percent.

19.     Paddy economic price was valued at 2014 average market price (Ar 700/kg)36. Rice
import parity price was not used as the 10-20 percent premium that is currently paid for local
rice over imported rice price is said to reflect a preference for locally produced rice.

20.      Additional benefits arising from possible technology adoption beyond participating
irrigation schemes were not taken into account.

         21.     Whereas at appraisal, NPVs and ERRs were computed assuming a 20 year project life
         cycle, a 10 year lifespan for project investments was used here, to reflect the much lower
         intensity of the rehabilitation works that were actually carried out.

         22.   Finally, as at appraisal, 10 percent was regarded as the opportunity cost of capital in
         Madagascar.

         24.     As was foreseen at appraisal, Itasy shows a greater ERR than the other regions,
         Ankaibe excluded, and an ERR that is still well above the opportunity cost of capital under
         scenario 2, due to a combination of factors: higher cropping intensity (estimated at 140 percent
         while it is only 100 percent in Marovoay and Sahamaloto), relatively high yield gains and
         contained rehabilitation costs. Despite having the highest cropping intensity (200 percent) and
         yield gains, the Sava region (Ankaibe excluded) has a lower ERR, only 5 percent under
         scenario 2, due to higher rehabilitation costs per hectare. Returns are negative in Marovoay
         with the limited yield gains observed. The ERR for Sahamaloto is very close to the 10 percent
         threshold even under scenario 2.

         25.        It is interesting to note that though it was not planned at appraisal, the Ankaibe weir
         and feeder canal construction boasts a high ERR, due to a series of factors: (i) the Ankaibe
         perimeter was not used any longer, thus the foreseen yields are 100 percent project benefits;
         (ii) it is assumed that rehabilitation works will be finalized by PURSAPS and support extended
         to farmers so that they get similar yields to those obtained on other IWMP rehabilitated Sava
         schemes; and (iii) a cropping intensity of 200 percent is expected as in most irrigated areas in
         the Sava region. Under scenario 2, the Ankaibe part of the project has the highest ERR and
         enables the project as a whole to display an ERR of 15 percent, just higher than the overall
         project ERR that had been calculated at appraisal. Therefore, not only has the Ankaibe weir
         and feeder canal construction allowed the project to use up its rehabilitation works credits and
         to gain considerable visibility, but it has also highly contributed to its overall economic
         profitability.


                                                              63
Sensitivity analysis

26.     Every effort to increase the area under improved technology over the 30 percent level
assumed in scenario 2 would obviously lead to greater ERRs. Indeed, the ERR proves to be
extremely sensitive to an increase in the area under improved technology (or in other words,
an increase in the average yield observed in the scheme). An increase from 30 to 35 percent in
the proportion of the area under improved technology in Sahamaloto, equivalent to an increase
in the average yield on the perimeter from 4.0 to 4.1 tons/ha, would improve Sahamaloto’s
ERR to 13 percent. Similarly, an increase from 30 to 40 percent in the proportion of the area
under improved technology in Sava perimeters (Ankaibe excluded), equivalent to an increase
in the average yield on the scheme from 3.3 to 3.5 tons/ha, would improve the ERR to
10 percent. This calls for continued efforts to promote improved technologies packages
adapted to farmers’ capacities in the irrigated schemes that were rehabilitated by the project.

27.     The Ankaibe ERR proves to be very robust against lower than expected yields: even if
the average yield on the Ankaibe scheme were not to exceed the baseline yield of 2.5 tons/ha
that was observed in the Sava region at the onset of the project, the Ankaibe ERR would still
be high at 21 percent, and the overall project ERR under scenario 2 over the opportunity cost
of capital at 12 percent.

28.      Due to the low intensity of the works that were carried out and the difficulties WUAs
are facing to collect adequate amounts of O&M fees, there is a major risk that the life of most
project rehabilitation investments be less than the 10 year period used in the above analysis in
all sites except Ankaibe, where works can, on the contrary, be expected to last longer than 10
years. An analysis was therefore carried out for all sites but Ankaibe assuming an investment
lifespan of 5 years. Project returns are quite robust against that shortened investment life under
scenario 1 but would become largely negative, except in Itasy, under scenario 2 (table 3.10).

29.     Applying a 20 year lifespan for the Ankaibe investment, even assuming a US$ 3.2
million rehabilitation of the scheme every 10 years (US$ 1,500/ha), naturally gives very good
ERRs: 33 percent under scenario 1 (NPV: 2014 US$ 11.8 million) and 29 percent under
scenario 2 (NPV: 2014 US$ 8.6 million).

Projet Bassins Versants Périmètres Irrigués – Evaluation par les Bénéficiaires du Projet,
Savaivo, Décembre 2014

Résumé
Le Projet Bassins Versants – Périmètres Irrigués (BVPI) mis en œuvre depuis 2007, sous
financement IDA et GEF est arrivé à sa fin en décembre 2014. Le Projet a pour objectif d’augmenter
de façon durable la production agricole dans quatre bassins versants à haut potentiel de
développement et les périmètres irrigués associés que sont la zone d’Andapa dans la région de la
SAVA, la zone de Marovoay dans la région de Boeny, la zone de d’Itasy dans la région d’Itasy ainsi
que la zone du Lac Alaotra dans la région Alaotra Mangoro. Le système de suivi-évaluation du
Projet a prévu une évaluation par les bénéficiaires pour recueillir leurs perceptions, leurs
comportements et leurs visions vis-à-vis des prestations et des résultats dudit Projet. Les
conclusions de cette évaluation permettront au ministère de tutelle, en l’occurrence le Ministère de
l’Agriculture, d’améliorer la qualité des services rendus au profit des ménages ruraux dans le cadre
de futurs projets similaires.
La présente étude essaie de déterminer la valeur des activités, des résultats et des impacts du
Projet BVPI telle qu’elle est perçue par les bénéficiaires, pour les sous-projets des sous
composantes A2 (intensification agricole dans les périmètres irrigués ou dans les sous-bassins
versants) et C2 (investissement dans les bassins versants).
L’évaluation a porté sur 301 sous-projets correspondant à environ 8% de l’ensemble des sous-
projets financés pour les deux composantes. Ces sous-projets couvrent les thèmes d’arboriculture
fruitière, d’intensification agricole sur bassins versants (pour les cultures de haricot, d’arachide, de
vanille), d’intensification agricole sur périmètres irrigués essentiellement de la riziculture pour la
sous-composante A2 ; tandis que pour la sous-composante C2, ils consistent à la stabilisation des
lavaka, la protection des berges, la mise en place des pépinières, à des reboisements ainsi qu’à
l’amélioration des pâturages. Par ailleurs, 53 personnes ressources constituées par des
responsables administratifs et des autorités locales, des responsables des services techniques
déconcentrés (DRDR, CSA, DREF), des responsables des institutions de micro-finance, des
partenaires stratégiques du Projet BVPI ainsi que des opérateurs économiques, ont été
interviewées pour recueillir leurs avis et perceptions.
Les résultats de cette évaluation par les bénéficiaires et par les autres acteurs ayant contribué à
l’opérationnalisation du Projet BVPI sont présentés ci-après.
Echelle d’évaluation
Très pertinent – pertinent – moyennement pertinent – faiblement pertinent
Très efficient – efficient – moyennement efficient – faiblement efficient
Très efficace – efficace – moyennement efficace – faiblement efficace
Impacts très élevés – impacts élevés – impacts moyens – impacts faibles
Viabilité très élevée – viabilité élevée – viabilité moyenne – viabilité faible
Satisfaction très élevée – satisfaction élevée – satisfaction moyenne – satisfaction faible

Pertinence du Projet
L’évaluation de la pertinence du Projet a été faite tout d’abord à travers la réponse du Projet aux
besoins et aux contraintes des paysans, ensuite à partir de l’adéquation de l’approche et des
techniques adoptées ; enfin à travers les services des partenaires ainsi qu’à l’adéquation des
modalités de financement.




                                                   68
En général, le Projet BVPI a été jugé très pertinent étant donné que ses interventions à travers le
financement des sous-projets ont apporté des réponses favorables aux attentes des paysans ainsi
qu’à leurs contraintes de production selon les perceptions des organisations paysannes (OP) ayant
reçu les appuis.
En moyenne, 82% des OP (81% pour la sous-composante A2 et 84% pour la sous-composante
C2) ont constaté une contribution élevée de la part du Projet dans la résolution de ces contraintes
que ce soit en termes d’appui technique, matériel ou financier ; que ce soit en termes de
sensibilisation et/ou de formation ; que ce soit en termes de réhabilitation des infrastructures
d’irrigation. Selon les personnes ressources interviewées, 94% jugent que la contribution du Projet
BVPI est élevée.
L’approche en sous-bassin versant adoptée par le Projet a aussi été vue comme très adaptée à
leurs conditions de vie quotidienne, conditions sociales et environnementales. L’approche est très
adaptée aux conditions des paysans selon 82% des OP (79% pour A2 et 88% pour C2) et selon
les 92% des personnes ressources. L’approche liant la protection des périmètres irrigués contre
les ensablements avec celle des bassins versants, a été notée par les OP.
Sur les technologies apportées par le Projet par rapport aux besoins et contraintes de production
des paysans, 85% des OP jugent qu’elles sont adéquates car faciles à réaliser, simples et efficaces
(même pourcentage pour A2 et C2). Les techniques de SRI et de SRA ont beaucoup réduit les
semences alors que le rendement a augmenté. Cette adéquation a été aussi jugée très bonne pour
73% des personnes ressources.
En matière de services fournis par les partenaires stratégiques, 91% des OP constatent une qualité
élevée (même pourcentage pour A2 et C2). Les partenaires ont apporté leurs expériences de
terrain en réalisant les formations théoriques et pratiques, et cela à travers une pédagogie adaptée
au niveau des paysans. La disponibilité des partenaires pour accompagner les OP a été jugée
élevée pour une moyenne de 79% (80% pour A2 et 77% pour C2). En effet malgré certains
problèmes d’accessibilité, ils répondent toujours présents. Ainsi, suite à cette disponibilité ils ont
été aussi jugés comme possédant une capacité d’intégration élevée dans le milieu, pour 90% des
OP (90% pour A2 et 89% pour C2).
Sur les modalités de financement des sous-projets, elles ont été jugées moyennement adéquates
pour 44% des OP (41% pour A2 et 49% pour C2) contre 33% des OP ayant jugé ces modalités
comme très adéquates. Les appuis financiers ont permis l’acquisition des intrants et des matériels
nécessaires. Toutefois, la modalité d’appui financier dégressif est jugé inappropriée étant donné
que certains bénéficiaires n’ont pas pu honorer leurs apports lors du cycle 3, et les OP constatent
généralement un retard du déblocage de fonds non adapté au cycle cultural. Par ailleurs la modalité
de financement [BVPI : 80% et bénéficiaires : 20%] pour A2 a été jugée moyennement adaptée à
très adéquate pour 92% des personnes ressources ; tandis que pour C2 la modalité [BVPI : 100%]
a été jugée la plus adéquate pour 80% des personnes ressources.

Efficience du Projet
L’efficience du Projet a été évaluée à partir de la participation et de l’implication des bénéficiaires
tout au long de la mise en œuvre des sous-projets ; ensuite à partir du degré de transparence des
dépenses liées à la réalisation des sous-projets ; et enfin à travers les capacités techniques,
institutionnelles et organisationnelles des bénéficiaires. En général, le Projet est jugé comme
efficient.
D’une manière générale, la participation et l’implication des bénéficiaires dans le processus de
mise en œuvre des sous-projets ont été jugées élevées par 64% des personnes ressources
interviewées. Mais selon les résultats des focus group, hormis les autres étapes, le niveau
d’implication des bénéficiaires est faible dans l’identification ou le choix des sous-projets. Aussi,
les membres des OP veulent-ils toujours avoir plus d’information et d’explication, non seulement
sur les types de sous-projets que BVPI peut appuyer mais également sur l’établissement du budget.
Par rapport au degré de transparence des dépenses liées à la réalisation des sous-projets, il a été
jugé comme transparent selon 88% des OP (87% pour A2 et 90% pour C2). En effet, la majorité


                                                  69
des OP tiennent un cahier contenant les dépenses liées au sous-projet ; ainsi que des pièces de
dépenses justificatives même pour un faible montant. Pour les personnes ressources, le degré de
transparence est moyen (45%) étant donné que les bénéficiaires ne géraient pas directement le
budget.
Sur les capacités techniques, institutionnelles et organisationnelles des bénéficiaires, elles sont
jugées moyennes. Si on regarde le niveau d’éducation du président des OP bénéficiaires, on peut
dire qu’il est assez élevé étant donné que 64% sont du niveau secondaire. Par contre, les OP ont
fait parties des membres des institutions de micro-finance seulement à la date où elles ont acquis
un appui du Projet pour 93% des OP. En outre, 92% des OP n’ont bénéficié de financement
d’autres projets (95% pour A2 et 86% pour C2).

Efficacité du Projet
L’efficacité du Projet a été évaluée à partir de l’évaluation des résultats obtenus, en l’occurrence à
travers l’amélioration de la productivité en la comparant avec la situation avant le Projet, ensuite à
travers l’accès des bénéficiaires aux divers intrants et services après le Projet ; enfin à partir de la
répartition des recettes issues des sous-projets. Au vu de tout cela, le Projet est jugé efficace.
Sur l’amélioration de la productivité et notamment sur le rendement obtenu si on le compare avec
la situation avant le Projet, 41% des OP ont jugé qu’elle est moyenne (42% pour A2 et 36% pour
C2). Les OP ont observé une augmentation du rendement et donc de la production, ainsi qu’un
taux de réussite des plantations et une efficacité des systèmes de lutte anti-érosive. Toutefois, le
non maîtrise de l’eau, l’échec de certaines plantations ainsi que le retard du déblocage et
l’insuffisance du budget ont constitué en autant de facteurs de blocages. Par contre, les 91% des
personnes ressources ont jugé que le Projet a amélioré considérablement la productivité des zones
où il y a eu des interventions.
Après la réalisation des sous-projets, 72% des OP ont constaté une amélioration de l’accès aux
conseils que ce soit auprès de la DRDR ou des partenaires (71% pour A2 et 73% pour C2). L’accès
aux intrants a été considérablement amélioré pour 58% des OP (54% pour A2 et 67% pour C2).
Cela est dû à l’existence des fournisseurs d’intrants de proximité et à la fabrication de soi-même
des engrais organiques tels que le compost. Toutefois, l’augmentation incessante des prix
d’intrants limite leur achat par les bénéficiaires après l’arrêt des appuis du Projet. L’accès aux
crédits est moyennement amélioré car il ne s’est pas amélioré et même pas du tout pour 38% des
OP (même pourcentage pour A2 et C2) ; contre une amélioration importante constatée par 24%
des OP.
Quant à la diminution des surfaces touchées par les feux de brousse après la réalisation du Projet,
83% des OP l’ont constaté (40% pour A2 et 62% pour C2). Elle est surtout due aux sensibilisations
des populations locales sur les impacts néfastes des feux, ainsi que suite à la responsabilisation
des populations à travers les VOI. Dans cette ligne d’idée, 59% des OP ont constaté une
augmentation considérable des surfaces reboisées en raison des reboisements et de la protection
de ces boisements par la mise en place des pare-feux (52% pour A2 et 73% pour C2).
Sur le niveau de maîtrise en termes de gestion et de l’élimination des pestes et des pesticides
après le Projet, 67% des OP ont avancé que ce niveau a considérablement augmenté (63% pour
A2 et 77 pour C2). Ceci est du à l’application des acquis des formations et des conseils reçus de
la part des paysans relais.
Par rapport à la gestion des recettes issues des sous-projets, 38% des OP bénéficiaires de la sous-
composante A2 ont acheté des biens communautaires tels que des équipements agricoles ; tandis
que 11% des OP ont constitué une épargne mais dans la caisse de l’association même, tandis que
3% seulement des OP l’ont fait dans une institution de micro-finance.
L’évaluation de la part des personnes ressources sur le degré d’atteinte des résultats du Projet est
de 50%. Ce chiffre est illustré par les quelques indicateurs suivants : taux de réussite des
reboisements (pour la campagne 2013 -14) de 60% à Alaotra Mangoro et 70% pour Itasy;
rendement moyen réel obtenu de 5,23 t/ha si rendement attendu de 5t/ha selon le sondage de
DRDR (2014) ; réparation des ouvrages à 80% ; amélioration moyenne de la vie associative ; les


                                                  70
ensablements des rizières et le problème de l’irrigation sont toujours intenses et encore observés
dans certaines zones.

Impacts du Projet
Les impacts du Projet sont évalués à partir des changements positifs apportés directement ou
indirectement par la réalisation des sous-projets, par l’évaluation des effets d’entrainement des
résultats ou des acquis des sous-projets, par l’évaluation des évolutions des pratiques techniques
après le Projet, de l’état des infrastructures d’irrigation et des rendements obtenus, ainsi que par
l’évaluation des prix de vente des produits. Les impacts du Projet sont jugés moyens à élevés.
Les changements observés (A2 et C2) portent sur l’amélioration de la capacité technique des
membres pour 83% des OP ; sur l’amélioration du niveau de vie en général des membres pour
73% des OP ; sur l’amélioration du revenu familial pour 72% des OP ; sur l’amélioration de la
production/productivité (rendement) pour 56% des OP ; sur l’amélioration de l’autosuffisance
alimentaire pour 53% des OP.
Les effets d’entrainement des sous-projets pour la sous-composante A2 sont jugés importants pour
39% des OP et de 26% pour la sous-composante C2.
On a observé une énorme évolution des pratiques techniques sur la riziculture car si avant le Projet
les techniques traditionnelles ont été les pratiques habituelles adoptées par plus de 50% des
membres des OP (88% des avis des OP), après le Projet, les membres des OP pratiquent des
techniques améliorées SRA/SRI selon 86% des OP enquêtées.
Si on regarde l’évolution des systèmes de culture sur les uplands (Système sous couverture
végétale), l’intervention du BVPI a permis de changer positivement les systèmes de culture
pratiqués sur les uplands pour les bénéficiaires. Selon 57% des OP, les techniques pratiquées par
plus des 50% des membres avant l’intervention du projet sont traditionnelles ; tandis qu’après le
Projet, seulement 3% des OP enquêtées confirment le maintien de ces techniques traditionnelles.
Quant à l’évolution de la superficie cultivée en riz (rizicultures irriguées en SRA / SRI), ces
superficies ont augmenté pour 70% des OP. Ceci est essentiellement du à l’efficacité des
techniques et utilisation des engrais. On observe aussi un constat sur l’augmentation des
rendements en riz et par la suite, de l’amélioration de revenu des membres des OP. En effet si on
compare avec la situation globale à Madagascar (environ 92% des ménages sont en dessous du
niveau de pauvreté sous US$ 1.25 en 2013), les ménages bénéficiaires du projet BVPI sont bien
lotis car avec ce seuil, ils ne sont qu’environ 47% pour la sous-composante A2 et près de 60%
pour la sous-composante C2.
L’évolution de la superficie cultivée sur les uplands selon les techniques proposées par le Projet a
été aussi observée de façon positive car la superficie a été en hausse pour 57% des OP. Les faits
sont expliqués par la disponibilité des engrais et des bonnes semences, ainsi que l’accès aux
autres intrants tels que les matériels agricoles. Suite à cela, le rendement rizicole dans le périmètre
irrigué a été en hausse pour 84% des OP. Quant aux cultures sur uplands, les rendements
agricoles sont en hausse pour 80% des OP suite à l’utilisation des intrants (engrais et pesticides)
ainsi que la pratique de l’association culturale.
Depuis l’intervention du Projet, le prix de vente du riz produit par les OP a augmenté pour 22% des
OP en raison de l’inflation ou de la concurrence des prix entre les nombreux collecteurs. Toutefois,
28% des OP ont constaté que le prix du riz a baissé en raison de ces collecteurs et de la présence
d’un plus grand nombre d’intermédiaires. 50% des OP ont constaté qu’il n’y a eu aucun
changement de prix.
Quant à l’évolution des prix de vente des produits agricoles sur uplands, 58% des OP ont constaté
une hausse des prix en raison de l’amélioration de la qualité des produits, et suite à l’augmentation
de la demande.
Par rapport à l’évolution de l’état des infrastructures d’irrigation dans les périmètres, elle est assez
moyenne car avant le Projet 68% des OP (A2) ont perçu l’état fonctionnel de leurs infrastructures,
et après le Projet, 77% l’ont constaté.


                                                  71
L’utilisation des matériels agricoles plus performants a augmenté. En effet, 12% des OP ont affirmé
que plus de 50% des membres ont utilisé les motoculteurs avant le Projet tandis que 43% des OP
l’affirment pour l’après Projet. Il en est de même pour l’utilisation des pulvérisateurs. 16% des OP
ont affirmé que plus de 50% des membres ont utilisé des pulvérisateurs mais 33% des OP attestent
l’utilisation après le Projet.

Viabilité/pérennité des acquis du Projet
Elle a été évaluée à partir du niveau de réalisation des trois cycles pour la sous-composante A2 ;
à partir de la proportion des membres adoptant et s’appropriant des acquis, ainsi que par
l’évaluation du degré de pérennisation des acquis par les bénéficiaires. La viabilité est jugée élevée
à moyenne.
Généralement, 79% des OP bénéficiaires de la sous-composante A2 n’ont pas pu suivre les trois
cycles en raison de manque de moyens financiers selon les OP.
Quant au taux d’adoption et d’appropriation des acquis du Projet par les OP, ce taux est élevé car
il est de 70% (même pourcentage pour A2 et C2). Les personnes ressources interviewées ont
aussi constaté cette adoption et appropriation des acquis car 78% l’attestent. Pour la sous-
composante C2, le taux est de 68%. En effet, les techniques sont faciles à pratiquer et efficaces ;
par ailleurs, les paysans ont constaté les avantages des pratiques comme le SRI ou SRA. Quant
à la pérennisation des acquis du Projet, les personnes ressources interviewées pensent qu’elle est
assurée (71% des interviews pour A2 et 58% pour C2).

Satisfaction des bénéficiaires
La satisfaction des bénéficiaires sur l’intervention du Projet BVPI a été évaluée à partir des actions
entreprises par le Projet par rapport à trois indicateurs : priorités de production agricole et de
développement en général ; la collaboration avec les autres acteurs partenaires, ainsi que la
participation des femmes dans la réalisation des sous-projets. Le niveau d’évaluation par les
bénéficiaires pour ces trois indicateurs est élevé à moyenne.
D’une manière générale, 62% des OP sont satisfaites par rapport à l’intervention du Projet BVPI
sur les priorités de production agricole et de développement en général. En effet, 63% des OP de
la sous-composante A2 sont satisfaites tandis qu’elles sont de 60% pour la sous-composante C2.
Elles ont acquis des expériences techniques grâce aux conseils et aux formations reçus et la
production s’est améliorée ainsi que le niveau de vie. Toutefois, l’intervention a vu quelques limites,
notamment pour l’apport bénéficiaire jugé trop élevé pour le 3è cycle, le budget insuffisant ainsi
que le problème d’écoulement des produits agricoles dans certains cas.
Quant à la collaboration avec les autres acteurs partenaires du Projet, 57% des OP disent être
satisfaits. La proportion des OP satisfaites de la sous-composante A2 est plus élevée (64%) par
rapport à celle des OP de la sous-composante C2 (43%). Les OP se plaignent surtout de la difficulté
qu’elles ont rencontrée pour l’acquisition du fonds auprès de l’agence de microfinance; d’où un
décalage entre le déblocage du fonds et le démarrage des activités (retard par rapport au calendrier
de culture). Les OP ont fait également des remarques sur la non disponibilité de certains
techniciens chargés de suivis des OP lors de la mise en œuvre des sous-projets.
Par rapport à la participation des femmes dans la réalisation des sous-projets, la majorité des OP
sont satisfaites (96% des OP ; 95% pour A2 et 98% pour C2). En effet, 46% des membres sont
constituées par des femmes. Elles sont jugées responsables et de bonnes conseillères,
dynamiques et pleines de volonté.

Problèmes principaux et recommandations par les bénéficiaires
Les principaux problèmes soulevés par les OP lors de la réalisation des sous-projets sont
constitués par le déblocage de fonds (retard par rapport au calendrier cultural), le problème sur les
apports bénéficiaires (non réalisation pour le cycle 3, montant élevé pour la sous-composante A2) ;
le problème de la collaboration avec les IMF (procédures administratives) et l’accès au crédit ;
ainsi que l’insuffisance des suivis de la part des partenaires (période très courte et fréquence de


                                                  72
visite assez limitée). Spécifiquement pour les Associations des Usagers de l’Eau, les paysans
reconnaissent la persistance des problèmes relatifs au non-recouvrement des entretiens des
infrastructures dont la cause principale est l’irrégularité du paiement, voire le non-paiement des
cotisations par certains membres.
Pour la sous-composante A2 et pour la sous-composante C2, les recommandations de la part des
OP ainsi que de la part des personnes ressources pour des projets similaires ou de développement
rural pour le futur sont surtout axées autour de l’encadrement et le suivi des OP pendant et après
le Projet, sur l’approche du Projet, sur la sensibilisation plus intense, de la bonne collaboration
entre les institutions concernées, de choix des sous-projets en rapport avec les priorités de
développement local ou régional, sur le renforcement des capacités techniques et
organisationnelles des OP et enfin sur l’accès au crédit.

Résumé Exécutif

Historique du Projet et justification
Le Projet BVPI financé par la Banque Mondiale constitue un des outils de mise en œuvre, à travers
le Programme National BVPI, de la politique de développement des Bassins Versants et
Périmètres Irrigués adoptée par le Gouvernement de Madagascar en juillet 2006. Il répond à la
nécessité d’une approche intégrée de la problématique périmètre irrigué – bassin versant, en
associant réhabilitation des réseaux hydroagricoles et intensification agricole, conditions de la
croissance, à l’aménagement et la protection des bassins versants, conditions de la durabilité.
Le Projet BVPI est un projet APL prévoyant trois phases de quatre ans chacune financées
conjointement par l’IDA et le GEF. Le présent rapport d’achèvement concerne la Phase 1 dite de
démarrage mise en vigueur en avril 2007 et dont la date de clôture était initialement fixée au
01/03/2011. L’accord de Crédit IDA 4244 0 MAG, d’un montant de 20,2 millions DTS, a été signé
le 26/11/2006, mais les décaissements ont été suspendus de mars 2009 à mai 2010 en application
de la directive OP/BP 7.30 relative aux gouvernements de facto. De ce fait, une première
restructuration du Crédit IDA a été approuvée le 25/02/2011 : elle consiste en une réallocation des
fonds et un report au 31/12/2012 de la date de clôture du crédit IDA. L’Accord de Don du GEF
TF093651 n’a pu être signé que le 26/12/2011, pour un montant de 5,9 millions USD et avec le
30/06/2014 pour date de clôture, ce qui a nécessité une seconde restructuration du Crédit IDA
consistant en une nouvelle réallocation des fonds et un report de la date de clôture au 30/06/2014
également. Afin de pouvoir achever certains grands travaux d’infrastructures hydrauliques, le
Projet BVPI a obtenu de l’IDA une extension de six mois (sans réallocation des fonds), portant ainsi
au 31/12/2014 la date de clôture du financement IDA.
Conformément à l’approche « pôles de croissance », la Phase 1 du Projet BVPI a concerné quatre
sites à fort potentiel de développement rizicole : la région Itasy, la cuvette d’Andapa (région SAVA),
la plaine de Marovoay (région Boeny) et le périmètre de Sahamaloto (région Alaotra Mangoro).
L’objectif de développement de la Phase 1 du Projet BVPI IDA-GEF, tel que formulé dans le PAD,
est de poser des bases durables pour l’agriculture irriguée et la gestion des ressources naturelles
au niveau de quatre bassins versants à fort potentiel et des périmètres irrigués associés.
L’objectif environnemental global du Projet 37 est une amélioration de la durabilité
environnementale des pratiques de gestion des terres au niveau des quatre bassins versants cibles.
Les activités menées pour essayer d’atteindre ces objectifs ont été conduites à travers :
     trois composantes techniques couvrant des orientations stratégiques majeures :
             o Composante A : Développement de l’Agriculture Commerciale,
              o   Composante B : Développement des Périmètres Irrigués,
             o Composante C : Développement des Bassins Versants,
        une composante de Gestion du Programme,
        et une composante transversale de Sauvegarde Environnementale et Sociale.

  Pour éviter des répétitions fastidieuses et alléger le texte, les termes « Projet » et « Projet BVPI » seront
employés dans la suite du présent document pour désigner la Phase 1 du Projet BVPI.


                                                      75
Chacune des trois composantes techniques a comporté deux sous-composantes :
     une sous-composante d’appui, financée à 100 % par le Projet,
     une sous-composante d’investissement, par la mise en œuvre de sous-projets à frais
      partagé
Principaux facteurs affectant la performance du Projet
Les évènements politiques de début 2009 ont entrainé
       la suspension des décaissements de la Banque Mondiale de mars 2009 à mai 2010, et
        donc la perte de deux campagnes de saison des pluies et de contre-saison,
       le report de la signature de l’Accord de Don du GEF, et donc l’impossibilité de mener les
        actions éligibles à son financement, jusqu’à ce que l’IDA, en juillet 2010, accepte de les
        prendre provisoirement en charge.
Le financement à 80 % en cycle 1 des sous-projets d’intensification a suscité une forte demande,
renforcée ensuite par les bons rendements obtenus. Il en a résulté un fort accroissement du
nombre de sous-projets, et par conséquent un effet de tache d’huile significatif qui a permis une
augmentation de 1,7 T/ha du rendement moyen en paddy des périmètres.
Mais ce fort engouement pour les sous-projets en cycles 1 et 2 a également obligé le Projet à
diffuser des paquets techniques (surtout SRA et SRI) très standardisés (avec quelques variantes
régionales), sans pouvoir s’attacher aux spécificités de chaque bénéficiaire et en devant recourir,
pour assurer un appui et un suivi le plus rapproché possible, à des paysans-relais, courroie de
transmission entre les techniciens des Partenaires Stratégiques et les Organisations Paysannes.
Le recours à des Partenaires Stratégiques a été un facteur déterminant des succès obtenus par le
Projet : il a permis de suppléer au manque criant de personnel de terrain des DRDR, tout en
assurant un renforcement des capacités et une redynamisation de leurs cadres.
L’obligation initialement faite aux AUE de prendre en charge 20 % du coût des travaux de
réhabilitation des ouvrages transférables a été un frein à la réhabilitation des périmètres irrigués,
qui a été fort heureusement levé par l’adoption du MAPER, conjointement à la signature tripartite
AUE-DRDR-Commune) des contrats-plans pluriannuels (CPPA).
La concentration des actions sur uplands dans des sous-bassins versants modèles a permis
d’éviter la dispersion géographique des interventions et leur dilution dans l’espace ; elle a permis
de démontrer la faisabilité et l’intérêt d’un aménagement complet, sur l’ensemble de leur
toposéquence, de sous-bassins versants soigneusement sélectionnés pour leur accessibilité et
visibilité.
Principaux résultats
     Composante A
    Le Projet s’est concentré sur le financement de sous-projets d’intensification à frais partagés
    au profit d’exploitants agricoles structurés en organisations paysannes. Chaque sous-projet
    devait être subventionné par le Projet de manière dégressive sur 3 cycles de culture
    successifs pour les cultures annuelles, et sur deux années pour les spéculations arboricoles.
    Sur les périmètres irrigués :
12 331 exploitants (dont 44 % de femmes) représentant 54 % de l’effectif total des usagers des
périmètres ont participé au cycle 1 d’un total de 1 508 sous-projets d’intensification rizicole (SRI,
sur Sahamaloto ; SRA sur les 3 autres sites d’intervention du Projet) sur une superficie totale de
5 456 ha représentant 27 % de la superficie des périmètres.
9 040 d’entre eux (dont 43 % de femmes) ont poursuivi l’intensification en cycle 2 sur une superficie
totale de 3 936 ha à travers 1 136 sous-projets.
Seuls 163 sous-projets sont allés jusqu’en cycle 3 : ils concernent seulement 1 327 exploitants
(dont 42 % de femmes) et 508 ha.


                                                 76
Alors que le rendement moyen de référence (en 2006) était de 2,7 tonnes de paddy/ha, les
rendements moyens en paddy obtenus en saison principale 2013-2014 sont les suivants :
                  Sur sous-projets (tous cycles confondus) : 5,87 T/ha
                  Hors sous-projets                         : 4,32 T/ha
                  En moyenne                                : 4,43 T/ha
L’augmentation significative du rendement moyen hors sous-projets témoigne à la fois de l’effet
tâche d‘huile provoqué par les sous-projets et du fait que les OP ayant quitté le système avant le
cycle 2 ou le cycle 3 n’ont pas complètement abandonné les techniques vulgarisées à travers les
sous-projets.
Le supplément de production de paddy (par rapport à la situation avant Projet) a été, pour la saison
principale 2013-2014, estimé à plus de 32 000 tonnes de paddy.
       Sur les bassins versants dominant les périmètres :
3 394 exploitants (dont 44 % de femmes) ont bénéficié du cycle 1 d’un total de 427 sous-projets
sur une superficie totale de 666 ha. Dans ces totaux, les cultures SCV représentent 398 ha cultivés
par 1 980 bénéficiaires répartis dans 248 OP.
Pour les sous-projets SCV, la déperdition après le cycle 1 a été très forte, puisque, en cycle 2, on
ne trouve plus que 46 sous-projets mis en œuvre sur 113 ha par 411 bénéficiaires. Cette très forte
déperdition est due à la complexité même du SCV et à un appui technique largement insuffisant
pour promouvoir un paquet technique aussi innovant.
       Composante B
       19 972 ha de périmètres irrigués ont bénéficié des appuis du Projet.
       88 AUE ont été formées, officialisées et équipées de documents de gestion divers.
       73 contrats-plans pluriannuels ont été signés et 100 millions MGA ont été réunis au titre du
       MAPER depuis que ce dernier a été instauré (fin 2012).
       Le Projet a fait réaliser par des consultants 21 études d’APD/DAO/EIES38 portant sur 19 522
       ha de périmètres pour un coût total d’environ 1,6 milliards MGA entièrement pris en charge
       par l’IDA.
       44 chantiers de réhabilitation (de construction, dans le cas d’Ankaibe) concernant 19 010 ha
       ont été financés par l’IDA pour un montant total d’environ 21,4 milliards MGA (et une
       participation des usagers de 609 millions MGA, avant instauration du MAPER).
       Le contrôle-surveillance des travaux et l’élaboration du MGE ont généralement été assurés
       par le Consultant ayant procédé aux études.
       Grâce à ces travaux, 14 049 ha bénéficient fin 2014 d’une bonne maîtrise de l’eau.
       La collecte des redevances reste nettement en deçà des prévisions des CPPA : pour la saison
       2013-2014, 275 millions MGA seulement ont été collectés (ou prestés en travail) sur un objectif
       de 458 millions MGA : il s’agit d’un effort significatif, mais non suffisant pour assurer la
       pérennité des réseaux.


       Composante C
       Les actions ont été focalisées sur 17 sous-bassins versants modèles totalisant 1 128 ha et
       mis en valeur par 6 022 utilisateurs structurés en 666 GGDT. Pour chacun de ces SBV modèle
       a été élaboré de manière participative un plan de zonage décrivant la situation d’occupation


38
     précédées d’un APS dans le cas d’Ankaibe.



                                                  77
    des sols avant intervention du Projet, puis un schéma d’aménagement de l’ensemble de la
    toposéquence du SBV, dans l’objectif de démontrer la possibilité et l’intérêt d’un
    aménagement complet de SBV.
    Cependant, les actions de traitement de points noirs d’érosion et de reboisement ont
    largement dépassé le cadre des sous-BV modèles.
    117 ouvrages stratégiques antiérosifs ont été réalisés (dont 81 traitements de lavaka et 14
    protections de berges de rivière), d’un coût de 2,5 milliards MGA pour la Banque Mondiale (et
    seulement 7 millions MGA pris en charge par les bénéficiaires).
     1 853 sous-projets de revégétalisation (dont 1 737 sous-projets Reboisement et 73 sous-
     projets Pépinière Forestière) ont concerné 16 426 bénéficiaires (dont 42 % de femmes) et
     coûté 4,3 milliards MGA financés par la Banque Mondiale et 200 millions MGA pris en charge
     par les bénéficiaires.
Niveau d’atteinte des objectifs de développement du Projet
L’objectif de développement de la Phase 1 du Projet BVPI IDA-GEF, tel que formulé dans le PAD,
est de poser des bases durables pour l’agriculture irriguée et la gestion des ressources naturelles
au niveau de quatre bassins versants à fort potentiel et des périmètres irrigués associés.
Ainsi qu’il ressort du tableau ci-dessous, la quasi-totalité des objectifs de résultat par rapport à
l’objectif de développement ont été dépassés.
Seul l’objectif de superficies exploitées en contre-saison semble ne pas avoir été atteint, car le
résultat affiché de fin de Projet ne mesure que les superficies des sous-projets d’intensification, à
l’exclusion des superficies hors sous-projets, qui n’ont pas pu être recensées (à la différence de la
plaine de Marovoay, seule une partie de la superficie des périmètres d’Itasy et de SAVA est
exploitée en contre-saison).

Performance de la Banque Mondiale et de l’Emprunteur
14 missions de supervisons ont été organisées par la Banque Mondiale (non compris les deux
missions individuelles de mars et juillet 2013). Toutes ces missions, à l’exception des deux
missions individuelles précitées, ont été conduites par M. Ziva RAZAFINTSALAMA, Task Team
Leader du Projet BVPI auprès de la Représentation de la Banque Mondiale à Madagascar. La
périodicité de deux missions par an a été ainsi globalement respectée. Les missions de terrain ont
été organisées avec le souci d’une égale fréquence de visite des quatre sites du Projet.
Le Projet a également participé à deux revues du portefeuille des projets de la Banque Mondiale,
les 26-27/03/2012 et le 21/05/2013. A ces deux revues, le Projet a obtenu la notation Modérément
Satisfaisant.
La mission de supervision de septembre 2011 a été l’occasion de la revue à mi-parcours du Projet.



                                                                78
La mission de décembre 2014 avait, entre autres, pour objectif d’assurer la bonne clôture du Projet
BVPI. A l’issue de cette dernière mission, la notation Satisfaisant a été donnée à chaque
composante et volet du Projet.
La Banque Mondiale a assuré un suivi rapproché des activités du Projet : l’aide-mémoire de chaque
mission a comporté des recommandations faites pour chacun des volets du Projet par les experts
concernés sous la forme de plans d’actions à mettre en œuvre dans des délais définis. En début
de chaque mission, le Projet a fait un compte-rendu de l’exécution des recommandations formulées
par la mission précédente.
Les cadres du Ministère de l’Agriculture ont activement participé à la conception et à la préparation
du Projet, en 2005 et 2006.Et les deux restructurations du Crédit IDA et la finalisation de l’Accord
de Don du GEF ont été le fruit d’une étroite collaboration entre l’équipe de la CelCo et celle de la
Représentation de la Banque Mondiale chargée du pilotage opérationnel du Projet.
Le Projet a bénéficié d’un appui constant du Secrétaire Général du Ministère et d’une très forte
implication des responsables de l’UGPM, en particulier du PRMP. Les deux directeurs centraux de
l’Agriculture et du Génie Rural, responsables respectivement des composantes A et B, n’ont pas,
du fait de leurs multiples activités, été en mesure de consacrer au Projet BVPI autant de temps
que souhaité, mais n’ont pas manqué de participer activement à toutes les missions de supervision
de la Banque Mondiale.
La responsabilisation entière des équipes DRDR dans la mise en œuvre du Projet a permis une
appropriation du Projet par ces cadres, ainsi qu’un renforcement de leurs capacités, et permet
d’espérer une poursuite des actions par ces derniers, pour peu que les moyen nécessaires leur
soient fournis.
Principales leçons tirées
En voulant atteindre un maximum d’exploitants à travers les sous-projets d’intensification agricole,
le Projet s’est exposé au risque de subventionner certains groupements opportunistes qui
abandonneraient le système dès après le cycle 1, et s’est condamné, vu la faible densité
d’encadrement (malgré le recrutement de Partenaires Stratégiques et le recours à des paysans-
relais) à vulgariser des thèmes et paquets techniques très standardisés ne répondant pas
forcément aux préoccupations et contraintes spécifiques de chaque exploitant ou groupement
d’exploitants. Il apparaît opportun d’imaginer une approche plus personnalisée d’un nombre limité
de bénéficiaires représentatifs, dont les parcelles serviront de lieux de démonstration et
d’apprentissage,
Les techniques agro-écologiques (SCV, agroforesterie) n’ont pas connu le succès espéré, parce
que les personnels chargés de leur vulgarisation n’avaient ni les compétences et l’expérience
nécessaires, ni le temps pour assurer la formation et le suivi très rapproché que nécessite
l’introduction de cette pratique particulièrement innovante.
Pour éviter les problèmes de retard de décaissement rencontrés, il convient de fixer de façon plus
rigoureuse les dates buttoirs d’élaboration et de signature des contrats de financement des sous-
projets d’intensification, même s’il faut pour cela rejeter les dossiers retardataires : il est préférable
de perdre quelques sous-projets plutôt que de financer des sous-projets qui souffriront de retard
(voire d’absence) de mise en application de certains intrants.
Les collectes de redevances pour fonctionnement, gestion et entretien des réseaux hydroagricoles
restent largement inférieures aux montants nécessaires (approuvés dans les CPPA) pour assurer
la pérennisation des infrastructures. Un des moyens d’améliorer le versement de ces redevances
serait de rapprocher l’usager de la structure qui gère sa portion de réseau, en initiant une
fragmentation en unités plus petites des AUE dont l’effectif dépasse 150-200 membres.
La gestion de l’eau doit être améliorée, en particulier en début de campagne, lorsque les besoins
théoriques pour l’irrigation des pépinières sont peu importants, mais que la consommation devient
extrême, du fait de la dispersion de ces dernières.




                                                   79
Les opérations de reboisement méritent d’être poursuivies, mais avec une plus grande
responsabilisation et implication des bénéficiaires, dont la motivation pour le reboisement doit ainsi
être concrétisée.
L’organisation institutionnelle consistant à confier la maîtrise d’œuvre des activités aux DRDR, tout
en les appuyant par une assistance technique, a démontré son intérêt pour l’appropriation du Projet
par les cadres de la DRDR. Cependant, les responsabilités et obligations respectives des
partenaires (assistants techniques, partenaires stratégiques, consultants divers, ...) et des agents
de la DRDR méritent d’être mieux précisées et appliquées.
La mise en œuvre des sous-projets a démontré le vif intérêt des femmes pour les actions du Projet.
Les interventions ultérieures devraient mieux prendre en considération ce facteur en attachant plus
d’importance à la question du genre.


(b) Borrower's Comments on Draft ICR

En général, le projet a réalisé les objectifs assignés malgré les difficultés qu’il a rencontrées
pendant cette phase 1. La non prolongation du projet en système APL ( trois phases de quatre
ans) fait que le jugement a été porté isolement sur la durée de cette phase.

L’évaluation de risque mentionnée comme « Forte » résulte de l’environnement politique que
le projet ne maîtrise pas et de la dimension (argent et en temps) car beaucoup de choses prévues
avant le projet ont été supprimées ou n’ont pas été priorisées (diversification, marketing,…).

Les points forts que le projet a réalisés n’ont pas été aussi bien décortiqués et mis en exergue
que les points faibles (sauvegarde environnementale et fiduciaires).

L’Etat a participé à la hauteur de 500 Millions d’Ariary pour les indemnités et la réparation
relatives au déplacement de population lors de travaux sur le barrage d’Ankaibe, 423 Millions
d’Ariary pour les travaux d’urgence sur la réparation des brèches sur ce périmètre (cf paragrahe
53, page 26 –Rapport ICR). Ces montants même modestes doivent être figurés dans le tableau
Annexe 1 de ce rapport.

Pour nous, la notation « Satisfaisante » peut être aussi être donné à la place de « Modérément
insatisfaisante » telle que l’évaluateur a proposé.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Le Programme National Bassins Versants – Périmètres Irrigués, qui inclut le projet BVPI
financé par la Banque et deux projets financés par l’AFD39, a fait l’objet d’une évaluation
indépendante en 2014-2015 (AGRER 2015). Les conclusions principales de cette étude sont
cohérentes avec celles de cet ICR:

- Des méthodes et outils prometteurs ont été testés tant au niveau des périmètres irrigués que
des bassins versants (schémas directeurs, plans d'aménagement, contrats de plan pluri-annuels,
MAPER, dina, paysans-relais, registres parcellaires, etc.);

- Des pouvoirs locaux ont été légitimés et renforcés et leurs responsabilités formalisées
(Associations d’Usagers de l’Eau, CORES, Communes, DRDR, CSA, etc.);

- L'insertion du projet Banque mondiale/BVPI dans les structures de l'Etat a été un facteur
important d'appropriation par la partie nationale;

- Les avancées sur le cadre institutionnel et réglementaire restent néanmoins réduites et fragiles
tant que les textes réglementaires régissant le secteur de l'irrigué ne sont pas vulgarisés, que les
modalités de co-financement des travaux ne sont pas établies (FERHA, FRDA, ressources des
collectivités territoriales décentralisées) et que l'appui socio-organisationnel aux Associations
d’Usagers de l’Eau et GGDT n'est pas assuré dans la durée; les résultats tendent à se fragiliser
quand les structures projets se retirent, d'autant que la présence d'un projet ne s'est pas
nécessairement traduite par une augmentation des effectifs de techniciens au sein des DRDR;

- L'importance de l'approche conseil à l'exploitation a été mise en évidence, ainsi que la
nécessité d'une approche différenciée selon les conditions agro-économiques des exploitations,
mais la forme et l’organisation institutionnelle de services de conseil pérennes restent à définir;
le conseil agricole constitue un enjeu-clé de la durabilité des acquis, mais également de leur
mise à l'échelle;

- De même, une approche filière avec lien avec l'amont et l'aval (secteur privé) et les institutions
de crédit est essentielle;

- L'approche micro-projets subventionnés a produit des résultats mitigés; ils ont généré un
intérêt souvent opportuniste mais n’étaient pas forcément adaptés (faible rentabilité du travail)
ou à la portée des bénéficiaires (besoins en main d'œuvre et en financement);

- Les investissements sur bassins versants ont produits des résultats généralement insignifiants
en matière de transformation du paysage (pour le projet Banque mondiale/BVPI, les schémas
d’aménagement et les sous-projets Culture Sous Couvert Végétal ont représenté
respectivement 2% et 0,2% de la superficie totale des bassins versants);

- La pérennisation de l'entretien des aménagements sur bassins versants reste à assurer, en

- Le traitement des problèmes d'ensablement des périmètres irrigués et de leurs retenues
nécessite des actions d'envergure passant par une approche interministérielle;

- La question de la mise à l’échelle des résultats de cette phase de "recherche-action" reste donc
entière;

- La CelCo, qui devait initialement coordonner les différentes initiatives dans le domaine du
Programme National BVPI, est devenue une unité de projet pour la BM et n'a pas joué de rôle
en matière de coordination/capitalisation/réorientation du programme, d'autant que sa
légitimité en ce sens n'a jamais été confirmée et que les moyens ne lui ont jamais été donnés
pour le faire (en particulier, absence d'outil de Suivi & Evaluation);

- Il est nécessaire de refonder la stratégie nationale BVPI en capitalisant les enseignements
fournis par l'ensemble des initiatives en la matière, y compris celles qui ont été développées en
dehors du PN-BVPI (BAD/Bas-Mangoky, PAPRIZ, PLAE, etc.);

- En particulier, la nouvelle stratégie devra prendre en compte les nouvelles conditions qui
prévalent au sein des périmètres irrigués (fragmentation des parcelles, diversité et complexité
des modes de faire-valoir, hétérogénéité de l’accès à l'eau, politisation des Associations
d’Usagers de l’Eau, faible implication des services de l'Etat et des collectivités territoriales
décentralisées, etc.), qui aujourd'hui rendent tout investissement aléatoire et risqué.
