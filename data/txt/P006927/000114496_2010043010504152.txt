Dear Mr. Minister:
RE:
COSTA RICA - Second Structural Adjustment Program
Loan No. 3005-CR
We refer to the Loan Agreement between the Republic of Costa Rica (the Borrower) 
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated 
December 16, 1988, for the above-mentioned program.
Due to a printing error, the Amortization Schedule set forth in Schedule 2 to 
the above Loan Agreement is incorrect.  We propose to amend the Loan Agreement by 
deleting the dates "February 15, 2006" and "August 15, 2006" in Schedule 2 and 
substituting therefore the dates "February 15, 2005" and "August 15, 2005", 
respectively.
If you agree with the proposed amendment, as representative of the Borrower, 
please sign and date the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to us.
The amendment shall come into force on the date of countersignature by you.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
   AND DEVELOPMENT
