imports. This\n            would be achieved by: (i) expansion of agricultural\n            productive capacity; (ii) strengthening of the existing\n            agricultural productive capacity and of the maintenance of\n            existing support infrastructure; and (iii) improvements in\n            relevant institutional capacity and operating procedures,\n            particularly in procurement, inventory control, planning,\n            budgeting, and accounting. The project would finance six\n            subprojects, namely: small-scale irrigation; agricultural\n            production support; agricultural road maintenance; livestock\n            feed production; sugar processing; and warehousing and\n            inventory management. These six subprojects would be\n            supported by technical assistance and training. The project\n            would directly benefit approximately 60,000 small farm families."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
