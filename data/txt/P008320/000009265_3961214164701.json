The primary objective of the DDSR was to\n            reduce Bulgaria's debt overhang through a significant\n            reduction in its total debt burden. The DDSR operation can\n            be judged a success. Implementation of the project was\n            satisfactory. The performance of the Bank was good. The Bank\n            played an important advisory role in the design, formulation\n            and evaluation of the menu of options of the operation. The\n            performance of the borrower was satisfactory, especially\n            given the political changes. The DDSR agreement was\n            successfully completed in a relatively short time and has\n            largely achieved its immediate objectives. However, the loan\n            accomplished less in advancing pivotal long-term reform and\n            several core development issues remain to be tackled.\n            Several key lessons have emerged from the Bulgarian DDSR\n            experience that may be of broader relevance to other\n            countries in the process of restructuring their commercial\n            debt. First, a country's ability to meet its external\n            debt obligations on a sustainable basis depends on progress\n            in restructuring the economy and restoring the basis for\n            economic growth during the breathing space provided in the\n            first few years of a DDSR agreement. Second, seeking a clear\n            picture of available external financing should come before\n            agreeing on the specific terms of the DDSR. The Bulgarian\n            experience suggests that while pursuing policies that ensure\n            the availability of sufficient resources for its debt\n            reduction operation, a country should also explicitly\n            incorporate its objective for debt reduction into the deal.\n            Finally, directing macroeconomic policies toward preserving\n            financial stability throughout the DDSR process is vital."}, "docdt": "1996-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
