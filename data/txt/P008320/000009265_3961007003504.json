costs of the recent\n            debt and debts services reduction (DDSR) agreement on the\n            restructuring of about US$8.1 billion in public external\n            debt - including about US$1.9 billion in past due interest.\n            The Bank's support will be part of a joint effort with\n            the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to replenish partially\n            Bulgaria's international reserves used to finance the\n            upfront costs of the DDSR agreement. The proposed measures\n            are: (i) a Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan to the\n            Republic of Bulgaria for US$125 million to reimburse a\n            portion of the cost of the principal and interest collateral\n            of the instruments and/or the debt buyback; and (ii) set\n            asides of US$75 million out of a proposed Financial and\n            Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL), which the Bank\n            intends to submit to the Executive Directors for approval in\n            the second or third quarter of FY95. The Agreement was\n            implemented without direct official support by drawing down\n            Bulgaria's international reserves to less than two\n            months of merchandise imports. Bank and IMF support for the\n            DDSR agreement will help replenish Bulgaria's reserves\n            to a level more appropriate for a small open economy."}, "docdt": "1994-09-07T00:00:00Z"}
