A major lesson\n            from this Distance Learning Centers' (DLCs) experience\n            is that Centers should guard against being drawn into costly\n            local training activities, in the interest of\n            diversification. The post-project financial analysis, as\n            well as the comparison between Benin and Cote d'Ivoire\n            (although very limited), seem to suggest that, in pursuing\n            sustainability, Centers should stay focused on maximizing\n            video conferencing and E-learning activities, while being\n            very selective in local training expansion. Another lesson\n            concerns financial viability and training as a public good.\n            As of the first year of the project performance, experience\n            suggest that, with the appropriate mix of video and\n            non-video activities, and cost-conscious management, the DLC\n            could cover its operational costs, assuming a guaranteed\n            amount of training paid by the public sector.\n            Notwithstanding, one should also consider that the Benin\n            operational cost coverage calculation, which did not include\n            depreciation and equipment renewal (based on the PAD model,\n            depreciation is shown after operational cost coverage).\n            Experience with other centers is mixed: while the Cote\n            d'Ivoire figures include depreciation (with increasing\n            cost coverage), the Senegal figures do not (also with\n            increasing cost coverage). In any case, in view of the\n            \"public good\" nature of training, public subsidies\n            may include investment in new equipment or, in effect\n            depreciation. Further lessons address the importance of\n            monitoring and performance indicators; of coordination\n            within the network and maximizing video utilization; to\n            focus on electrical and technical challenges; and, the\n            problem of a continued dependency and Bank support."}, "docdt": "2005-01-06T00:00:00Z"}
