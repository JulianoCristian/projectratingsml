Distance learning\n            will be further expanded through experience, and information\n            exchange. The components include: 1) the establishment of a\n            distance learning center (DLC) to both retrofit, and upgrade\n            certain facilities, to provide videoconferencing, while\n            outfitting a computer room for 30 stations - to include\n            hardware, software, and internet availability. A technical,\n            and administrative center will be installed, with the\n            necessary upgrading of electrical, and telephone wiring.\n            Further DLC equipment will be supplied, including the\n            installation of the Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) - a\n            satellite communications terminal -, video,\n            telecommunications, and microprocessor equipment; 2)\n            operational, and financial assistance for DLC's\n            viability. This component will finance technical assistance,\n            over a 3 year period, for Center staff training, and,\n            implementation of periodic evaluations of the Center's\n            operations, and management, and, its financial accounts,\n            with the respective annual audits. Marketing, and transport\n            of DLC's services will be facilitated, and provided, respectively."}, "docdt": "2000-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
