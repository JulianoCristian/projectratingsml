MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMFC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR AN EDUCATION SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for SDRl3.2 million (US$18.2
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would help finance an
education sector restructuring project. The project would be cofinanced by the
African Development Bank (AfDB) in the amount of US$17 million equivalent.
2.        Background.  The Government spends 222 of its budget on education, but
the impact of these expenditures on economic and social development is weakened
by several interrelated distortions in resource allocation and use as evidenced
by: (a) low development of primary education juxtaposed with excessive growth
of secondary and higher education -- while Mauritania has the highest enrollment
ratio in tertiary education in the Africa Region, its primary enrollment ratio
(55?) is well below the regional average (about 80?). Further growth of primary
education is constrained by the low priority given to such education in the
education budget (its share of the budget declined from 462 in 1975 to 32? in
1987, while that of higher education increased from 15? to 25Z); (b) mismatch
between output mix and labor market demands -- the recent years' rapid growth in
secondary and higher education has been in humanities and social science
programs, which offer poor employment prospects, and has not addressed shortages
for technicians and skilled workers outside the mining and industrial sectors;
(c) low internal efficiency -- 20X of primary school pupils are repeaters and
only one-third of those who take the school leaving examination pass. The pass
rate for the baccalaureat declined from 50? in 1980 to 26? in 1987, and only 22?
of those who enter the University graduate. The low efficiency is caused by
overcrowded classes in primary education, lack of selectivity in admission to
secondary education and to the University, and lack of pedagogical materials and
equipment at all levels of education; (d) high unit costs -- due to a high
proportion of foreign teachers in secondary and higher education, low internal
efficiency, high capital costs, inefficient use of existing facilities, high
student subsidies, and weak education sector management capacity.
3.        The Government has developed and started to implement a strategy aimed
at correcting the above distortions and weaknesses. The strategy gives priority
to expansion of and quality improvements in primary education, and to the
restructuring of secondary and higher education in order to align the
development of these two sub-sectors with present resource constraints and
trends in labor market demands.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Government has requested IDA
assistance to accelerate the pace of implementation of the above strategy. The
strategy addresses high priority issues in the education sector, and should be
supported by IDA as an integral component of Mauritania's broader economic
recovery program. Under the project, IDA would help Mauritania: (a) introduce
reforms that would bring about major improvements in the quality and relevance
of education; (b) protect and expand primary education during this period of
overall economic adjustment; and (c) coordinate donor assistance to the
education sector within a common framework.
5.        Project Obiectives.  The project would help:  (a) correct distortions
in costs and resource allocation in the education sector; (b) expand access to,
and improve the quality and relevance of primary education; (c) improve the



internal and external efficiency of secondary and higher education; and
(d) improve the planning and managerial capacity in the education sector.
6.        Proiect Description.  The project would:  (a) implement a sectoral
adiustment program that would increase primary education's share of the educa-
tion budget, promote more efficient use of existing resources, and stimulate
increased private financing of education; (b) increase access to, and improve
the quality and relevance of primary education through (i) assisting local
communities to build/renovate about 300 classrooms using low-cost construction
techniques developed under the project, (ii) developing and printing about
350,000 textbooks and 60,000 teachers' guides, and providing in-service training
for all primary teachers, and (iii) introducing multi-grade and double-shift
teaching, strenigthening regional inspectorates, and transferring one of the
country's two teacher training colleges from a "high" to a 'low" enrollment
area; (c) improve internal and external efficiency of secondary and higher
education through (i) improving the quality of science teaching in secondary
educatiolL by revising programs, retraining all science teachers, developing and
printing about 120,000 science textbooks, providing science equipment, and
renovating about 100 classrooms, (ii) developing natural science programs in
higher education by providing pedagogical equipment and materials, and
renovating and constructing facilities, (iii) improving the quality and
relevance of technical secondary education by revising and diversifying
programs, upgrading admission requirements, developing the capacity to train
technical teachers, and creating two new schools -- one providing programs for
the commercial sector, and the other programs in support of the rural economy
along the Senegal River, (iv) strengthening and diversifying vocational programs
to upgrade the skills of industrial and commercial manpower by providing
equipment and creating four new courses, and (v) establishing training programs
for the industrial fishing sector; and (d) reinforce the education sector's
planning and management capacity by developing the capacity of key ministries to
plan and monitor the use of education resources and to coordinate the provision
of training programs with trends in labor market demands.
7.          The project, to be carried out over a five-year period, provides
funds for civil works, furniture, equipment, pedagogical materials, training,
specialist services, and incremental operating costs. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$37.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$28.5 million (76Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Mauritania
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively, followed by a map of the country.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7213-MAU dated June 28, 1988, is also attached.
8.          Agreed Actions.  Under the project's sectoral adjustment program,
the Government has agreed to implement several cost-saving and budget reallo-
cation measures, including: (a) a freeze through FY1993, at the 1987 level, of
scholarship budgets for secondary and higher education, and new admission to
upper secondary education; and (b) a containment of the growth of other
recurrent expenditures for secondary and higher education. Furthermore, the
Government has agreed to increase the recurrent budget for primary education by
9Z annually through FY1993. Together, these and other agreed-upon actions would
increase primary education's share of the education budget from 32Z in 1987 to
44Z in 1993. The Government has also agreed to: (i) sell textbooks produced
under the project and use the proceeds for textbook renewal; (ii) stimulate the
provision of private education; (iii) develop measures to involve employers in
decisions on course content and financing of technical and vocational education;
and (iv) ensure that student boarding and restaurant facilities at the Higher
Institute of Science be self-financing. Implementation of these actions would



- 3 -
be monitored during an annual review meeting during which the Government would
also a3ree with IDA on the recurrent budget for education for the upcoming
fiscal year, and on the investment budget for the education sector for the
coming three years.
9.          Benefits.  The sectoral adjustment program would help reallocate
education resources in favor of primary education, thus ensuring an adequate
level of investment in basic education services during this period of overall
economic adjustment, and a redistribution of the benefits generated by public
education spending in favor of the less well-off social groups (between school
years 1986/87 and 1993/94, the primary enrollment ratio would increase from 55%
to 74?, and the share of girls in total enrollment from 401 to 44Z). Together,
the project's investment and adjustment measures would help increase the social
returns to all levels of education by improving the skill levels of the labor
force, thereby increasing its contribution to growth in the fishing, service and
informal sectors, and improving its mastery of the technologies needed to
exploit the country's meager agricultural and water resources. Most students
would benefit from the project through more relevant programs, improved
availability, relevance and quality of pedagogical materials and equipment,
better trained teachers, and improved school buildings.
10.         Risks.  The main risks are:  (a) the Government's ability to contain
growth of secondary and higher education, and hence to provide the resources
required to achieve the targets for growth in primary education and for quality
improvements at all levels of education; and (b) the capacity of the economy to
generate gainful employment for technical and vocational education graduates.
To address the former risk, the sectoral adjustment program includes specific
measures to redirect growth in enrollment and education budgets in favor of
primary education; implementation of these measures would be monitored through
joint Government/IDA annual reviews. To minimize the latter risk, investments
are directed towards sectors where there are demonstrated skill shortages,
programs would be kept flexible to respond to changes in labor market demands,
and employers would participate in both the development and the financing of
training programs. The reinforcement of the Government's capacity to plan and
monitor the development of the country's human resources would also help
minimize these risks.
11.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
