This project was aimed to: (a) correct\n            distortions in resource allocations and use in the education\n            sector; (b) increase access to, and improve the quality, of\n            primary education, and improve; (c) the quality of science\n            teaching in secondary and higher education; (d) the quality\n            and relevance of technical and vocational education; and (e)\n            education sector planning and management capacities.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were\n            as follows: (i) the approach to community participation\n            whereby participation was not limited to contributions in\n            cash or in-kind, but encompassed community management of the\n            construction process, including financial management; (ii)\n            verifiable and transparent criteria for the allocation of\n            funds; (iii) simple disbursement procedures which allowed\n            rapid reimbursements to communities for work completed; (iv)\n            good technical support services provided to communities; and\n            (v) strong local support for the program."}, "docdt": "1996-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
