assistance to CED; and (c) urgent road maintenance works.\n            The Project would reduce transport costs on a major artery\n            in south-central Somalia, the Afgoi-Baidoa road, which\n            connects Mogadishu--principal port and capital city--with\n            Baidoa, the administrative capital of the Bay Region which\n            has a vast agricultural potential. It would also protect\n            past capital investments by extending the road's\n            service life. In addition, the Project would assist the\n            Borrower in improving its road maintenance planning,\n            organization and operations."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
