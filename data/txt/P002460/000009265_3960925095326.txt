FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 1324-SO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Highway
Project in Somalia for which Credit 1324-SO in the amount of US$23.0
million was approved on February 15, 1983.   The credit was closed on June
21, 1989, at which time SDR 186,563 was canceled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the Eastern Africa Department in the Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Part I and Part III). On January 28, 1991 comrments on the report
were solic ted from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, a
co-financie', but none were received as of February 28, 1991.
Preparation of this PCR was started in October 1990 and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit
Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.
on September 13, 1990 the Bank sent the Borrower a request to
prepare Part II but, as of February 28, 1991, no reply was received.

(Credit 1324-SO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUNWALY
Obiectiv-s
The objectives of the Project (from SAR 3604-SO) were to i)
protect the capital investment in and increase the service life of a
primary road in south-central Somalia; ii) help improve road maintenance
planning, organization and operations; and iii) help alleviate the starfing
shortage of the Civil Engineering Department (CED), forerunner of the
Directorate of Highways, within the Ministry of Public Works and Housing
(MPWH) (para. 4-5).
ImlDementation Experience
Implementation of the main civil works component of the Project,
the strengthening and improvement of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road, was hindered by
several problems which contributed to its late start, the truncating of the
sc.ope of work and its resultant early completion. The late start was
caused by a delay in Credit effectiveness caused by difficulties in
obtaining the Borrower's legal opinion, which, in turn, delayed the
mobilization of the contractor, approval of the contract having been given
before Credit effectiveness. The truncating of the scope of the main civil
works was caused by the withdrawal of financial support in the amount of
US$14 'nillion by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD)
owing to the Borrower's being in default on earlier AFESD loans. A
decision was taken to complete as much of the original project design as
could be financed by IDA and GOS alone, without increasing the planned
financial contribution from either source of funds. The reduced scope of
work, about 35% of the original length of the road, was completed seven
months before the completion date estimated at the time of Project
appraisal (para. 12-13).
The technical assistance component of the Project was implemented
without undue problems. A team of advisors assisted with the preparation
of a Road Maintenance Study and the strengthening of the highway
maintenance capacity of MPWH. The inadequate provision of recurrent funds
allocated by GOS to road maintenance precluded the possibility of posting
the technical assistance team to regional headquarters. The project
closing date was extended once by 12 months to allow the team to complete a
small training program. Emergency road repair works were undertaken by the
Ministry with the help of the technical assistance team (para. 14)
Results
The objective of increasing the service life of the Afgoi-Baidoa
Road was only partly achieved for reasons beyond the control of the
implementing agency (para. 17). Approximately 80 km of the original 216 km
of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road was strengthened and improved. Urgent repairs to
critical elements in the main north-south "spine" road in the country were
undertaken. The project yielded significant institutional changes which
flowed from the recommendations of an important Road Maintenance Study
financed under the project. Despite the delays incurred while GOS studied
the advice contained in the Study, by 1988 the following major innovations
had been introduced in the way maintenance of roads was to be managed in
the future:



- iii -
a)    The Civil Engineering Department (CED) was transtor.ned into a
single-purpose Department of Highways and subsequently up-graded
to the level of an autonomous self-budgeting Directorate of
Highways (DOH) under the Ministry of Public Works and Housing
(MPWH);
b)    DOH gained direct control over all road maintenance activities in
7 newly defined Highway Maintenance Areas throughout the country;
and
C)    MPWH established a Road Maintenance Fund to be generated by
revenue raised by means of a motor fuel tax, thereby increasing
the potential for adequate funding for road maintenance in the
years to come. To date, however, sources of funding have been
insufficient to adequately finance road maintenance.
Sustainability
The institutLonal accomplishments of the Project set the stage for
future improvement in road maintenance in Somalia. It remains for
Government to utilize the framework by creating the appropriate conditions
under which the Road Maintenance Fund can generate adequate resources tc
finanoe routine road maintenance activities. Measures to be taken to
achieve this goal include eliminating the subsidy which exists in the price
of motor fuels, revising the fuel levy to be an ad valorem tax, and
expanding the tax base of the Fund to include not only diesel but also
gasoline. Provision for these policy dctions have been made in a proposed
IDA-financed follow-up project (para 23).
However, political developments in the Persian Gulf in August 1990
coupled with national macroeconomic imbalances indicate that Government
will find it difficult to pursue further progress in road maintenance.
High fuel prices, caused by the Persian Gulf crisis in the last quarter of
1990, has made it difficult for the Government to reach import parity
pricing let alone implement revised tax schedules on motor fuel to finance
road maintenance. In the short to medium terf, continuing internal
political discord militates against improved operations of the re-
constituted DOH in most areas of the country. Once political and economic
stability return to the country, DOH will require further assistance to
activate the mechanisms at its disposal tc implement an eftective national
road maintenance program.
Findings and Lessons
The principal lessons include the following:
a)    IDA should carefully assess the risk involved in giving no
objection to the award of a large contract before Credit
effectiveness, especially if a significant amount of unsecured co-
financing is involved;
b)    Projects which call for a significant level of technical training
should include specialists who are knowledgeable not only about
the technical area concerned but who are also knowledgeable about
effective and appropriate methods of experiential learning; and
C)    Under conditions where the Borrower's capacity to prepare
financial audits of project accouncs is limited, IDA should
include funds for their preparation by external auditors,
including international auditors if necessary.

Countrys             Somalia
Sectors              Transport
Subsectors           Highways
a  .    Prolt Background
1.       SQctor DeveloRment Obiectives.  Government's broad objectives in
the transport sector, as enunciated at the tin,e of project preparation
(Five-Year Development Plan - 1982-85) included: a) opening aew areas for
development 'n order to increase the productive capacity of the economy} b)
fostering economic integration of relatively isolated areas; and c)
facilitating movement of goods within the country at low cost. The overall
objective was to promote regional development and the efficiency of the
transport system as a support to other economic sectors. Somalia's
specific objectives in the highways sub-sector included upgrading primary
and secondary roads in order to prevent serious traffic interruptions
during rains and to reduce vehicle operating costs.
2.       Policy Context.  In 1980 transport infrastructure in Somalia was
composed of about 21,600 km of roads of which only 2,460 km were paved,
three principal ports, and fifteen airfields, four of which had paved
runways. There were no railways, pipelines or inland waterways. Coastal
shipping, whb_ch once linked economically active coastal cities, has
essentially ceased. In the period 1974-1978 planned transport investments
accounted for 20 percent of total public investment. The road network,
absorbing 63 percent of transport investment, formed by far the most
important means of transport in the country. The situation in 1991 remains
basically the same - only that there are now 21,830 km of road of which
2,757 km are surfaced. Because of the high foreign cost element (95%) in
the road transport system composed of both roads and vehicles, traditional
(non-motorized) means of moving people, goods and servicen within the
country are still common practice.
3.       At the time of project inception there were still three Ministries
involved in the road transport sector: i) Ministry of Public Works and
Housing (MPWH), through its Directorate of Highways (formerly Civil
Engineering Department), responsible for planning, constructing and
maintaining roads, ii) Ministry of Land and Air Transport (MLAT)
responsible for vehicle registration; and iii) Ministry of National
Planning (MNP) responsible for general planning of the sector and
monitoring project implementation. As a result of Project implementation,
the institutional structure within MPWH has been improved to give greater
autonomy and control to the Directorate of Highways (DOH) to carry out its
mandate with regard to road maintenance (Section F. below).
C.       Proiect Obiectives and Descrintion
4.       Project Obiectives.   The objectives of the Project (from SAR
3604-SO) were to:
a)    protect the capital investment in and increase the service life of
a primary road in south-central Somalia;
b)    help improve road maintenance planning, organization and
operations; and



- 2 -
C)    help alleviate the staffing shortage of the Civil Engineering
Department (CED), forerunner of the Directorate of Highways,
within the Ministry of Public Works and Housing.
5.       Proiect Components.  The Project consisted of the following
components:
a)    strengthening and improvement of the Afgoi-Baidoa road (216 km.)
and related supervision;
b)    consultancy services for:
i)    a countrywide road maintenance stmdy; and
ii)   technical assistance to the CED; and
C)    assistance for urgent road maintenance needs.
D.       Proisct Design and Organization
6.       Proiect Design.  The Afgoi-Baidoa Road was originally constructed
in 1971 with EDF and IDA assistance. The pavement was designed for a
service life of seven years using staged construction. By 1980 the road
had not been resealed since its construction and was showing signs of
distress, having reached the end of its economic life. The technical and
economic study for strengthening and improvement of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road,
including detailed engineering design, was u:dertaken by British
consultants during the nine months ending mid-1981. The design standards
adopted for the Afgoi-Baidoa Road were in accordance with the national
primary road standards and the road improvement and strengthening works
were designed for a service life of 20 years. The Project was appraised
immediately after the design was complete in May 1981.
7.       The technical assistance component of the Project was designed to
strengthen CED's road maintenance operations, prepare and monitor the road
maintenance budget, improve the traffic count system, and to draw up and
implement a staff training program. The design of the component was based
primarily on the supply of 180 person-months of long-term technical
assistance.
8.       The road maintenance study was intended to make recommendations
about improving road maintenance planning, organization and financing and
to define a five-year comprehensive road rehabilitation and maintenance
program which could form the basis for future assistance to the country.
9.       The urgent road maintenance works, identified as part of the Rorn
Maintenance Study, included the repair of 21 bridges along the Bulo Burti-
Beletweine Road.   Design of the repairs was undertaken by CED, assisted by
an American firm of consultants.
10.      Proiect Organization.    The  strengthening/improvement of the
Afgoi-Baidoa Road was carried out by a Chinese contractor under the
supervision of the British consultants on behalf of CED. The Chinese
contractor also carried out the urgent repair of bridges on the Bulo
Burti - Beletweine Road under the supervision of the CED. The US
consultant provided CED with technical assistance and training, including
the preparation of a national road maintenance study.
11.      Financing for the project was provided by IDA, the Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development (AFESD) and the Borrower as shown in Table
4.



- 3-
X.       Prolect Implementation
12.      afgoo-Baidoa Road Strenathening and Improvement.  After an
unsuccessful first attempt to invite international competitive tenders for
the work, which resulted in only one submission with a price three times
higher than the engineer's estimate, IDA, AFESD and GOS agreed to
r.tendering.   Seven prequalified firms participated and the contract was
awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder, the Chinese contractor,
in the amount of US$29.7 million equivalent. The contract was signed in
May 1983 and called for a completion date of February 14, 1986, after a
contract period of 32 months. The order to commence work was given In June
1983, five months after Credit negotiations but four Lnonths before Credit
effectiveness. The delay in Credit effectiveness, caused by a delay in the
receipt of the Borrower's legal opinion, forced a delay in the release of
mobilization payinents by both IDA and AFESD which in turn slowed the
contracto:s i mobilization rate. Credit effectiveness was declared in
September i983 and construction of the permanent works was started in
December 1983. Physical progress was slow during the first year of
implementation owing to problems with site management and organization on
the part of the contractor. After senior personnel changes were
implemented, initiated by IDA, progress improved such that by mid-1984, 25
percent of the work was complete.
13.      In July 1984, AFESD suspended disbursements of the remaining US$14
million out of a total of US$16.3 million provided as J.cint co-financing
for the Project. The reason given was GOS's being in default on other
AFESD loans. Despite a multi-donor agreement in February 1985 to
reschedule Somalia's international debts, AFESD did not resume
disbursements. To avoid closure of the works, agreement was reached in May
1985 by IDA and GOS that IDA would take over the outstanding contract
payments from the AFESD and the scope of the project would be reduced to
fit within the amount of funds available from IDA and GOS. In addition to
the already completed section beginning at Afgoi up to km 69, the funds
(after reallocation) were used to complete items of work already in
progress, undertake repairs of the worst parts of the remainder of the
road, and to compen%atA the contractor for his losses caused by the
reduction in the scope of the work. The reduced contract was substantially
completed in September 1985 at a cost of US$21.3 million equivalent.   The
reduction in the scope of the work on the Afgoi-Baidoa Road rep-esents the
most critical variance between the planned and actual implementation of the
Project.   The withdrawal of AFESD financial support in mid-stream was an
event which could not have been foreseen. The decision to alter the
contract and allow the contractor to complete in an orderly manner an
amount of work commensurate with the available funds was the most
appropriate solution at the time. Other alternatives, including
terminating the contract and suspending further IDA disbursements because
of cross-conditionality with AFESD, would have yielded lower overall
results.
14.      Road Maintenance Study and Technical Assistance to CED.   Both the
Road Maintenance Study and the technical assistance to CED were provided by
the U.S. firm of consultants. The study, prepared over a two year period,
wae submitted in final form in September 1986. The issues addressed in the
Study included the economics of road maintenance, a proposed Five-Year
Maintenance Program, suggested administrative and organizational changes in
the sector, priority road maintenance needs, manpower deve:.r-.nent and
training considerations and a plan for technical assistance to support
implementation of the recommendations.
is.      Under the Project, a technical assistance team provided by the US
Consultant assisted DOH to strengthen its administration and to improve
highway operations. The 6-member team comprised a road maintenance
engineer (team leader), a road design/construction engineer, a road



-4-
maintenance superintekident, two workshop superintendents, and an
administi.ttive/financial officer. The technical assistance ctaff provided
formal and on-the-job training to a number of Somali engineers and other
categories of staff (mechanics, drivers, operators); however, the value of
courses and on-the-job training for the other categories was limited due to
the iack of actual road maintenance work in the field, the result of
inadequate recurrent finance from Government. Also, four engineers
received six months training at the New Mexico Department of Highways; two
engineers attended one month courses at the Eastern and Southern African
Management Institute (ESAMI), Tanzania; and three engineerm received
training abroad, two in UK and one in Yugoslavia.
All six members of the consultant's team remained stationed in Mogadishu
throughout the Project because GOS fund. allocated for road maintenance
were too meager to justify their posting to regional headquarters. The
contract for technical assistance was amended eight times between 1984 and
1989 owing to the need to make adjustments in the contract period, the
exchange rate, person-months of TA provided, travel and education units and
costs, and the provision for training. During the same period the
consultant was engaged to prepare the detailed engineering study for
resealing/rehabilitation of sections of the Mogadishu - Galkayo, appraised
as part of a proposed follow-up IDA-financed project. The design study was
financed from a Project Preparation Facility provided as part of the
follow-up project. Applications for withdrawal of IDA funds occasionally
confused the two contracts with resultant lack of clarity in record-
keeping.
16.      Uraent Road Maintenance Works.  The Chinese contractor, selected
under LCB procedures, repaired 21 bridges on the Bulo-Burti - Beletweine
Road under the terms of a 16-month contract finally valued at US$650,000.
Work was completed in October 1987.
P.       Prolect Results
17.      The objective of increasing the service life of the Afgoi-Baidoa
Road was only partly achieved for reasons beyond the control of the
implementing agency. Approximately 80 km of the original 216 km of the
Afgoi-Baidoa Road was strengthened and improved. The recalcalated ERR was
determined to be 16.2%, a result within the range of 15% - 23' estimated
for the corresponding road sections at the time of project appraisal
(Annex). The similarity between the ERR in the SAR and recalculated ERR is
attributed to the higher actual costs of the civil works per km being
offset by the higher traffic volume than anticipated at appraisal. It
should also be noted that owing to a lack of reliable data, the
recalculated ERR does not include benefits accruing in the form of deferred
reconstruction ccvts. Had these been included, thb recalculated ERR would
have been higher.
18.      The economic costs of the project were assumed to be made up of
the actual final cost of the road (US$26.43 million including design and
supervision) as determined at the time of the completion of the road in
1985 and the estimated vehicle operating costs prepared by the consultants
in 1988. The actual average cost of the civil works was US$300,000 per km
as compared with US$185,000 per km &t appraisal. All costs were brought to
a 1985 base, the year during which the largest project investment was m&de.
19.      After the road section was rehabilitated, one traffic count was
carried out in 1986 as part of the preparation of the National Transport
Master Plan. Total daily traffic on the rehabilitated road section was 726
vehicles of which 61% were light and the balance were heavy. Daily traffic
on the unrehabilitated section of the road was measured at 514 vpd. On the
whole, the actual traffic was higher than what was estimated in the Staff
Appraisal Report for the corresponding road sections, estimated to be
between 350 and 700 vpd in 1985/86.  Taking into account the GTZ-financed



5
Master Plan and more recent forecastc for Somalia's economy showing lower
overall growth, the annual traffic growth rate was revised downwards from
5% in the SAR to 2% for purposes of determining the recalculated stream of
benefits, i.e., savinqs in vehicle operating costs over the twenty-year
economic life of the road.
20.      In addition to the rehabilitation of part of the Afgoi-Baidoa Road
and the complet'on of urgent repairs to critical elements in the main
north-south "spine" road in the country, the project yielded significant
institutional changes. Institutional reform flowed from the
recommendations of the Road Maintenance Study. Despite the delays incurred
while GOS studied the advice contained in the Study, by 1988 the following
majo.. innovations had been introduced in the way maintenance of roads was
to be manageds
a)    CED was transformed into a single-purpose Department of Highways
and subsequently up-graded to the level of an autonomous self-
budgeting Directorate of Highways (DOH) under MPWH;
b)    DOH gained direct control over all road maintenance activities in
7 newly defined Highway Maintenance Areas throughout the country;
c)    DOH retained the services of several trained Somali engineers who
now form the backbone of the technical capacity of the
Directorate; and
d)    MPWM  established a Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) to be generated by
revenue raised by means of a motor fuel tax. However the RMF
still needs assurances that adequate funding will be provided.
21.      Training of CED staff was not especially effective owing to the
delay in preparing a suitable training program (a training proposal was
submitted to IDA three years after the date agreed at negotiations) and the
absence of a qualified specialist in human resource development on the
expatriate technical assistance team (para. 15).
22.      At the same time there exists a situation, exogenous to the
Project, which has offset the institutional gains outlined &bove. This is
the continuing erosion of civil service salaries and benefits in the face
of high rate of inflation in Somalia. Inflation has been caused both by
unconstrained growth of the money supply and rapid devaluation of the local
currency vis a via the US dollar during the project implementation period.
At appraisal in May 1981 the Somali shilling/US dollar exchange rate was 15
to 1 whereas by the time of project completion in June 1989 it was 400 to
1. By October 1990, the rate had soared to nearly 3,000 to 1. The current
levels of remuneration received by even the highest level of the civil
*           service fall far short of a living wage.   Consequently many staff have
left DOH for better job opportunities in the private sector and others who
want to leave and are restricted from leaving feel little obligation to job
performance. In theory, revenue generated by the RMF should be adequate to
provide, inter alia, the necessary staff incentives. However the current
fuel tax levy earmarked for the RMF amounts to a token So. Shs. 0.2 per
liter, a specific tax rate unchanged since the establishment of the Fund on
September 1, 1988.
O.      1!rogint Sustainabilitv
23.      The institutional accomplishments of the Project set the stage for
future improvement in road mainienance in Somalia.  It remains for
Government to utilize the framework by creating the appropriate conditions
under which the RMP can generate adequate resources to finance routine road
maintenance activities, estimated to cost US$1.2 million per year (1989



-6-
prices). Measures to be taken to achieve this goal include eliminating the
subsidy which exists in the price of motor fuels, making the fuel levy an
ad valorem tax rather than a specific one, and expanding the tax base of
the RMF to include not only diesel but also gasoline. These measures were
embodied in the conditionality of a proposed follow-up project.
24.      However, political developments in the Persian Gulf in August 1990
coupled with national macroeconomic imbalances indicate that Government
will find it difficult to pursue further progress in road maintenance.
High fuel prices, caused by the Persian Gulf crisis in the last quarter of
1990, has made it difficult for the Government to reach import parity
pricing let alone implement revised tax schedules on motor fuel to finance
road maintenance. In the short to medium term, heightened internal
political discord militates against improved operations of the re-
constituted DOH in most areas of the country. Once political and economic
stability return to the country, DOH will require further assistance to
activate the mechanisms at its disposal to implement an effective national
road maintenance program.
H.       Bank Performance
25.      Through the Fourth Highway Project, the Bank made a positive
contribution to the development of the road transport sector. Bank staff
contributed to the success of the project through supportive working
relationships and professional advice. IDA attention given to the
resolution of the problem created by the withdrawal of co-financing by the
AFESD effectively saved the major component of the Project from collapse.
Bank records reflect very little official communication from AFESD after
the latter's withdrawal from the project, thereby creating a degree of
uncertainty abou..  the co-financier's possible actions in the situation and
thus making the preparation of contingency plans especially important.
IDA's intervention making GOS aware and accept the fact that no additional
AFESD funds would ce forthcoming after disbursements were suspended, was
fundamental to arriving at a successful outcome with a minimum of
disruption. The multitude of contracts for technical assistance each
bearing similar titles and descriptions created problems in the processing
of disbursement claims, with the result that the allocation of costs
between them was difficult to ascertain.
26.      The principal lessons include the following:
a)    IDA should carefully assess the risk involved in giving no
objection to the award of a large contract before Credit
effectiveness, especially if a significant amount of unsecured co-
financing is involved; and
b)    Projects which call for a significant level of technical training
should include specialists who are knowledgeable not only about
the technical area concerned but also knowledgeable about
effective and appropriate methods of experiential learning.
I.       Borrower Performance
27.      DOH performance was barely adequate despite heavy reliance on
foreign consultants. The Borrower was remiss in meeting standard reporting
requirements, including quarterly progress reports and annual audit
reporta. Productivity of DOH staff was low owing to low levels of
remuneration (para. 21).
28.      The major lesson suggests that where the Borrower's capacity to
prepare financial audits of project accounts is limited, IDA should include



- 7 -
funds for their preparation by external auditors, including international
auditors if necessary.
J.       Consultina services
29.      Consultant services for the supervision of the Afgoi-Baidoa road
rehabilitation were well delivered. Supervision missions gained the
impression that the assistance provided to the civil engineering contractor
who was relatively inexperienced with the working conditions of Somalia
was important and well done. Supervision reports were consistently
thorough and timely.
30.      Technical assistance provided to CED for preparation of the Road
Maintenance Study and for institutional strengthening was characterized by
a high turnover of staff who tended to act in line functions.  At times
local staff felt under-utilized. Stricter oversight by the consul'ant
firm's management would have been desirable in the preparation of the RMS
report.



PART II   PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER PERSPECTIVE
On September 13, 1990 the Bank sent the Borrower a request to
prepare Part II by November 30, 1990, but no reply was received.
