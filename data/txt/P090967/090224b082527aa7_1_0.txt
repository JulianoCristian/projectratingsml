                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is closing on June 30, 2014 and it is expected that about 98% of project funds will be utilized. Notably, with very close monitoring and careful planning, the project actually
                         ended up using nearly 30% additional funds in NPR terms due to exchange gain to support a much larger number of institutions and students than planned originally.

                         The main impact of the project has been successful piloting of several reforms despite post-conflict political instability, limited capacity and resistance to change from teachers and

                         students. The project interventions have now led to nation- wide consultations and demand for much bigger urgent reforms in the coming years. At the same time challenges are also
                         much bigger as the enrollment is growing at an unprecedented rate of about 20% per year.

                         The project has been able to fully achieve its development objectives and complete implementation albeit slow pace up to the first two years. In fact, it was expected that there would

                         be initial delays because many new concepts were being introduced under the project. After the Board approved restructuring in March 2011, implementation accelerated and has
                         now reached or exceeded 8/10 of revised (much enhanced) targets and new targets. One indicator (pass rate) was influenced by factors (rapid expansion) beyond the control of the
                         project.

                         The major achievements recorded under the project include: (a) Proficiency Certificate level (equivalent to grades 11-12) programs, which constituted a large percentage of total
                         tertiary enrollment, were phased out of universities and 944 community higher secondary schools including 214 for science stream in remote areas were supported to facilitate this
                         transition; (b) a Quality Assurance and Accreditation (QAA) system was initiated and 12 campuses (against target of 6) have been accredited so far (with about 60 more in the
                         pipeline); (c) four TU campuses were granted autonomy; (d) 28 new market oriented programs (against target of 20) were introduced; (e) over 700 research grants were made on a
                         highly competitive basis- resulting in PhD and MPhil scholars and noticeable increase in publications; (f) performance based grants were awarded to 89 community campuses
                         (against the original target of 10) selected on a highly competitive basis; (g) three small universities established through public-community/private partnerships opted for formula-
                         based funding; (h) 14,583 students (against a target of 7,800) from poor families, mostly from remote areas, received grants for higher secondary education and higher education
                         through a poverty targeted selection process; and (i) Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS) Reports are being published annually based on manually collected
                         data, and a web-based HEMIS Reporting has also completed testing phase. During FY2012-13, SHEP facilitated nation-wide consultations to prepare a Higher Education Policy.
                         However, the overall quality, especially program delivery and students' pass-rate, remain a challenge due to rapid expansion of higher education.

                         The outcomes on the first PDO related to quality, efficiency and relevance are as follows:(i) Quality and Accreditation System established as planned; (ii) twelve higher education
                         institutions accredited against the target of six; (iii) pass rates at the master's level are close to the target – 24.8% compared to the target of 26%; (iv) pass rates at the bachelor's
                         level will fall short of the target – 29.3% compared to the target of 36%; (v) share of enrollment in the science stream in participating community higher secondary schools has
                         exceeded the target – 2.9% compared to the target of 2.6%; (vi) share of enrollment in science, technology, management, and other employment/economic development focused
                         programs in participating higher education institutions has reached close to the target – 38.4% against the target of 39%; (vii) share of centrally run TU programs adhering to
                         academic calendar will fall short of the target – 57% compared to the target of 100%; (viii) number of new programs in science, technology, management, and other employment/
                         economic development focused programs in participating institutions has exceeded the target – 28 compared to the target of 20; and (ix) number of publications in refereed journals
                         has exceeded the target – 27 compared to the target of 20.

                         The outcomes on the second PDO related to equity are as follows: (i) share of enrollment of dalits and educationally disadvantaged Janajatis in participating higher secondary
                         schools exceeded the target – 7.0% compared to the target of 6.2%; (ii) share of girls' enrollment in participating higher secondary schools reached the target of 50%; (iii) share of
                         enrollment of dalits and educationally disadvantaged Janajatis in participating higher education institutions exceeded the target – 18.9% compared to the target of 13.5%; (iv) share of
                         girls' enrollment in participating higher education institutions exceeded the target - 47.4% compared to the target of 44%; (v) number of higher secondary students receiving financial
                         assistance exceeded the target – 7,391 compared to the target of 4,300; and (vi) number of higher education students receiving financial assistance exceeded the target - 7,192
                         compared to the target of 3,500.

                         Impressive progress was made on the following intermediate indicators: (i) enrollment in participating higher secondary schools exceeded the target – 210,100 compared to the target
                         of 163,000; (ii) enrollment in participating higher education institutions – 93,690 compared to the target of 80,000; (iii) number of TU autonomous campuses – 4 against the target of
                         3; (iv) draft higher education policy prepared as planned; (v) and higher education EMIS established as planned; (vi) UGC has submitted the Higher Education Policy for Government
                         approval. Government has also allocated some resources to continue major reforms beyond the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. UGC has forwarded the final draft of the Higher Education Policy for the Government's endorsement.

                         2. Based on the HEP and the Approach Paper to the Thirteenth Plan, Government has prepared Draft Higher Education Program for next six years. World Banks support in the next
                         phase of reforms in higher education will build on the Government program. PCN of the new project (Higher Education Reforms Project) was approved on March 28, 2014, and its
                         Pre-appraisal mission was carried out during June 2-10, 2014.

                         3. UGC will expedite coordination with all implementing agencies to work out the possible amount which would be left unspent by June 30, 2014. UGC in coordination with MOE and
                         MOF will facilitate the process to send a formal letter from MOF to the World Bank for cancellation of such amount by June 20, 2014. Thereafter, the task team will process for
                         restructuring (cancellation) to complete it before June 30, 2014. The unspent amount is estimated to be in between $ 1-2 million - project used nearly 30% additional funds in NPR
                         terms due to exchange gain.
