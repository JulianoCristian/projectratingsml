The changes are: the project closing date is to be\n            extended from January 15, 2014 to June 30, 2014 aligning it\n            with the International Development Association, or IDA\n            fiscal year (and also closely with the government fiscal\n            year). The extension is mainly to continue assistance to\n            financially poor students on scholarships and for research\n            scholars already supported by the project. The extension\n            will also facilitate continuity and smooth transition to a\n            new project under development. To facilitate the full and\n            optimum utilization of project resources, a final\n            reallocation of funds is proposed. The total reallocation is\n            SDR 1.775 million amongst categories of expenditure: SDR 0.6\n            million is to be reallocated to category 1A, 0.3 million\n            from category 1C, and category 5 each. Similarly, SDR 1.175\n            million is to be reallocated to category 2, SDR 1.00 million\n            from category 1D, SDR 0.04 million from category 4, and SDR\n            0.135 million from category 6."}, "docdt": "2013-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
