                         Implementation Status Overview
                         At the request of GON, the project closing date was extended in September 2013 by 5.5 months to June 30, 2014. The extension was granted mainly to continue assistance to
                         financially poor students on scholarships and for research scholars already supported by the project. Some reallocations were also made to provide grants to additional higher
                         secondary schools offering programs in science stream. Discussions on further support for reforms in higher education have commenced.

                         There is evidence of project progress against most of the project outcomes and intermediate results indicators, inter alia: (i) progressive building of the accreditation and quality
                         assurance system in the country with eleven institutions already accredited, against the project target of six; (ii) significant improvement in access to higher secondary and higher
                         education including from poor families with the number of enrolled students almost double the targets and the proportion of girls and dalits exceeding the targets; (iii) pass rates at the
                         Masters level are close to the target; and (iv) more higher secondary schools have introduced science streams. Seven out of ten PDO sub-indicators (under four outcome indicators)

                         have exceeded targets. However, due to a rapid expansion of higher education (beyond the control of the project) during the past six years – mostly in conventional programs
                         (humanities, education, management) with very large enrollment, the quality indicators such as pass rate at the Bachelors level will not be met by the closing date, and most of these
                         programs are also not following the academic calendar. Therefore, the DO rating is retained as “MS”. Further reforms would need to continue in the coming years.

                         Under the Student Financial Assistance Scheme, web-based student data processing, Proxy Means Testing (PMT) administration, grant distribution using e-banking and monitoring
                         are in place. The PMT approach is also being embraced by other GON agencies.

                         A total of 948 Community Higher Secondary Schools including 220 (including recently selected) with science stream, and additional 4 universities, 89 community campuses including
                         many from lagging regions, and more than 38 TU constituent campuses are receiving project support.

                         The Quality Assurance and Accreditation (QAA) system, established at the University Grants Commission (UGC) has received, national and international recognition. Apart from the
                         eleven accredited institutions, 14 others are in pipeline. Fifth round of the Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS) report (2011/12) has been published. The
                         development of a web-based National HEMIS and TU-EMIS is nearing completion.

                         A draft Higher Education Policy is under finalization. Building on the HEP, UGC in coordination with MOE has started preparation of a Nepal’s Higher Education Program for major
                         higher education reforms.
