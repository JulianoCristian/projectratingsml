﻿University Grants Commission
Second Higher Education Project
IDA Grants- H274- NEP
Audit observation
Performance of grants-Project has received Rs.2013.39 million till the end of this year. It
has selected 3 universities and 89 campuses to provide the grants to the maximum of
Rs.2.520 million for implementing the reform programme of these universities and
campuses as stipulated in strategic plan. We observed that the project has not carried out
any monitoring and evaluation regarding the utilization of grants amount by the concerned
universities and campus.
The project has targeted toachieve 36 % and 26 % passing rate in Bachelor and Master
Degree level respectively. However, after the completion of the project, it is found that the
passing rate has remained 29.33% and 24.83% respectively
Utilization of Grants - The project has provided capital grants of Rs.457.61 million for 203
community campuses and regular grant for 419 community campuses. The project has not
carried out monitoring about the utilization of the grants. The project should have provided
the grants to these campuses for construction of building on the basis of ownership of
premises. However,the project has provided the total amount of Rs.10 million to 4
campuses without produce of the entitlement documents and ownership
Grants for Development Board-The University Grants Commission Act, 2050, clause 6 (B)
states that the commission shall distribute grants to universities and their affiliated
campuses only.However, the project has provided Rs.47.5 million to Medical College
Promotion Development Board without complying the clause.
Central Account- The Central Account of Second Higher Education Project has shown
total expenditure of Rs.1856.996 million,but the project account shows total expenditure of
Rs.1565.933 million only.Thus, the project has shown Rs.291.063 million less than the
amount presentedin the central account, which should be reconciled and settled.

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying Project Financial Statements including Statement of Designated Account of
the "Second Higher Education Project" financed by IDA Grant H274-NEP as at 16 July 2014 (32 Ashad,
2071) and for the year then ended and a summary of accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Financial Statements in accordance
with the Government of Nepal (GON) accounting policies and relevant practices. This responsibility includes:
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud and error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Project Financial Statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the INTOSAI (International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions)
Fundamental Auditing Principles. Those Principles require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment. including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the
inancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness from accounting estimates
made by management. as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.
Opinion
Management letter highlighting areas for improving financial management is attached herewith.
In our opinion, the Project Financial Statements including Statement of Designated Account, in all material
respects. give a true and fair view of the financial position of the "Second Higher Education Project" as of 16
JUIl 2014 (32 Ashad, 2071), and of the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with GON accounting policies.We also report that funds provided under IDA Grant H274-NEP have
been utilized for intended purposes.
