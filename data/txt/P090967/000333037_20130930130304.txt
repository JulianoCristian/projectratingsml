A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The proposed changes are:

1. The project closing date is proposed to be extended from January 15, 2014 to June 30, 2014 aligning it
with the IDA fiscal year (and also closely with the government fiscal year). The extension is mainly to
continue assistance to financially poor students on scholarships and for research scholars already supported
by the project. The extension would also facilitate continuity and smooth transition to a new project under
development.

2. To facilitate the full and optimum utilization of project resources, a final reallocation of funds is
proposed. The total reallocation is SDR 1.775 million amongst categories of expenditure: SDR 0.6 million
is to be reallocated to Category 1A - 0.3 million from Category 1C, and Category 5 each. Similarly, SDR
1.175 million is to be reallocated to Category 2 – SDR 1.00 million from category 1D, SDR 0.04 million
from Category 4, and SDR 0.135 million from Category 6.

B. Project Status
3. The pace of project implementation has been accelerated in a coordinated fashion at both the central and
field levels since a level 1 restructuring in March 2011. Most of the project supported Higher Education
(HE) reforms have been implemented and institutionalized. The reforms include (a) granting of autonomy
to selected institutions, (b) formula based funding of participating universities, (c) establishment of quality
assurance and accreditation (QAA) system, (d) leveraging competitive funding for quality research, (e)
improving market relevance of academic programs, (f) phasing-out/transfer of Proficiency Certificate
Level– PCL (equivalent to Grades 11 and 12) from the University to school system; (g) enhanced
community contribution in HE access/equity, poverty targeting for student assistance, and (i) the
development of a draft Higher Education Policy for further reforms. Disbursement is accelerating and has
reached 75% (80% of the original allocation, based on the rate between SDR and USD, and 75% based on
current rate).

4. The project is in its final year of implementation and is currently rated “moderately satisfactory” both in
terms of its achievement towards its development objectives and implementation progress. There is
evidence of project progress against most of the project outcome and intermediate results indicators, inter
alia: (i) progressive building of the accreditation and quality assurance system with ten institutions already
accredited against the target of six; (ii) significant improvement in access to higher secondary and higher
education with the number of enrolled students almost doubling with respect to the targets while at the
same time, the share of girls and dalits exceeded the targets; (iii) pass rates at the Master level are close to
the target; and (iv) more higher secondary schools are introducing sciences streams. However, due to rapid
expansion of higher education (beyond the control of the project) during the past five years – mostly in
conventional programs, some of the quality indicators would not be met by the closing date. Further
reforms would need to continue in the coming years.

5. The project is expected to accomplish most of its development objectives. During the July 2013 review
mission, the Bank and the Borrower have agreed on further actions that will be undertaken by the borrower
to complete the project. After a long time, financial management rating was upgraded from “moderately
unsatisfactory” to “moderately satisfactory” in July 2013. University Grants Commission is enhancing its
monitoring of covenants and financial management arrangements of the grant recipient institutions. This
needs to be continued and sustained. There are no outstanding audit reports under the Project.


                                                      5
6. More than 900 Community Higher Secondary Schools including 110 with science stream, 4 universities,
89 community campuses including from lagging regions, and more than 30 TU constituent campuses are
receiving project supports.

7. The Quality Assurance and Accreditation (QAA) system established at the University Grants
Commission (UGC) received national and international recognition. Ten institutions have been accredited
and 17 more are under review. Annual Higher Education MIS (HEMIS) report has been published
regularly during last 4 years; the development of a web-based HEMIS software at UGC and TU is nearing
completion.

8. A national Seminar chaired by the chairperson of the Council of Ministers to finalize the draft Higher
Education Policy was completed on August 14, 2013. The HE Policy would form the basis for major
higher education reforms for developing the necessary human resources and creating knowledge for
Nepal’s development.

9. Component-wise project status is presented below.

Component 1: Reform Grants
(a) Most of the revised targets under this component are met by the project. These include: (i) four TU
campuses obtained autonomy against the revised target of three; (ii) 49 TU campuses have become
decentralized against the target of 45; (iii) TU selected 25 new market relevant programs through a highly
competitive process against the target of 20; and (iv) three universities have subscribed to formula based
funding, meeting the project target.
(b) Most targets for research awards are reached. The project has supported: 300 Master/MPhil
dissertations; 80 PhD; 300 faculty research grants; 40 institutional research grants; 55 workshops on
research methodology and 30 workshops on culture of enquiry. A number of institutional development
activities were also supported, including strengthening of TU central library, establishing/upgrading
research management cells in 50 institutions, and conducting 25 university–industry dialogues. To ensure
the quality of research, the UGC has established a rigorous process of the evaluation of research proposals
and research outputs. Twenty one papers by SHEP supported research scholars have been published in
refereed journals against the target of 20; 40 other papers have been published in professional journals and
6 have been presented in international conferences. A number of papers have been submitted for
publication.

Component 2: Student Financial Assistance Scheme (SFAS)
(c) About 13,680 students have received scholarships against the project target of 7,800.
(d) A functioning, web-based Proxy Means Testing (PMT) scholarship administration system has been
established. The system simplifies the process of student identification, awarding, fund transfers, progress
monitoring, and fund utilization. The project has also adopted e-banking technology to efficiently release
scholarships to individual students’ bank accounts – SFAFDB can transfer more than 600 scholarship
payments per day to individual students’ accounts using its own staff in the office premise.
(e) MOE and its line agencies have now owned the PMT system. The PMT approach has also been well
embraced by other GON agencies, including the Poor Household Identification and Poverty Card
Distribution Office under the Ministry of Co-operatives and Poverty Alleviation.

Component 3: Higher Secondary Education
(f) More than 910 Community Higher Secondary Schools (CHSS), including 110 with science streams,
have received project support (EOP target is 470). This has helped significantly in enhancing access to
higher secondary education (Grades 11 and 12) in remote districts after the Proficiency Certificate Level



                                                    6
(PCL) was phased out from TU.
(g) Enrollment in the participating CHSSs has reached 208,468 compared to the end of project target of
163,000. Girls’ share in total enrollment has reached the project target of 50%. Marginalized communities
consisting of dalits and extremely marginalized janajatis constitute 7.36% of total enrollment (project
target is 6.20%). The share of enrollment in the science stream in the participating schools is 2.90%, higher
than the project target of 2.60%.

Component 4: System Capacity Strengthening
(h) Ten higher education institutions have been accredited against the target of six; two more have
completed the peer review process, five are under peer review and 10 others are in the immediate pipeline
for peer review; 41 institutions are preparing self-study reports and 26 others have submitted letters of
intent for accreditation. A number of private institutions too have applied for accreditation .
(i) UGC has received international recognition for its QAA work; it has become a member of Asia Pacific
Quality Network (APQN) and International Network of Quality Assurance Agency in Higher Education
(INQAAHE); UGC and APQN have agreed internship and other exchange programs.

C. Proposed Changes

Financing
Change in Loan Closing Date(s):
Explanation
10. The Borrower has requested extension of the current closing date of January 15, 2014 until July 15,
2014 to facilitate orderly closure of the project as well as to fully utilize the available project resources.
The task team recommends extension of the closing date to June 30, 2014, to match with the Bank's fiscal
year. The extension will help:

a) Continuation of assistance to poor students on scholarships and research scholars already supported
under the project;
b) Completion of some unfinished critical tasks – such as approval of HE policy and associated plan of
action; and studies agreed for completion report and for designing further reforms; and
c) Continuity and smooth transition to the next phase of reforms under consideration.

11. The Trust Fund will close on January 15, 2014 as scheduled.

Reallocations
Explanation
12. Due to more than 45% devaluation of NPR against USD and due to implementation delays till the Mid-
Term, some funds will not be utilized fully under the present categories of expenditure. On the other hand
there is a shortfall of funds especially under the Grant (Category 2) of the Higher Secondary Education
component - 99% of allocation has been disbursed and there is an urgent need to support schools with
science stream. Similarly, there is some shortfall of funds under UGC Reform Grant (Category 1A). To
facilitate the full and optimum utilization of project resources, a final reallocation of funds is proposed
following the Borrower’s formal request dated September 19, 2013. The total reallocation is SDR 1.775

SDR 1.00 million from category 1D, SDR 0.04 million from Category 4, and SDR 0.135 million from
Category 6.

13. No reallocation of proceeds under Trust Fund is proposed.
