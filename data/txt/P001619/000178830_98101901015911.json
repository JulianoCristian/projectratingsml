     Government in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of\n            its health delivery system. Specifically, it will: (a)\n            improve the MOH's ability to plan, monitor and evaluate\n            health programs and policies; (b) strengthen the MOH's\n            capacity to carry out epidemiological studies with\n            supporting laboratory services; (c) improve the system for\n            procuring and distributing pharmaceuticals; (d) extend\n            primary health care services to selected districts; and (e)\n            introduce child spacing services as an element of the\n            MOH's maternal and child health program. MOH will have\n            overall responsibility for project implementation. The\n            project is expected to significantly reduce recurrent\n            account budgetary outlays for pharmaceuticals and extend\n            primary health care services to 120,000 people. Successful\n            implementation of the project and preparation of an updated\n            ten-year national health plan will set the stage for\n            reductions in mortality and fertility. The national health\n            plan also will provide the basis for future investments from\n            both local and foreign sources."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
