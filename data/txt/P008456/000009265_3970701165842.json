The main\n            objective was originally intended to: (a) increase\n            utilization of domestic coal in primary energy generation in\n            accordance with Government policy at that time; (b)\n            reconstruct and rehabilitate 8 coal power stations belonging\n            to Hungarian Power Companies Limited (MVM) and upgrade other\n            MVM power stations, transmission and distribution systems;\n            and (c) improve MVM 's operational efficiency and\n            management. Bank performance can be considered satisfactory.\n            The performance of the Borrower was also satisfactory. The\n            key lessons learned in the project were: (i) more attention\n            should have been given at appraisal to cost comparisons\n            between indigenous coal and alternative energy options,\n            including environmental costs; (ii) it is important to take\n            account of the risks of actual demand turning out to be\n            different from forecasts, and to adjust investment programs\n            promptly to changed demand information; (iii) to avoid\n            procurement delays under international competitive bidding\n            the Bank should provide to new borrowers and beneficiaries\n            detailed information on its procurement guidelines during\n            project preparation; and (iv) financial covenants should be\n            flexible enough to ensure financial soundness of the\n            enterprises through periods of falling as well as increasing demand."}, "docdt": "1996-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
