                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the LGCBP has generally made progress in meeting its project development objectives in the three key PDO elements as follows: (i).standardized systems of accounting,
                         financial management and budgetary control have been developed, adopted and implemented in all 134 local governments, and this has been complemented by the design and
                         approval of an ISMIS that has already been introduced in a representative sample (33) of LGs (and is being rolled out in the remaining LGs under a well conceived program that is
                         facilitated by a "help desk" that has been set up and is in operation - - and is being sustained by support under the MDP); (ii) a series of initiatives in land use and physical

                         development planning, together with efforts to introduce a process of LG amalgamation where appropriate have been successfully introduced into a representative of LG clusters (4)
                         with others in process, and public participation in local government decision-making has been piloted; and (iii) some, more problematic efforts have occurred in building the capacity
                         of MOLG to enhance its internal systems and capabilities and organizational arrangements, as well as oversee the LG system (it has made progress with its responsibility for
                         monitoring LG budgets). It should be noted that the scope of activities under this sub-component was changed friom those outlined in the PAD to reflect the other donors providing

                         PAD for this aspect of the project were not particularly well reflected in the translation of the PAD indicators to the ISR To date, 90% of the grant proceeds are disbursed and more
                         than 99% of the proceeds are committed and likely to be disbursed within the disbursement period after grant closing.
