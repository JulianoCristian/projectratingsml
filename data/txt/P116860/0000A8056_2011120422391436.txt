                         Implementation Status Overview
                         LGCBP has made notable progress in meeting its project development objective (PDO). It has contributed towards reforms in financial and accounting systems, assisted in
                         developing and piloting reforms in physical planning procedures and piloted public participation process in local government decision making. To date, 70% of the grant proceeds are
                         disbursed and more than 90% of the proceeds are committed. However, the rating for project implementation progress has been downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory to reflect
                         the considerable delays in the roll out of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS)
