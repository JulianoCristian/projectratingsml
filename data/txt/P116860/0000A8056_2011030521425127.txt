                         The LGCBP is in process of achieving its objectives. To date, a total of US$6.8 million has been disbursed and about 92% of funds have been committed. Component 1 has been
                         supporting the Palestinian Authority (PA) in laying the foundation for implementing the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). Component 2 has provided
                         support in the development of a physical planning and procedures manual which has been adopted by the Ministry of Local Government (MOLG) and in the preparation and
                         completion of an operations manual for the amalgamation of local government units (LGUs). Component 3 has supported institutional strengthening of both the Municipal

                         still need to be included in the national curricula for urban planning.

                         The LGCBP remains strongly linked to the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan. In particular, the roll out of the IFMIS with an accrual-based accounting system is considered
                         one of the most significant reforms undertaken in local government in West Bank and Gaza (WBG) since it lays the foundation for improved municipal financial systems and
                         strengthens the capacity of local governments in this area.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Progress towards meeting the project development objectives (PDOs) is satisfactory. The LGCBP has supported the MOLG in the preparation of a physical planning policies and
                         procedures document which has been adopted and in the development and completion of a local government amalgamation strategy and related operations manual. The project has
                         laid the foundations for an improved municipal financial system by implementing the IFMIS. The project has experienced a number of delays as a result of the political situation in
                         WBG, the broad scope of reforms required in this project and contractual issues between FreeBalance and the MDLF. These issues have been resolved and reflected in a mutually
                         agreed contract amendment and action plan. The roll out and full implementation of IFMIS is currently underway and remains one of the most significant of a series of national
                         reforms being undertaken by the PA. In addition to the full implementation of the IFMIS, physical and management plans for a representative set of LGUs and Joint Service Councils
                         (JSCs) are also necessary to ensure the project meets its PDOs.
