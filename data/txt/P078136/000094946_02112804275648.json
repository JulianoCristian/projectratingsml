resulting\n            from the economic crisis, and its consequent fiscal impact,\n            by financing goods and services, necessary for service\n            delivery. To this end, the project will: a) finance the\n            non-salary recurrent expenditures of the core social\n            service-delivery ministries of Health, Education and Higher\n            Education, and Social Affairs, as well as other ministries\n            whose operating non-salary budgets, the Ministry of Finance\n            is unable to finance; and, b) finance the operating costs of\n            the project implementation unit within the Ministry of\n            Finance, and any other essential technical assistance needs\n            identified by the participating ministries. It is expected\n            funds will be fully disbursed by December 31st, 2004."}, "docdt": "2002-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
