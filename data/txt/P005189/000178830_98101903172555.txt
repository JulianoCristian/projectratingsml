REPORT AMD RECOkZIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO IRAN FOR A FIFTH ROAD PROJECT
1.        I subnit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Iran in an amount in various currencies equivalent to USWh2 million.
The loan would be used to assist the Government in financing the construction
of priority main roads, the purchase of maintenance equipment and consultants'
services.
PART I _ HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has made four loans for roads in Iran.  The first loan
in 1959 of $72 million, which financed the constructionl of some 2,700 km of main
roads, and the second loan in 1964 of $16.7 million for about 380 km of main
roads and engineering on about 3,200 km for future improvement, have been
fully disbursed. The tlhird road loan of 428 million for the construction of
about 1,600 km of roads, and the fourth road loan of $8.5 million for the
construction of about 1,850 l;m of feeder roads, were both made in 1965 and
are still being disbuirsed. Bank missions visited Iran in October 1969
and again in February 1970 to complete the appraisal of the fifth road
project.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed loan took place in Washington from
May 14 to 22, 1970. Mr. D. Oskoui, Assistant Managing Director of the Plan
Organization led the Iranian delegation which included Messrs. Afrooz, Taheri
and Nikain from the Plan Organization and Miessrs. Nasirain and idir-Hosseini
from the Ministry of Roads.

4.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's fifteenth loan to Iran.
The status of Bank loans to Iran as of April 30, 1970 was as follows:

5.        Disbursements for some projects have been slow and
action to speed up project implementation has been taken whenever
possible.  There have been delays in the Ghazvin Agricultural Project (517-IRN),
but a recent supervision mission noted improvements in the project implement-
ation.  Disbursements on the Dez Irrigation Project (594-IRN) have only receftJy
begun. This project was originally designed to promote improved small-scale,
traditional farming and to develop some large-scale farming; it now appears
that the Government will proceed with large-scale farming over a wider acruag"
than was originally contemplated. A mission has recently visited the project



area to assess the implications of this shift in emphasis and its report
is under preparation. As noted in a previous report (SecM69-278 of
May 23, 1969), disbursements on loans for highways have fallen behind
schedule for various reasons. In some cases disbursements had been delayed
because payments to contractors were in arrears. However, payments to
contractors which had been on average four months in arrears, were brought up
to date at the end of Iran's last fiscal year (March 20, 1970), and arrange-
ments are being made which should ensure that henceforth payments are kept
current with work performed. IMDEI is ahead of schedule in its commitment of
Bank loans and the undisbursed amounts represent funds which have been committed
or earmarked for projects which are in an advanced stage of preparation.
6.        Negotiation of a sixth loan to IMDEI in the amount of approximately
$50 million has recently been completed and the loan is expected to be
presented to the Executive Directors shortly.
7.        IFC has so far invested in two companies in Iran.  A loan of
US$300,ooo was extended in 1965 to Sherkat Sahami Khkashan, a manufacturer
of ceramic tiles. In 1967, a loan of USO3 million was made for the Ahwaz
Steel Mill, together with an equity investment of US$800,000. Several new
proposals are under consideration.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        A report entitled "Appraisal of A Fifth Road Project, Iran"
(PTR-53a) dated June 1, is attached.
'0.       Iron's Fourtli Plan (March 1968 to i!arch 1973) envisages total
expenditures of rials 480 billion ($6.8 billion equivalent), of which
17 percent (or $1.1 billion) is earmarked for transport. At the Government's
request, a Bank mission reviewed progress in the transport sector in late 1969.
The main conclusion of the review was that the overall financial and physical
targets for transport in the Fourth Plan were reasonable and acceptable.
However, tihere is a need for improved transport coordination and a better
basis for the selection of investment priorities among the various modes in
Iran.
11.       The highway network in Iran totals some 35,800 km, of which about
10,200 km (28 percent) are surfaced, 20,000 kmI (56 percent) are graveled and
the remaining 5,600 km (16 percent) are earth roads and tracks. The present
project will assist the Government in bringing its main road network to modem
highway standards and thus closely related to previous road projects.  The new
project will also focus on necessary institution building and particularly on
improving road maintenance. A detailed explanation of the project content is
given in Section 4 of the appraisal report.
12.       At the present time, the Plan Organization (PO) is responsible for
the planning, survey and design of roads, and the Iivnistry of Communications
and Roads (Miinistry) for execution and maintenance. Coordination between the
two agencies is poor and the PO presently performs several functions which could
properly be transferred to the Ministry. However, various improvements in the
organization of the Ministry are necessary before it can carry out additional
functions efficiently. Therefore, in addition to financing the construction
and improvement of about 550 Ian of priority main roads, the project will
finance managomcnt consultants' servicco to study and make recommendations
(i) for the establishment of a transport coordinating organization; and (ii) for
the reorganization of the Ministry of Roads and those departments of the Plan
Organization concerned with roads.
13.       Road maintenance has been neglected in Iran. The problem is not
only that the funds allocated for maintenance operations and equipment are
insufficient but also that urgent improvements are required in the structure
and organization of sections of the Ministry responsible for road maintenance.
The project provides $8.0 million for the purchase of necessary road maintenance
and workshop equipment and another important element in the project is the
provision of consultants' services to make recommendations for improvements in
road maintenance organization and practices.
14.       In order to assist in the preparation of projects for possible future
consideration by the Bank, the project will also provide for the financing of
feasibility studies and detailed engineering of other priority roads and a
study of the special and urgent transport requirements in the metropolitan
area of Tehran.



15.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$85 million equi-
valent.  The proposed loan of 4j2 million wjould cover the forcign exchange
cost of constructicn, consultants' services and the purchase of maintenance
equipment. The local currency cost will be met mainly by the Plan Organization
out of the development budget. Contracts for road construction and for the
supply of all major equipment -will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. The principal economic benefits deriving from the project
are savings in vehicle operating costs on the roads to be improved; these
savings will yield rates of return between 17 and 27 percent on the invest-
ments.
16.       Some delays in the performance of works and disbursements of previous
Bank road loans h-ve been caused by the failure to provide adequate local funds.
Therefore during negotiations agreement was reached that before the loan is
signed, the Government would supply the Bank with the details of the arrange-
ments agreed between the Plan Organization and the Central Bank to avoid
recurrence of this problem.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Government of
Iran and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and a draft resolution are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
18.       The provisions of the Draft Loan Agreement follow closely the pattern
of Bank loans for this type of project and previous road loans to Iran. Attention
should be called to Section 4.o4 (b) whereby the Government agrees to provide
adequate funds for road maintenance and to implement the recommendations of the
management consultant regarding transport coordination and institutional
reorganization and of the maintenance consultant regarding organization and
operation of the road maintenance department.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
19.       An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects of
Iran" (SA-8a) dated December 31, 1969 was distributed to the Executive
Directors on January 7, 1970 (R70-2).
20.       Since the early sixties, Iran's development efforts have met with
considerable success. Gross national product at constant prices has been growing
at more than 8 percent per annum and investment at more than twice the rate of
growth of income. These rates of growth were made possible largely by the rapid
increase in oil revenues during the period. However, in recent years the rate



- 6 -
growth of domestic savings, particularly in the public sector, has not kept
pace with the needs of Iran's very ambitious investment program. The
easuing savings gap was met by heavy reliance on short- and medium-term
foreign borroiing.
21,       The overall prospects for the continued growth of the economy are
favorable. Hlowever, if price stability is to be maintained and balance of
payments difficulties are to be avoided, the Government will have to take
measures to improve the mobilization of domestic resources for investment, the
quality of the investment program and the terms of foreign borrowing.  Over
the next few years, Iran will continue to need large amounts of external
financing and total external debt is likely to rise. At the present time
debt service (including service on private debt) represents about 18 percent of
foreign exchange earnings. wihile a country such as Iran, with a high and assured
level of foreign exchange earnings, can probably afford a higher debt service
ratio than countries not so favored, the sharp rise in Iran's debt service
obligations in recent years will have to be watched carefully. At the
present time, I consider Iran creditworthy for additional Bank lending.
PLART VI - COifTLIAACE ,',ITH VRTICLES OF AGREEMMT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan wll1 comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOCIEITAiTII-DT
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
