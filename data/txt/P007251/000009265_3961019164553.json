In 1988, the Government of Guyana (GOG) launched\n            comprehensive economic reforms under an Economic Recovery\n            Program (ERP). An IDA's Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (SAC) was part of the donor community's support for the\n            ERP. The main objectives of the ERP were to (i) restore\n            economic growth over the medium term; (ii) eliminate\n            internal and external imbalances, (iii) incorporate the\n            parallel economy into the official economy; and (iv)\n            normalize Guyana's financial relations with external\n            creditors. Overall performance of both IDA and the borrower\n            is rated as satisfactory. Overall, these are important\n            findings and lessons: a) commitments to thorough reforms\n            emphasizing macro-economic stabilization and\n            market-orientation can play a significant role in the\n            economic turnaround; b) revenue enhancement is at least as\n            important to restoring fiscal soundness as reductions in\n            real expenditures and needs to be one of the earliest\n            elements attended to in any adjustment program; c)\n            Participants in the parallel economy who are generally\n            averse to government regulations and taxation requirements\n            will rejoin the official economy in response to a\n            well-designed adjustment appropriately balancing the\n            incentive and revenue considerations; d) tranche release\n            conditions should be geared to successful implementation of\n            major policy changes; e) it is important that in parallel to\n            an adjustment program, an efficient and effective social\n            impact alleviation program be put in place early, carefully\n            identifying groups most likely to be affected; f) the\n            ability of the public sector to implement effectively its\n            development programs may be hampered by the sharp reductions\n            in real wages in the public sector, which make it difficult\n            to retain skilled technicians and managers, compromising the\n            sustainability of otherwise promising institutions to reform\n            and ; g) to ensure sustainability of a program involving\n            debt reduction work-out, it is important that all important\n            creditors be fully associated."}, "docdt": "1995-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
