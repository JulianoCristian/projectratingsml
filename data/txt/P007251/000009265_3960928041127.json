Specifically, the\n            proposed credit will support a reform program encompassing :\n            1) the improvement of the incentive framework through\n            reforms in domestic pricing, trade policies, and private\n            sector investment procedures; 2) improvement of public\n            sector finances through the elimination of central\n            government transfers to public enterprises, streamlining the\n            civil service, increasing revenue transferred by public\n            enterprises to the Central Government and divestment\n            programs for selected public enterprises; and 3) the\n            formulation of a realistic public sector investment program\n            consistent with the macroeconomic framework in terms of\n            size, composition and financing and also with the\n            country's implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "1990-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
