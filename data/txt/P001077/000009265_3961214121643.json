For this purpose, the project will\n            provide financing for technical and capacity building\n            services needed to: 1) revise the legal and regulatory\n            framework; 2) furnish adequate geological information to\n            private investors; 3) improve the efficiency of the\n            administration; and 4) restructure existing mining\n            operations in line with the new policies and regulations.\n            The project will comprise the following: 1) a legal\n            component, aimed at improving the overall legal and\n            regulatory framework for the mining sector; 2) a data\n            component, aimed at furnishing essential information for\n            investors and public administration, such a mining data bank\n            and a geological map; 3) an institutional component, aimed\n            at strengthening the government's capacity to\n            facilitate private investment and apply regulations in the\n            mining sector; and 4) a restructuring component, aimed at\n            preparing the restructuring of existing mining enterprises."}, "docdt": "1996-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
