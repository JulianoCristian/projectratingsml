   satisfactory, and sustainability is rated likely. Both the\n            overall performances of the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            assessed as satisfactory. The following positive lessons\n            have been learned from implementing the project: In\n            countries with weak implementation capacity, similar\n            services such as geological mapping, should preferably be\n            always contracted as long as there is insufficient local\n            capacity. The twinning arrangement with a geological survey\n            from an important industrialized country contributed to the\n            success of the arrangement. The small size of the unit and\n            the unrestricted direct access of the coordinator to the\n            Minister proved to be very efficient the team members worked\n            as civil servants, performing coordinating and\n            teaching/coaching tasks. The training projects executed\n            under the project had a significant motivating effect, for\n            the coordinating team as well as for the eligible staff from\n            the Ministry. Motivation was not only induced by\n            participation in foreign training but also by attending\n            local courses. Negative lessons learned were these: Changes\n            in civil servants' status cannot be achieved at the\n            sector level, but rather as part of a major cross-sectoral\n            operation. Lastly, inter-ministerial cooperation cannot be\n            achieved without a special framework set up in advance."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
