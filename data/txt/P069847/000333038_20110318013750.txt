F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Global Environmental Objective (GEO) is the improved conservation and sustainable use of
Medicinal and Herbal (MH) plants (several of which are rare and endemic, and thus of global
importance) at the national and the local levels through achieving specific targets over and above
the baseline scenario: (i) establishing a framework of M/H (medicinal/herbal) plant biodiversity
conservation and management; (ii) strengthening institutions and implementing a coordination
program; (iii) promoting in-situ conservation and sustainable use of M/H plants in 2 pilot sites;
and (iv) designing and implementing a communication strategy.

                 and North Africa (AARINENA) have been developed. A phased exit strategy of the
                 coordination mechanism through the PMU should have been foreseen in the project

  It is to be noted that a six points rating system (adding two intermediary categories MS= moderately
satisfactory; and MU= moderately unsatisfactory) was introduced only in late 2007. Before that and since
1999, a four point system (including, HS= highly satisfactory; S= satisfactory; U= unsatisfactory; HU=
highly unsatisfactory) was in use. The unavailability of intermediary categories (MS and MU) has
influenced the actual ratings provided in the ISRRs of the CMHPP till June 2007.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Jordan's flora is rich and diverse, including four bio-geographical regions and thirteen
vegetation types. The country's strategic location at the junction of three continents: Europe,
Asia and Africa, further enhances its global bio-diversity importance. Medicinal and herbal
(M/H) plants are distributed from the eastern desert to the western highlands and from the
semi-arid north to the extremely arid south, covering roughly 20 percent of Jordan's
rangelands and forest areas. The importance of these plants as a source of preventive and/or
curative health value (for both people and livestock) as well as herbs for food preparation is
well recognized by Jordanian people. A total of 485 species of medicinal plants, which belong
to 330 genera and 99 families have been reported including several rare and endemic, thus of
global importance2.

The Government of Jordan (GOJ) signed the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) since
1992. A National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) was prepared in 1996, and in 1998 the
Government, in collaboration with UNEP and UNDP, prepared the Country Biodiversity
Study; the purpose of the study was to ensure the conservation of the broadest range of
biodiversity and its rational use. In December 2002, GOJ endorsed the National Strategy for
Agricultural Development (NSAD) for the decade ending in 2010. The strategy highlights the
importance of conserving and expanding M/H plants in environmental and production
systems. Despite the general commitment of Government reflected in all referred documents,
there was inadequate knowledge concerning species that are used, their distribution,
modalities of collection and on prevailing threats on M/H plants. As for species which are
cultivated, while there is evidence of an increased domestic demand, information on how
demand is satisfied, on businesses and on trade is largely unreliable.

Thus, the Conservation of Medicinal and Herbal Plants Project (CMHPP) was conceived to
start operationalizing the country's global commitments and as the first initiative to address
conservation issues of M/H plants. Specifically, the Project was also designed to seek GoJ's
poverty reduction and rural development objectives. Jordan's authorities are well aware of the
importance of prudent management of scarce natural resources, which is why one of the four
2003 Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) pillars included "improving water resource
management and environmental protection" to which the project contributes. The Bank and
the GEF have collaborated with GOJ in implementing a number of conservation activities
(Strengthening of RSCN and Conservation of the Dana Wildlands Project; the Gulf of Aqaba
Environmental Action Plan Project; and the "Second Tourism Development Project). Thus,
the Bank's involvement in the GEF-assisted M/H plant projects would have allowed valuable
lessons to be incorporated into the proposed project and affords the opportunity to promote an
exchange of ideas, facilitate cross-fertilization with other GEF projects and create an M/H
plants network. The Project's objectives were also consistent with GEF's Operational
Strategy for Biodiversity, GEF's Program 1 on "Arid and Semi-Arid Zone Ecosystems", as
well as Program 13 for the "Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity
Important to Agriculture". Besides few exceptions, an assessment on the state and use of M/H

  The endemic species include: Iris petrana, Cousinia dayi, Plantago maris-mortui, Crucianella
transjordanica, Centaurea procurrens, Scrophularia nabataerum, Tamarix tetragyn, and T. palaestina.
Rare species include: Adiantum capillus-veneris, Sternbergia clusiana, Pistacia atlantica, Caralluma
aaronis, Pergularia tomentosa, Equisetum ramosissimum, Crocus moabiticus, Micromeria sinaica
(endemic; also on IUCN list), Teucrium leucocladum, Ajuga chamaepytis, A. iva, Lavandula pubescens,
Withania obtusifolia and W. somnifera. (Oran and Al-Eisawi, 1994)

plants of the larger Mediterranean area was yet lacking and thus the survey provided by the
project would contribute significantly towards the global goal of developing a conservation
and sustainable use strategy for this important group of plants.

1.2 Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved and
stated in the PAD)

The Global Environmental Objective is the improved conservation and sustainable use
of M/H plants (several of which are rare and endemic, and thus of global importance) at
the national and the local levels through achieving the following targets over and above the
baseline scenario: (i) establishing a framework for M/H plant biodiversity conservation and
management; (ii) strengthening institutions and implementing a coordination program; (iii)
promoting in-situ conservation and sustainable use of M/H plants in 2 pilot sites; and (iv)
designing and implementing a communication strategy. Accordingly, the Project
Development Objective (PDO) is to design and test models to improve the conservation
of medicinal and herbal plants and the livelihood of the communities; through the
management and sustainable use of MH plants for human and livestock needs in the Mujib
Nature Reserve and the Central Upper Slopes of the Rift Valley (the two project sites) in
Jordan while ensuring effective in-situ protection of threatened habitats and ecosystems in
these areas.

The project's agreed key performance indicators (KPI) are:

a. Capacity established to sustainably manage the wild genetic resource base of MH plants
    (linked to GEO i/ii);
b. Threats to MH species are diminished and key biodiversity areas are identified and
    protected (linked to GEO iii);
c. A database, gene pool and monitoring system are established and operational (linked to
    GEO i/iii);
d. Active participation of communities in conservation, management and income generating
    programs established in project areas (linked to GEO ii/iii);
e. Livelihoods of rural communities improved (linked to GEO iii/iv);
f. Public awareness, including environmental education of MH plants improved (linked to
    GEO iv).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

At the global level and national level, benefits would accrue from: (a) the protection of
endangered, particularly endemic species, (b) the sustainable use of M/H plants and natural
habitats, (c) improved agro-pastoral practices, (d) better water management and reduced
erosion, (e) enhanced capacity building of government agencies, research institutes and
communities, and (f) income generation for disadvantaged communities. At the regional level,
the project would promote an exchange of ideas and thus build capacity in dealing with the
protection of M/H plants. Also, there would be a gene pool and a source of material to expand
the production of endangered or rare M/H species in Jordan and the region. Direct




                                               2
beneficiaries would be the rural communities living in and around the project sites3, which
include the poorest segment of the population. Project investments in terms of on-farm
improvements, guidelines for plant management, and marketing channels would target
farmers with a special focus on women, who are the most important producers and processors
of M/H plants.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Institutional Strengthening (US$2.54 million). This component is designed to
strengthen the institutional and technical capacity of key players. It would: (a) develop and
provide an organizational mechanism for project implementation via a Project Management
Unit (PMU); (b) develop inter-sector links among government and public bodies, NGOs, the
pharmaceutical industry, consumers, and producers; and regulatory instruments; (c) develop
intellectual property rights (IPR) policy and guidelines for indigenous knowledge and use of
M/H plants for medical and other purposes by humans and livestock; (d) establish health and
safety standards for M/H plants and products; (e) establish a national M/H plants
database/GIS and plant gene bank and herbarium collection; and (f) capacity building through
designing and implementing a training program. (Links with KPI a. and c.)

Component 2: Pilot-Sites Conservation (US$6.92 million). This component was designed to
effect in-situ conservation and use of M/H plants; and to support ex-situ cultivation to relieve
in-situ pressure. Two pilot areas are targeted for in-situ conservation project activities: (a) the
Mujib Nature Reserve adjacent to the Dead Sea, and (b) and the Central Upper Slopes of the
Rift Valley covering the Madaba area. Activities at the two sites, under healthy competition
bases, are implemented respectively, by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature
(RSCN) and by the National Center for Agricultural Research and Extension (NCARE)4. Ex-
situ cultivation was planned to involve: (a) villagers/farmers for on-farm pilot crop
propagation and cultivation trials of M/H plants, and (b) pilot-prototype farm demonstrations
at ECOHERB Farms of Jordan including IPM, organic farming, contract farming and
adoption of internationally acknowledged processing standards practices. (Links with KPI b.,
d. and e.)

Component 3: Public Awareness and Education (US$1.25 million). This component includes
the development of public education (including school and college curricula) and mass
awareness campaigns on the relevance of conserving and managing Jordan's M/H plants and
their importance in the country's biodiversity. It consisted of two sub-components: (a)
environmental education, and (b) public awareness. (Links with KPI f.)

Component 4: Income Generation Activities (US$3.5 million): M/H Quality Enhancement,
Product Development. The purpose of this component is to add value to M/H plants for local
use and exports by producing organically-grown and certified plants, ensuring proper
handling and grading of M/H plants and using the correct processing procedures to ensure
quality products. Three sub-components are included: (a) standardization of M/H plants raw

  A total of seven villages are located on the edges of the Mujib reserve with a total population of about
20,000. In the Central Upper Slopes of the Rift Valley, the main locations are Irbid, Ajloun-Jerash,
west of Amman to Salt, with an estimated population of 1.5-2 million people (Department of Statistics
of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan).

1.6 Revised Components. The original project components were not revised.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

The Grant Agreement was signed on May 23, 2003 with project effectiveness on June 16,
2003. The actual launch workshop was organized only on April 12, 2004. This delay was due
to deferred decision regarding the Implementing Agency house (eventually confirmed at EPP
of MOPIC) and as a related matter, to the postponed appointment of a Project Manager
(01/2004) and of the PMU (completed on 01/2005). The PAD identified private sector partner
(ECOHERB) for the ex-situ conservation work (Component 2) was considered unsuitable by
MOPIC and was replaced by another player on 10/2005. The Project Technical Committee
(PTC) was not formed; and the coupling of an international expert to the Project Manger
(PM) of the PMU as envisaged in the PAD never occurred. Differently, the PMU availed
itself of technical advice as required, through ad hoc consultancies.

A first revision of the Grant Agreement (GA) was requested on July 5, 2005 and effected on
May 8, 2006. In the original GA the incremental operating costs were limited to "office
furniture and supplies, audit costs, and local transportation". This list was a constraint and the
first Amendment of the GA relieved this constraint by including several other types of
expenditures. A second revision, reallocation of proceeds, was requested by the Government
on June 26, 2007 in order to better achieve the stated project objectives. This was discussed
during the Mid-Term Review (MTR). At that point (12, 2007/01/2008), only US$ 1.9 million
of the total grant amount had been disbursed. The reallocation was approved on March 19,
2008, after approval of MTR conclusions. A third and final reallocation of the grant proceeds
was agreed on March 5, 2009. An extension of the closing date from December 16, 2008, to
December 16, 2009 but further extended to June 16, 2010 was effected on December 7, 2009
(through a Restructuring Paper), based on a revised procurement and action plan and with the
expectation that thereby some crucial planned activities could be completed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Project was prepared over the course of a four-year period 1999-2003, starting from a
Government request for a project and a subsequent PDF-B preparation grant phase (through
several studies and surveys), which enabled the definition of the project context and an ample
set of baseline data and information. The design responded well to the needs and comparative
advantage of the country in focusing on this important conservation task and interesting niche
market related to M/H plants. This was a pioneering project; background analyses were
sound; and the rationale for Bank management and for GEF of the grant was also strong. The
first three components were ambitious but well designed. However, the inclusion of a full-
fledged fourth component ­ Income Generating Activities ­, which aimed at boosting the
M/H plant related business through standardization, product development and financing
instruments, was overambitious. This investment would have been better positioned with a
more mature sub-sector situation. Differently, the piloting nature of the initiative may have as
well included lighter M/H plant business trials attached to the 2nd (with the ex situ activities)
or to the 3rd (together with the public awareness and education activities) but avoiding the risk
of adding management complexities to an already elaborate project. Indeed, component-
related problems arouse at the very start. With this realization by project implementers, an
early or even later ­ when the issue became manifest ­ restructuring of the project
components would have probably been beneficial.


                                                4
The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) structure and outline belongs to an older generation
of projects. Similarly, the Project Design Summary therein contained5 does not follow the
more modern arrangement of a Results Management Framework (RMF). This has involved a
difficult re-alignment of the design and agreed indicators to the actual outcomes realized by
the project. The lack of RMF-structured baseline data, and the availability of substantially
output-oriented indicators somewhat limits the straightforward assessment of project
achievements. Nevertheless, the project must eventually be assessed against its original main
six PDO KPIs and GEO targets/indicators, while any other system is to be considered of a
forcing nature.

Most stakeholders in Jordan and the World Bank attribute the most significant design
weakness as that related to the implementation arrangements, and to the decision to place the
PMU into the EPP of the MOPIC. Alternative options (NGOs, Ministry of Agriculture) were
explored but it is similarly an unanimous conclusion that at the time the decision was taken,
the selected option was the most suitable in terms of both operational and counterpart
financing readiness. The decision to directly involve RSCN and NCARE in project
implementation was sound, since these institutions had technical knowledge and interest.
However, given the global objectives of establishing a permanent program management
framework and of strengthening the participating institutions who would eventually be
assigned a permanent task, a planned exit strategy from PMU-centred operations should have
been foreseen at design stage.

2.2 Implementation

No major factors outside government or implementation agencies' control occurred during
project life, with the only exception of the poor performance of the substitute private sector
partner in charge of key ex situ activities, who had been selected after the decision to discard
the one that had been identified at appraisal6. Otherwise despite the specified milestones in the
GA, the principal implementation agency EPP-MOPIC, significantly delayed the appointment
of the PM and of the PMU, and as a consequence the launch workshop was only held April
12-13, 2004; almost one year after project effectiveness while PMU staff were all hired
during 2004 and 2005. Overall, due to the late activation of the project's main implementation
conduit ­the PMU­, the project suffered an operational delay of about two years after its
effectiveness. As a result, during this period but also afterwards, too many operational
decisions were actually placed with the chair of the Project Steering Committee (PSC) who
has been represented by the Secretary General (SG) of MOPIC throughout project life (5
officials have succeeded to the role of SG during CMHPP). Undoubtedly, implementation
task decisions were attributed to higher coordination and policy making positions which could
not guarantee required and efficient follow-up capacity. Typically, the importance of the PSC
in the case of the CMHPP is even more crucial than in normal circumstances as it brought
together, with voting powers, the CEOs of all involved implementing agencies (NCARE,
RSCN, the private sector representative, the PM and the SG). During CMHPP's life, the PSC
meetings occurred with an irregular frequency: highest till 2006, nihil in 2007, lowest from
2008 till mid-2009, and normalizing only then onwards to project completion. This has led to
inadequate management efficiency and has allowed insufficient flexibility of the PM and the

 After MOPIC's decision to cancel ECOHERB FARMS JORDAN's participation to the CMHPP
another company, IRIS-Pindstrup was contracted. This company highly underperformed and its
contract was eventually terminated after one year, wherein the decision was taken to focus on
Champion Farmers.

PMU as envisaged in the PAD. On the contrary, the lack of a functional PSC has de facto
belittled the leadership of the PM, which at times appears to have had a mere executive role of
MOPIC decisions.

The CMHPP was a complex undertaking at all times in terms of both project activities and
implementation arrangements. Risks and issues have been identified during Bank supervision
missions and flagged out in the Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRRs). However,
it was only during MTR that all outstanding technical and implementation issues were
systematically identified and mitigation measures and recommendations were agreed upon
among parties. From then onwards albeit belatedly, and thanks also to a more attentive
supervisory activity on the part of the Bank, the CMHPP overall management acquires an
increased efficiency, including improved participatory processes among the concerned
implementing agencies.

Procurement and disbursement (see Disbursement Profile) was less efficient particularly at
the early stages of the project. The lack of EPP's experience in channeling GEF/Bank funds
was a further issue. Bank and GOJ's procurement provisions and the implementation
complexity of the project that had a multi-agency structure would have justified a different
set-up whereas ad hoc procurement power delegations are given to actual implementers from
the very start. As regards to financing (see Annex1, Project Costs and Financing), the PMU
estimates that 72.2 percent of total baseline costs (or 68.5 percent of total financing required,
when contingencies are included) have been made available for project expenditures. Out of
the total available GEF sources, 98.4 percent have been spent. With respect to GOJ only EPP,
NCARE and to a lesser extent JEDCO, have contributed up to 30.8 percent of the
contributions estimated at appraisal stage. Contributions from other public sector entities
though never materialized. Nevertheless, even after the withdrawal of the appraisal-stage
identified private sector partner (ECOHERB FARMS JORDAN), involved Jordanian parties
(mainly RSCN but including beneficiaries and other private sector participants [JRF, JEPA,
Champion Farmers]) have contributed 120.9 percent of what was estimated at appraisal.

Project implementation was delayed significantly, causing the postponement of the
completion date by 1.5 years. Although by and large, CMHPP has implemented all foreseen
investments, many activities were hurried during the last year of its life, hindering its capacity
to show evidence on actual impacts.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Although the PAD stated that "a well-designed M&E system is critical to ensure the project's
timely and successful implementation and to enhance its impact through a systematic analysis
of lessons learned and their effective dissemination", the design was not consistent in
providing specific investments to this end. Nevertheless, a simplified M&E system was set up
by a dedicated PMU specialist recruited by mid-2005. This included straightforward M&E
mechanisms at the PMU, and replicated at NCARE and RSCN. The M&E system enabled the
monitoring of the four components and their sub-components, and the PMU provided
Quarterly Progress and Annual Reports in a timely manner. The summary of monitoring
results against each component is provided in Annex 2.

An excel-based MIS was also created but not maintained due to the termination of the M&E
specialist's contract ahead of project completion. The project e-filing system has not been
structured adequately and did not allow the electronic archiving of documents and reports
generated by the project. The project paper archive is reported to be eventually transferred to
NCARE. An elementary but not-professional project website was created by project staff but
with little maintenance and updating.



                                                6
Annual beneficiary surveys were not undertaken, but a general assessment was made during a
stakeholder workshop held in November 2009. The PAD-recommended scientific surveys to
be undertaken every two years "to monitor M/H plants and the farming systems, and evaluate
changes" are carried out only once. The six indicators identified in the PAD for purposes of
tracking progress are not related to quantity-based targets, are somewhat qualitative in nature
and do not easily lend themselves to periodic monitoring. The botanical surveys have
highlighted the threats on MH plants, which offer the benchmarks to be regularly monitored
(in the Mujib reserve and at the 12 Hotspots of the Central Upper Slopes). A Rangeland
Survey concluded that grazing pressures in the Mujib Reserve have decreased (on file).

The GEF's biodiversity tool was applied in July 2008, repeated in May and in September
2009, and again at closing of the project in June 2010. These allowed for the tracking on the
achievements of the project for biodiversity aspects. The findings show that there was a slight
increase in biodiversity between the first two points in time and that it held basically steady
between May and August of 2009.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project was classified as Environmental Category B, and it therefore has an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which is dated October 2002, and which includes
environmental mitigation and M&E measures. An in depth review in February 2008 found
general compliance of the Project with the EMP.

Financial management assessments by the Bank took into consideration audit, reporting,
budgeting, staffing, and flow of funds issues. This was judged as satisfactory. Regarding the
audits, all audit reports were submitted to the Bank with clean opinions. For the 2008 audit
report, the Bank requested some modifications, which were addressed satisfactorily.
According to the design of the PMU, there was one person responsible for both procurement
and financial management. The Bank flagged this issue during the MTR in the fall of 2007,
viewing it as a possible conflict of interest. The matter was resolved in November 2008 when
a part-time F&M Specialist was appointed, who was retained till December 2009.

Although procurement procedures under CMHPP were not per se particularly complex,
problems often arose during project implementation. Despite the fact the GA contained
additional provisions to be followed when conducting national competitive bidding,
throughout the project period both the World Bank procurement guidelines as well as those of
GOJ were applied. To this end, a Special Tendering Committee (STC) was instituted. Abiding
to dual provisions led to significant delays. Work plans and activity plans underwent frequent
changes, requiring update approvals by the PSC chair and, when needed, Bank no-objections.
Moreover, the PMU could not submit timely the updates of the procurement plan because of
unaligned STC administrative internal clearances.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

The foundations of a functional framework for MH plant biodiversity conservation and
management have been created through the project. At project completion, the momentum is
high and a permanent institutional focal point of a national program on MH is being
appointed at NCARE. The institution is acknowledged by all stakeholders. A governing
Program Committee is being established that includes all key partners: MOPIC-
EPP/RSCN/NCARE, the Jordan River Foundation (JRF) and the Jordan Exporters and
Producers Association (JEPA) 7 . The designated focal point (NCARE ­ Biodiversity

Directorate) has its own operational budget, and a 12-month action plan is being prepared.
MOPIC-EPP is devoting one of its poverty alleviation budget lines with an allocation of 0.5
million JD to the program. The Program Committee (PC) would be initially chaired, ad-
interim, by MOPIC-EPP, and subsequently the stakeholders will select a permanent chair.
The PC will have to seek further financing means for a medium term action plan.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Government attaches high priority to the biodiversity conservation agenda. The Project's
objectives remain highly relevant to Jordan, even more than in 2003. During the project
period, Jordan's tourism in general and the ecotourism industry in particular has expanded
significantly, amounting now to over 10 percent of GDP (2009). In a way, the M/H project is
strengthening Jordan's reputation and image as a conservation-oriented destination. In this
respect, conservation societies (such as RSCN) who also have a role as ecotourism operators
are using M/H plants to promote country's image. In addition, marketed fresh herbs have
increased from 15,000 tons in 2004 to about 27,000 tons in 20098, while exports although on
a slight increase are still at low volumes. Hence, there was and there continues to be a high
domestic demand for M/H plants, which are part and parcel of the local culture in food
preparations and in the therapy of human and livestock illnesses and diseases. This is well
documented in many papers and documents produced by the CMHPP (see Annex 9).

Conservation and sustainable use of M/H plants are indeed part of the country's development
strategy (NSAD, National Poverty Alleviation Strategy, National Strategy for Youth,
Childhood National Plan, National Desertification Strategy, etc.); and importantly, the
objectives of the project are aligned to its Environmental Strategies (National Environmental
Strategy, National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan), and contribute towards taking action
on the country's global commitments (CBD, UNFCCC, UNCCD, Agenda 21).

At the same time, over-harvesting, increasing grazing pressure and urban/agricultural
encroachment over natural habitats need full understanding of their effects on biodiversity in
general and on M/H plants' population in particular. Also needed are systems in place to
sustainably conserve/protect/monitor natural flora and grow plants for cultural and
commercial uses. Moreover, Jordan has one of the world's lowest levels of water resources
availability, and the Kingdom's water per capita amount (140 cubic meters per year)
represents around 14 per cent less than the world's water poverty line. In the view of the
institutional stakeholders (Ministry of Agriculture, MOPIC, MOENV, etc.), ICARDA,
concerned non-governmental institutions (RSCN, JRF, JEPA) and the international
community in Jordan (FAO, WB, USAID), growing M/H plants has important potential as a
means against water scarcity (less demanding than widely cultivated vegetables) and as a
niche market both for the local market and for exports (including income generation for poor
segments of the society through value additions). Typically, the project also responds to the
CAS goal of poverty reduction in that (i) commercialisation of M/H plants and their health-
care uses are key components of GOJ's poverty alleviation objectives; and (ii) project sites
are located in marginal areas where poverty issues prevail. To this end the location of the
project in EPP, which program oversees actions in the poverty pockets of the country, has
certainly been functional.

A sound diagnosis of the issues was made during PDF-B and project preparation phases. The
design was highly relevant to stated objectives in terms of project components, investments

and implementation arrangements but with few redundant elements. A slightly lighter design
and a different balance of sub-components and activities would have avoided complexities
without lessening the project's overall capacity to meet its objectives.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental and Project Development Objectives

Given that the CMHPP is supported by GEF, the project achievements have been assessed
against both the GEO four targets/indicators and the PDO six key performance indicators
contained in the PAD. As discussed (see Data Sheet), (i) the foundations of a functional
framework for M&E of plant biodiversity conservation and management have been created
(80% achievement); (ii) the participating institutions have boosted their individual human
resource base, technological and management capacities (80% achievement); (iii) the highest
achievement of the project has been both in terms of conservation as well as for sustainable
use capacity of M/H plants (100% achievement); and (iv) although a formal strategy
document has actually not been elaborated, a strategy has de facto been implemented and the
arena of stakeholders has been enlarged (80% achievement).

The PDO was aligned to the GEO. The project had to pilot models to improve the
conservation and sustainable use of M/H plants while also ameliorating the livelihood of local
communities. The project's achievements towards the objectives are hereafter discussed
against the six foreseen key performance indicators (see Annex 2 for details).

Key Performance Indicator #1: Capacity established to sustainably manage the wild
genetic resource base of M/H plants.
Capacity at the level of the two main designated Implementing Agencies (RSCN and
NCARE) was established to enable their faculty for sustainable management of the wild
genetic resource base. This was done by increasing or developing the human resources of
the two entities. RSCN has retained most of the staff which had been specifically recruited
during the project (a M/H plant socio-economist - a function the NGO was lacking- and five
ladies specialized in M/H plant processing); and has even absorbed staff that had worked in
the PMU (the Training and Awareness specialist). The NGO has also improved the
qualifications and expertise of the staff involved in project activities (and has assigned higher
corporate responsibilities to staff that performed during CMHPP) and is now in better
condition to manage conservation activities in the Mujib reserve and to interact with the
communities living in the surroundings. In the case of NCARE, the five staff which had been
seconded to project activities including to the PMU (the M&E specialist), now constitute the
core resources that inter alia, will manage the 12 hotspots established, the database, the
genebank and the herabarium, the advisory activities with farmers and local communities, and
M&E functions. On top of this, about 50 percent of the M/H plant-related research grants (18)
promoted9 by the project have allowed the upgrading of NCARE research staff to MSc and
PhD degrees. The CMHPP has also provided significant physical and system-type
investments at the organizations' headquarters and on-site levels, which have increased their
overall capacities (building infrastructure, site protection fencing, water harvesting and
electricity, mobility means, communication and visual devices, monitoring equipment, etc.).
Important instruments have been realized by the project such as: the Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) policy guidelines; and the Health and Quality M/H plants' and products'
Standards; enlargement of the institutional stakeholder arena in this area by organizing
specific endorsing committees (i.e. MOA, MOIT, MOH, MOPIC and the Jordanian Food and
Drugs Agency [JFDA]). All such capacity is expected to allow the sustained functioning of
the future M/H Plant National Program to be established within NCARE, and overseen by a
specific Program Committee.

Key Performance Indicator #2: Threats to M/H species are diminished and key
biodiversity areas are identified and protected.
The pilot biodiversity areas have been identified at two sites (Mujib reserve and Central
Upper Slopes of the Rift Valley). Threats in the two areas have reportedly diminished: key
areas may now be protected in Mujib through enclosures, additional rangers, and also by
working with surrounding communities in a participatory manner to develop mutually agreed
management/grazing plans. In the Mujib area, a botanical updating survey had indicated the
prevalence of 146 M/H plant species (out of over 400) and the level of threat of each.
A botanical survey covering 2000 km2 identified wild M/H plant resources and the
biodiversity of the Upper Rift Valley of Jordan. The methodology has allowed the
determination of the levels of threats and the uses of the M/H plants. About 2100 different
species of plants were found (overall 2500 species are reported in Jordan), of which 221 were
classified as M/H plants (about 50% of those known in Jordan). Population density and list of
endangered species have been reported. Five M/H new rare species have been identified and
two new families registered. Twelve hotspots have been demarcated in the Upper Slopes, in
which fenced areas are well protected, allowing comparison and participatory learning with
the local communities outside the fence areas which continue to be grazed and herbs
harvested. In these spots, under NCARE supervision, management plans have been agreed
with all the jurisdictional institutions which are competent for each hotspot (but including the
Mujib reserve under RSCN); biodiversity inventories inside the fenced areas have been
undertaken at all sites with some vegetation rehabilitation through replanting where deemed
necessary; and botanical monitoring surveying is scheduled. Thus, the foundations have been
set for sustained increased protection at these sites, which are laid for system expansion to
other sites in Jordan.
Studies and maps showing grazing intensities are now available. In all protected areas, as
shown by subsequent monitoring, there is ample evidence of vegetation re-growth even of
species that could not be found during initial surveying.
Key Performance Indicator #3: A database, gene pool and monitoring system are
established and operational
A Biodiversity and Genetic Resources Directorate including a M/H plants department was
established within NCARE. Under the CMHPP, NCARE created an Oracle-based database of
M/H plants including photos, information on the location where specimens have been
collected, and about cultural practices on how to best grow some of the plants in gardens and
on farms. The functionality of the database is being upgraded. For the time being the 221 M/H
plant species identified in the two pilot areas have been reported in the database but all other
species recorded in Jordan (over 554) are planned to be included. The database will
eventually be connected to NCARE's website. A GIS-database function is at work but not yet
available in the website. Otherwise, a Google-earth base mapping exercise of all hotspot sites
and enclosures has been elaborated.

NCARE has experience with developing best cultural practices, to breed plants, to multiply
and propagate them. It is also equipped to preserve the gene pool and has storage facilities
and procedures to keep it under cold dry conditions and to be inspected periodically
according to international standards. By the end of the project the total number of M/H
seeds in the seed bank of NCARE amounted to 120 plant types. In addition, 204 plant
samples are kept in the herbarium (out of 221 species identified, and excluding only the
endangered species which purposely have not been picked).

NCARE signed an agreement with all other concerned parties to sustain the management
and monitoring of the M/H plants hotspots identified by the project. These other institutions
include the Royal Botanical Garden, the Forestry Directorate of MOA, the Ministry of
Municipalities (Dier Yousef Municipality), and the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human
Development (JUHD).
                                              10
Key Performance Indicator #4: Active participation of communities in conservation,
management, and income generating programs established in project areas
Communities around the Mujib reserve have been involved in participatory development of
management plans for in situ and for areas adjacent to them. Importantly, an agreement has
been reached with a Cooperative of sheep herders. An area10 of 25 km2 is allowed for grazing
inside the reserve applying clear management criteria: use of caves and water springs;
rotational grazing areas; and a defined carrying capacity. A monitoring plan is also agreed so
to fine-tune the management plan. An additional value of this agreement is that herders are
now patrolling the reserve and report illegal hunting and harvesting. This has resulted in
diminished pressure in the reserve.

In the hotspot areas of the Upper Slopes, several meetings have been held with community
groups to come to agreed management plans with demarcated boundaries for different
management schemes. Both around the Mujib Reserve as well as the 12 hotspots, income-
generating programs supported by the Project have been piloted.

Key Performance Indicator #5: Livelihood of rural communities improved
The pilot nature of the project allows only for preliminary indications on the potential the
M/H plant business can have on livelihoods improvement.

In the Mujib reserve agreements have been piloted by RSCN with two individual farmers.
Such farmers are able to have incremental income from their M/H plant plots in the order of
150 Jordanian Dinars per month (representing some 30-40 percent of estimated total monthly
income). A more significant agreement has been made with a farming Cooperative of some
130 members. For this cooperative, contract growing arrangements are being initiated with
bulk buyers. The herders' Cooperative that has an agreement on grazing rights inside the
reserve brings together 500 households. RSCN has also started a pilot initiative by processing
and packaging herbal teas and products; the business has allowed RSCN to retain on a
permanent basis 5 women. Raw material is sourced from the pilot farmers, from home
gardens of the local farming community and from outside area sources. The initial sales are
calculated by RSCN at around 16,000 JD per year. The business is promising and is attracting
more farmers. In the Ex-situ areas to Central Upper Slopes and around the hotspots,
sustainable use has been promoted with 23 poor families and 3 small farmers. In addition,
sustainable MH plants business promotion has been undertaken with 9 NGOs, and about 58
farmers under rainfed conditions. Reportedly, NCARE calculates that some 14 tons of M/H
plants have been produced at an approximate value of 40,000 US$. JRF is promoting MH
plant production under organic farming conditions and a solid private sector partner has been
engaged to support marketing arrangements. Support has also been provided to 10 champion
medium/large scale farmers for export-oriented MH plant cropping. Trial shipments by JEPA
are showing interesting results in terms of international (Gulf, Europe) orders being placed to
exporters in the range of few tons (3-10) per week to start with that can generate some 5-
15,000 US$ weekly at farmgate.

Key Performance Indicator #6: Public awareness, including environmental education of
M/H plants improved
CMHPP has done much training and awareness-raising. All such activities have de facto
constituted the communication and knowledge management thrust of MH plants brought
forward by the project. People of Jordan are more aware of MH plants' value and a wider
group of stakeholders now exists in the country. The bases have been set for a sustainable
communication on MH plants to present and future generations. MH plants school curricula

     Which is about 12 percent of the total Mujib reserve area (212 km2).


                                                    11
have been prepared in cooperation with MOED, which has endorsed them for inclusion in
formal education at primary and agricultural professional school levels. Environmental
educational tools and school books have been prepared and implemented and about 4500
students have been made aware and have received information about MH plants. Educational
gardens on rare and threatened MH plants have been established open to school students.
Special workshops for awareness raising, several training courses, study tours and farmers'
visits have involved in all some 3500 participants. In addition, public awareness materials in
terms of CD/DVDs, posters, TV broadcastings, special booklets, and newsletters have been
produced.

3.3 Efficiency

The Project did not require cost recovery, and the financial resources made available to the
beneficiaries were all transferred as grants to small farmers, champion farmers and members
of NGOs. Furthermore, the benefits of most of the in-situ conservation investments are
dedicated to protecting public/global commons, as premised for GEF biodiversity grants, and
they are not readily quantifiable. Consequently, economic or financial rates of return are not
calculated. Nevertheless, M/H commodity chain analyses performed during the project; show
that interesting gross margins are generated from different M/H plants to all chain operators:
40-55 percent for farmers; 9-29 percent for traders; and about 13-15 percent for retailers.

In terms of cost effectiveness, the outcomes of the project have been achieved by spending
about 70 percent of the originally estimated costs. The objectives related to the first two
components were achieved to the extent assessed by spending respectively 98 and 94 percent
of allocated financial amounts. Interestingly, the third component of the project ­ public
awareness and education ­ is to be considered satisfactory spending about a quarter of the
amount estimated necessary, though it included much in-kind and complementary spending
on the part of the implementing partners (primus inter pares, RSCN). Conversely, for the
fourth component, possibly the most premature at design and complex during implementation,
only about 19 percent of the allocated monies have been spent. Although there cannot be
evidence on achievements in case all appraisal foreseen resources were made available, it is
possible that these may have been even higher.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

When considering the project strictly against its PDO's output/outcome indicators, and taking
into account its pilot nature, the project should be rated by and large, as satisfactory. As
discussed in 3.2 above, the PDO indicators that have been selected to measure project
achievements all demonstrate that these are significant. However, the careful analysis of the
GEO stated specific objectives / expected outcomes reveal that there are moderate
shortcomings that impede a full satisfactory rating. There is ample evidence that all involved
institutions (RSCN, NCARE, and others brought on board by the project such as JRF, JEPA,
and JEDCO) have been strengthened and are now full-fledged stakeholders capable of
running jointly a national M/H plant program. There is also no doubt that in-situ conservation
and sustainable use of MH plants has been promoted by the project in (and beyond) the two
designated pilot sites. This is an unprecedented result for Jordan which carries high values
and important lessons for the entire region, and globally. With regard to the `communication
strategy' it cannot be stated that this was formally `designed and implemented' as predicated
in the PAD. Nevertheless, the achievements of the public awareness and education
investments are there to show that the communication thrust and activities of the project have
enabled a unanimously recognized result that goes beyond expectations, obtained in a very
cost-effective manner.

As far as the establishment of a framework for MH plant biodiversity conservation and
management is concerned, this can only be considered as an `expected to be achieved'

                                              12
outcome but not a consolidated achievement. At the time of the ICRR, the eventual
determinations of the primary implementing agency ­ MOPIC ­ have yet to be formalized.
The declared intentions to designate NCARE as the focal point of a National M/H plant
Program with a specific Action Plan; the will to institute a Program Committee that brings
together all major stakeholders with voting powers; the announcement that EPP will provide
seed capital for the Program to integrate that of NCARE; are all positive indications. As
mentioned, the design of the project should have had embedded modalities and means to
pursue this objective which it did not. The mainstreaming of the project implementation
directly with the actually concerned institutions (NCARE and RSCN) or at least the gradual
phasing out of the PMU mediation, would have better prepared the grounds for the envisaged
program framework.

Lastly, the unbalanced implementation pace of CMHPP and the significant delays at project
start have obliged the project to an overextended completion date and have constrained
implementers to concentrate and hurry major investments during the last eight to twelve
months. This situation has highly frustrated all involved players and has also biased the
general perception on the overall quality of the project. It has also impeded project
investments to provide full evidence of the impact these would generate. The overall rating is
thus: Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The CMHPP has been gender balanced in many instances. Female professional staff of the
core institutional partners (RSCN and NCARE) have actively participated in project activities
covering roles of responsibility which have been maintained at project completion; women
employment has been enhanced; and among the beneficiaries who were involved in capacity
building/training activities, implementation of MH plants productive investments, and also in
research grants for MSc/PhD degree acquisition, women have had highest opportunities and
performances.

(b)Institutional Change/Strengthening
Further institutional strengthening has occurred for the participating institutions and
stakeholders who already had prior interests and commitments in biodiversity conservation in
general and for M/H plants in particular. The project has also enlarged the group of
stakeholders with an interest to support conservation and sustainable management of Jordan's
biological resources.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
The Integrated Ecosystem Management Project, approved in 2007, benefited from the
experience of the CMHPP; it is being implemented by RSCN under a Steering Committee
headed by MOENV with a PMU within RSCN. ICARDA also attributes a `spill over' effect
of the project into the Water and Livelihoods Initiative of USAID which has a regional value
(Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Syria and Jordan) that promotes stakeholders'
knowledge and experience sharing on best use of limited water resources.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

An informal beneficiary survey through questionnaires prepared by the PMU was undertaken
during the closing stakeholder workshop held on November 23-25, 2009. There was general
consensus that M/H plants are a strategic but also profitable business sector, which requires
close collaboration of concerned government agencies with the private sector. Project studies
and results should be widely disseminated and further investment should address value
addition areas for pharmaceutical and oil extraction enterprising but also packaging,
marketing, product promotion, training and knowledge management. General knowledge has

                                             13
improved for all respondents but specific know-how on agricultural practices and post harvest
technologies improved for 80 percent of producers/exporters. Increased income was a
perceived result for 50 percent of respondents while cultivated areas under M/H plants
increased according to about ¼ of all respondents; while it doubled according to local
community and cooperative members. Interestingly, NCARE is indicated as the right
institutional focal point for a national program and the need for a program committee
including all major interested parties is endorsed by all respondents.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Program continuity for conservation and protection of M/H plants is likely ensured because of
the vested interest with at least two of CMHPP's main players: NCARE and RSCN. The
former has a biodiversity and genetic resources directorate, has instituted a specific M/H
plants department with a small but dedicated budget; and is designing a twelve month Action
Plan. RSCN continues to be in charge of the Mujib Reserve and is in a position to upscale the
experience and capacity acquired during CMHPP in the other protected areas under its
mandate. The JRF has undersigned a sustained assistance agreement with the local
communities and cooperatives with which it has undertaken specific project activities (for
organic farming of M/H plants) which has a validity of 10 years. As regards to sustainable use
of M/H plants and business promotion, all champion farmers, producing NGOs and other
private sector members interviewed during this ICRR have shown concrete interest to
consolidate the investments made during the project and to further invest in this growing
sector. The JEPA has also declared the will to assist its members to improve exports of M/H
plants and products. Confirmation ­ which ought to occur during project's grace period - is
warranted that MOPIC will champion and allocate financial resources for the institution of a
National Program. Risk rating is considered: Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
The Project was subject to a Quality Enhancement Review Meeting held on February 11,
2003. The panel was supportive of the project design of this "pioneering project".
Performance at identification, preparation and appraisal of the project was satisfactory.
However, it would have been much more advisable to have had on board a PM accompanying
the Project as early as preparation and presentation to the Board. In addition, the Bank did not
foresee (and had no mitigation measures in place) the exclusion which later occurred of the
selected private sector partner (ECOHERB). The overall delay of about two years before
actual start of project activities implies an underestimation of the readiness for
implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Bank management has been kept informed on project progress and performance through 13
ISRRs. The project has been supervised and managed, respectively, by three Task Team
Leaders (TTLs). The first TTL led the identification throughout the appraisal phases. From
mid-2005 through to June 2008, including MTR there was another TTL, and thereon the third
and last TTL who continued supervision work till project completion. Delays, slow
disbursement, and implementation shortcomings, which have been all duly highlighted in the
ISRRs, have been considered not severe enough and the project has been always rated as
`Satisfactory' for 8 successive reports. This was a somewhat obligatory decision due to the
fact that a new rating system, which included intermediate rating categories (MS and MU),
was available only in 2007. Due to security reasons in one instance (end 2005) but perhaps
also due to insufficiency of supervision resources (as stated in one ISRR), the project was
monitored only through PMU progress reports for over one and half year (from May 2005 to

                                              14
December 2006). A first `Moderately Satisfactory' rating is given at MTR, occurred in
November 2007. This rating is upgraded again to `Satisfactory' during 2008 when it is
decided to extend the project duration and allow it time and resources to meet expected
outcomes. The project is supervised attentively during this period and the last two ISRRs rate
it rightly as `Moderately Satisfactorily'. Bank supervision of procurement matters followed
the project diligently. Despite the challenges posed by the design of the project, Bank
supervision, albeit variably over the project duration, paid attention to the issues and
bottlenecks ­ working with the client to overcome the challenges (e.g. private sector
participation). The quality of supervision and hands-on attention in the second part of the
project (from MTR till the end) allowed the client to deliver on the project both on the ground
and on disbursements. This was made possible through a decision to restructuring the project,
particularly through reallocation of the procurement plan, to meet the objectives in a
satisfactory manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Due to the highlighted underestimations at Entry; unbalanced performance and insufficient
investment during supervision; and somewhat tardy decision making on actions to be taken to
adjust implementation pace, overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Grant Recipient

(a) Government Performance
The Government of Jordan had commitment and recognized the potential in an innovative,
ambitious and somewhat complex project. MOPIC ­ which is also the GEF institutional focal
point ­ has represented the Grant Recipient in the CMHPP. MOPIC provided the Chair to the
Project Steering Committee, which though met irregularly during project life. There has also
been a high turnover of PSC Chairs. It has performed variably in providing the required
guidance and backstopping to its Enhanced Productivity Program (EPP), which had been
delegated to house the project and to which the PMU was answerable. Significant delays and
implementation shortcomings were mitigated tardily. MOPIC should have assisted the
selected institution ­EPP­ by appropriate staffing, and facilitating it by simplifying
procurement arrangements. Some critical decisions have regarded: (a) no PSC meetings
convened for over 1 year; (b) inadequate support to specific project outputs agreed in the
PAD and GA (e.g. IPR, beneficiary assessment); (d) insufficient facilitation for a number of
activities and actions (e.g. training and awareness, PMU staff hiring/substitutions). MOPIC
however showed highest ownership and worked hard during the last extension on
its commitment to deliver both on the ground and on disbursements (which as regards the
GEF grant at closing were 98%). The Government provided about 31 percent of the planned
counterpart funding but was certainly instrumental in leveraging a contribution of other
Jordanian sources, which eventually over performed at about 121 percent of appraisal
estimate.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
The EPP of MOPIC was the host of the PMU. The EPP had no previous experience of Bank
and GEF projects, rules and procedures. The PMU was only fully staffed and had office space
and internet connectivity in 2005, even though the Project was effective in May 2003.
Afterwards its work was sometimes hampered by excessive bureaucracy. The PMU itself
often did not operate as an effective PMU, but more like a coordination unit. It was not
always appropriately staffed. Although NCARE and RSCN as the main implementers were
often hindered by delays and additional burdens with procurement and financial issues over
and above their own technical work; these operational implementing agencies, that are now
charged to ensure program continuity, have performed adequately and satisfactorily. RSCN
and NCARE have the legal mandate and through the project, have received adequate technical
and human capacity building to maintain and continue working on related research and
development aspects of conservation and sustainable use of M/H plants.

                                              15
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Grant Recipient Performance
Taking into account the achievements of the key players that have to ensure continuity of a
National Program as well as of the shortcomings of the implementing partners that however
are destined to phase out, the general assessment of the Grant Recipient performance is rated
as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The CMHPP has been an occasion to learn important lessons. The following are highlighted
as most significant to have a carry-over effect on future investments:
·   Make a case study, build on project success stories, and disseminate unique
    documentation for possible replications. The CMHPP story should not go forgotten.
    There have been very significant and unprecedented achievements in terms of (i) in situ
    biodiversity conservation; (ii) sustainable ex situ M/H plants' experiences; (iii) dual effect
    on poverty alleviation and livelihoods improvements, and concrete private sector business
    opportunities (to be sought however with attentive organization and timing); (iv)
    considerable expansion of human resources' capacity; (v) high success in civil society
    awareness raising; and lastly, (vi) the production of wealthy knowledge-base including
    papers and documentation. GEF and the Bank should take stock and promote all such
    achievements.
·   A project that carries an institutional target for its sustainability after completion requires
    specific mechanisms in its design. When a project has an important `institutional building'
    value and objective ­ a community of partners for its continuity, in the case of CMHPP ­
    it is outmost important that its design is also consistent and that approaches and
    mechanisms are embedded that can operationally ensure the result. In addition, such
    investments would largely benefit by involving international stakeholders who form part
    of a broader constituency and can act as champions and independent brokers. For
    CMHPP, an exit strategy from the PMU and the handing over of direct implementation
    and coordination responsibilities to the NCARE, RSCN and others should have been
    planned at least during the last year of project operations.
·   Project design needs to be simple and focused on its main objective. An investment that is
    geared at creating a long term thrust out of an unprecedented pilot should minimize in its
    design all complexities and avoid over-abundance of objectives while privileging only the
    fewer key components and activities that can guarantee realistic and concrete impact. The
    `income generating' component of the project should have been more practically
    positioned in a follow up investment. Conversely, a knowledge management activity
    would have been more in tune and would have allowed higher cohesiveness and
    integration among project stakeholders.
·   Project management, where feasible, should be housed in within an appropriate existing
    institution. The CMHPP experience, once again confirms that PMUs in general are not
    only ­ by design ­ unsustainable management structures which come to an end at any
    project's completion; but they often are also detrimental to project smooth functioning
    and may be counterproductive to the creation of concrete and permanent institutional
    capacity. Development projects' management structures, in particular when capacity
    exists (like in the case of CMHPP through RSCN and NCARE) ought to be mainstreamed
    within existing institutions.
·   Task management turnovers warrant more caution and when unavoidable, be
    accompanied by transitional arrangements. The CMHPP shows a case that Bank
    management would need to use in future projects and activities. The project has been
    managed by three TTLs, and in the interim phases between one and the successive TTL,
    remote supervision appeared unattended. A rule should be adopted that when a TTL
    hands-over the management responsibility to another she/he should organize a joint
                                               16
    supervision mission for smooth continuity. Adequate supervision resources must be
    guaranteed at all times.
·   The M&E function always requires adequate investment and funding. A well designed
    and implemented monitoring and evaluation system is key for any project. This is even
    more important in the case of a project with a `global' conservation/protection and natural
    resources sustainable use thrust. Design and investment allocation need to be consistent.
    In the case of CMHPP this is a lost opportunity.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies
During ICR mission, interviews with all Implementing Agencies and partners have been
carried out. According to the EPP management the project has offered a very important
natural resources' protection case but also a business opportunity for the country and for the
Jordanian stakeholders. For this reason, GOJ will continue in its endeavor in terms of
institutional and financial commitment. This was also confirmed by the SG of MOPIC.
According to RSCN, the project has created capacity and knowledge which have strengthened
the institution. However, the implementing modalities and mechanisms have hampered
smooth execution and have strongly limited the actual potential. As a result, the institutional
set-up created by the project is still weak and insufficiently integrated. NCARE is totally
committed to fulfill the mandate of the national MH focal point and the investments made
through the project have all provided the grounds for this capacity. It is the opinion of
NCARE that a framework has been created which now needs strengthening. The ICRR
mission concurs with the majority of the stakeholders that a system has been created including
capacity and knowledge on MH plants conservation and sustainable use. What is now needed
is the urgent political endorsement and activation of a National Program.

(b) Cofinanciers
None

(c) Other Partners and Stakeholders
Important partners of the CMHPP have been JRF; the JEPA and JEDCO among others.
According to JRF, the project was a quasi unique opportunity for local communities and
cooperatives to become protagonists of an important national initiative. Given JRF's statute
commitment to sustainability of operations they get involved in, it appears likely that organic
farming will be a further business ­ but also a sustainable resource use ­ opportunity for MH
plants and importantly, with the farming communities of Wadi Araba. This would also
compensate for the little impact that was generated by many `last minute' activities of the
project. For JEPA, the project offered significant public good values which have enabled
marketing lessons to the emerging private sector that can now upscale investment. Given the
small dimension of the Jordanian farming community, the likeliness of a shared impact is also
there. In the opinion of JEDCO, the fourth component of the project (Income Generation) has
shown its design weakness in that it overestimated the capacity of the farmers to take up the
business at an adequate scale. In addition, it would have been beneficial to introduce from the
very beginning a cost-sharing approach with willing investors. JEDCO also highlights that
individual partners have apparently worked in isolation with little integration and sharing of
experiences. This comment is common to many stakeholders including individual farmers.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

No attempt has been made to calculate economic or financial rates of return for the Project
due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying the investments for "public good" environmental
operations. A M/H commodities' chain analysis show considerable gross margins for all
operators.

The incremental costs cover project expenditures of activities that have global benefits. The
baseline expenditure scenario was calculated to establish current and planned funding
amounts for activities that would occur without the Project. The estimated difference between
the cost of the baseline scenario and the cost of GEF's alternative represents the incremental
costs.

The incremental costs contributed to: (i) achieving global environmental benefits through
conserving rare and endangered M/H plant species; (ii) completing a database and gene pool
of all M/H plants in Jordan; (iii) strengthening the institutional framework; (iv) developing
mechanisms for sustainable use; and (v) enhancing public awareness of global environment
issues pertaining to M/H plants conservation. GEF's actual contribution towards the
incremental costs is US$4.9 million, with estimated additional contributions of about US$3.98
million from GOJ, RSCN, and the private sector, while the total project costs, exclusive of the
PDF-B, were originally estimated at US$14.21 million.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A stakeholder workshop was held on November 23-25, 2009 (see Annex 6). In this occasion
an informal beneficiary assessment was undertaken through questionnaires prepared by the
PMU. A total of 26 participants responded, categorized in three groups: decision makers,
champion farmers/exporters, and members of local community and cooperatives.
Respondents confirmed GOJ's commitment and interest for the Project. There was general
consensus that M/H plants are a strategic but also profitable business sector, which requires
close collaboration of concerned government agencies with the private sector. Project studies
and results should be widely disseminated and further investment should address value
addition areas for pharmaceutical and oil extraction enterprising but also packaging,
marketing, product promotion, training and knowledge management. General knowledge has
improved for all respondents but specific know how on agricultural practices and post harvest
technologies improved for 80 percent of producers/exporters. Increased income was a
perceived result for 50 percent of respondents while cultivated area under M/H plants
increased according to about ¼ of all respondents while it doubled according to local
community and cooperative members. Interestingly, NCARE is indicated as the right
institutional focal point for the program and the need for a national committee including all
major interested parties is endorsed by all respondents.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


(From the Report on Proceedings of the Closing Workshop of the Conservation of Medicinal
           and Herbal Plants Project; 20-21 November 2009, Dead Sea- Jordan)
Introduction
The Conservation of Medicinal and Herbal Plants Project (CMHPP) emerged from the crucial
needs of the country to conserve wild Medicinal and Herbal plant resources and to promote an
economical promising and value adding MH plant sector. Thus, it received governmental and
non-governmental appreciation and support. Positive feedback was obtained throughout from
all stakeholders (from subsistence farmers to the private sector). The project was the first to
address the conservation of MH plants and give priority to their sustainable use. Furthermore,
it initiated and strengthened the institutional and technical capacity of key partners, including
for the first time, partnering with the private sector; addressing the root causes of biodiversity
loss and barriers to sustainable use; moving away from supply driven research towards
demand responsive applied research on the ground; and fostering product and market
developments, through participatory approaches involving all stakeholders.
Objectives
The main objective of the Closing Workshop of the CMPH is to take stock of achievements,
share insights, challenges, and constraints and draw lessons learned. The workshop aims to:
(a) get feedback from the different beneficiary groups and stakeholders: this is very important
for the ICR, particularly since no beneficiary survey has been undertaken; (b) share about
achievements/outputs/outcomes; (c) discuss lessons-learned, including challenges, constraints
what actual or possible solutions are to the constraints; and (d) how the work on MH plants
can be sustained, and what roles the Ministry of Agriculture, NCARE, RSCN, the private
sector, NGOs, and communities can play to extend and scale up this important work.
Participants
105 persons attended the closing workshop representing the following entities:
-   World Bank
-   Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation
-   Ministry of Agriculture
-   National Centre for Agricultural Research and Extension
Recommendations
By Decision Makers
-   Endorse a national committee including MOPIC, NCARE, RSCN, Private Sector,
    Universities, MOA, and other interested parties to follow up on medicinal and herbal
    plants activities.
-   NCARE, Agro-biodiversity and medicinal and herbal plants Research Program would the
    focal point of potential efforts on medicinal and herbal plants, and in coordination with
    Universities, research centers, and all relevant institutions.
-   Utilize the remaining funds of the Project in training and capacity building
-   Promote cooperation in the field of medicinal and herbal plants at regional and
    international levels (ICARDA and others)
-   Intensify training and capacity building for farmers, local community and staff at
    implementing agencies by providing funds from MOPIC.



                                               36
-   Promote awareness and keep farmers, communities, NGOs and other interested parties
    informed about the medicinal and herbal plants.
-   Conduct deep and detailed socio-economic studies including feasibility of production and
    in which chain the added value is higher.
-   Connect the pharmaceutical enterprises.
-   Develop and continue legislation, guidelines and polices relevant to conservation of
    genetic resources to avoid export and contraband of these genetics.
-   Support connection and networking among all parties.
-   Support the development of JFDA laboratories.
By Champion Farmers
-   Intensify training and capacity building for farmers and exporters as well as JEPA
    members and extension agents of public sector in the field of production, marketing, and
    post harvest technologies
-   Promote the specialized and advance training courses for farmers and exporters in the
    developed courtiers
-   Specialized study tours are highly needed to get acquainted on success stories and
    activities starting from land preparation, cultivation, production and end in post harvest
    technologies (packing, packaging, cold chain). Potential study tour countries: Far East
    Asia, Latin America, and Cyprus
-   Recruit experts on day to day advice, and their sustained advise for the whole agricultural
    season and including production, post harvest, and marketing matters.
-   Establish a national references committee including both private and public sectors, with
    mandate to create services for MH plants industry and organize the relation between
    relevant parties. The national committee may include the following parties (qualified
    farmers and exporters; JEPA; NCARE; MOPIC; JEDCO, MOPIC, and ACC). However,
    members of the project steering committee giving the priority to be members in this
    committee
-   Establish a specialized cooperative to associate all MH plants farmers and exporters with
    a mandate to serve the MH plants beneficiaries and coordinate relations between relevant
    entities.
-   Future international and regional projects to target private sector. i.e. JEPA, role of
    governmental offices and donors including monitoring, supervision, and follow up.
-   Budget of future projects should include a significant share for infrastructure (post harvest
    technologies, and marketing facilities)
Cooperatives and Local Communities
-   Intensify technical training for production staff
-   Establish a private marketing corporation with mandate to facilitate marketing of MH
    plants
-   Budget of future projects should include a significant share for infrastructure (post harvest
    technologies, and marketing facilities)

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Recipient institution, MOPIC, has not submitted it own ICR yet. In May 2010 the PMU
produced a draft ICR document. A few extracts (slightly edited) of this document are quoted
below:

""

·    The PMU was supposed to have more independency and enforcement (capacity) headed
     by a prominent high caliber (manager). MOPIC dropped this requirement and (initiated
     recruitment) of (a) lower caliber (manager) which was rejected by the Bank two times,
     then the Steering Committee came (end of 2003) to agreement to appoint an acting
     (March 2004) then permanent (mid 2005) PMU manger/project coordinator. Moreover,
     the PMU was (attached) lower in the hierarchy of the MOPIC; the PMU head became
     accountable to EPP director instead to Steering Committee head (the Secretary General).
     The Bank agreed/tolerated that decision and the practice.

·    ECOHERB Farms of Jordan (EFJ) was an idea developed during PDF-B preparation
     phase to function as private sector partner. It aimed to establish a profit oriented
     investment entity for pooling and benefiting from technical know-how provided to the
     project in terms of production and processing of MH plants on advanced large scale
     business and working parallel to project implementation as hub for information and
     encouragements of other farmers on contract-farming bases. Before launching the project,
     this selection procedure was objected; hence (new) selection through open competition
     was initiated (in Oct. 2003).

·    PSC has held 41 meetings during implementation period (June 2003- April 2010), while
     from Dec. 2006 until February 2008, no meetings were held despite crucial
     implementation circumstances. (M)eetings were not regularly conducted and voting
     practice never used. The PSC experienced during implementation period (2003-2010)
     inconsistency in chairman position; (5) Secretary Generals have changed and in each
     change valuable time was spent to introducing the project values to the new chairman.
     Chairman of the PSC as MOPIC Secretary General was dominating although the directors
     of executing agencies of (NCARE & RSCN and PS) are more concerned; they often
     claimed less consultation and involvement. Rotating chairman position would have been
     more useful option.

·    The disbursement went very slow due to a) delays in the replenishment () and b) due to
     the practice where the PMU had to comply with both the Government and the WB
     procedures in terms of procurement and financial treatment.

·    The TTL has changed (three) times during the course of implementation. In each change
     the PMU lost reference and guidance for a while, this accumulated to general
     implementation delay. ... Since July 2008 the project received better response and follow
     up from the Bank team. The Bank's missions were crucial in supporting and expediting
     implementation; main findings and recommendations were used by the PMU for
     improvements and as tool for enforcement that contributed significantly to successful
     implementation especially during extension phases.

·    The project had complex () objectives that have to be reached through integrated efforts
     of multi players. This complexity had the advantage of managing concerted efforts of
     research, development, awareness and capacity building at the same time, but it had the
     difficulty of coordinating different entities. Most problematic was to work with local
     communities and rural farmers (even champion farmers).

                                              38
·   (With) reference to the achievements of the project in relation to the PDO and GO, the
    project has made concrete contributions to the conservation of MHP through targeted in-
    situ conservation measures in the Mujib Reserve and in the hotspots of the Upper Slopes.
    Furthermore, the sub-projects and socio-economic activities with communities to
    cultivate MHP are (planned) in the understanding that these will reduce the pressure () in
    the wild.

·   The following were achieved ():
       a. New mechanisms for partnerships and working methods established
       b. (F)unctioning models with community NGOs, and private sector operate beyond
            project life
       c. Maintenance and upgrading the Gene bank at NCARE ongoing.
       d. Major threats identified in Mujib Reserve (grazing, heavy cutting by population,
            decline in indigenous knowledge).
       e. Major threats in Upper Slopes (change in land use, over grazing, illegal cutting of
            MH plants, fires, stone and sand quarries)
       f. MH plants database established and networking ongoing.
       g. Communities around Mujib Reserve involved in conservation (grazing
            agreement, zoning plan, patrol plan).
       h. Community-based support program in Upper Slopes ongoing # 23 poor families
       i. Income generating activities in Upper Slopes established (13).
       j. Informal education improved (MH garden, MH lab, materials for locals and 4500
            students (50% of total) around Mujib Reserve; formal education (RSCN & MOE).
       k. In Upper Slopes, 14 Training need assessments resulted 44 courses, where 24
            workshops conducted (500 participants)
       l. New research program on biodiversity & MH plants established at NCARE.
       m. A new model for conservation established in Upper Slopes with local community
            (12 hotspots).
       n. 8 initiatives by champion farmers & 8 NGOs have been launched
       o. Vegetation cover increased by (24%) in Mujib.
       p. 17 students (5 PhD & 12 M.SC), out of 15- graduated & continue work with their
            entities.
