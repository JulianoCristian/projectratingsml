"Despite the positive environmental\n            nature of the Conservation of Medicinal and Herbal Plants\n            Project, to conserve, and manage best practices for\n            medicinal, and herbal (M/H) plants, there might be an\n            eventual increase in grazing, and browsing plants due to the\n            project's potential success in reversing rangeland\n            degradation, obviously with a possibility of overgrazing\n            such areas by increasing animal numbers, and, as the\n            promotion of organic farming is one of the aims of the\n            project, integrated pest management will be part of the\n            project activities, with farmers using certain herbicides,\n            pesticides, and chemical fertilizers when growing M/H\n            plants. Mitigation stipulates the following: capacity\n            building, and training will be provided to manage\n            environmental protection, increase biodiversity, and improve\n            land-use management, and water management; protection of\n            wild M/H plants, limited grazing, as well as protection of\n            erosion prone areas, and improved rangelands through\n            increased uses of perennials; biodiversity will be\n            monitored, through agreed plans with beneficiaries to\n            promote, protect, and improve stocking of wild M/H plants;\n            reserves will be monitored to establish the effect of better\n            farming systems on soil, and water quality; management plans\n            will be developed to improve rangeland management, and\n            demonstrate best pastoral practices; community participation\n            will be encouraged to identify wild M/H plant areas, while\n            demonstration methods for growing, harvesting, and\n            processing M/H plants, and products will be enhanced; the\n            establishment of an organic certification will control the\n            use of pesticide, and herbicides, thus providing increased\n            market opportunities for \"organic\" M/H plants, and\n            products; and, the effects on biodiversity, water quality,\n            and carbon sequestration will be measured, and monitored."}, "docdt": "2003-02-05T22:34:01Z"}
