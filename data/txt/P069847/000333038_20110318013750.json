the Conservation of\n            Medicinal and Herbal Plants Project (CMHPP) for Jordan were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the CMHPP story should not go forgotten. There have been\n            very significant and unprecedented achievements in terms of:\n            (i) in situ biodiversity conservation; (ii) sustainable ex\n            situ Medicinal and Herbal (M/H) plants' experiences;\n            and (iii) dual effect on poverty alleviation and livelihoods\n            improvements, and concrete private sector business\n            opportunities. When a project has an important\n            'institutional building' value and objective a\n            community of partners for its continuity, in the case of\n            CMHPP it is outmost important that its design is also\n            consistent and that approaches and mechanisms are embedded\n            that can operationally ensure the result. In addition, such\n            investments would largely benefit by involving international\n            stakeholders who form part of a broader constituency and can\n            act as champions and independent brokers. For CMHPP, an exit\n            strategy from the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the\n            handing over of direct implementation and coordination\n            responsibilities to the National Center for Agricultural\n            Research and Extension, Royal Society for the Conservation\n            of Nature (NCARE, RSCN) and others should have been planned\n            at least during the last year of project operations. An\n            investment that is geared at creating a long term thrust out\n            of an unprecedented pilot should minimize in its design all\n            complexities and avoid over-abundance of objectives while\n            privileging only the fewer key components and activities\n            that can guarantee realistic and concrete impact. The\n            'income generating' component of the project\n            should have been more practically positioned in a follow up\n            investment. Conversely, a knowledge management activity will\n            have been more in tune and would have allowed higher\n            cohesiveness and integration among project stakeholders. A\n            well designed and implemented monitoring and evaluation\n            system is key for any project. This is even more important\n            in the case of a project with a 'global'\n            conservation/protection and natural resources sustainable\n            use thrust. Design and investment allocation need to be\n            consistent. In the case of CMHPP this is a lost opportunity."}, "docdt": "2010-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
