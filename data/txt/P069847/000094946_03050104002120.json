 CONSERVATION OF MEDICINAL PLANTS PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Conservation of Medicinal and Herbal\n            Plants Project for jordan aims to design and test models to\n            improve the conservation of medicinal and herbal plants and\n            the livelihood of rural communities. This would be done\n            through the management and sustainable use of medicinal and\n            herbal plants (M/H) plants for human and livestock needs in\n            the Mujib Nature Reserve and the Central Upper Slopes of the\n            Rift Valley in Jordan, while ensuring effective in-situ\n            protection of threatened habitats and ecosystems in these\n            areas. There are four main components. Component 1,\n            institutional strengthening, is composed of 6\n            sub-components: establishing a project management unit;\n            developing links between government agencies, the growers of\n            medicinal/herbal plants, the pharmaceutical industry, other\n            producers of M/H plant products, nongovernmental\n            organizations, and consumers; designing an intellectual\n            property rights framework; establishing health and safety\n            standards; establishing a national M/H plants database and\n            gene pool; and designing and implementing a training\n            program. Component 2, the pilot-sites conservation\n            component, has two sub-components, namely the in-situ\n            protection and management of M/H plants and the ex-situ\n            production of rare, endangered and popular M/H plants to\n            relieve in-situ pressure. Component 3 consists of\n            environmental education and public awareness. Component 4\n            focuses on income generating activities, among them, organic\n            farming certification, standards for M/H plants for\n            harvested products, processing standards for M/H plant\n            manufactured products, quality control of M/H plant\n            products, product development, market identification, and\n            facilitating access to microcredit."}, "docdt": "2003-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
