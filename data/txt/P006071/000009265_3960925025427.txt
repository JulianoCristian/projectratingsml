PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Repo.t (PCR) on the Education
Project in Barbados, for which Loan 1642-BAR of US$9.0 .illion was approved
on December 19, 1978.  A supplementary loan of US$3.0  -. lion was approved
by the Board on August 30, 1983 and the original Closing Date of
December 31, 1983 was postponed to September 30, 1985. Th. loan proceeds
were completely disbursed on May 29, 1986 on whi;ih date the loan account
was closed.
The PCR was prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Operations Division, Country Department III, Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office (Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
The PCR is based on the findings of the Bank project completion
mission to Barbados during February 1989, discussions with Government
officials involved with the project, and data from the project files in the
Bank.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BARBADOS
EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1642-BAR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       This was the first IBRD assisted education and training project in
Barbados. It was appraised in July 1978 and approved in December 1978.
Total costs were estimated at US$14.48 million, of which US$9.00 million
was financed by an IBRD loan. This project required 7.25 years for comple-
tion, in contrast to the planned 5.0 years.   The loan was closed on
September 30, 1985. In scope the project remained essentially as planned;
however, because of higher than expected price increases in civil works and
in technical assistance, the actual costs of the project at the time of
completion were US$22.43 million (55% increase).
Progect Obiectives and Content
2.       The project addressed major educational object:;es of the
Government by:  (a.) broadening educational opportunity; (b) improving the
quality and relevance of the education and training programs; and (c)
enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness  of the system.   A loan
supplement in August 1983 increased the loan amount by US$3.0 million to
cover large and unanticipated price increases.   A loan amendment in
September 1984 provided for the use of loan funds in the preparation of a
second project for further development of the education and training
system. The project included: (a) constructing, furnishing and equipping
of (i) seven primary schools to replace ten obsolete and unsuitable schools
in rural areas; and (ii) three primary schools on the outskirts of the
capital city to serve a growing population; (b) constructing, furnishing
and equipping the expansion of six existing secondary schools to provide
about 2,600 science and practical training places; (c) equipping and
furnishing one new secondary school, including science and practical
training places for a total of 1,225 students; (d) constructing, furnishing
and equipping of a new facility to house a library, a demonstration/
microteaching area, a lecture theater, and a general workshop and
instructional aids production area; (e) constructing, furnishing and
equipping of an expansion to the Barbados Institute for Management and
Productivity (BIMAP); and (f) related study-tours abroad, specialist
services for teacher training, and project management and professional
fees.

Imolementation
3.       The 22 month delay, from Loan Signing until Loan Closing, resulted
froms (a) delays in civil vorks caused by problems in obtaining architec-
tural specialists to finalize designs and tender documents of first phase
schools, inadequate counterpart funding beginning in FY 82/83, and minor
design changes in certain institutious; and (b) delays in equipment
procurement caused by inadequate technical specifications of the more
complex items.   Other furniture and equipment procurement lagged in
accordance with slower completion of civil works.   Because of their
extensive involvement, as counterparts in preparation of the project, key
staff of participating institutions were able to play a major role in
project design and implementation.
Prolect Results
4.       Quantitative goals of the project have been essentially met,
except as affected by an unanticipated decline in school age population and
lower demand for new teachers; and a lower demand for in-plant training and
overall employment opportunities because of recession in key industries.
The moderate decline in school age population, combined with a scarcity of
alternative employment opportunities for teachers, had a negative impac.. on
the goal of decreasing the teacher-student ratios and the assoc-iated
reductions in unit recurrent costs. As decreases in the teacher-student
ratios were planned to be made through teacher attrition, rather than
massive "layoffs", this goal will only be achieved gradually.
Prolect Sustainability
5.       When the planned teacher-student goals are reached, the recurrent
costs of the project schools will be about 11 less than before the
project. As the economy continues to recover, it is expected that attrac-
tive employment alternatives for the younger teachers will result in the
teacher-student goals being met in the early 1990's.  This aspect, along
with the qualitative improvements already being experienced, helps assure
the sustainability of the primary and secondary school components of the
project.   Although the management training institute's expanded programs
have increased its recurrent costs by about 402, the high level of partici-
pation during the past 16 years of its membership of some 400 private and
public firms clearly indicates their continuing commitment in assuring its
financial sustainability.
Princival Lessens Learned
6.       The Aajor lessons learned, or again confirmed, as a result of the
experiences during project implementation are summarized as follows:



(a) Thorough and well-documented preparation and appraisal, that
may build on the extensive participation of key staff of
project institutions, is an important factor in the success-
ful implementation of any project.   Neverthelees, for this
first education and training project, a project launch
vorkshop, with Bank and borrower staff, might hqve helped
identify potential implementation problems and action for
their timely resolution.
(b) Local price contingencies for civil works proved unrealis-
tically low, in part, because of excess demand in the
construction industry. Appraisal staff and their country
counterparts must seek to inform themselves fully of both
government and large private investment plans, especially in
small island economies such as Barbados subject to supply
constraints, and evaluate their inflationary implications on
civil works costs during the project implementation period.
(c)  Specialized staff, such as educators appraising the project
should, ideally, continue their supportive role via project
supervision during, at least, the first two years. This is
necessary to assure that initial implementation of the
technical aspects of the project are fully understood and
start well. For the same reason, supervision missions should
be fielded at appropriate and, generally, uniform intervals.
(d) The specifications and grouping of complex equipment and most
of the power tools in vocational-technical education and
training require comprehensive review in the field, with
those who have prepared them, by competent technical educa-
tors to assure successful tendering.

Productivity Training
B. Project Backaround
1.       Sector Develonment Obiectives (At time of project appraisal).  The
major education policy objectives of the Government weres: (a) equalization
of educational opportunity through extension of education to all up to age
16, and provision of sufficient places at the secondary -'chool level for
all graduates of primary schools; (b) modernization anc re-direction of
secondary educational c.,ntent through greater emphssis on training, and
expanded and improved resources for science and other practical studies;
and (c) improved efficiency in order to realize the above aims without
increasing the relatively high costs of the education and training system.
2.       Basic Strategy and Policy Context.   The basic strategy in
achieving the modernization and re-direction of the educational system was
to: (a) help improve quality, especially by raising teacher competence and
increasing instructional aids; and (b) aimultaneously introduce cost-
effective measures to assure more economical use of resources in the over-
all education and training system. The Government policy of development of
a well-educated and appropriately skilled labor force has resulted in the
assignment of high priority to vocational and technical training relevant
to the needs of the country's industrial development, and to the develop-
ment of a broader based secondary education system.  The IBRD assisted
project complemented the assistance provided by IDB and other multilateral
and bilateral agencies for the development of skilled vorker and technician
level training, curriculum development, industrial management and in-plant
training programs; and has helped achieve the major policy objectives.



3.       Linkages Between Project. Sector and Macro Policy Objectives.  The
project's emphasis, as set forth in paragraphs t and 2, clearly supported
the attainment of the Government's central poVly objectives oft   (a)
strengthening the manufacturing sector; (b) diiersifying agricultural
production to, among other purposes, help reduce food imports; and (c)
increasing revenue and return in investment in tourism.
C. Project Obiectives and Description
4.       Proiect Obiectives.   The project addressed the major policy
objectives of the Government bys  (a) broadening educational opportunity;
(b) improving the quality and relevance of the educational and training
programs; and (c) enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
A supplemental loan in August 1983 increased the loan amount by US$3.0
million to cover large and unanticipated price increases, and a loan amend-
ment in September 1984 approved financing from the loan for the preparation
of a second project for iurther development of the education and training
system.
5.       Prolect Components.   The project included:   (a) constructing,
furnishing and equipping of (i) seven primary schools tc replace ten
obsolete and unsuitable schools in rural areas, and (ii) three primary
schools on the outskirts of the capital city to serve population shifts;
(b) constructing, furnishing and equipping of expansions to six existing
secondary schools to provide about ,600 science and practical training
places; (c) equipping and furnishing one new secondary school, including
science and practical training places for a total of 1,225 studentsl (d)
constructing, furnishing and equipping of a new facility at the Teacher
Training College to house a library, a demonstrationlmicro-teaching area, a
lecture theater, and a general workshop and instructional aids production
area; (e) constructing, furnishing and equipping of an expansion to the
Barbados Institute for Management and Productivity (BIMAP); and (f) related
study-tours abroad, specialist servicec for teacher training, project
management, professional fees and project preparation. Project results are
detailed in Table 9 of Part III.
D. Proiect Design and Organization
6.       A total of 29.8 staff weeks in the field c7er a 12 month period
was utilized by four different missions, comprised of six staff specializa-
tions, in the identification and preparation of the project (Table 13).
This phase was followed, after a two month lapse of time, by a 9.4 staff
weeks appraisal mission. The 39.2 staff week, of preparation and appraisal
activities led to the development of a clear conceptual foundation for the
project. The extensive participation of key staff of the project institu-
tions resulted in full agreement and understanding by all relevant parties.
During the process of appraisal the scope of the project vas modified and
reduced in accordance with a better understanding of the country's finan-
cial capacity.



- 3 -
7.       The project was innovative in that it inittited the process of
amalgamation of small uneconomic, ill-housed, poorly equipped and inade-
quately managed primary schools. These were replaced by an approk-riate
lesser number of newer and larger primary schools having enhanced internal
efficiency and improved quality and relevance of instruction. By the time
of Loan Closing on September 30, 1985, the success of this process was
sufficiently apparent that a second projects including a component to
further expand the amalgamation of small primary schools, was approved for
appraisal; and a loan (Loan 2688) was signed on May 21, 1986.
E. Proiect I-Mlementation
8.       Critical Variances in ProiecL Imolementation.  The major factors
respor.sible for the nearly th-ee years delay in the completion of civil
works were:  (a) inability of the PIU to obtain  appropriately qualified
local architectural staff for prompt -6sign of first phase institutions;
(b) designs and bidding documents for four first phase institutions, to be
tendered during August 1978 to June 1979, were so slow in preparation that
tendering actually took place during December 1979 to March 1981 or 6 to 21
months later than planned (see Table 1, Annex 3); (c) minor delays encoun-
tered in procurement of sites for nine of the ten primary schools and for
the management training center; (d) revision of designs for the management
training center resulting from   conceptual differences between the PIU
Manager and the Director of BIMUP with respect to the type of facilities to
be constructed; (e) a sharp increase in unit costs of civil works which
occurred during a period of high demand in the construction industry and
rapid increase in constructior costs, and which affected 15 of the 17
institutions requiring construction; and (f) as economic conditions
worsened, a shortage of counterpart funding of civil works beginning in
FY 82/83.  Project implementation ultimately required 22 months beyotd the
originally estimated 60 months after Loan Signing. About 202 of the equip-
ment for the secondary schools and BIMAP was not received until about 18
and 42 months respectively after the completion of civil works. Delays in
equipment procurement were caused by difficulty in obtaining bids through
ICB, due, in some measure, to inadequate specifications.
9.       The Bank supervision of project implementation was uneven.  There
was no architect on a field mission during the 25 month period between
December 1980 and January 1983 (Table 5) when most civil works problems
were occurring.   However, it cannot be said with any certainty that the
presence of an architect could have had a significant positive effec:.
While the Bank discussed with the Government the cash flow problem created
by escalating costs, it is not likely that any other feasible actions could
have been taken at the time, especially in view of the grave financial
conditions of those years.
10.      Project Risks.   The three major risks in project implementation
were correctly idea.tified. Of these, both the failure to introduce more
cost-effective norms in regard to teacher-student ratios, and difficulty in
the recruitment of architectural staff for the design of civil works were



realized. In regard to the former, no improvement was made in the 1:21
teacher-student ratio in primary schools, with actual performance falling
282 short of the goal of 1:29 (Table 9).  Performance in the secondary
schools was only marginally better, with a shortfall of 22Z in the 1:23
goal.   Because of a tight market for architects and related staff in
Barbados, the perceived risk in the  recruitment of architectural staff
quickly became real.   Although the goverrment had taken action to have
posts created and funds appropriated at time of appraisal, it was not until
early 1982 that these staff positions were filled. The major problem of
counterpart funding, and the contributory large price increases in civil
works, were not foreseen.
11.      Actions Taken or Not Taken Which Affected Imvlementation. In view
of the problems in the recruitment of architecturallcivil works design
staff and resulting delays in designs and contracting (Annex 3, Table 1),
it is probable that it would have been more cost effective to have con-
tracted most of the design work.
F. Maior Results of Proiect (Refer Part III Table 9)
12.      Prolect Objectives.  With the exception of teacher-srudent ratio
goals, and the associated improvements in recurrent costs, project objec-
tives were largely met. It was intended that the increase in the number of
students per teacher would be primarily reached through teacher attrition.
However, attrition rates during the course of project implementation have
been significantly less than expected because deteriorating economic condi-
tions in Barbados resulted in fewer alternative employment opportunities
for the relatively young teaching force. When the economy recovers it is
expected that the attrition rate will quickly expand. Quantitative goals
have been essentially met, except as affected by:  the decline in school
age population and a correspondingly lower demand for teachers; and a lower
demand for in-plant training, and overall employment opportunities, because
of a recession in key industries.
13.      Impact of Proiect.   The project has had a positive effect on
sectoral growth and policy attainment, and on manpower, employment and
industrial development as discussed below. (a) Sectoral growth and policy
attainment have been aided through: the development of an institutional
base for attainment of the policy goals of consolidation of small and
inefficient rural primary schools with inadequate and obsolete physical
facilities into larger, better designed, equipped and staffed, and more
efficient primary schools. 'b) Manpower, employment and industrial devel-
opment has been enhanced through expanding and upgrading of practical
training and the teaching of science in the upper secondary school system;
upgrading and expanding management training for both the private and public
sectors; assisting individual firms in developing and oper4ting in-plant
training schemes (Table 9); and providing special training assistance to
small businesses and entrepreneurs.



C. Proiect Sustainabilitv
14.     When the planned teacher-student ratio goals are reached, the
recurrent costs of the primary and secondary school components will be
about 11Z less than those at the pre-project ratios.   As the economy
recovers, employment alternatives for teachers vill, over the short and
medium term, result in the teacher-student goals being met in the early
1990's. This aspect, along with the qualitative improvements already being
experienced, assures the sustainability of these components of the project.
Although the recurrent costs of BIMAP'S expanded programs   ve increased
about 401, the continuing high level of participation of it& membership of
some 400 private and public firms clearly indicates their continuing
commitment in assuring its financial viability.   The willingness of its
management and trainees in courses on productivity to pay fees, equal to
about 351 of the total recurrent costs, further attests to the financial
sustainability of BIMAP.
B. Bank Performance
15.      Maior Streneths and Weaknesses.   The Bank, with the UNESCO
Cooperative Program's assistance, prepared and appraised the project. The
general thoroughness of these activities, and the extensive participation
of key staff of the project institutions, resulted in national education
and training administrators having an in-depth knowledge of the project.
This knowledge was undoubtedly a major factor contributing to the local
team's above average performance in project implementation. It was especi-
ally important in view of the Bank's uneven record in fielding adequately
staffed supervision missions.   The major discernible weakness in the
appraisal process was in the Bank team's failure to evaluate correctly
existing and potential inflationary strains on civil works costs during
1979-82, resulting in under-estimation of annual price increases by about
1001.
16.      Supervision missions were fielded at erratic intervals.  The time
intervals between the eight missions, over a seven-year period, were:
5-5-12-17-8-14-12 months respectively (Table 5). With a norm of 6 month
intervals, the project should have had about 14 supervision missions.
Further compounding the effects of the occasional long intervals between
missions, after the first year of implementation, was the lack of con-
tinuity in mission staffing.  During the critical years of December 1980
through February 1984 only three one-person missions, rather than the
normal eight, were fielded. The only member participating in more than two
of the missions was an architect who participated in four missions over a
63 month period of time. An unfortunate consequence of the lack of con-
tinuity of mission composition is that during a one week mission a new
member or one who has not been in the country for 12-18 months is obliged
to devote almost full time to determining project status. In such cases,
more detailed and critical analysis or effective guidance and support are
not possible. During the period of 1981 and 1982, no architect was fielded



by the Bank for civil works supervision and advisory assistance. Further-
more, although the major portion of the project was vocational/technical in
nature, neither vocational or technical educators were on any of the
supervision missions.
17.     Lessons Learned.  The major lessons learned, or again confirmed,
as a result of the experiences during project implementation and the prepa-
ration of the PCR are summarized as follows.
(a) Thorough and well-documented preparation and appraisal, and
the extensive participation of key staff of project institu-
tions, is an important factor in the successful implementa-
tion of any project. Nevertheless, for this first education
and training project, a project launch workshop, with Bank
and borrower staff, might have helped identify potential
implementation problems and actions for their timely
resolution.
(b) Local price contingencies for civil works proved unrealisti-
cally low, in part, because of excess demand in the construc-
tion industry during the early project phase.   Appraisal
staff and their country counterparts must be fully aware of
goverrment and large private investment plans, especially in
small island economies such as Barbados, subject to rapid
cost increase during a period of high capacity utilization in
the construction industry, and evaluate their inflationary
implications on civil works costs during the project
implementation period.
(c) Specialized staff, such as educators appraising the project,
should ideally continue their supportive role by means of
project supervision through, at least, the first two years.
This is necessary to assure that implementation of the educa-
tional aspects are fully understood and starts well. Super-
vision missions should be fielded at appropriate
and, generally, uniform intervals.
(d) The specifications and grouping of complex equipment and
most of the power tools in vocational-technical education
and training require comprehensive review in the field, with
those who have prepared them, by competent technical educa-
tors to assure successful tendering.
I. Borrower Performance
18.     Maior Strengths and Weaknesses.  A major strength of the borrower
was the extensive involvement of key staff of participating institutions in
preparation and appraisal of the project. The management performance of
the PIU was generally satisfactory throughout the implementation cycle.
This was in spite the fact that for seven extended periods of time (up to
two months each) the project manager was called upon for short-term



- 7 -
assignments in other high level government positions. During most of these
periods, however, he kept in touch with the project so that he could advise
on the more important matters.  Rapidly escalating costs, the borrower's
financial problems and inability to recruit local or civil works design
personnel, while major constraints to implementation, were largely beyond
the borrower's control.   Minor delays in procurement of sites for nine
primary schools and BIMAP, largely because of legal problems, could
probably have been alleviated had a lawyer been assigned, on a part-time
basis, to the PIU. Moderate problems in equipment procurement for the phase
2 secondary schools and for BIMAP were partially a result of inadequate
technical specifications and packaging. The MOE Planning Office failed to
predict with sufficient accuracy a moderate decline 'z. school enrollments,
especially at the primary level.   However, because of the generally
deplorable state of physical facilities at the majority of the older
schools, no over-investment in new facilities has resulted.
J. Proiect Relationships
19.      Bank-Borrower Relationships.  With the possible exception of the
Bank architect, who participated in four missions, the continuity of parti-
cipation for Bank supervision mission members was not sufficient to develop
with the PIU, or other Government officials, close professional relation-
ships essential to support timely and effective project implementation.
The major lesson learned here is that continuity and composition of super-
vision missions are very important.
20.      Borrowers Internal Relationships.  A few relatively minor problems
occurred in communications between the PIU Manager and the Director of
BI1AP over interpretations of the intent of the Appraisal team regarding
BIMAP facilities (para. 29).
K. Consulting Services
21.      The local consultants recruited for the prenaration of the
proposed Second Education and Training Project performed satisfactorily.
The proposed project data and information were quickly prepared and the
project was appraised in May/June 1985. No other consultants were planned
for, or were utilized, in project implementation. The specialists financeJ
under the loan for strengthening the PIU, management team and design work,
performed satisfactorily.
L. Proiect Documentation and Data
22.      Legal Aereements.  The Loan Agreement dated December 29, 1978, the
Amending Agreement for the Supplemental Loan dated September 27, 1983, and
the Amendment dated May 10, 1985, in order to allow for the financing of
preparation activities for the Second Education Project, were all clearly



and conaSs-ly drafted. The memorandum (Special Prccedure R83-262 of August
11, 1983) recoimwading the pupplemental loan, provided clear and in-depth
detail In support of the Amendis$ Agreement, and the full justification and
the ftinncing plan for Its utilization.
21.     sAuoralia RtP3  -and Wo) l.n  Panere.  The Appraisal Report, the
u#jor Working Paper., #nd project Preparation Reports were adequate for
project   plemntatiou.
24.      Aaiskabilit  of Relevant Data to PCR Mission.  A short pre-mission
seam*ar oh preparatioh of 4ata for the PCR sission vas conducted with key
staff member. during a supervi ion mission for Loan 2688-BAR in August
1988.   Much of the data bad been prepared by the time the PCR mission
arrived In the field on January 18, 1989, and all was ready for review,
analsise ad discussion by t)%e middle of the mission.



PART II.  PROJICT REV1EW FROM BRROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Adecuact and Accuracy of Factual In$ormation in Part III
25.      The project implementation data (Table 4), project costs and
financing data (Tables 6 and 7), direct benefits of the project and project
studies (Tables 9 and 10), and compliance with covenants (Table 11) defin-
ing the project profile at completion, were all prepared by the borrower.
They were discussed thoroughly with the participating institutions while
the PCR mission was in the field.
B. Evaluation of Bank's Performance and Lessons Learned
26.      The Bank made significant contribution  to the evolution,
preparation and development, through appraisal, of the project. However,
there were aspects of the supervision of project implementation which
should have been strengthened.   These included:   supervision of the
vocational-technical components by qualified specialists; earlier assis-
tance in developing the accounting system of the PIU to better reflect the
auditing and reporting requirements of the Bank; more assistance in plann-
ing and implementing the procurement of equipment. The PIU staff had to
rely on short-term advice by mission members for the difficult tasks of
preparation of technical specifications; grouping of equipment items into
appropriate packages for tendering; and the accounting, and auditing
requirements of the Bank.
27.      The major lessons learned were:  (a) a short seminar, conducted by
the Bank staff early in the implementation cycle, would have assisted in
the preparation of equipment lists, technical specifications, grouping for
efficient tendering, preparation of other tender documents, and bid
evaluation; thus minimizing trial and error learning, procurement delays,
and price increases; (b) the PIU should make sure that it clearly under-
stands the Bank requirement for accounting, auditing and reporting; and (c)
more accurate population data must be developed to facilitate realistic
projections of demand for school places.
C. Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learned
28.      Considering this was the first education and training project with
the Bank, the Borrower's performance was generally satisfactory. Despite
the capability and commitment of the staff to meet the challenges of the
project, there were some problems which weakened the quality of perform-
ance.   The project suffered from a decision-making process within the
Government which was often slow.  There were periods when the project
manager WaS called upon for high level short-term assignments in other
government positions. In such cases the temporary managers were limited by
their unfamiliarity with project and Bank procedures, and were often reluc-
tant to make substantial decisions. Finally, PIU staff lacked familiarity,



- 10 -
because of no previous experience with Bank projects, of certain technical
requirements of tendering and reporting.
29.      The ma1or lessons learned were:   (a) to speed up the decision
making process, appropriate direct linkages should be formally established
between the project manager and the more relevant top decision-makers; (b)
for managing a project of this size and complexity, a project manager
should be able to devote his full-time attention to the project; and (c)
the project manager should be appointed sufficiently early that he can
participate in the project appraisal, and PIU technical staff should
receive essential training on Bank procurement and reporting requirements
in order to increase the prospects for timely project implementation.

30.      Coments -      ijmetable.   The thorough identification and pre-
paration of the pvo3zt enabled it to be appraised and processed through
Loan Signing with an elapaed time of only five months. As there were no
Conditions of Effectiveness, project implementation waa initiated imme-
diately after Loan Signing. However, by the end of FY79 implementation
progress was beginning to drop behind schedule, and by the end of the first
quarter of FY81 the inevitable effects of an approximate 851 increase in
construction costs were of serious concern (para. 31). This problem ulti-
mately led to the necessity of a supplemental loan approved by the Board on
August 30, 1983 and extension of the Loan Closing Date to September 30,
1985.

31.      Comments on Proiect Imolementation.  Delay in completion of civil
works falls into two groups:   5 to 9 months5 and 15 to 33 months.  The
former delay occurred early in the implementation cycle as construction
costs began to rise.  The latter, and much longer delay occurred between
mid-1981 and the end of 1984 as a result of a re-phasing of public expen-
ditures (para. 32). The escalation in costs led to the Government and the
Bank negotiating the aforementioned supplemental loan, without which about
one-third of the schools would have been dropped from the project.   The
delays in procurement and installation of furniture and equipment generally
resulted from delays in civil works.   The delays in consultant and
specialist services and fellowships, which included support to the PIU,
were a res.'t of the failure to identify qualified consultants within the
Caribbean Region and contract extensions, with corresponding higher costs,
caused by delay in the civil works and other components. By the end of
FY83 more than 1201 of the funds allocated for this purpose under the loan
had already been utilized, but many requirements remained unmet and supple-
mental financing was sought. The data in Table 5 shows that Bank supervi-
sion of project implementation was uneven after the first year, with a 12
month lapse between the third and fourth missions and a further 17 month
lapse until the fifth one. From the beginning of CY1981 through project
completion on September 1, 1985 only four missions were fielded with an
average of 13 months between missions.   Despite the above problems, the
rate of project disbursements were consistently ahead of the LAC profile by
an average of 20X.

32.      Comments on Project Costs.  The total cost overrun in US dollar
equivalent vas 55 of original estimates and foreign costs vere 492 more
than estimated. These increased costs, vhich required the aforementioned
supplementary loan to help finance, were the result ofs (a) the necessity
of an average of two years delay for about one-third of the constructior
program to conform vith the reduction in public investment expenditures
during a period of sharp increase in costs and attendant financial problems
for the Government; (b) unit cost increases by late 1980 in civil vorks of
about 851 of original 1978 estimates; (c) the costs of consultants and
specialist services were about 501 higher than estimated, due to the lack

33.      Comments on Proiect Financin.   Because of the increased costs
discussed in paragraph 32, the Government and the Bank negotiated a second
loan of US$3.0 million to supplement the original US$9.0 million. These
additional funds were used to finance 601 of the remaining costs of civil
works, up from 501 in the first loan; and 1002 of the remaining costs of
consultants, specialists services and fellowship training; and 100S of the
costs (up to US$0.25 million) for preparation of a proposed second educa-
tion and training project.

34.      Comments on Direct Benefits of Proiect.   Actual enrollments in
both primary and secondary schools have fallen short of estimates because
the decline in school age population was greater than expected.   The
enrollments and outputs of the Teacher Training College have been less than
expected because of:   the decline in primary school age population; the
young age of the teaching force; and the relative lack of attractive alter-
native employment opportunities, slowing attrition among teachers and
reducing the expected demand for new teachers.  In-service course enroll-
ments at the Teacher Trainirg College were also about 18% less than
projected as a result of the University of West Indies (UWI) Faculty of
Education having initiated in-service training courses. While not identi-
fiable in the numerical data in Table 9 or in Table 4, a significant bene-
fit from in-service training for school administrators was the development
of administrative handbooks for both levels of administrators.   In the
1987/88 school year these courses were attended by 86 administrators.
While the BIMAP management training course has been able to meet its
enrollment goals, its future growth may be somewhat curtailed because the
Barbados Campus of UWI has initiated courses for a B.Sc. degree in
Management.  The BIMAP in-plant training program has not yet reached its
projected annual participation, as a result of a recent setback in expected
growth of the electronics, sugar processing, mining and furniture making
industries.   This decrease in the demand for training is expected to be
only short-term. The reduction in BIMAP' full-time instructors is a result
of the growing availability of qualified part-time staff.

35.      Comments on Pro1.jt Preparation Study.  The loan amendment which
authorized the f-nancing of project preparation was essential to the rapid
preparation and appraisal of a follow-on project.  It also resulted in a
greater in-depth understanding of the proposed project by local adminis-
trators and key staff, because it was carried out largely by local educa-
tion and training personnel.

36.      Comments on Staff Inputs.   Staff inputs through appraisal were
appropriate both in staff weeks and mission composition (Table 13) to
assure a well prepared and appraised project. However, the implementation
of the project was undoubtedly hindered as a result of uneven timing and
staffing of supervision missions (Table 5 and Annex 3, Table 2). Data on
staff inputs at Headquarters was not available.
