Project (NETREP) for Sudan were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            joint co-financing arrangement has been challenged by the\n            slow flow of counterpart funding for payment certificates\n            for works executed by contractors and consultants. The\n            project initially sought to reestablish basic transports\n            services in the areas that came out of a protracted civil\n            war, through spot improvement and maintenance of the\n            existing roads. Capacity of the implementing entities was\n            weak and Technical Assistance (TA) was sought in critical\n            areas. However, the institutions were reluctant to have TA.\n            Proactive project management is necessary to respond to\n            changing circumstances. The design of the NETREP was\n            substantially modified during implementation to take into\n            account the changing situation. NETREP was designed to\n            address sectorial challenges in a single operation within a\n            short period of time. Despite difficult situation in post\n            conflict environment where many things are uncertain and\n            risks to Project Development Objective (PDO) were high, the\n            Bank's decision to quickly respond to the\n            country's immediate challenges, and thus taking risks\n            to help, is commendable."}, "docdt": "2013-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
