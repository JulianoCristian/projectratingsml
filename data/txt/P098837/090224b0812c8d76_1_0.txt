a   transport services are delivered. The improvement of Kadugli- Kaouda road Lot B (30 km) and upgrading of the Gadamai-Hamashkorieb road (81.5 km) to asphalt level standard
were completed. In addition, engineering design for 995 km of national and rural roads was completed. The studies on private sector participation (PSP) in rail transport, Port Sudan
trade facilitation, and Inland River Navigation Diagnostics, as well as the preparation of the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) were completed and have delivered sound sector
