                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The rehabilitation of the Babanusa-Wau rail line, connecting northern and southern Sudan is completed and rail transport services have resumed after 25 years of disruption. Road
                         improvement works are in progress on 208 km of roads, and about 150 km of roads will be completed in June 2011. The engineering design for the Abugebeieha ­ Talodi ­ Kadugli
                         road (310 km) is completed and design services for 685 km of national and rural roads are expected to be completed in February 2011. The studies on private sector participation
                         (PSP) in rail transport, Port Sudan trade facilitation, and Inland River Navigation Diagnostics, as well as the preparation of the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) are completed
                         and have delivered sound sector development policies and strategies, and implementation is in progress.

                         The key activities delivering the outputs expected under the project are under implementation and some are already completed. The completion of the Babanusa-Wau rail line has
                         helped to provide access to about 215, 000 people living along the project corridor. The rehabilitation has also increased the average train speed from 30 km/hr to 50 km/hr. Three
                         road contracts, with a total length of 150 km of roads, will be completed in June 2011, and will help to provide all weather access to about 30, 000 people living within 2 km of the road
                         corridors. The road improvements will also reduce average travel time from 12 hours to 1.3 hours. The institutional development studies have initiated policy dialogue that would help
                         to improve the performance of the transport sector.
