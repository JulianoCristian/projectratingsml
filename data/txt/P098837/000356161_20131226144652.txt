1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     At the time of appraisal in 2006, with a land area of 2.5 million square kilometers,
Sudan was the largest country in Africa and the ninth largest country in the world. Its land area
encompasses dense forest in the south and desert in the north, and contains 32 percent of the
Sub Saharan African irrigable lands.1 Although well-endowed with natural resources, Sudan’s
economic performance has been substantially below its potential. Per capita income for the
year 2006 was about US$ 1085.2

2.     The civil war, which lasted more than 20 years, and the related governance failures
have had an adverse effect on Sudan’s development.. The war ended in January 2005 with the
signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government of Sudan and
the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM). Among others, key features of the CPA
were the formation of Government of National Unity (GONU) and establishment of the
Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) with extensive autonomy and inclusion of special
provisions for the three conflict-affected areas in northern Sudan, namely: South Kordofan,
Blue Nile and Abyei (referred to hereafter as the Three Areas).

3.      The civil war had a devastating effect in terms of loss of human life, destruction of
infrastructure and social services, and internal displacement of people. As a result, large parts
of Sudan were isolated and underdeveloped with very minimal access to basic services and
infrastructure; this was particularly the case in the South, war-affected areas of the North,
West, East; and the Three Areas. Indeed, the country was characterized by wide disparities
along regional lines, between urban and rural areas, and by gender. 3 Beyond widespread
human suffering, the conflict resulted in isolation from the international community and
limited development assistance.

4.     The signing of the CPA in January 2005 provided an unprecedented window of
opportunity to turn the devastation of years of war, displacement, and underdevelopment into a
new era of peace and prosperity. The strategy for meeting the reconstruction and development
needs of Sudan was initiated in January 2004 by forming a Joint Assessment Mission (JAM)
which produced a comprehensive report on the strategy and priority areas for reconstruction
and development requirements of the country.

5.      The challenges of Sudan's reconstruction called for an unprecedented response by the
international community, both in terms of funding and in terms of coordination of the
reconstruction effort. In a series of donor meetings during the 2003-2005 periods, donors
agreed on the need for advanced planning for, and effective coordination of, the reconstruction

6.      Process as well as overall leadership of GONU and GOSS. It was in this context that
the formation of Multi Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) was conceived.

7.     As part of the wealth-sharing protocol, the CPA called for the creation of two Multi-
Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs): one for the Government of National Unity (MDTF-N), and one
for the Government of South Sudan (MDTF-SS). The two TF were officially established
following the Oslo conference in April 2005. Donors from more than 10 countries, including
the European Union (EU), pledged over US$500 million. The World Bank made a historic
contribution of US$10 million from its net income.

8.       MTDF-N (TF057323) was established for the war-affected areas in the north
(including the Three Areas), MDTF-SS (TF054777) was established for the rehabilitation and
improvement of basic services in Southern Sudan. After considering different options, the GoS
and the SPLM requested the World Bank to administrator both MDTFs. The rationale for the
World Bank’s involvement as fiduciary administrator was that, given its worldwide experience
and expertise in institution building in conflict-affected areas, and its experience in transport
infrastructure projects in post-conflict environments, the Bank was uniquely positioned to
manage the MDTF. The Bank also supported the reconstruction and development efforts by
playing a coordinating role among development partners and the Government.

9.       The MDTF-N is governed by an Oversight Committee (OC) consisting of
representatives from the Government of National Unity, Development Partners, together with
the World Bank as administrator of the fund and associated projects. The National Emergency
Transport Rehabilitation Project (NETREP) for which this ICR is being prepared, was one of
the projects conceived within the framework of the MDTF-N to improve selected transport
infrastructure considered critical to enhancing the benefits of the peace agreement by focusing
on the Three Areas.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators4

10.     The development objectives of the project as outlined in the Final Project Proposal
(FPP) were to facilitate the country’s economic and social recovery through improved physical
access to goods, markets, and administrative and social services.

11.    To achieve the PDO, the project focused on two key trade routes linking the North and
the South with Port Sudan, namely: (i) the Wau-Khartoum-Port Sudan corridor; and (ii) the
Port Sudan – Kosti – Malakal – Juba corridor. The other focus was on addressing the isolation
of communities in the three conflict-affected areas in northern Sudan, namely: South Kordofan,
Blue Nile and Abyei.




4
 Due to the emergency nature of the project, the PDO indicators at approval were generic, and specific,
measureable, attainable and realistic targets were established at the Mid-term review in May 2010.

                                                        2
12.     To attain the project development objective, NETREP was designed with three broad
components : (i) removing key transport bottlenecks that seriously hamper trade and recovery
efforts; (ii) providing equipment and technical assistance related to operation, maintenance and
supervision of works, thereby building capacity in management, implementation and
subsequent operation and maintenance; and (iii) strengthening multi-modal operations and
improving sector management capabilities of the Government

13.    The project was designed as an emergency operation to contribute as quickly as
possible to economic recovery and peace-building by restoring existing assets and improving
access to basic services. The NETREP was prepared, from concept stage to approval in 12
months, and designed to have an implementation period of 36 months, consistent with the
expected tenure of the MDTFs. Given the emergency nature of the intervention and the limited
available information, the focus in defining the results framework at design stage was rightly
placed on measurable outputs rather than more nebulous outcomes in a post-conflict
environment, to measure progress towards the attainment of the PDO. Accordingly,
monitoring was envisaged to focus on the physical deliverables, when they would become
functional and timeliness of other interventions.

14.        The key PDO performance indicators were:

      1. Rural accessibility is improved in areas affected by project investments;
      2. Time taken for villagers to reach closest markets and services reduced;
      3. Cost of key commodities reduced in villages and towns affected by project investments;
      4. Training of staff provided and basic capacity restored/increased in implementing
         agencies;
      5. Normal traffic operations resumed on the key rail and waterway arteries to facilitate
         movements on the key import/export links;
      6. The civil works, equipment and subsequent operation and maintenance financed
         through the project provide employment for the local population in all rehabilitations,
         operations and maintenance activities.

1.2.1      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification5

15.     While the PDO and expected outcomes remained unchanged, key outcome indicators
were changed four times during the course of implementation: at the time of additional
financing (AF) in May 2009, at the Mid Term Review in May 2010, during project
restructurings in 2011; and 2012. The main reasons for the changing the KPI were to make
them specific and measurable, to introduce the Bank’s core indicators, and to try and ensure
that, as better information became available, the substantive outcomes associated with the
project were better reflected in the formal monitoring framework. Table 1 provides the changes
made to the PDO indicators in the course of project implementation.

 List of indicators presented in the datasheet are based on changes made during restructuring, see Table 1 below
and Annex B for more details.

                                                        3
16.     As the modifications mainly reflected changes to outcome indicators, changes in
project scope, cancellation of project activities, and extension of grant closing dates, all
restructurings were treated as Level 2, and approved by the Country Director.

17.    For comparison purposes, the original and the final (June 2012) PDO indicators and
intermediate KPI are presented in Annex 2B: Revised Results Framework and Monitoring.

1.3 Main Beneficiaries


18.      The main beneficiaries as described in the FPP were: (i) the transport construction
industry and users of road, rail and waterway transport facilities throughout Sudan; and
(ii) the local population in the hinterland of project interventions, including communities
in the Three Areas. In addition, staff of the implementing agencies that received training
also benefited from the project.

19.     Through the project, critical rail and road links were rehabilitated providing all
weather transport access to 261,000 and 26,000 residents in the serviced hinterland of the
infrastructure respectively, thereby improving greater improving the integration of people
and communities, and indirectly facilitating economic and social cohesion of the country.
The project also enabled the communities living along the roads to benefit from growth in
trade and various economic activities, such as increased employment opportunities,
improved accessibility to markets and essential social services such as health and
education; and marked reductions in travel time.

1.4 Original Components

20.     NETREP consisted of three components: Component 1 was to cover rail related
activities and some interventions to promote multi-modal operations at Port Sudan and
improve sector management; Component 2 was to focus on activities related to river
transport; and Component 3 was to improve accessibility mainly through the
rehabilitation of roads in the Three Areas. Components 1, 2 and 3 were to be
implemented independently by the Sudan Rail Corporation (SRC), River Transport
Corporation (RTC) and the National Highway Authority (NHA) respectively. The Sudan
Port Corporation (SPC) was to assist RTC with the physical works of river port
development activities; and the Inland River Navigation Department was to assist with
the studies related to dredging and hydrographic survey of the White Nile. The MTRB
through its Planning Unit coordinated project activities and monitored progress of
implementation.

21.       The original components consisted of the following activities:

         Component 1: Rehabilitation of critical rail infrastructure and services which
          consists of: (i) rehabilitation of Babanousa-Wau railway line; (ii) de-mining
          related to rehabilitation of Babanousa-Wau railway line; (iii) rehabilitation of
          Bridge number 353 on the Khartoum to Port Sudan rail section; (iv) rail
          connections to the container depot in the Damadama area of Port Sudan; (v)
          improvement of rail connections at existing and new Port at Kosti; (vi) studies on
          enhancing private sector participation in railway operations; (vii) support for
          project management; (viii) enhancement of sector management capacity; and (ix)
          improving inter- modal operations at Port Sudan.

         Component 2: Improvements to River Transport Services which consists of:
          (i) Provision of equipment in support of port operation; (ii) concessioning of the
                                              7
       new port at Kosti; (iii) study to establish emergency dredging and navigational
       needs; and (iv) support for project implementation including targeted institutional
       development and capacity building activities.

      Component 3: Road improvements with focus on the Three Areas which
       consists of: (i) Spot improvements on Kadougli to Kaouda road (135 km) and
       section 2 of the E’ Damazin to El Kurmuk road (55km) and Hamashkraid to El
       Gahwa road (90 km); (ii) de-mining associated with road design and improvement
       activities; (iii) detailed design of Abu Jubayah to Talodi to Kadugli road (310
       km), Damazin to Geissan road (160 km) and Toker to Garora road (215 km); (iv)
       feasibility studies and detailed design of Geissan to Kurmuk road (160 km),
       Damazin to Renk road (200 km), Kadugli to Hegleig road (170 km), and Muglad
       to Abyei road (160 km); and (v) project management and institutional
       development and capacity building including: (a) carrying out of various studies
       on sustainable road sector financing, road safety and axle load control; (b)
       establishment of pavement management system; (c) improvements to materials
       testing laboratory; and (d) training, workshops, study tours and targeted TA.

1.5 Revised Components

22.      As a result of a government decision to privatize the RTC, those related elements
of Component 2 were cancelled and the Grant Agreement revised to reflect the necessary
changes in implementing arrangements. The RTC Subsidiary Agreement was terminated,
all related activities were cancelled, and responsibilities of implementing those remaining
activities were transferred to MTRB. The changes were formalized through an
amendment of the Grant Letter in April 2008. Accordingly the revised components and
implementation arrangements were as follows:

      Component 1: Rehabilitation of critical rail infrastructure and service would be
       implemented by Sudan Railways Corporation (SRC);
      Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and improvements to River Transport
       Services. This component would include the Ministry of Transport, Roads and
       Bridges activities and the residual old Component 2 activities. This component
       would be implemented by the Ministry of Transport, Roads and Bridges; and
      Component 3: Roads improvements with focus on the three areas would be
       implemented by the National Highway Authority (NHA).

23.     In addition to revising components, further changes were made to a number of
other activities within each component. This was done on four occasions through project
restructuring, primarily to respond to various emerging needs during implementation, and
a change in the priorities of the GoS. The table below summarizes changes made to the
project components/activities during the course of implementation.

            1.6 Other significant changes

            24.     Project restructuring: During the course of implementation, to address emerging
            challenges, the project was restructured four times: in April 2008, May 2009, June 2011
            and June 2012. The main reasons for project restructured were: (a) financing re-
            arrangement between MDTF and GONU, with the latter keen to accelerate the
            implementation of some priority components from their own resources, the change of
            implementing agency and the resulting reallocation of funds within and among
            components; (b) requirements for additional financing; and (c) dropping of activities
            reflecting the privatization of RTB and changes in scope of some of the remaining
            interventions (changing from gravel to asphalt surfacing for a number of the road sections
            necessitating reallocation and an AF to cover the increased costs) to respond to emerging
            challenges. As a result of these changes, the project closing date has been extended three
            times: in 2009, 2011 and 2012. Details of the changes are presented in Table 3.

25.     Extension of project closing dates: The project closing date was extended three
times: (i) at the time of AF in May 2009; (ii) at the third project restructuring in 2011;
and (iii) at the last restructuring in June 2012. The first extension from the original
closing date of December 2009 to June 2011 was required to allow sufficient time for
completing the additional works included as result of the AF. The second and third
extensions, from June 2011 to June 2012 and then to June 2013 were required to allow
completion of on-going activities and ensure achievements of the PDO.

26.     Financing Arrangements: The original financing arrangement for all activities
was on a one to two ratio for MDTF-N and GoNU respectively. However, this
arrangement was changed during the first Grant Amendment in April 2008.
Consequently, it was agreed that the one to two ratio for MDTF-N and GoNU
respectively be maintained only for works, and all other expenditure related to services
and trainings be 100% funded from the MDTF-N.

Grant Cancellation: A total amount of US$31.70 million was eventually cancelled from
the grant amount due to: (i) mis-procurement associated the taking-over of sections
A,C,D, and E of Kadugli-Kaouda road by the respective local Government that awarded
a contract to a local contractor, while the procurement process under NETREP
(US$19.75 million) remained underway; (ii) In addition, there was cost savings from
various activities including PMS (US$5.95 million), which were cancelled consistent
with OP/BP 13.25 7 , and (iii) unutilized funds from Damazin-Kurmuk road section-2
(US$6.0 million). Thus, the allocation to the project from the MDTF-N was finally
reduced from US$87.25million to US$55.55 million. (A summary of the original and
final Grant allocation is presented in Annex 1).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

27.    Although some activities of the project were dropped, and some taken forward
with parallel support from the GoNU outside the project,, NETREP is considered to have
achieved its objective of facilitating the country’s economic and social recovery through
improved physical access to goods, markets, and administrative and social services as an
all-weather road was provided along the Demazin – Kurmuk, Kadugli - Kaouda and
Gadamai-Hamashkorieb road sections; and the Babanusa-Wau rail line was restored and
became operational after 25 years under the project.

28.     However, implementation of the project was confronted by a number of
challenges soon after effectiveness, which is possibly not surprising in an emergency
operation in such a fluid context, including the secession of South Sudan. Key factors
affecting implementation were the relatively weak capacity of the implementing
agencies, the changes in the priorities of the GoNU, delays in release of counterpart funds

and security issues. More detailed information on the factors affecting implementation is
provided in the relevant section below.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

29.     Soundness of background analysis: NETREP was designed as an emergency
intervention to support the immediate recovery and peace-building effort in the country
as per the JAM framework. The selected road and rail corridors were the most critical
routes to connect conflict affected areas and remove isolation of the population thereby
bringing cohesion of the country - which was directly related to achieving the objectives
of the CPA. The project was considered to be timely, was delivered in an impressively
short period of time, and is considered to have contributed in a substantive manner to
sustainable peace building in Sudan.

30.     Due to highly fragile and post conflict environment, and hence absence of active
construction market at appraisal and the difficulties of conducting robust surveys ex ante,
detailed cost estimates were difficult to generate at appraisal, and hence reliance was
placed on comparative estimates for similar interventions in similar contexts, together
with a risk premium to reflect the particular circumstances. .

31.    Lessons from previous emergency infrastructure projects were taken into account
during preparation, as were a number of other sources including: (i) the detailed
assessment of the transport sector to better understand sectorial issues; and (ii) the
capacity assessment of implementing agencies with regard to procurement, financial
management and disbursement. As a result, major risks were identified and mitigation
measures put in place.

32.     Assessment of Project Design: The project was designed with the objectives that
were relevant at the time and was responsive to the needs of Sudan in the early post
conflict period. A detailed review of the existing transport sector situation (including
financial and procurement assessments) was undertaken which provided a very solid
foundation, for a post-conflict environment, to identify and implement the project.

33.     Because of pressing needs at the time for reconstruction and recovery, NETREP
was designed to provide financing to the Government for rehabilitation works combined
with policy advice, institutional development and reform assistance; all of which are
essential for long-term sustainability of investments in the road sector. The project was
considered to be designed in a flexible manner to permit rapid responses to changing
circumstances, and allow adjustments (through restructuring) to the size and scope of
components as implementation progressed.

34.    To mitigate capacity constraints in the sector, the overall project management
responsibilities were entrusted to Project Management Teams (PMT) established in each
IA. This arrangement, together with other technical assistances, contributed to ensuring
local ownership and strengthened institutional capacities of the IAs.

35.     The overall design, however, was ambitious in that it attempted to address
sectorial issues in a single operation in a very short period of time: from railway
                                            13
rehabilitation, road improvements, detail engineering design of 945 km and feeder roads
development study to capacity building and institutional strengthening - all in 3 years.
There was no explanation provided in the project documents as why the project was
designed to be implemented only in 36 months, although the suspicion is that it was tied
in some way to the perceived duration of the MDTF.. However, given the scope and scale
of the project, inadequate implementation capacity at the time, and security uncertainties,
it was with the benefit of hindsight unrealistic that such a project could be implemented
and achieve its objectives in only 3 years. This was borne out by the fact that the project
eventually required 6.5 years of implementation.

36.     Risks and Mitigation: The risk assessment undertaken at appraisal classified the
project as a high risk in terms of financial management, procurement and security issues.
Security issues were rightly identified as the primary risks to implementation and
appropriate mitigation measures were beyond the control of the project. Additional risks
were seen as: (i) lack of capacity and experience in using World Bank Guidelines and
procedures; (ii) limited local consulting and contracting industry; and (iii) potential
delays in demining activities. The rating of the risk associated with the timely release of
counterpart funds appeared to overestimate the GoNU’s financial situation at the time;
rated as low. During the course of project implementation, the provision of counterpart
funds became a major challenge as early as 12 months in project implementation.

       a. Lack of capacity and experience in using Bank Guidelines and procedures:
          this was identified at appraisal as potential risk to implementation and
          dedicated PMTs were established in each implementing agency (IA) to
          mitigate the problem. The PMTs were staffed with experts seconded from
          each IA and were supported by external experts as and when needed. Each
          PMT was responsible for implementation of its respective component. This
          arrangement contributed to the success of the project although did not bring
          the required level of implementation support.
       b. Fiduciary risk: Given the number of activities, weak institutional
          arrangements, absence of financial rules and regulation, the FM risk was high.
          To minimize these risks additional FM arrangements were put in place,
          including: (i) recruitment of consultants to support the financial management
          staff of the IAs; (ii) the use of direct payments; (iii) use of parallel accounting
          records to reflect project activities; and (iv) submission of monthly and
          quarterly progress reports by the PMTs. The internal audit and expenditures
          were monitored by a Monitoring Agent (MA) hired by the Bank to assist all
          projects funded by MDTF. The project was audited by Sudan Auditor
          General according to international standards. All these arrangements have
          positively contributed to the performance of the project.
       c. General security risk. This was mainly associated with resumption of conflicts
          in the conflict affected areas of Sudan and was largely outside the control of
          the project. Although the issue was discussed at appraisal, there was no
          concrete mitigation measure put in place. Indeed, conflict in the Blue Nile
          area had disrupted the construction of Damazin - Kurmuk road which led to
          suspension of the contract in September 2011 and eventual termination in
          March 2013 without the works being completed.
                                            14
37.    As an emergency operation, the project did not go through a Quality-at-Entry
review by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG).

2.2 Implementation

38.     The major factors that contributed to the slow implementation of the project were
related to scope changes, inadequate capacity of the IA, delays in release of counterpart
funds and uncertainty of security issues. To address problems arising during
implementation, the project was restructured four times and closing date extended three
times to allow completion of on-going activities. The following paragraphs provide a
summary of each factor that contributes to the slow progress of the project.

39.     Scope changes: The project initially sought to reestablish basic transport services
in the war affected areas through spot improvement and maintenance of the existing
roads. However, because of heavy deterioration on Damazin - Kurmuk road, spot
improvement was no longer the preferred option, and required upgrading of the road to a
higher standard which caused delays in the startup of the operation and excessively
increasing the cost.

40.     Implementation capacity constraints: Although attempts were made to mitigate
capacity constraints by establishing dedicated PMTs in each IA, the PMT lack qualified
personnel, particularly for procurement activities and M&E. This has contributed to the
delays in implementation of project activities.

41.    Insecurity and clearing of landmines: Some project sites, especially roads,
experienced security challenges during implementation. Design works were cancelled on
Kadugli - Heglige section and Damazin – Geissan– Kurmuk roads due to presence of
mines; and road construction works were terminated on Damazin - Kurmuk section due
to ongoing conflict in the Blue Nile States. These problems negatively affect the
outcomes of the project.

42.    Delays in release of counterpart fund: The financing arrangement being joint
between the GoNU and the MDTF has also affected implementation as the Government
was unable to meet its obligation of availing counterpart funds on a timely manner.
Timely release of counterpart funds was a challenge throughout project implementation
negatively affecting progress, and at times, was put as a condition by contractors for
completing outstanding works.8

43.     Contract Termination and Construction Claims: The conflict in the Blue Nile
State had left a negative impact on the overall project performance as part of the Damazin
- Kurmuk road; section 2 had to be terminated in March 2013 before completion. The
situation was beyond the control of project and was considered as force majeure. As per
the Government’s proposal, the MDTF-N allocation for the gravel works on Damazin -

Kurmuk road section 1 was swapped with the provision for compensation (settlement of
claims) for section 2. The proposal was to utilize the amount of US$6.59 million
earmarked by the MDTF-N for section 1 to meet the compensation of the Contractor’s
claims on section 2. Thus section 1 was dropped from NETREP. The Government took
over the responsibility of financing the outstanding works for section 1, and the
contractor’s claim in the amount of US$6.55 million for damages sustained due to the
force majeure and termination of the contract has been paid from the Grant amount.9

44.     Mid-Term Review (MTR): A midterm review was not envisaged at preparation.
As implementation progressed, it was agreed to hold MTR (ISR#3) to review project
implementation and planned for November 2009. The MTR actually held in May 2010
and confirmed that the project was likely to achieve its objectives at completion of
project activities. By the time of the MTR, most of the activities in component 1, 2, and 3
were either completed or progressing well. The review identified the following issues as
the main reasons for delays in implementation: (i) logistics problems in some project sites
because of the remoteness of the sites from administrative centers, (ii) presence of mines
and delays in demining activities, (iii) delays in procurement process; and (iv) delays in
release of counterpart funds; and suggested recommendations to improve the situation.
The main outcome of the MTR, however, was establishing baseline and target data for
PDO and intermediate KPIs which were then used monitor the progress of the project.

2.3        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

45.     M&E Design: The emergency nature of the project and post conflict environment
meant that obtaining information for the baseline data was extremely challenging.
According to the design, monitoring and evaluation was to focus on outputs and results,
which were to be measured by the project and contracted specialists. The project was to
utilize existing data sources supplemented by regular routine data collection, and further
updates to be carried out by contracted specialists. As such, the project focused on
monitoring whether physical deliverables are produced and made functional, and that key
studies are completed timely. To monitor overall project performance, five indictors for
the PDO, and some additional KPIs for each component were selected at project
preparation. These were later redefined and streamlined with commonly used Bank sector
indicators. It is worth noting that the original indicators were directly derived from what
the project would do although were not specific and measurable.

46.     Implementation: The selected indicators were collected by the Monitoring Agent
through the IA as implementation of the project progressed, and were disseminated in
quarterly progress reports. The IA supplied the relevant data and the Bank monitored the
progress through regular supervision missions. It must be noted, however, that data was
not provided regularly and reliability of the information at times was questionable due to
inconsistencies in data collections.

47.    The completed road sections and railway line have now become part of the
national network system and are subject to regular monitoring by the respective
Government agencies. SRC and NHA have dedicated M&E departments that monitor
performance of completed infrastructures as part of the network.

48.    Utilization: Baseline indicators were established half way in the project life at
MTR in May 2010. Before the establishment of the baseline, outputs were measured to
monitor progress. After the MTR, indictors were tracked through the pro reject and used
to monitor progress.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

49.     The project was prepared under OP 8.00: Rapid Response to Crises and
Emergency which stipulates that the project could follow simplified procedures regarding
social and environment safeguard policies. However, in the course of implementation,
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) were prepared for all components
where physical works were likely to cause impacts. In addition, on Damazin-Kurmuk
road section, a resettlement action plan was developed and resettlement of 58 businesses
was successfully completed to the satisfaction of project affected people. For most of the
implementation period compliance to environment and social safeguards was rated as
moderately satisfactory.

50.     Through the project an Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) was prepared and has been used as a basis for preparing environment and social
impact assessment on road projects. In addition, the project supported the establishment
of the Environmental and Social Management Unit (ESMU) in the MTRB; and staff were
trained in application of basic safeguard requirements in projects. It is expected that this
unit will lead the implementation of safeguard related issues for the Ministry.

51.    Financial Management (FM): At appraisal, the project was assessed as a high
risk, because of weak institutional arrangements, regulatory environment, lack of
capacity and absence of financial rules and regulations. Mitigation measures were put in
place to strengthen the FM system, including supporting the FM staff of the IA with a
consultant. As a result, FM compliance in general was satisfactory.

52.    Audit reports and Interim Financial Reports were submitted to the Bank on a
timely manner. There are no unresolved fiduciary issues at project completion and, to a
large extent the implementing agencies have complied with financial management
covenants.

53.  Final project cost: As at 27 Nov.2013, US$53.34 million was disbursed from
MDTF-N bringing the disbursement level to 96%.

54.    Procurement: At project appraisal, the procurement capacity assessment was
carried out in the three implementing agencies to verify whether there was adequate
capacity to carry out procurement activities in compliance with World Bank procedures.
As a result of this assessment, a procurement specialist was recruited for the project to

                                            17
strengthen the capacity of the IA. Although all procurement activities were carried out in
accordance with relevant World Bank Procurement Guidelines, the project faced two
major challenges: (i) mis-procurement with grant cancellation on part of Kadulgli-Kauda
road section; and (ii) contract termination of Damazin-Kurmuk road Section 2 due to
security reasons. Misprocurement was declared when the Kadugli -Kaouda road (Lots C,
D & E) was awarded to a national contractor by the local authorities while the bid for the
same lots was floated under NETREP. The Bank declared misprocurement and funds
allocated to these lots in the amount of US$19.75 million were cancelled from the Grant.
Another challenge was termination of Damazin-Kurmuk section 2 to due force majeure
associated with security issues. By the closing of the project, there were no unresolved
procurement issues and the above mentioned challenges did little influence to the
outcome of the PDO.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

55.     Maintenance of the roads improved under the project: NHA has a road toll
collection system in place to finance maintenance of the national road network. To
improve utilization of funds, and increase engagement of road users in the administration
of funds, the National Transport Master Plan prepared under the Technical Assistance
Facility recommended the establishment of an independent Road Fund office. Currently,
the recommendation is under review by the Government. For the roads improved under
the project, NHA has already included them in its annual maintenance program to ensure
sustainability of the investment. As an alternative option of long term maintenance, it is
recommended that NHA considers long term Performance Based Maintenance
contracting in the future. In addition, when the pavement management system (PMS)
becomes operational, it would allow the NHA to monitor performance of the road
network and develop appropriate maintenance program on technically sound grounds.

56.      As for the railways infrastructure system, its maintenance is financed by
government annual budget and from collections of railway user fees from the private rail
transport operators. SRC has been maintaining the Babanusa-Wau rail in the past as part
of its annual maintenance program, and this will continue to be the case in the future.

57.    There are a number of activities completed under NETREP that could be
considered for financing by GoS and/or development partners in near future. Engineering
design of 945 km of national and rural roads is complete and could further be refined
with additional information to make them ready for implementation. The feeder road
development plan initiated under the project could also be a good starting point to
develop a feeder road master plan. Thus, 185 km of rural road (Toker – Garora Road) in
the East has already been selected for construction with a financial support from Arab
Fund for Economic and Social Development.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: Significant

                                           18
58.    The project objectives are highly relevant to the country’s development agenda.
As outlined in the Country Economic Memorandum, ensuring access to basic services
and connectivity is an essential factor to support basic livelihoods of the population,
especially in the lagged regions such as the South, and The Three areas10 - confirming the
relevance of the project objectives and areas of interventions.

59.     The project continue to be relevant as the results achieved through the project are
serving the population affected by the civil war, and contributed to the realization of
sustainable peace, thereby facilitating cohesion of the country. As a result of the project
interventions, war affected areas have now all-weather access to essential social services
and market places for the first time; journey times and travel cost have reduced markedly
due to improved roads and rail line - facilitating trade and commerce between regions. In
some places cost of goods has fallen by up to 20% compared to the pre-construction
period.11
60.     In addition, the studies conducted under the project have focused on the transport
sector and were able to reveal a number of problems and issues that would be considered
by the policy makers.

Relevance of design: High

61.     The core concept design was extremely relevant, in that it set out to respond to the
country immediate challenges of restoring damaged infrastructure and removing transport
bottle necks in war affected areas, thereby improving connectivity and facilitating
sustainable peace in post conflict Sudan. The activities defined under each component
were particularly relevant at the time of preparation and project approval and were in line
with JAM framework; and have remained relevant at completion.

62.      The design of the project was also particularly relevant in that it combined the
restoration of access through the implementation of infrastructure investments with
institutional capacity strengthening across three institutions and helped developing
partnerships, e.g. involvement of staffs of the implementing agencies in the PMT in
managing the respective project components.

63.     Throughout project implementation relevance was refined by the project’s
flexibility to adapt to the client’s emerging needs; and thus operations remained
important to achieving development objectives.

64.     Considering the relevance ratings discussed above for objectives and design, the
overall relevance rating is HIGH.

65.    As explained in Section 1 of this ICR, while key outcome indicators were
changed at various occasions to reflect changes made to the components, the PDO and
expected outcomes remained unchanged throughout project implementation. The
following paragraphs asses the efficacy of the project at the time of each restructurings.

Original PDO Efficacy at the time of 1st restructuring: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66.     Achievement towards the original PDO indicators at the time of first restructured
(First Amendment to Letter Agreement, April 24, 2008) is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. The recorded results at this time (ISR#1), when 48% of the project time
was elapsed, reflect that major works contracts that would result the achievements of
PDO were just signed, and no actual works were commenced, and hence no results were
achieved. Delays in release of counterpart funds and delays in de-mining of project roads
were major challenges affecting project implementation. As a result the project
disbursement was only 13% against 48% of project time.

Efficacy at the time of 2nd restructuring: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     The performance of the project after the first restructuring has improved. The
revision of the financing arrangement (1st restructuring) has improved the ability of the
Government to fulfill its commitment, and thus avail counterpart funds timely. The ISR
has made a note that at this stage all outstanding counterpart funds were paid, improving
overall performance of the project. The recorded results at this time (ISR#3) reflect that
contracts for all road improvement and design works were concluded, and about 90
percent of the grant amount was committed. Also, rehabilitation of 252 km Babanusa-
Wau rail line (56% of the total) was complete providing access to the community to
markets and social services; and construction works on Gadamai-Hamashkorieb road was
progressing well. As a result, disbursement has reached 27%. As such, progress towards
achieving PDO is rated moderately satisfactory on account that all major works contracts
are progressing well and the railway line has become partially operational. At this stage
the Grant closing date was extended to June 2011 to allow completion of on-going
activities.

Efficacy at the time of 3rd restructuring: Satisfactory

68.    With the injection of additional financing (2nd restructuring) in the amount of
US$43.75, the project has shown significant improvement when the 3rd restructuring was
approved in June 2011. At this stage, rehabilitation of Babanusa-Wau rail line (446 km)
was completed connecting north and south Sudan, providing access to over 200,000
people and transporting over 650,000 tons of freight per annum. Two more road
improvement works in the war affected areas with a total length of 112 km were
completed providing all-weather access to about 5,500 people, and reducing travel time
from 11.6 hours to 6.6 hours. Also, engineering design of 995 km of national and rural
roads was completed; and studies on private sector participation in rail transport, Port
Sudan trade facilitation, and Inland River Navigation Diagnostics, as well as the
preparation of the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) were completed. As a result
of improved performance, disbursement has reached a record level of 45% and key

                                           20
performance indicators were largely achieved (ISR#8) contributing to the overall
achievement of the PDO.

Efficacy at the time of the 4th restructuring: Moderately Satisfactory

69.      The third restructuring left the project with cancellation of US$19.75million due
to mis-procurement, and also the project faced implementation challenges resulted from
suspension of Damazin-Kurmuk road section due to security reasons. Although most of
key activities delivering outputs were completed or progressing well, suspension of the
part of Damazin Kurmuk road contract wouldn’t allow full achievement of the PDO, and
thus progress towards PDO is downgraded to moderately satisfactory. However, the
completed rail line and road projects continue providing the population access to social
and administrative services and market places, thereby facilitating trade and connectivity
among regions. During 2010 and within eight month, SRC was able to run 25 trains that
handled 10,819 tons of goods. Also between 1/09/2010 and 5/11/2011 it carried 42,492
tons and was able to run 76 trains. SRC has also managed to operate 5 blocked trains for
passengers for carrying the returnees back to South Sudan after its independence. The
Gadamai-Hamashkorieb road (81 km) and Kadugli-Kaouda road (30 km) were fully
completed while Damazin-Kurmuk was improved to passable condition providing access
to over 26,000 people, and reducing travel time from 11.6 hours to 2 hours. The
institutional development studies have initiated policy dialogue that would help to
improve the performance of the transport sector. As such, progress towards achieving
PDO was rated moderately satisfactory.

Efficacy at project completion: Moderately Satisfactory

70.     The last restructuring left the project with a reduced scope as Damazin Kurmuk
section 1 was dropped from NETREP because, by the request of the Government, the
MDTF-N allocation for this section was transferred to section 2 to pay compensation to
the contractor for section 2 which was terminated due to emerging insecurity in the
project area. As a result, responsibilities of completing all outstanding works on section 1
were transferred to the Government and Damazin-Kurmuk section 1 was dropped from
MDTF reducing the scope of the project from 95 km to 45 km. In addition, to reflect the
impact of reduced scope on Damazin-Kurmuk road, outcome targets for reduction in
travel time, beneficiary population, and increase in traffic volume were reduced
accordingly.12 However, the project has largely achieved its PDO as a result of completed
activities under each component prior to the last restructuring, and given the benefits
realized under the project (and summarized in the Results Framework), the efficacy
rating at completion is held as moderately satisfactory despite the reduced scope.

3.3 Efficiency

71.     There was no detailed economic analysis conducted at project preparation because
of the emergency nature of the operation, and preparing a reliable and meaningful
demand forecast would have been difficult if not impossible from such a low base. At
the time of project preparation, traffic was negligible on the destroyed infrastructure, and
the demand for transport infrastructure was latent and driven by the need to remove key
bottlenecks for: (i) peace keeping operations; (ii) distribution of relief goods; (iii) opening
and improving of physical access to goods, markets and social services; and thus the
traditional cost benefit analysis and feasibility indicators such as the Economic Internal
Rate of Return (EIRR) and the Net Present Value (NPV) were no longer feasible in such
post conflict situation where transport needs determined the nature, size and magnitude of
the transport interventions. More generally, the transport development interventions were
needed to be socially sound and contribute to the peace building process and cohesion of
the country. As the project passed through a number of restructurings, for the purpose of
ICR evaluation, efficiency was assessed at the time of each restructuring, as detailed in
the following paragraphs.

Original PDO Efficiency at the time of 1st restructuring: moderately unsatisfactory

72.    The efficiency of the project for the period before restructuring, January 2007 till
April 2008 is rated low. By the time of the first restructuring, only 13% of the Grant had
been disbursed with very limited delivery of results against 42% of project
implementation period. By June 2008 only few contracts were signed and no actual
physical work commenced, as a result few economic benefits has been realized at this
time.

Efficiency at the time of 2nd restructuring: Moderately satisfactory

73.     The second restructuring was done when disbursement has reached 27% against
77 % of implementation period. By this time, all design projects were contracted out,
50% of the rehabilitation of the railway line was completed, road works on Gadamai-
Hamashkoreib was progressing well, and as a result tangible economic benefits in terms
of improved access were being felt by the resident population along the completed
sections; and overall 90% of the Grant amount was committed. According to
disbursement, 252 km (50%) of the railway line was rehabilitated with only 26% of the
allocated budget, indicating that the railway line would be completed within budget.
Completion of the part of the railway line provided access to local communities to
markets and social services. In addition, design works of 995 km of roads, and technical
assistance to the implementing agency were progressing well. As such the efficiency of
the project at this stage was moderately satisfactory primary because although there had
been delays in implementation, there has been significant progress and real economic
benefits as improved access (rehabilitation of part of the railway) had been realized.

Efficiency at the time of 3rd restructuring: Moderately satisfactory

74.   The third restructuring was done in June 2011 when disbursement has reached
45% of the revised project cost (with additional financing). During the period between
                                              22
the 2nd and 3rd restructurings, the focus of the project was on delivering of the physical
infrastructure works. Thus, at this time, the Babanusa-Wau railway line and the Kadugli-
Kauda road section were completed; and Gadamai-Hamashkorieb road construction has
reached 80% - all delivering restored infrastructure and tangible economic benefits. In
addition four out of five studies and engineering design of 995 km of roads were largely
completed. More generally, at this stage results against the revised indictors were
substantially achieved and the resources expended over this time were considered to be
reasonable in comparison with both the benefits and with recognized norms (see table 4
below).

75.     No economic analysis was done for the Babanusa-Wau rail line where 445 km of
line was rehabilitated and resumed operations in March 2010. From actual expenditures,
the cost of rehabilitating the Babanousa-Wau rail line, including telecommunication
equipment was US$76,400 per km, which is reasonable for rehabilitation of a railway
line of similar nature. However, it is worth mentioning that the rehabilitation works was
carried out by SRC own force which may not reflect the market cost of doing similar
works.

Efficiency at the time completion: Moderately satisfactory

76.   At the time of project completion disbursement has reached 82% with all works
component completed except Damazin Kurmuk road section 1.

77.      As implementation progressed and the original scope was changed, an additional
financing was provided in 2009 for upgrading of Damazin- Kurmuk road to an asphalt
road standard; and a cost benefit analysis was made for the same. The EIRR at a discount
rate of 15 percent for the upgrading of the road was 23.32 percent, while the Net Present
Value (NPV) was SDG135,866, implying that upgrading of the road to an asphalt
standard would provide a real benefit that was not dissimilar from the average return to
transport projects in a recent review conducted by World Bank. 13 However, due to
various reasons (See paragraph 42 and 70 above) the scope was reduced to a gravel road
standard and part of the works contract was terminated due to insecurity in the area,
although the section of road is in passable condition. Hence, the economic evaluation
cannot be used to assess the efficiency of the project. Further, due to insecurity in the
project area, a revised economic analysis could not be conducted at completion. The
improved road section, however, has provided all-year access to the community and
improved physical access to goods, markets and social services, as planned originally.

78.     An economic analysis was done for the Gedamia-Harmashkoraib road section at
completion. The EIRR at a discount rate of 15 percent for the upgrading of the road was 5
percent, while the NPV was - 43,658, indicating that with the current level of use, the
road has limited economic return in terms of user benefit, but benefits will be social
reflecting the improved access and realized as traffic builds up.. Thus, the population in

the project area (355,700) will now easily access social services thereby improving their
livelihood, which is in line with the objectives of the project. The completed road will
also provide access to agricultural areas with livestock where development has been
hampered for years due to insecurity, isolation and poor accessibility to markets,
employment and social services.

79.    Out of the three originally planned road improvement works, the scope of two
(Kadougli–Kaouda and Damazin-Kurmuk) was changed during the course of
implementation, and hence it would not be easy to assess the efficiency as the original
cost estimate was based on a different assumption and scope of works. From actual
expenditure, however, can be asserted that cost of civil works completed under the
project was reasonable as shown on the table 4 below. For example, the Gadamai-
Hamashkoreib road was constructed to a double bituminous surface treatment standard at
a cost of US$0.25million per km, which is below the cost of doing similar works in
neighboring countries (Uganda and Ethiopia) -which is between $0.4 and $0.5 million per
km.

  2-   NA- Not applicable as the cost estimate at appraisal was for 55 km of spot improvements


80.     In addition, engineering design of 995 km of national and rural roads has been
completed and ready for construction. The feeder roads study has delivered feeder roads
development plan, and produced design and bidding documents for selected roads in
three states (Blue Nile, Kassala and South Kordofan). As part of the capacity building
effort (i) short term training was provided to 67 staff of NHA; and (ii) all the PMS
equipment have been delivered and specialized training provided to 12 NHA engineers
on use of and application of PMS equipment.

81.     By the end of the project all institutional development studies were completed and
have initiated policy dialogue that would help to improve the performance of the
transport sector. The formation of a functional ESMU under the Ministry would help
strengthening similar units in NHA and SRC. To strengthen the ESMU, 16 staff was
trained in the application of environment and social management plan in infrastructure
projects.

82.   On account of the above mentioned outcomes, progress towards achieving PDO at
completion is moderately satisfactory.




                                                        24
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome. Rating - Moderately Satisfactory

83.    The overall outcome rating for the project is Moderately Satisfactory based on
relevance, combined evaluation of the efficacy and efficiency at each restructuring as
explained above.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. Rating

84.      Poverty Impact: The project was delivered in areas with high agriculture
potential where transport plays critical role in improving the livelihood of the
communities. The improvement of roads and the rail line in these areas enhanced the
economy through increased agricultural production and access to market and social
services. The project also enabled the provision of all-year transport services for the
population living within the influence areas of the improved road corridors, providing
lower transport cost, creating employment opportunities and boosting local economy. The
MTR established that, due to improved access, commodity prices have shown reduction
of up to 20% compared to the situation prior to the project interventions.

85.     Gender Aspects: It was estimated that 48% 14of the beneficiaries in the project
area are women, reflecting the national gender split as a coarse indicator. The project
presented no evidence on gender mainstreaming in its activities and no data was collected
on gender. However, given the isolation of the project area prior to realization of the
project, improved transport will enable youth and women to have better access to social
services such as hospitals and schools.

86.     Social Development: The project was able to provide better access to social
services such as schools, health centers and markets which improved development of
business activities and livelihood of people. The project also facilitated the resettlement
of internally displaced people and improved cohesion of the country by breaking the
isolation of war affected communities. The immediate socio-economic impact has been
positive on the restoration of travel and livelihoods in areas served by the improved
roads, with visible increases in traffic volumes on the key roads on which improvements
have been carried out.

87.      Institutional Strengthening: The project assisted the MTRB to streamline
environment and social impact assessment studies into transport projects. To this effect a
dedicated Environment and Social Management Unit (ESMU) has been established in the
MTRB to oversee implementations of safeguard requirements in road projects. This will
assist proper screening of projects for environmental and social impacts before they get-
off for implementation.

88.    River transport has become operational with a joint venture agreement with the
government. Thus, with 70% and 30% share of private and Government respectively,
regular service between North and South has been continued until the separation of the
two countries in June 2011. Once the boarder issues are resolved the service will continue
between the two countries.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome. Rating – Substantial

89.    Although a road toll collection system intended for maintenance of the national
network is in place, effective utilization of funds remains a challenge. And also, as the
network expands, the country is likely to face revenue mobilization challenges.
Inadequate capacity for maintenance planning poses another challenge to ensure
sustainability of the investment. The PMS initiated under the project would support
planning and prioritization of maintenance operation if implemented as designed, which
requires Government’s commitment.

90.    To improve the application of funds for the intended purpose, the NTMP study
has suggested the establishment of an independent Road Fund to oversee funds
administration. However, the proposal by NTMPfor establishing a Road Fund office has
not been implemented by the end of the project.

91.     While the initiatives mentioned above are all promising and the Government has
shown its commitment to maintain the completed road and railway line by including
them in the annual maintenance plan, the risk to development outcomes in the medium
term depends on how soon the above mentioned recommendations will be implemented
by the Government. Given the fact that at the time of preparing the ICR (i) establishment
of the RF is still under discussion; and (ii) the implementation of the PMS has not yet
started, the risks to development outcomes remain substantial.

92.     Sustainability of the infrastructure is further challenged by the uncertainty of the
security in the project area. Part of the Babanusa-Wau rail line and Damazin- Kurmuk
road has already been affected. Thus, the above mentioned factor suggests that the risk to
development outcomes to be significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating - Moderately
    Satisfactory

93.     Bank performance during project entry was moderately satisfactory. The process
of identification and preparation of the project is detailed in Section 2 of this report. The
JAM recommendation and GoNU priorities together with the Bank’s experience in post-

                                             26
conflict countries served as a strategic plan and guided the identification and preparation
of the project.

94.    The design was relevant and appropriate in addressing key transport bottlenecks
in conflict affected areas of Sudan and improving institutional capacity constraints of
implementing agencies at the time.

95.     Given the weak implementation capacity at the time, acceptable implementation
arrangements for financial and procurement activities were provided at project design.
Major risks were also assessed and appropriate mitigation measures were put in place to
the extent possible at the time of design. However, risks related to counterpart funding,
security issues and compliance (by the Client) to the Bank’s operational procedures were
underestimated.

96.    The relevant operational policy (OP/BP8.0) was employed for processing the
operation. However, the project scope was ambitious to be achieved in the original
intended period; and outcome indicators were broad and not always specific and
measurable.

97.    It has to be noted that despite gloomy situations in post conflict environment
where risks to PDO were high, the Bank’s attempt to quickly respond to the country’s
immediate transport challenges, and not being risk avert, is commendable.

(b) Quality of Supervision. Rating - Moderately Satisfactory

98.     The Bank performance during implementation was moderately satisfactory. The
Bank carried out supervision every six months, and reports were sufficiently detailed and
well written highlighting key issues with action plans for next steps. Project design
changes were made timely to respond to emerging challenges. This was best
demonstrated in restructuring the project four times to align to the PDO. Although the
project was supported by dedicated PMT, implementation could have been improved
through specialized trainings in safeguards, procurement and general Bank procedure and
process to the implementing agencies. Performance ratings given in the Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs) were realistic, and sufficient attention was paid to the project’s
likely development impact. However, while the project became effective in January 2007
and the first supervision was conducted in May/June 2007, first ISR was filed in the
system in June 2008; and it is not clear as why the production of the first ISR was delayed.

c ) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance. Rating - Moderately
Satisfactory

99.    The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory on account of the
observed shortcomings in project preparation and implementation which led to several
changes in the project, even if the overall objective was maintained.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance. Rating - Moderately Unsatisfactory
                                            27
100. The major challenge during project implementation was the Government’s
inability to timely release counterpart funds. Despite revised financing arrangement (from
the original) in favor of the GoNU, availing counterpart funds was a challenge throughout
project implementation negatively affecting project performance. As a result, completion
of on-going activities suffered due to lack of counterpart funds, e.g. on Gadamai-
Hamashkorieb project road marking was not completed due to nonpayment of
counterpart funds.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance. Overall Rating - Moderately
    Satisfactory

101. Ministry of Transport, Roads and Bridges (MTRB): The Ministry was proactive
and committed to achieving the PDO. It played a critical role in coordinating various
activities and all the studies under its direct supervision were completed timely. Given its
limited capacity and being new to working with the Bank, its overall performance is rated
as moderately satisfactory.

102. National Highway Agency (NHA): NHA played a key role in administering most
of road works and associated studies. Except Damzin-Kurmuk section 2, which was
terminated due to security issues, all other road works and studies are complete.
However, NHA was slow in addressing contractual which was largely associated with
technical capacity of the institution. As such, the performance of NHA is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

103. Sudan Railway Corporation (SRC): All the activities under its responsibility were
completed timely. The Babanusa-Wau rail line became operational soon after
rehabilitation and communication equipment was also delivered with minimal delays. As
such the performance of SRC is rated satisfactory.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance - Rating:
Moderately Satisfactory

104. Although most of the activities under each implementing agencies were
completed, on accounts of weak capacity, delays in releasing counterpart funds, mis-
procurement, weak project management and delays in resolving implementation issues,
the overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

105. The transport infrastructure improvement and institutional development initiatives
of the MDTF-N had to overcome hurdles of reoccurring insecurity, low capacity, slow
procurement and challenging design and construction tasks before delivering results. The
key lessons drawn from the project are summarized as follows:

      Counterpart funding: The joint co-financing arrangement has been challenged
       by the slow flow of counterpart funding for payment certificates for works

                                            28
       executed by contractors and consultants. This has slowed the progress of the
       contracts and in some cases led to suspension of works. Parallel financing where
       government finances separate standalone projects may have reduced the risk, as
       contractors would make the necessary provision from the outset and delays in the
       release of counterpart funding would not affect every contract under the project.

      Changes in standard of interventions: The project initially sought to reestablish
       basic transports services in the areas that came out of a protracted civil war,
       through spot improvement and maintenance of the existing roads. However, local
       governments insisted for the upgrading of the roads to a higher asphalt road
       standard, which caused delays in the startup of the project and excessively
       increased the project cost. Therefore, it would be prudent to agree with key
       stakeholders, at the planning stage, on priorities and sequencing of interventions.

      Capacity building: Capacity of the implementing entities was weak and
       Technical Assistance was sought in critical areas. However, the institutions were
       reluctant to have TA. Although the establishment of Project Management Teams
       helped to pool some staff from within, the absence of TAs has resulted in a
       lengthy planning period, delays in procurement and difficulties in managing
       complex contractual matters. Going forward, TA for capacity building needs to be
       planned at project inception and has to focus on institutionalizing capacity
       development at all levels.

      Proactive project management is necessary to respond to changing
       circumstances. The design of the NETREP was substantially modified during
       implementation to take into account the changing situation. Decisions were made
       to drop activities that would not be completed under the project and activities
       were repackaged and restructured to make sure that their outcomes supported the
       achievements of the PDO.

      Selectivity in project activities can improve outcomes: NETREP was designed
       to address sectorial challenges in a single operation within a short period of time.
       The activities selected were many and diverse in scope. Some of the activities
       could not be completed in the original project period, and had to be dropped, and
       some were scaled down requiring restructuring of the project. On the other hand,
       the rehabilitation of Babanusa-Wau railway line has brought significant impact
       with relatively little intervention.

      Bank being proactive: Despite difficult situation in post conflict environment
       where many things are uncertain and risks to PDO were high, the Bank’s decision
       to quickly respond to the country’s immediate challenges, and thus taking risks to
       help, is commendable.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

106. The Government has not provided comments on the Bank’s ICR. However, it
produced its own ICR, the summary of which is presented in Annex 7. The Borrower
                                            29
ICR commented that the GONU has played a minor role in the preparation and the
design of the project, the reason of which the GONU did not give the project the
degree of support it deserves during implementation. This situation did not encourage
the government to own the project and to give enough weight and focus to the
implementation of the project in its initial stage in terms of proper staffing.

However, the Bank ICR team could not find evidence in the project documents (Final
Project Proposal or any other project preparation document) that supports the clients
comment.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

a) Economic Analysis

1.      There was no detailed economic analysis conducted at project preparation due to
the emergency nature of the operation. However, in 2009 an economic analysis was done
for upgrading of Damazin- Kurmuk road to an asphalt road standard; and a cost benefit
analysis was carried out for the same. The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) at a
discount rate of 15 percent for the upgrading of the road was 23.32 percent, while the Net
Present Value (NPV) was SDG135, 866, implying that upgrading the road to an asphalt
standard could result a positive benefit. However, due to various reasons the scope was
reduced to a gravel road standard and part of the works contract was terminated due to
force majeure, but road is in passable condition; and thus the economic evaluation could
not be used to assess the efficiency of the project at completion. The improved road
section, however, has provided all-year access to the community and improved physical
access to goods, markets and social services, as planned originally.

2.     There is no economic analysis carried out for the Babanusa-Wau railway line
which has been out of service 25 years prior to project approval.

3.     For Gedamia-Harmashkoraib road section, which was upgraded to double surface
treatment (DBST) standard, an economic feasibility assessment was done at completion.
The result of the analysis shows that the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) at a
discount rate of 15 percent for the upgrading of the road was 5 percent, while the Net
present value (NPV) was negative (- 43,658), indicating that with the current settings, the
road has limited economic return, rather it is a social project mainly aimed at opening up
the area and remove the isolation of the community of Hamashkoraib and its
surroundings.

Assumptions, Inputs and Methodology considered

4.      Traffic count: In 2002, the NHA has conducted traffic count in the project area
and has come up with a total of six vehicles per day (vpd). With a 5% estimated growth,
the total expected annual traffic by 2006 was 3141 or 8.6 vpd, and this was taken as base
year traffic. It was also assumed that: (i) a minimum of 5% traffic grown will be
maintained during the project life (25 years);(ii) construction started in 2009 and opened
for traffic in 2012. During its service life, periodic maintenance was assumed to happen
every five years after opening, the first one being at year 2017.

5.      Result of economic analysis: The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) at a
discount rate of 15 percent was 5 percent, while the Net present value (NPV) was
negative 43,658, indicating that with the current settings, the road has limited economic
return, rather it is a social project mainly aimed at opening up the area and remove the
isolation of the community of Hamashkoraib and its surroundings. The result of the
analysis is shown in table 3.1 below.

NPV                            (SDG 43,658.62)                (SDG 30,455.27)
IRR                            5%

6.      However, in terms of social benefits, the population in the project area (249,000)
will now easily access social services thereby improving their livelihood, which is in line
with the objectives of the project. The project will also provide access to agricultural
areas with livestock where development has been hampered by insecurity, isolation and
poor accessibility to markets, employment and social services.

7.      As has been shown above, the economic indicators of the analysis demonstrated
that the nature of the project is mainly of social benefits and its purpose was humanitarian
seeking to remove the isolation of the project area. But in the near future, the road is
expected to generate traffic.

pretty sound and timely and coincides with the JAM framework and the GONU agendas
and strategies, yet the key factors that have affected the project implementation were
generally associated with the project design. The design was described to be weak in
terms of its stated objectives, life (timeframe), management structure, financing
arrangement, recommended technical assistance as well as its monitoring and evaluation
plan.

2.      The project objectives were considered to be very broad to be achieved within the
life of the project specified in the implementation plan. Given the scope, scale and
magnitude of the project, its management & staff’s capacity as well as the level and
terms of funding, it will be very difficult to believe that such a project can be concluded
and attained its objectives within the said time frame. Well–defined, quantifiable and
realistic objectives are necessary pre-requisites for the success of such a project.
Designing an implementation plan for 39 months to conclude this project with such a
magnitude is an underestimation to the time required to conclude each activity and each
component in a developing country such as Sudan.

3.    The project management team was in short of key expertise in the areas of
procurement and M&E. This status has contributed to serious delays in implementation.

4.     The project financing arrangement and the partnership responsibilities between
the GONU and the MDTF has also resulted in long delays as the Government was
unable to meet its obligation in availing counterpart funds. Since the GONU has played
a minor role in the preparation and the design of the project, there was a feel that the
GONU has not given the project the degree of support that this project deserves. This
situation did not encourage the government to own the project and to give enough
weight and focus to the implementation of the project in its initial stage in terms of
proper staffing.

5.    Due to lack of the required plan for monitoring and evaluation, the Project
implementation has not been running smoothly and several delays could have been
avoided. If the M&E system was in place.

2. Implementation

6.     NETREP has undergone some drastic changes that involve: (a) an extension of
the project closing date so as to complete the on-going road project which is stalled due
to insecurity situation in the Blue Nile State; (b) reallocation within and among
components to: (i) avail funds to institutional development to continue with the capacity
building activities; (ii) provide additional funding to supervision services to cover the
                                           42
increased cost of supervision, during the extended period of roads contracts execution;
and (iii) allocate the balance of the Multi Donor Trust Fund for Sudan National
Secretariat (MDTF-N) allocation for the first section of the Damazin-Kurmuk road to
the second section of the Damazin- Kurmuk road contract to cover additional financing
requirements due to the insecurity, increase in quantities of existing bill items and
escalation of prices; (c) drop activities that would not be implemented under the
National Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project (NETREP); and (d) revision of
targets to reflect the changes. The MDTF-N Grant closing date was extended to June
30, 2013, to allow the completion of ongoing contracts.

3.   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

7.      There are no unresolved fiduciary, environmental, social or other safeguard
issues. The audit for the year ended June 30, 2012 has been concluded without raising
any financial concerns. The Interim Financial Report (IFR) for the quarter ended March
31, 2013 did not indicate any significant financial management issue. Financial
management, procurement arrangement, and institutional roles and responsibilities
remain unchanged. There are no changes to the PDO, except the adjustment of
outcome targets on reduction in travel time, beneficiary population, and increase in
traffic volume, due to the completion of the upgrading of part of the Damazin – Kurmuk
road and the completion of Gadma-Humshkoraib

4. Key Factors Affecting Implementation, outputs and outcomes Assessment of
   objectives and outcomes:

Component 1: Rehabilitation of Critical Rail infrastructure and services

8.     SRC was able to complete the rehabilitation of the track on Babanousa/Wau link
which extends for 446 km using its own force. It was originally estimated to cost
USD$39.98 Million with a USD$ 15.09 Million contribution from the MDTF and USD$
24.89 Million from the GONU. The actual expenditures show that the total cost comes
to USD$37.15 Million, with the MDTF contribution equals USD$ 12.27 Million
whereas the Government contributes with USD$24.88 Million. The total population
benefiting from this project comes to 175,909 from the side of the Republic of Sudan
and perhaps the beneficiaries on the side of South Sudan can be equal or more than the
one cited here.

9.     Originally this rail link has been designed to serve one united country. Currently,
the situation is different and it becomes part of a corridor between two sovereign States.
The link can easily accommodate two trains per day from each direction. During 2010
and within eight month, SRC was able to run 25 trains that handled 10,819 tons of
goods. Also between 1/09/2010 and 5/11/2011 it carried 42,492 tons and was able to run
76 trains. SRC has also managed to operate 5 blocked trains for passengers for carrying
the returnees back to South Sudan after its independence.




                                           43
10. There is a considerable reduction in the journey time between Babanousa and
Wau: before the rehabilitation, the rail trip used to take 30 days on the average whereas
currently it only takes (35 hrs) or two days at most.

Component 2: Institutional strengthening and improvement to river transport
services:

11. The studies under this component were completed and have delivered sound
reform principles and sector development strategies. Private sector participation in rail
transport study was completed and final report submitted in August, 2009.
Implementation of the study recommendation resulted in: financing the track access.
The establishment of rail infrastructure manager, public rail transport operator and
Regulator of rail transport operations is in progress.

12. Port Sudan trade facilitation: The study completed and the final report submitted
in November, 2011. Recommendations consolidated in one document and most of them
implemented. Diagnostics review study of the Inland River Navigation Department.
The study has been completed and its final report has been submitted in November,
2010. The recommendations of the study were utilized in the:

      Restructuring of the department;
      Identification of the responsibilities of the department; and
      Technical Assistance (TA).

13. Establishment of the environmental and social management unit.it has been
established and currently it is part and parcel of the planning directorate. The head of
the unit has been nominated whereas two focal points were established in SRC and
NHA.

14. TA for the planning Directorate of MTRB: has been delivered and ESAF
document was prepared and formally adopted by the Sudanese Government in October
2008.

Component 3: Road Improvement Component

15. Construction of Gadamai – Hamashkoraib Road (81.5 Km) was substantially
completed in June 2011. The outstanding installation of safety signs and road marking
by the contractor awaiting the release of counterpart funds. Upgrading of Damazine –
Kurmuk road 1st section (37 Km) was suspended in August 2011 due to the conflict in
the area. Before the suspension the overall physical progress was estimated to be around
30%.

16. Upgrading of Damazine – Kurmuk road 2nd section (38 Km) work was
suspended in the road due to the conflict in the area. Before the disruption of the work in
August 2011 the overall physical progress was about 70%. It was eventually terminated
due to force majeure.

                                           44
17. Improvement of Kadugli – Kauda Road Lot B (30.4 Km) was fully completed in
December 2010. Feasibility and detailed design study for 955 Km of national and rural
roads were completed in June 2011. In addition, development of feeder roads study was
completed and final report submitted in June 2012.

5. Assessment of the Government and the Bank Performance

Bank Performance:

18.    The bank was generally so cooperative during the implementation of NETREP
though the Bank’s procedures were new and tend to be cumbersome for most of the staff
in some of the Government entities. It was however an excellent opportunity for the
counterpart staff to enrich their experience by exposing themselves to the procedures
and systems of a major Donor such as the World Bank.

19.     Though much benefits have been reaped from interacting with the Bank under
this partnership arrangement, it is however fair to mention that this arrangement resulted
in several cases of delays that could have been avoided if both partners were
communicating on the same wave-length. The project management and staff benefited
from the training and workshops organized by the Bank covering the areas of financial
management, procurement and M&E.

20.    Some of the Sudanese staff in some implementing agencies raised their concerns
that sometimes they receive contradicting advices from the Bank. Also, some
complained that when they dealt with the issues of procurement and compensation, they
have received vague and ambiguous advices from the Bank.

Assessment of the Government Performance

21.    As has been motioned earlier, the Government has played a very minor role
during the conceptualization and preparation of the project. This state of affairs was a
key factor that influenced the implementation of the project and has been reflected in the
apparent low level of commitment that the Government shows. This inactive role and
negligence is well demonstrated in its inability of availing the counterpart fund in time.
One would always believe that the Government would give a higher priority to fulfill its
contractual commitment for counterpart payment. In the course of NETREP’s
implementation however several delays were encountered due to the lack of counterpart
funds.

22.    During the implementation of NETREP, some of the Governmental entities were
found to be lacking necessary experienced staff capable of working to international
standards. Not only that but these entities are in need of capacity building and special
housekeeping that pertains to putting the initial procurement procedures in place.




                                           45
6. Lessons Learned

23. In the course of NETREP’s implementation, several delays that could have been
avoided occurred. The following are some few cases (selected as examples) that needs
to be taken into consideration to avoid delays and ensure sustainability when embarking
on the execution of a project such as NETREP.

24.    The Government’s internal structures together with its executing agencies require
substantial capacity building and housekeeping in terms of procurement procedures in
order to cope with the international standards. For example, the RTC required three
months to revise the ferry boats documentations to comply with the World Bank
procedures and guidelines.

25. The Government entities seem to require considerable coordination with some
important units outside the transport sector like Ministry of Finance and National
Economy (MoFNE), and the project design did not allow for that in the formation of
steering committees. As an example, the MoFNE suspended items that did not comply
with its procurement procedures which was not a requirement according to NETREP’s
Grant Agreement and that has led to a three months delay.

26.    In some cases, the project management was not aware of the Government policy
in the areas of concern to NETREP like the delay that occurred in project requests for
payments in USD$, whereas Sudan falls under USA sanctions. In other cases the World
Bank procedure is an issue that needs to be addressed as it becomes cumbersome
delaying implementation by considerable time.

27.      To attain the sustainability of services, the flow of funds for maintenance and
rehabilitation should be continuous. It is however believed that the only crucial issue to
be addressed, in this respect, is the re-structuring of the road tolls system in order to
generate substantial revenue for meeting road maintenance requirements. Detailed
costing studies should be carried out to examine the elasticity of the road toll in respect
to total transport costs. Initial studies indicated that the percentage share of road toll in
transport cost doesn't exceed 2%, therefore doubling the current road toll rates will only
lead to an increase in total transport cost to 3 or 3.5%. The doubling of the current toll
rates may generate sufficient income that caters for road maintenance if effective
measures of axle limit control were enforced. The NHA is also looking towards the
establishment of road fund that will bring other sources of income such as the import
taxes on road vehicles and their accessories, petrol and diesel taxes as well as the annual
vehicles’ and driving licenses.
