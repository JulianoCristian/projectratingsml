                         Roads Improvement: The improvement of Kadugli- Kaouda road Lot B (30 km) and upgrading of the Gadamai-Hamashkorieb road (81.5 km) to asphalt level standard were
                         completed. In addition, engineering design for 995 km of national and rural roads has been completed. A feeder roads study that has delivered a feeder roads development plan and
                         design and bidding documents for selected feeder roads for three states (Blue Nile, Kassala and South Kordofan) has been completed. Short term training was provided to 67 staff
                         of the National Highways Authority (NHA)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) of improving physical access could be considered fully achieved as all- weather access was provided to public traffic along the last road
                         section of the Demazin -Kurmuk road, to be improved under the project, which was suspended due to the conflict. Further, the project has delivered the following outcomes: (i) the
                         completion of the Babanusa-Wau rail line has helped to provide access to about 261, 000 people; (ii) the completion of the two road contracts, with a total length of 112 km of roads,
                         and the improvement of the road on Damazin-Kurmuk road to a passable stage has provided all-weather access to about 26,000 people. The improvement of the roads has also
                         reduced average travel time from 11.6 hours to 2 hours. The institutional development studies are completed and have initiated policy dialogue that would help to improve the
                         performance of the transport sector. The project also helped to leverage resources from the Blue Nile and south Kordofan state administration to provide all weather access up to
                         Kurmuk and Kaouda
