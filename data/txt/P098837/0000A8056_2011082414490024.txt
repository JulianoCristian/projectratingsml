                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The rehabilitation of the Babanusa-Wau rail line, connecting northern and southern Sudan was completed and rail transport services have resumed after 25 years of disruption. Road
                         improvement works are in progress on four contracts with a total length of 208 km ofroads. The Kadugli- Kaouda road Lot B (30 km) was completed and Gadamai-Hamashkorieb
                         (81.5 km) has reached substantial completion stage in June 2011. Engineering design for 995 km of national and rural roads was completed. The studies on private sector
                         participation (PSP) in rail transport, Port Sudan trade facilitation, and Inland River Navigation Diagnostics, as well as the preparation of the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP)
                         were completed and have delivered sound sector development policies and strategies, and implementation is in progress.

                         The key activities delivering the outputs expected under the project are under implementation and some are already completed. The completion of the Babanusa-Wau rail line has
                         helped to provide access to about 215, 000 people living along the project corridor. The two completed roads (Kadugli - kaouda (Lot B) and Gadamai-Hamshkorieb have helped to
                         provide all-weather access to about 5,500 people. The road improvements carried out so far have helped to reduce average travel time from 11.6 hours to 6.6 hours. The institutional
                         development studies have initiated policy dialogue that would help to improve the performance of the transport sector.
