constructing additional transmission and\n            distribution facilities to match its generation expansion\n            program and meet the demand growth. It will also assist\n            KEPCO in implementation of end-use survey and load\n            management programs, improvement of planning techniques to\n            achieve greater economic efficiency of resource utilization\n            and with rationalization of tariffs. The project consists\n            of: (a) the transmission and distribution (T/D) component of\n            KEPCO's 1986-1989 investment program; (b) technical\n            assistance and engineering services; and (c) a program for\n            strengthening KEPCO's Research Centre."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
