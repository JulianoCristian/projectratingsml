PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SECOND POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2671-KO)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Power
Project in Korea, for which Lo&n 2671-KO in the amount of US$230 million was
approved on March 27, 1986. The loan was closed as scheduled on June 30,
1990. US$44.1 million of the loan amount was canceled in three steps, the
final cancellation being on March 28, 1990. The remaining amount of US$185.9
million was fully disbursed with the final withdrawal of US$8.0 moillon on
March 28, 1990.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations
Divisions, Department II of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower, Korea Electric Power Corporation
(KEPCO) prepared Part II.
Preparation of the PCR was started in August 1990 and is based on,
inter alia, the Staff Appraisal Report, legal documents, supervision and
progress reports, correspondence files and a comprehensive data compilation
provided by KEPCO.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SECOND POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2671-KO)
Evaluation Summary
Obiectives
1.          The main cbjective of the project was to support KEPCO's 1986-89
investment p~.3gram of constructing additional transmission and distribution
facilities to match its generation expansion program and meet the estimated
demand growth reliably and efficiently. In addition, the project was to help
implement important programs of end-use survey and load management, and assist
in improving economic efficiency of resource utilization through improved
investment planning techniqnes in the power subsector. Efforts at ratio-
nalizing KEPCO's tariff structure were to be continued in the context of
variations in demand characteristics and cost of services prevailing at the
time (Part I, para. 31.).
Implementation Experience
2.          Tbe project was expeditiously implemented and completed on
schedule without encountering significant difficulties. Procurement
arrangement required international competitive bidding (ICB) for all goods,
except concrete poles, financed by the Bank loan. This was KEPCO's first
exposure to ICB. KEPCO reports that the Bank's review and approval procedures
caused some initial delays, bu' they were overcome and did not affect overall
progress. KEPCO further reports that as a result of the use of ICB it was
able to obtain better quality material and equipment at less cost since many
Korean manufacturers improved their competitive standing, both in quality and
price. A review by Bank staff showed that under ICB domestic suppliers were
mostlv the successful bidders and that their bids were generally lower, in
some cases substantially lower, when compared to similar purchases using
KEPCO's local bidding procedure (Part I, para. 5.1).
Results
3.          The project was successfully completed on schedule and within
budget, and it achieved its objectives. Except for a minor shortfall in high
voltage circuits, the transmission and distribution targets set for the KEPCO
1986-89 investment program were significantly exceeded. The sector and insti-
tutional components were largely carried out as planned. KEPCO's financial
performance over the 1986-89 period was generally satisfactory. The reeval-
uated internal financial rate of return was calculated to be 12 percent, the
same as the SAR estimate. The SAR estimated the internal economic rate of
return to be 15 percent based on the base demand case excluding consumer



- iiiD
surplus.  The same value was obtained for the reevaluated rate of return
(Part I, paras. 6.1-6.3).
Sustainabilitv
4.          Benefits from the project should be sustainable into the
foreseeable future given the fact that (i) KEPCO's tranemisston and distri-
bution facilities have been installed in accordance wiLh strict design and
construction standards and international practices and (ii) KEPCO has the
technical and administrative skills to competently maintain and operate these
facilities.  The decline in KEPCO's system load facto  and i_ impact on
future investments was a cause for concern; however,  .ipler..erl  '.'  of a load
management program and follow-up efforts should enable .ZPCC  _ successfully
deal with this problem (Part I, para. 7.1).
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.          KEPCO's implementation of the project demonstrated its high level
of technical --xpertise and outstanding operational efficiency. A future Bank
lending operation involving KEPCO should focus on helping KEPCO achievi
sectoral and institutional goals (Part I, para. 9.1).
6.          KEPCO's implementation experience also showed that price and
quality benefits can be realized by procuring equipment and material using
competitive bidding procedures. This reinforces the validity of Bank
insistence on competitive bidding (Part I, para. 9.1).

Subsector:                    Electric Power
2.       Background
2.1       The high oil prices in the 1970s dealt a heavy blow to Korea's
energy intensive and oil import dependent eronomy. A severe recession and
large burdensome balance-of-payment deficits were the result. The Government
countered by adopting a strategy directed at diversifying energy sources and
suppliers and readjusting the industrial structure of the economy to foster
energy conservation and reduce the rate of growth of energy demand. This
strategy achieved impressive results. Realizing that further gains could be
achieved, the Government next shifted emphasis from diversification to
improving the economic and institutional efficiency of the energy sector. The
Sixth Five Year Plan implemented during 1987-91 emphasizes efficiency
improvements in the energy sector.
2.2       The rationale of a Bank lending operation in the power sector was
based on (i) the fact tL.at investment in this sector constitutes 40? of the
public investment program and consequently needs substantial external
financing; (ii) it was felt that a few well directed changes in the investment
program could significantly improve the pattern of resource alloc&tion;
(iii) consistent with its import liberalization policy, the Government had
decided to permit overseas competition with domestic industries which had been
protected from outside competition; and (iv) the Government was in the process
of reexamining planning and policy issues in the context of its Sixth
Development Plan, and the Bank's input at this stage could be of considerable
benefit.
2.3       The Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), the borrower of the
Bank loan, is a Government-owned corporation; it was the implementing agency
for all components of the project. KEPCO was well qualified for this task
having participated, since its inception in 1961, in a 20-fold increase in
electricity generation, transmission and distribution.



3.        Project Objective and Description
3.1       The main objective of the project was to support KEPCO's J986-89
investment program of constructing additional transmission and distribution
facilities to match its generation expansion program and meet the estimated
demand growth reliably and efficiently. In addition, the project was to help
implement important programs of end-use survey and load management, and assist
in improving economic efficiency of resource utilization through improved
investment planning techniques in the power subsector. Efforts at rational-
izing KEPCO's tariff structure were to be continued in the context of varia-
tions in demand characteristics and cost of services prevailing at the time.
3.2       The project comprised:
(a) the transmission and distribution component of KEPCO's 1986-1989
investment program:
(b) technical assistance and engineering services; and
(c) a program for strengthening KEPCO's research center.
4.        Project DesiAn and Organization
4.1       The Bank opted for a lending operation in Korea's power sector
because there was a need for funds and the timing was right. Thus, the
project was conceived with the aim of providing Bank funds in a sector needing
a substantial amount of external financing at the time, and also helping the
Government resolve planning and policy issues which it was then reexamining.
Furtbermore, a report on energy sector issues in Korea had just been completed
by the Bank. Project design was consistent with these aims. The project
provided foreign exchange to help finance essential imports for expanding
KEPCO's transmission and distribution facilities, and it included engineering
services and technical assistance components which proved to be beneficial for
KEPCO's operational and institutional development and efficiency.
4.2       Project preparation was thorough.  The project components and the
responsibilities for implementing them were clearly defined in the project
documents and understood by all concerned. The decision to turn over to KEPCO
these implementation responsibilities was well taken in view of its technical
expertise and long experience in implementing power projects, and it was
justified by results.
5.        Project Implementation
5.1       The project was expeditiously implemented and completed on schedule
without encountering any significant difficulties. Procurement arrangements
for the project required international competitive bidding (ICB) for all goods
financed by the Bank loan, except concrete poles which were procured through
local competitive bidding. This was KEPCO's first exposure to ICB; KEPCO
reports that the Bank's document review and approval procedures caused some



delays, but they were overcome and did not affe-t overall progress. KEPCO
further reports that as a result of the use of ICB it was able to obtain
better quality materials and equipment at less cost since many Korean
manufacturers improved their competitive standing, both in quality and price.
A review by Bank staff showed that under ICB domestic suppliers were mostly
the successful bidders and that their bid prices were generally lower, in some
cases significantly lower, when compared to similar purchases using KEPCO's
local bidding procedures.
6.        Proiect Results
6.1       The project was successfully completed within budget allocations,
and it fully achieved its objectives. With regard to the project's physical
components, actual results during the 1986-89 investment period significantly
exceeded SAR forecasts except for a marginal shortfall in high voltage cir-
cuits (see Annex I). Other project results are discussed in the following
paragraphs.
6.2       The internal economic and financial rates of return (IERR and IFRR)
on KEPCO's 1986-89 investment program were reevaluated on the same basis as
the SAR estimates. The results are tabulated below. Full details are given
in Chapter 4 of Part III and Annex II.

IFRR - 1986-89 investments, base demand case    12Z                    12Z
6.3       The technical assistance, engineering study and research center
equipment project components were carried out as planned with the following
results.
(a) A standardization study for future 500 MW coal-fired power plants
established the design basis, essential design details and technical
specif. cion for such future plants. The study laid the ground
work for savings in such areas as design, construction, spare parts
inventory and enhanced operating and maintenance efficiency.
(b)  Two KEPCO staff members received training in the field of load
research and management at the facilities of a French power company.
The French company assigned two consultants to carry out a study of
KEPCO's load regulating system and practices. The consultants
focused on load regulation based on demand, but they noted that
supply should not be overlooked because it could lead to substantial
savings. The study provided (i) a review and analysis of tariff
measures available to KEPCO for load regulation; (ii) a
recommendation to carry out a cost benefit study before establishing
a load management policy; helpful proposals were offered for the



existing situation; and (iii) a recommendation to develop a
comprehersive and accurate data bank before proceeding with any
extens've studies of KEPCO's electr4c power system; the main
requirEments are representative sampling using statistical studies
and appropriate modern instrumentation and equipment.
(c) A wide range of testing, metering, analyzing and other scientific
devices were purchased for the Electric Power Research and
Development Center. Altogether, the equivalent of US$1.4 million
was spent on essential researchi equipment for the center.
7.        Proiect Sustainabilits
7.1       Benefits from the project shou3d be sustainable into the foreseeable
future given the fact that (i) KEPCO's t.ansmission and distribution facili-
ties have been installed in accordance with strict design and construction
standards and international practices and (ii) KEPCO has the technical and
administrative skills to competently maintain ar.d operate these facilities.
The decline in KEPCO's system load factor and its impact on future investments
was a cause for concern; however, the implementation of a load management
program and follow-up efforts should enable KEPCO to successfully deal with
this problem.
8.        Performance of the Bank
8.1       The Bank performed satisfactorily in the preparation of the project,
and KEPCO's high level of technical competence left room only for technical
advise during the implementation stage. The Bank's decision to finance a loan
operation in Korea's power sector was well timed and chosen. First of all, it
provided on opportunity to follow-up on the findings and recommendations of
the comprehensive Bank-financed sector review during 1984-85, and in the
context of the Sixth Development Plan, the Bank was able to establish a worth-
while planning and policy dialogue with the Government and KEPCO. Also of
importance to the Goverrment and KEPCO at the time, the Bank loan provided
much needed external finance toward the large sector investment program.
8.2       The Bank's supervision effort from 1988 onward dropped off sharply
(Table 9B, Part III). This is understandable, however, considering that
70 percent of the transmission and distribution project components had already
been completed by end-1987, and also that the project was proceeding without
significant problems.
9.        Performance of the Borrower
9.1       KEPCO is an efficient and well-managed utility with an energetic,
qualified and motivated staff. This fact is reflected in its performance tn
executing the project which, both from a managerial and technical standpoint,
was of a high quality.



-5-
10.       Proiect Relationships
10.1      Bank staff established a good working relationship with KEPCO and
government officials associated with the project. As far as could be
observed, KEPCO remained on equally good terms with consultants and
contractors throughout project implementation.
11.       Consulting Services
11.1      KEPCO needed no consulting assistance for implementing the
transmission and distribution components of the project. All of the con-
sultants who undertook the technical assistance components performed their
assignments professionally and competently.
12.       Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1      The Staff Appraisal Report and the President's Report were
comprehensive and well prepared. They gave a thorough account of the institu-
tional and sectoral background of the project and its objectives. The legal
documents provided the necessary legal framework for project implementation
and agreements reached by the Bank with the Government and KEPCO.
12.2      Both the Bank's supervision reports and KEPCO's progress reports
gave a comprehensive presentation of the project's implementation progress.
However, the combination of KEPCO being required to submit annual progress
reports and the Bank issuing only two supervision reports left a gap in up-to-
date implementation information. This is not a serious matter when a project
is efficiently and competently executed as in this case.. Nevertheless, such
infrequent reporting should be avoided as a matter of course. It should be a
standard practice for Borrowers to submit quarterly progress reports during
the active phase of project implementation.
12.3      Data for this PCR was obtained from documents, reports and
correspondence in Bank files. A report prepared by KEPCO at the request of
the Bank provided most of the essential data in Part III of the report.

6.        KEPCO has acquired considerable experience in the improvement of
engineering and project management capabilities and the purchase of high
quality equipment at lower prices.
7.        The performance of the consultants, contractors and suppliers was
satisfactory. The project was, in every respect, a major success.
8.        All details concerning the project and KEPCO's performance during
the project implementation are contained in PART III; and we hereby confirms
the adequacy and accuracy of all information in PART III.



Performance and Effectiveness
9.        All material and equipment was supplied on time and KEPCO completed
all programs on schedule.
10.       The construction of the transmission and distribution lines and
other facilities was satisfactorily completed on schedule.
11.       No major problems werx  encountered, both consultants and contractors
performed satisfactorily, and no major claims were made.
12.       This was KEPCO's first ex-erience in the procurement of localized
items such as post-insulators, distribution wires, watthour meters, etc.
through international competitive bidding, including Korean manufacturers
under IBRD' procurement guidelines.
13.       As a result, KEPCO was able to obtain better quality materials at
lower prices, and many Korean manufacturers improved their competitive ability
in the areas of both quality and price.
14.       KEPCO has also gained considerable experience in improving
cooperation with relevant departments, i.e., the technical engineering
departments and the planning and controlling department.
15.       Therefore, we were able to send progress reports every year and
complete the projection in a more efficient and economical manner.
16.       The IBRD's International Competitive Bidding procedures and required
subsequent approvals for contract awards, etc., caused some delays, compared
to the procurement, financed by the Korea Foreign Exchange Fund.
17.       Despite these delays, KEPCO initially understood and adhered to be
entire procedure; and with IBRD's help, KEPCO was able to rapidly proceed
through the procurement process.
18.       IBRD has made significant contributions through the introduction of
an efficient procurement method which contributed to KEPCO's timely
procurement on schedule.

6.   Proiect Results
A. Overall Proiect Results
6.1       The technical assistance was carried out as planned.  Annex 1 shows
a comparison of the actual project results with the original targets for the
transmission and distribution components of the project.
B. Economic Rate of Return
6.2       The internal economic rate of return (IERR) was reevaluated on the
basis of the incremental costs and benefit streams associated with the 1986-89
investment program. An IERR of 15 percent was calculated compared to the 15
percent estimated at project appraisal. The details and basis for the
reevaluation are given in Annex II, page 1 and Table 1.
6.3       The SAR considers the above IERR as being based only on the "direct"
benefit of energy consumption and not including the effect of the indirect
benefits represented by the consumer surplus. The consumer surplus was
estimat4d by means of the demand functions developed by the research center
for various consumer groups. Including the 26-28 percent of direct benefits
weighted coverage determined at project appraisal the reevaluated, like the
SAR value, is 19 percent.
C. Financial Results
6.4       The internal financial rate of return (IFRR) for the 1986-89
investment program was calculated by including taxes and duties with input
costs and excluding sales taxes from revenues. The reevaluated IFRR is
calculated to be 12 percent compared to the 12 percent SAR estimate.
6.5       KEPCO's key financial performance indicators for the 1986-89 period
are compared with the SAR forecast in the following table. The financial
statements over the same period are compared with the SAR in Annex III, Tables

Reevaluation of the Internal Economic Rate of Return
Main Assumptions and Basis
General
Cost and benefit figures contained in Table 1 of this Annex
correspond with the actual during the period 1986-89 and the "base case" after
1990 where calculation of electricity benefits and O&M costs is predicted on
the "base scenario" of the load forecasts and consume- surplus is not included
in the stream of benefits.
All costs and benefits are expressed in 1990 constant dollars.
Investment Costs
Generation investment costs are for the projects commissioned
during the period 1986-89 investment.
Operations and Maintenance Costs
Operation and maintenance costs are based on the actual cost
figures in 1986-89. Fuel costs for 1986-89 are actual and for 1990 onwards
were calculated by planned net generation and estimated fuel costs per KWh
which takes account of the purchase price of the nuclear fuel as well as the
costs involved in the conv_;sion, enrichment and fabrication.  Disposal costs
of the fuel are included in generation operation costs.
Energy Sales and Revenues
The incremental energy sales and revenues for 1986-89 are based on
the actual figures. Incremental energy generation for 1990 onwards was
produced by simulating operations planning model. Incremental energy sales
were calculated by adjusting the incremental energy generation for T&D losses
and auxiliary energy consumption.  Average price of electricity for 1990
onwards was assumed to remain, in real time, at its 1990 level.

Reevaluat;on of the Internal Economic Rate of Return
Main Assumptions and Basis
General
Costs and benefit figures contained in Table 2 of this Annex
correspond with the actual during the period 1986-89 and the "base case" after
1990 where calculation of electricity benefits and O&M costs is predicted on
the "base scenario" of the load forecast.
All cost and benefits are expressed by including taxes and duties
with input costs and excluding sales taxes from revenues in 1990 constant
dollars.
Operations and Maintenance Costs
Operation and maintenance costs are based on the actual cost
figures in 1986-89. Fuel costs for 1986-89 are actual and for 1990 onwards
were calculated by planned net generation and estimation fuel costs per KWh
which takes account of the purchase price of the nuclear fuel as well as the
costs involved in the conversion, enrichment and fabrication. Disposal costs
of the fuel are included in generation operation costs.
Energy Sales and Revenues
The incremental energy sales and revenues for 1986-89 are based on
the actual figures. Incremental energy generation for 1990 onwards was
produced by simulating operations planning model. Incremental energy sales
were calculated by adjusting the incremental energy generation for T&D losses
and auxiliary energy consumption. Average price of electricity for 1990
onwards was assumed to remain, in real time, at its 1990 level.
