     Project for Malawi were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project: The need to ensure consistence of\n            the PAD and DCA is important. A Clear Monitoring and\n            Evaluation Framework including capacity building should be\n            part of the project design. There should be mechanisms to\n            enforce the functioning of Oversight Committees. Contracting\n            work to private firms requires Government's capacity to\n            effectively supervise the firms. A framework for quality\n            assurance in relation to standards and specifications need\n            to be clear and available at school and other levels to\n            guide implementation and monitoring such as in relation to\n            civil works and different supplies. Adequate guidelines for\n            school mapping and site selection needs to be in place in\n            all education projects. Involvement of stakeholders within\n            communities where the schools have been constructed, was\n            insufficient. Well established mechanisms for coordination\n            should be in place in the government ministries to ensure\n            adequate support is provided in project implementation.\n            Issues of teacher supply, development and deployment need to\n            be addressed more comprehensively to ensure adequate supply\n            and effective deployment of qualified teachers for primary\n            and secondary education."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
