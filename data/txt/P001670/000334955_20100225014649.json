FOR AFRICA,TF036639-MALAWI - SECONDARY EDUCATION PROJECT,TF040492-MALAWI:  SECONDARY EDUCATION\n            PROJECT - ARCHITECT/PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTUR", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Secondary Education\n            Project for Malawi were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was significant;\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. This assessment provides a\n            number of lessons for the education sector: Civil works have\n            procurement issues that may exceed the supervisory capacity\n            of the implementing units in low-income countries.\n            Private-sector contractors may be able to execute civil\n            works, but a lack of supervision may result in fraud,\n            vandalism, and poor-quality buildings. The complexities of\n            civil-works procurement may become the focus of education\n            projects at the expense of learning issues. Governments\n            should make efforts to employ staff with continuity and\n            expertise that would ensure efficient execution of civil\n            works and allow managers time to focus on learning-related\n            improvements. Textbooks or systematically reproduced\n            materials are a prerequisite for knowledge management at all\n            levels of education. Their sustained availability should be\n            a policy priority, particularly in countries where they are\n            expensive. Without textbooks and training of teachers in\n            their use, class time is spent in transcription; knowledge\n            becomes constricted and systemic efficiency is low. Because\n            of their crucial role, decisions on textbook purchases might\n            best not be left to the discretion and financial strength of\n            individual schools. A national strategy of sustainable and\n            affordable secondary education textbooks is needed in\n            low-income countries. Often projects provide inputs to\n            educational institutions and expect improved learning\n            outcomes as a result of these. To help student's\n            process information and retain it, however, instructionally\n            oriented interventions are needed. Project designs lacking\n            specific elements for improving the learning conditions of\n            schools may not obtain the needed learning and subsequent\n            educational outcomes. Large-scale curricular reforms will\n            only have a positive effect if curricula are realistically\n            implementable in classrooms. The Bank should be more\n            proactive in advising governments on realistic curricular\n            structures. Since curricular revisions often necessitate new\n            textbooks, it is important to ensure that there is\n            sufficient rationale for the revisions."}, "docdt": "2010-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
