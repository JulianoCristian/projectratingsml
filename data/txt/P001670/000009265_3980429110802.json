to increase the number of students from\n            disadvantaged groups who graduate from public and private\n            secondary schools with higher performance.  There are five\n            components in this project.  First, expanding access to\n            secondary education comprises all civil works activities\n            related to the construction of day secondary schools.  This\n            component will finance all school facilities, furniture and\n            equipment, library furnishings, teachers' housing,\n            playing fields, roads, etc.  Second, quality of secondary\n            education will provide instructional materials in the\n            project-financed schools.  For all other public conventional\n            schools, this component will provide textbooks, school\n            supplies, and coonsumables for sciences.  Third, efficiency\n            and effectiveness of secondary education will provide\n            training for school-based managers.  The credit will also\n            finance establishment of a small training unit, procurement,\n            and other monitoring activities. Fourth, the HIV/AIDS\n            materials component will finance the rapid adaptation of\n            high-quality, behavior-change instructional materials from\n            Zimbabwe, and the reprinting of some of materials.  Fifth,\n            support to administrative unit/monitoring &\n            evaluation/studies will cover the costs of procurement and a\n            computerized financial management system."}, "docdt": "1998-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
