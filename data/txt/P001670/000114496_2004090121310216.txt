Dear Sir:
MALAWI:
Credit No. 3051-MAI (Secondary Education Project)
Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement

We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement) entered into 
between the Republic of Malawi (the Borrower) and the International Development 
Association (the Association), dated April 17, 1998, in respect of the above-captioned 
Project.  We also refer to communications related to the effectiveness of the Credit, 
particularly related to the acquisition of sites for school construction and the 
selection of a Financial Management Adviser. 
2.
This is to inform you of our proposal to waive the condition of effectiveness 
related to the school sites and to amend Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement to 
read as follows:
"3.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no withdrawals 
shall be made in respect of payments made for: (a) expenditures prior to the 
date of this Agreement; and (b) expenditures under category (1) until the 
Borrower has furnished to the Association evidence, satisfactory to the 
Association, that the land required for the construction of schools under Part 
A of 
the Project and the rights in respect of such land are available for the  purposes of 
the Project."
3.
All other terms and conditions of the Agreement, except as amended herein, shall 
remain in full force and effect.  Terms defined in the Agreement and used in this 
letter shall have the same meaning given therein.
4.
If you agree, kindly countersign the enclosed copy of the letter and return it 
to us.  This amendment shall take effect from the date of countersignature.
