To achieve these objectives,\n            the project will comprise: (a) a credit component to finance\n            SSE fixed assets, permanent working capital and subproject\n            related technical and managerial expenditures; and (b) a\n            technical assistance program."}, "docdt": "1990-01-09T00:00:00Z"}
