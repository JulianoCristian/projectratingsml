finance afforestation, research and planting material\n            development activities and institutional strengthening in 15\n            provinces.  The project has 6 objectives, to : 1) expand\n            forest resources and reduce the gap between timber\n            production and consumption; 2) improve quality of forest\n            plantations through use of superior planting stock; 3)\n            introduce financial and economic analysis for forestry\n            investment; 4) strengthen research and extension programs\n            that support plantation forestry; 5) initiate an accelerated\n            tree breeding program that increases productivity of\n            planting stock within 2 to 3 years; and 6) create the\n            organizational and managerial infrastrucutre to plan,\n            appraise, finance, implement, and evaluate plantation\n            programs.  The project has the following components : a)\n            plantation establishment of 675,500 ha of coniferous and\n            309,500 ha of broadeaved plantations in 15 provinces; b)\n            research - assistance for setting up institutional\n            arrangements, research programs etc; c) improvement of\n            planting material - improving seed production areas; d)\n            organization and management - introduction of a monitoring\n            information system to focus on specific needs of the high\n            yielding plantation program; e) environmental management -\n            guidelines covering maintenance of biological diversity and\n            species mix, pest control, soil and water conservation and\n            fire prevention; and f) forestry sector planning."}, "docdt": "1990-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
