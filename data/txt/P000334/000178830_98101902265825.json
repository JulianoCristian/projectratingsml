{"cdata!": "The proposed project would consist of\n            three years of agronomic trials on the Plaine des M'Bo,\n            to establish the fertilizer requirements of rice and\n            soybeans, the adaptation of soybean to the cropping system,\n            and the prospects for double cropping of rice. In addition,\n            a mechanization/settlement scheme would be initiated with\n            settlers from the overpopulated nearby highlands, which\n            would test the feasibility of establishing self-managing\n            groups of 50 farm families on 100 ha to form a threshing\n            unit. At the same time, a parallel settlement of 50 farm\n            families using new types of equipment to be tested under the\n            project, will permit comparisons between several\n            mechanization/settlement schemes. The project will also\n            finance studies of the local market for soya, the\n            socio-economic characteristics of recent and potential\n            settlers of the plain and neighboring highlands, and health\n            control measures."}, "docdt": "1976-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
