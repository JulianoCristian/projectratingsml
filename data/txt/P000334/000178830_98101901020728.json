At the time of appraisal (1976), agriculture\n            provided a livelihood for 85 per cent of Cameroon's\n            population, accounted for 35-40 per cent of Gross Domestic\n            Product (GDP) and for over 75 percent of the value of\n            exports. The traditional subsector, producing food crops for\n            subsistence with varying surpluses for the local market, as\n            well as cocoa, coffee, cotton, and groundnuts for export,\n            accounted for 85 percent of agricultural output;  the\n            balance being produced by the industrial plantations, the\n            largest being state-owned, producing mainly palm oil and\n            rubber. In line with bank group strategy to support\n            government in its efforts to increase and diversify\n            agricultural production and to focus on rural development to\n            improve income distribution and to achieve a better balance\n            in regional development, proposals for development and\n            settlement of the largely empty Plaine des M'Bo, one of\n            the few plains around the over-populated western highlands,\n            merited priority consideration."}, "docdt": "1983-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
