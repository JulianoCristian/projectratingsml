The\n            Additional Financing will support priority activities that\n            have advanced beyond what was initially envisioned and are\n            pivotal to the Government's economic reform agenda.\n            Support for the additional and scaled-up activities will\n            enhance the project's impact and development effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2007-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
