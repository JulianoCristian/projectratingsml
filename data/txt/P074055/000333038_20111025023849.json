Competitiveness Project for Cape Verde were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the need for the World Bank to provide lead advice\n            on the design and implementation of a clear monitoring and\n            evaluation framework, including ensuring clear lines of\n            responsibilities and more robust and challenging performance\n            indicators. While the project supported many\n            sub-implementing agencies and hence activities, it also\n            showed ways to satisfactorily implement a complex project\n            commitment and dedication from key implementation\n            'champions' and government regular oversight are\n            key, in addition to the technical abilities and due\n            diligence of the World Bank Group team. Matching grant\n            schemes implemented and facilitated by private sector\n            associations appear to contribute significantly to\n            successful implementation and coupled with robust Monitoring\n            and Evaluation (M&E) framework, impact can be measured\n            within the project implementation period."}, "docdt": "2011-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
