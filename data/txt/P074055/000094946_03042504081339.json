  objective is to broaden the base for private participation\n            in Cape Verde's economic growth, enhance private sector\n            competitiveness, and further develop its financial sector.\n            To this end, through the project components the financial\n            sector will be strengthened, and restructured, namely\n            through the financial sector reform, which includes reform\n            of the pension system. Private sector competitiveness will\n            be enhanced by supporting reforms within the legal system,\n            as well as tax reforms, and alleviating the administrative\n            barriers. The focus will be on capacity building of selected\n            Government ministries, and agencies that interact with\n            private firms, namely to improve institutional capabilities,\n            and business delivery. Project management support will\n            oversee the financial management, procurement, reporting,\n            monitoring, and other project implementation issues."}, "docdt": "2003-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
