Recipient                  Mongolia
Implementing Agency        Ministry of Finance
Financing Data             IDA Credit Amount: US$29.7 million equivalent
                           Terms: Standard IDA terms; 40-year maturity, including a 10-year grace
                           period
Operation Type             Single-tranche operation to be disbursed upon loan effectiveness
Main Policy Areas          Following on from the 2009 DPC, this Development Policy Credit 2
                           (DPC2) is designed to improve structural policy weaknesses exposed by
                           the recent downturn that was triggered by the collapse of international
                           copper prices, and to support the current economic recovery. The DPC2
                           supports reforms in the policy areas most affected: (i) fiscal policy and
                           management, given the budget's strong dependence on mining revenues;
                           (ii) social protection, given the impact of the economic downturn on the
                           poor and the fiscal need for reform; (iii) the financial sector, which was
                           overheating when the global crisis hit, and which experienced a solvency
                           crisis; and (iv) the mining sector, given the sector's importance in driving
                           the recovery.
Key Outcome Indicators     Improve capital budget planning and execution, and protect the
                           maintenance of basic infrastructure:
                             Public investment projects implemented during 2010 and approved
                                 in the 2010-12 Medium Term Budget Framework meet the criteria of
                                 having the necessary feasibility studies and of meeting an identified
                                 need.
                             The 2010 Budget outturn on repairs and maintenance is at least at the
                                 budgeted level of 28.2 billion Tugrik.
                           Protect the poor during the downturn by retargeting social policies to the
                           poor:
                             The process of compiling a beneficiary database for a new poverty-
                                 targeted benefit program using PMT methodology, has begun.
                             The government has issued a resolution outlining the main design
                                 aspects of a new poverty-targeted benefit.
                           Further stabilize the financial sector:
                             Public confidence in the banking system is maintained as seen
                                 through the absence of widespread bank runs.
                             Good practice banking restructuring has paved the way for
                                 development of a sound and efficient banking system.
                           Further improve the policy framework for mining:
                             New Cadastre Regulations adopted and implemented.
                             Independent validation audit of Mongolia's national EITI program
                                 completed, and the International EITI Board has found it to be
                                 substantially compliant.
                             Publication of Environmental Impact Assessments on the internet
                                 has improved public monitoring of the environmental plans of
                                 mining projects.
Program Development           This Development Policy Credit 2 (DPC2) supports the continued efforts
Objectives and Contribution   of the government to use the crisis as an opportunity to improve macro
to the ISN                    and fiscal sustainability in a mineral-based economy, protect the poor and
                              vulnerable, restore confidence in the financial sector, and encourage
                              transparent and prudent mining investments. This operation forms the
                              second of two single-tranche DPCs (FY10 and FY11) which form the
                              centerpiece of the 2009 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) of the World Bank
                              Group's program of engagement in Mongolia.
Risks and risk mitigation     Significant risks include:
                                Near-term fiscal pressures which could be exacerbated by any
                                   adverse mineral price shocks. These risks would be mitigated by
                                   recently adopted prudent fiscal rules and macro management,
                                   anchored in a continued partnership with the IFIs.
                                Additional bank failures and delays or political interference in their
                                   resolution and the fiscal costs of further bank failures. This risk
                                   would be mitigated by the implementation of the comprehensive
                                   bank restructuring strategy that incorporates good international
                                   practices for transparent, long-term, and least-cost solutions.
                                As the copper price revives, the perceived threat of imminent crisis
                                   recedes, and as the 2012 elections draw nearer, legitimate pressure
                                   for a greater distribution of the benefits of Mongolia's mineral
                                   wealth to rural areas and to the urban poor has risen and could again
                                   degenerate into profligate populism, as it had during the previous
                                   mining boom. Mitigating this risk is the intensified IFI-supported
                                   outreach to policymakers, Parliament, academia, and civil society,
                                   reinforcing the commitment to prudent fiscal management.
                              Moderate risks include:
                                A return to policy uncertainty in the mining sector, and the failure to
                                   address the significant infrastructure needs associated with future
                                   large-scale mining projects. This risk can be mitigated through
                                   sustained technical assistance and policy support by development
                                   partners.

                     PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT 2
                                         TO MONGOLIA

I.     INTRODUCTION
1.       The global downturn hit Mongolia hard. This downturn was most immediately felt
through the collapse of mineral prices, in particular that of copper. Given Mongolia's high
reliance on copper revenues in the budget (with mineral revenues accounting for more than one-
third of the total budget revenues), the fiscal shock was very large, causing the overall
government balance to shift from a 2.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) surplus in
2007 to a 5.4 percent deficit in 2009. Similarly, the external balance swung from a surplus into a
deficit, as export proceeds fell by one quarter (about US$640 million) in 2009. And inflation,
which had peaked at 34 percent in August of 2008, fueled by large increases in domestic
spending, loose monetary policies and a de facto fixed exchange rate, turned negative for a brief
period in the latter half of 2009 as the economy contracted sharply. Real GDP contracted by
1.6 percent in 2009, following growth of 8.9 percent in 2008.

2.      The sudden economic downturn exposed a series of policy weaknesses. First, the
overreliance of the budget on mineral revenues, causing the fiscal situation to become
precarious. Second, social grants had proliferated during the boom, but were untargeted, making
them fiscally unaffordable during the bust. Third, the downturn exposed weaknesses in an
overheated banking sector, eventually leading to two systemically important banks failing, and a
loss of public confidence, as demonstrated by declining local currency deposits in late 2008 and
early 2009. However, a combination of strong policy action during 2009, supported by balance
of payments and budget support from key development partners, together with a rebound in the
copper price and the successful negotiation of a long awaited major mining project, successfully
stabilized the economic situation. More recently, the economy has strongly rebounded driven by
investment in the mining sector and a recovery in copper prices.

3.      Improving the policy environment is now the overriding priority for the government.
Multilateral and bilateral donor activities in the form of budget financing, technical assistance
and analytical work provide an important support for the government's policy agenda.
Considerable fiscal adjustment remains necessary over the next couple of years. Donor budget
financing can play a crucial role in facilitating the process of fiscal adjustment, helping to protect
key expenditures such as social protection and investment programs or to limit the recourse to
alternative, potentially destabilizing, financing options.

4.      While the economy has bottomed out, the window remains open to continue the policy
reforms started last year. Continued reform progress is critically needed in a number of key areas
in which the World Bank has a comparative advantage in providing support to the authorities and
on which there is on-going intensive dialogue with senior policy makers, excellent collaboration
with government and other development partners (in particular the Fund, with which the Bank
has several areas of joint work), and supporting existing, or planned, technical assistance
projects. There is urgency around effecting the necessary policy changes. The government feels
strongly that the adjustments will need to take place within the next three years, before a major
upsurge in mining exports and mining revenues occurs in 2013.
5.      The World Bank's proposed second Development Policy Credit (DPC2) is a single-
tranche operation of US$29.7 million, following on from the US$40 million DPC disbursed in
2009. As with the first operation, the proposed instrument is a single-tranche operation, because
of the existing uncertainties and risks, and the absence of a coherent medium-term policy
framework for which there is political commitment.1 The DPC2 will benefit from a multi-sector
technical assistance project that was approved by the World Bank Board in late June, which is
specifically designed to support the policy reform areas. This TA project will fill the gaps not
being filled by the existing TA projects and which were restructured to support the first DPC.

6.      The policy actions in this DPC2 are consistent with those in the 2009 DPC and based on
the same rationale. The DPC2 supports policy actions targeted towards the key crisis areas--
fiscal policy and management, social protection, and the financial sector--and the sector that is
leading the recovery--the mining sector. The DPC2 supports improvements to the budget
process, including the public investment program. This will help Mongolia increase the
efficiency with which future increases in mineral revenues are invested and is complementary to
other fiscal measures to better manage the boom-and-bust cycle of mineral prices. Putting in
place a targeted poverty benefit, another policy action supported by this DPC2, ensures that the
poor will be protected from future mining boom-and-busts in a fiscally affordable manner.
Similarly, addressing the current problems of the financial sector in a decisive and transparent
manner will prepare the sector for the upturn in economic activity, investment and capital
inflows in the years ahead. Finally, continued reforms in the mining sector and increasing its
transparency will help enhance incentives for new exploration and environmentally and socially
sustainable development in a sector that is a key driver of economic growth in the medium to
long term.

7.       While the medium-term growth outlook is favorable, there remain significant risks to the
economic and policy outlook, in particular relating to banking system solvency and to near-term
fiscal pressures in the next few years before the sharp increase in mineral revenues associated
with a major new mining project--Oyu Tolgoi (OT). In addition, social welfare reform is not a
stroke of the pen policy reform and requires lengthy consensus-building and development of
institutional and technical capacity. Furthermore, legitimate political pressures to distribute the
mineral revenues towards the rural and urban poor are rising and could degenerate into profligate
populism and undermine the current adjustment efforts. However, the actions so far taken by the
current coalition government and approved by both parties in Parliament have demonstrated a bi-
partisan resolve to undertake the appropriate fiscal reforms and to improve the economic policy
framework, notably the passage in June 2010 of the Fiscal Stability Law. This DPC2 helps to
support this resolve. There are significant benefits to staying engaged on the policy reform
agenda and supporting the reform-minded elements in government and Parliament.

II.        COUNTRY CONTEXT
8.      Mongolia has made tremendous political and economic progress since the transition that
started in the 1990s. Five parliamentary elections were held in the period since, and all were
deemed free and fair by international observers. Democratic laws and institutions were put in
place, an active media developed, and a small, but vocal civil society increasingly engages on the

political front. Similarly, in the past two decades, Mongolia has seen considerable success in
moving from a centrally-planned to a market-based economy.

9.      While Mongolia's political environment is dynamic and open, this has also brought its
own challenges to the process of governing, with three governments holding office in the last
few years. A new bi-partisan coalition government was formed in the fall of 2008. The coalition
has survived presidential elections held in May 2009, with a junior member of the governing
coalition defeating the incumbent, and the resignation of the Prime Minister (for health reasons)
in October, 2009. Most political observers agree that the basis for the coalition derives from the
need to have bi-partisan support for some of the major economic decisions which need to be
taken to develop Mongolia's enormous mining wealth. However, political divisions could
emerge again in the run-up to the next round of parliamentary elections, which are due in 2012.

10.     The policy risks associated with a mineral-dependent economy were amply underscored
by deficiencies in Mongolia's management of the recent boom which made it more difficult to
adjust to the impact of the global downturn. As in most mineral-rich economies, managing the
resource revenues consistently and sustainably puts a high premium on governance reforms,
including increased transparency, which is one of the themes of the proposed DPC2.

III.   ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
11.     Mongolia was one of the East Asian economies hardest hit by the global downturn. The
principal transmission channel was the collapse in mineral prices from the middle of 2008,
particularly copper, which is Mongolia's main export. By December 2008, copper prices were
70 percent below their peak in August 2008, and prices of other key exports--coal, zinc,
cashmere, and crude oil--also fell significantly. This external shock was compounded by a steep
drop in external demand in Mongolia's main trading partners, notably China, which absorbs
roughly two-thirds of its exports.

12.     All the major copper producers in the world were affected by the collapse in copper
prices, but, because of its particularly weak policy framework, Mongolia's experience was
perhaps the most severe (see Box 1). The contrast with Chile is particularly striking: Chile's
banking sector was unaffected due to prudent lending policies during the boom, its exchange rate
was flexible (so it absorbed part of the shock), and Chile was able to self-finance a large stimulus
package to support its economy by drawing upon fiscal savings made during the boom years
under its structural balance rule.

(Figure 4). CPI inflation was the highest in Mongolia since 2007, evidence of the largest domestic boom,
compared to the other four countries (Figure 5).
Copper export dependence, or a high export concentration, alone does not explain the differences in
performance during the crisis. For example, Zambia and Chile are the most dependent on copper exports,
but their drop in GDP is less than that of Mongolia and Peru. Zambia opened a major new copper mine in
late-2008 (the only country to do so). The increase in copper output mitigated the downturn. Zambia also
removed the windfall tax on mining to continue to attract new mining investments and prevent existing
operations from being scaled down prematurely. It also benefited from debt relief as a result of good
economic performance. Peru had accumulated sizeable fiscal surpluses for the previous three years, and
used the mineral windfall largely by increasing savings and reducing public debt. Chile, finally, finds itself
in a good position to weather the storm: it benefited from a fiscal rule which limited expenditure during
boom times, inflation targeting, a flexible exchange rate, a copper stabilization fund to help ensure that the
fluctuations in copper prices do not spillover into the rest of the economy, and adequate access to foreign
financing.

  In response to the crisis, Zambia received a substantial increase in financing of its ongoing IMF poverty
reduction program, although its access to IMF financing is still only around 50 percent of its quota, whereas
Mongolia received 300 percent under its SBA. Peru had a 25-month IMF Stand-By Arrangement from
January 2007, but this was considered precautionary with low access to IMF resources.

13.     Why was Mongolia hit so hard? Entering the crisis, the country's fiscal position was
highly reliant on mineral revenues. During the boom years (2005-2007) the government had
shifted the fiscal burden away from the non-mining sector, leaving the budget increasingly
dependent on revenues from mining. At its peak in 2007, mining-related revenue contributed
nearly 40 percent to total revenue or 15 percent of GDP. In addition, with the central bank
pursuing a de facto peg of the local currency to the dollar, there was a direct transmission of the
falling international copper price to tax revenues. And while the government did save part of its
mining windfall during the boom years, it had also funded large increases in untargeted social
expenditures, wages and salaries, and poorly-screened investment projects.

14.      When the boom turned into bust, the modest fiscal surplus quickly turned into a large
deficit, which the fiscal savings of the previous years' proved insufficient to fund. At the same
time, the external current account also swung into a large deficit. Meanwhile, the financial
sector, which had been overheating during the boom period, ran into serious problems. After a
crisis of depositor confidence in late 2008 triggered by the collapse of the fourth largest bank, the
health of bank balance sheets and credit quality deteriorated markedly. In turn, this contributed to
a tightening of credit conditions, which presented a drag on the economic recovery.

15.     Overall the economy contracted by 1.6 percent as a whole during 2009, following growth
of 8.9 percent in 2008, with the decline in economic activity contributing to the fall in domestic
inflation. Sectors which were primary drivers of the strong growth of preceding years, such as
transport, storage and communication, agriculture and wholesale and retail trade, were badly
affected by the crisis, with their growth rates declining sharply or turning negative over 2008 and
2009.

A. Recent Economic Developments
16.     Since the first DPC operation was approved by the Board in June 2009 there has been a
substantial stabilization of the macroeconomic situation (see Table 1 and Figure 6). Three factors
have contributed to this improvement. First, the government has taken comprehensive and strong
policy action on fiscal, monetary, exchange rate and financial policies 2 , supported by
international and bilateral budget and balance of payments support, and technical assistance.

17.     Second, the government was also able to conclude the major Oyu Tolgoi (OT) mining
investment agreement. As a result of the signing of this agreement, positive sentiment has
returned to the mining sector, and the overall economic outlook has improved significantly. GDP
growth for 2010 is projected to rebound to over 8 percent of GDP, up from a slight decline in
2009 on the back of a huge increase in OT-related infrastructure spending. Over the medium to
long term the economy is expected to grow by around 5 percent. But its dependence on the
mineral sector is also set to grow substantially, posing the risk of "Dutch Disease". The mineral
sector's share of GDP is expected to grow from slightly less than 20 percent currently to more
than 50 percent by around 2020.

18.    Third, recent external sector developments have been supportive due to the sustained
recovery in mineral prices and improvement in external demand. For instance, by the start of
2010, copper prices were only about a fifth below their peak in August 2008, and have remained
high since then. Meanwhile, economic growth in China, Mongolia's main export partner,
continues to be strong, fueled by a massive fiscal and monetary stimulus package.

19.     Together, these factors have laid the grounds for a recovery, as evident in the Q4 2009
and Q1 2010 data. After three successive quarters of contraction, the economy is enjoying a brisk
recovery. GDP growth came in at 3.4 percent year-on-year (yoy) in Q2 2010, following outturns
of 7.6 percent in Q1 2010 and 3.9 percent in Q4 2009. Initially the recovery was led by transport
and communication and the mining sector, but manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade
sectors have also rebounded strongly since the first quarter of this year. Industrial production
also rebounded at the end of 2009 and has since remained strong, growing by 25 percent yoy (on
a 3-month moving average basis) in August.

20.     Meanwhile the bottoming out of the downturn and the subsequent rebound was reflected
in inflation turning positive after briefly dipping into negative territory between August and
November 2009. Inflation has trended upwards since the start of the year and has averaged
11 percent yoy since May, up from 1.2 percent in December. Supply side factors, notably rising
meat prices due to the "dzud" (this refers to extremely severe winter conditions experienced this
winter which decimated the livestock) and an increase in regulated electricity prices, have
contributed to rising prices. But demand-pull factors have become important too, reflecting the
closing of the output gap in the economy due to the rapid recovery and cash transfers of MNT
70,000 per Mongolian citizen in February. As a result, the central bank raised its benchmark
policy rate by 100 basis points to 11 percent in May.

21.     The official unemployment rate initially declined to 3.2 percent at the start of the year,
down from 3.7 percent in July 2009. However, since then it has gradually trended upwards,
reaching 3.5 percent in August. However, these numbers likely grossly underestimate actual
unemployment levels. According to Labor Force Survey data which takes into account also those
who are not formally registered with the government, the unemployment rate stands at around
12 percent currently. The latest World Bank-commissioned quarterly survey of informal labor
markets in Ulaanbaatar from June 2010 finds that, on average, real wages have increased
significantly since April of last year, but that there has also been an influx of workers from rural
areas, reflecting in part migration from rural workers escaping harsh winter conditions due to the
("dzud") at the end of 2009 and early 2010. The dzud marked a record disaster, affecting over
80 percent of Mongolia's territory. In rural areas, livestock losses due to the dzud­­estimated at
around 9.7 million or 20 percent of the total herd­­have put further pressure on the livelihoods
of the rural poor and hurt profitability in the agricultural sector, threatening to reverse some of
the gains in poverty reduction that were seen over the past few years of high economic growth.

Fiscal Sector

22.     Fiscal retrenchment, supported by a recovery in mining-related revenues, resulted in a
deficit of 5.4 percent in 2009 (Table 2). This compares favorably with a full-year budget target of
around 5.8 percent and is only slightly worse than the outturn in 2008. Indeed, it had initially
been forecast in early 2009 that the 2009 budget deficit was heading for 12 percent of GDP if
measures to control spending and to compensate for the revenue loss as copper prices fell were
not taken.

23.     The revenue intake in 2009 was 7.5 percent lower than in 2008 in nominal terms, mainly
reflecting lower mining revenues, although receipts recovered substantially in the final quarter of
2009 helped by buoyant copper prices. Expenditure restraint meanwhile helped control total
spending which was 5.7 percent lower than in 2008, with capital expenditure and current
spending on goods and services cut by a fifth relative to levels in 2008. However, offsetting this
was increased spending on wages and salaries and current transfers and unexpected expenditures
related to flood damage, swine flu, and dzud relief efforts. There were also substantial fiscal
costs associated with the blanket guarantee law and the failures in the banking sector.

24.    More recently, the improvement in public finances, economic adversity due to the severe
downturn last year and the winter `dzud,' and the freeze on public wages and pensions over the
past two years have led to growing pressures for increased spending. In July, Parliament
approved amendments to the original 2010 budget in July which envisage a 4.5 percent of GDP
                                               7
increase in spending on top of the original 2010 budget, which are driven mainly by increased
spending on cash handouts­­one round of cash transfers took place in February with MNT
70,000 distributed per person and is to be followed by another MNT 50,000 per person to be
distributed in the remaining five months of the year starting August­­and a 30 percent increase
in government sector wages and pensions planned for October. The expansion in spending is
underpinned by a projected increase in revenues of 3.1 percent of GDP.

25.     The latest August data show that, with revenues continuing to be lifted by high mineral
prices, the 12-month rolling fiscal deficit fell to just 0.4 percent of GDP, after peaking at 10.6
percent in August 2009. According to recent IMF forecasts (refer back to Table 1), the overall
fiscal deficit for 2010 should amount to 2.2 percent of GDP by the end of the year, roughly half
the level in 2009, supported by strong mineral prices and continued economic recovery. In
addition, adherence to the recently passed (in June) Fiscal Stability Law, which makes the budget
use long-term prices for the mining revenue projections, and sets out limits on the resulting
structural budget deficit, the public debt and expenditure growth should also help to maintain
fiscal discipline in the near term.

External sector

26.      On the external front, key central bank actions in the first half of the year ­ it abandoned
its de facto peg, introduced a transparent bi-weekly foreign exchange auctioning mechanism, and
in order to restore confidence in the local currency, raised interest rates in March 2009 to
14 percent from 9.75 percent ­ helped to stabilize the exchange rate. This, combined with a
narrowing of the trade deficit, has helped the central bank to rebuild reserves, which reached
record levels of US$1,174 million in December 2009 and have continued to climb since then (in
August, reserves hit another peak of US$1,413 million). Reserves have also been boosted by the
disbursement of the IMF SBA tranches, the OT pre-payment loan, project funding from the

inflation contributed to a roughly 18 percent fall in the real effective exchange rate over 2009,

Since the start of the year, the nominal exchange rate has appreciated by around 8 percent.

at over 16 percent in Q2 2009. It was primarily financed by net capital inflows in the financial
account. Net borrowing from abroad by both government and the private sector jumped in 2009,
due to the donor disbursement and loans to the commercial banks. Direct investment by foreign
companies (FDI), mainly in the mining sector and related to the development of the OT copper
project, has also increased substantially over the past year and, at 14 percent of GDP in Q1 2010
on a 4 quarter rolling basis, is well above historical levels.

Banking sector

28.     The global downturn exposed problems in Mongolia's financial sector which had
overheated during the boom years. The credit boom, which masked the growth of non-
performing loans (NPLs), was at the expense of prudential norms and was supported by loose
monetary policy. As a result, domestic inflation reached 33.7 percent yoy in August 2008, the
highest in East Asia in 2008. Also, lending portfolios entered the crisis heavily concentrated on
sectors such as construction and real estate, which suffered the most during the downturn, and
have highly concentrated exposures to major local borrowers, many of whom were related
parties to the same banks. Eventually this culminated in a crisis of depositor confidence in late
2008, triggered by the collapse of Anod, the fourth largest bank by asset size. A second bank
(Zoos) failed towards the end of 2009 and was taken into receivership.

29.     The authorities' policy response since the beginning of 2009, including liquidity support
for banks, a blanket deposit guarantee and a sharp increase in the policy rate, has led to a
recovery in the level of deposits. These are currently well above those seen a year earlier on at
the system level, although weak banks continue to suffer from tight liquidity.

30.     Despite the Bank of Mongolia having cut its official policy rate three times since
May 2009, from 14 percent to 10 percent in September, nominal interest rates on both local
currency deposits and loans barely fell in 2009. As a result, the sharp fall in inflation at the end
of 2009 led to a surge in ex post real borrowing costs which rose to above 20 percent. Real
lending rates declined in the first half of 2010 as inflation has picked up, although they still
remained high (around 12 percent), posing a constraint to the recovery of the private sector. On
the deposit side, the search for funds by banks facing liquidity difficulties is likely an important
driver of the high rates, while the lending rates likely reflected concerns over credit quality and
high funding costs.

31.     Bank balance sheets remain an area of concern, with NPLs and loans with principal in
arrears amounting to about a fifth of total outstanding loans at the end of the second quarter of
2010. This is roughly double the levels in December 2008. Banks' credit exposures also remain
highly concentrated, with the top 50 borrowers by loan size accounting for around 30 percent of
                                                10
total loans in Q2 2010, up from 20 percent in September 2008. Write-downs of loans are
increasingly hitting bank capital, although within the commercial banks there is a large
differentiation in balance sheet strength.

32.     The availability of credit, in particular for individual borrowers, also declined during the
crisis period with banks increasingly choosing to use funds to purchase central bank bills for
example. The level of new loan issuance fell markedly in late 2008 and early 2009 both in
nominal terms, down 57 percent year-on-year for example in 2009 Q1, and relative to the
outstanding stock of loans. While there has been some recovery in new issuance levels in recent
quarters, for example in the mining sector, the banking sector generally remains reluctant to lend,
reflecting the poor quality of assets on bank balance sheets.

Mining sector

33.     In the mining sector, the now effective Oyu Tolgoi (OT) mining investment agreement
will make a substantial contribution to the economic growth of Mongolia from 2013 onward.
The investment associated with OT, around US$4 billion of construction costs, will provide a
significant boost to the economy over the next few years, and once the mine starts producing,
there will be significant export and fiscal revenues. The signing of the agreement between the
government and Ivanhoe Mines/Rio Tinto on October 6, 2009 (and which took full and binding
effect on March 31, 2010) followed the approval by Parliament of four draft law amendments
necessary for conclusion of the deal. These amendments will invalidate the Windfall Profit Tax
with effect from January 1, 2011, introduce changes to the corporate income tax (extending the
loss-carried-forward provision from 2 to 8 years), and permit private sector construction and
management of roads and water supply facilities. However, offsetting these positive changes to
the investment environment was a recent change to the VAT laws, meaning that exporters of
minerals will be unable to claim back their VAT payments on inputs unless they export
processed mineral products. Nevertheless, the government hopes to sign an agreement on another
major mining project (Tavan Tolgoi) during 2010, using the investment agreement developed for
the OT deal as a starting point.

B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability
34.     The near-term outlook has improved since early 2009 due to the authorities' adherence to
an improved macro policy framework, supported by development partners, and a recovery in the
external environment. However, risks associated with the financing of the budget deficit and the
weak balance sheets of many banks remain. The recovery in economic activity may also be
weakened if additional government spending contributes to overheating and inflationary
pressures in the economy. It is therefore essential that progress on fiscal adjustment and banking
sector supervision and restructuring continues, bridging the period until the start of the mining-
induced high revenue growth era in the medium term.

35.    Mongolia's medium- and long-term growth outlook is extremely favorable, driven by the
signing of the major OT mining investment agreement in October 2009. A surge in capital
expenditure on infrastructure and investment relating to the development of the OT mines is
expected to raise GDP growth rates to above 7 percent between 2010 and 2012 (Table 3). The
revival in economic activity will lead to a rise in inflation in the near-term. Once copper
production actually starts in 2013, GDP growth is forecast to rise sharply, to more than

                                                11
20 percent, and is projected at around 5.5 percent on average in the long-term (2015-2030). The
growth outlook could improve even further if other prospective mining projects also materialize,
notably the Tavan Tolgoi (TT) coal deposits, which could transform Mongolia into a leading
global coal producer.

36.     The current account deficit, which improved considerably in 2009, is set to worsen
markedly in the next few years as mining-related investment goods are imported for the
development of the OT mine. The current account deficit contracted by around US$340 million,
or 4 percentage points of GDP, in 2009 relative to 2008, as the trade balance improved through a
sharper compression of imports relative to exports (Table 4). Imports supporting capital
expenditures on the OT project will greatly enlarge the deficit with total imports projected to
increase to US$3.1 billion in 2010, up US$1 billion on 2009. In 2010 the overall deficit
including the impact of OT is projected at 14 percent of GDP and is expected to rise even further
until 2012. However, these near-term deficits are expected to be fully financed through FDI
inflows and private loans. Once the OT mine becomes operational, the current account balance is
expected to shift into surplus from around 2014/15, but eventually to a deficit in the long term of
around 6 percent of GDP by 2030.

37.     According to the recently undertaken Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability
Analysis, risks to public and external debt sustainability remain low (see Annex 3). The
assumption of new debt in 2009-10 related to the OT agreement is expected to cause public
sector debt relative to GDP to roughly double from 2008 levels to 63 percent in 2011. However,
                                               12
this will be more than offset by the enhanced outlook for growth and fiscal and export revenues.
Debt service-to revenue ratios are projected to peak at around 34 percent in 2014 (up from
6.4 percent in 2009), but are expected to fall rapidly thereafter.

38.     However, in the period prior to the OT operation coming on stream, fiscal pressures are
expected to be significant. As a result of the OT project, fiscal revenues are expected to rise from
around 40 percent as a share of current non-mineral GDP to 60 percent in 2016 (or 30 percent of
GDP). But until then, revenues will remain under pressure, particularly from the expiration of the
Windfall Profits Tax in 2011, which could entail net revenue losses amounting to around
2 percent of GDP,3 while once the OT project becomes operational, dividends income from it
will be offset against the domestic loan received from the mining company (for acquiring the
government's 34 percent equity share in the OT project). Meanwhile, the government will need
to repay in 2010 a US$75 million loan it borrowed in 2009 to finance gold mining operations,
while advance payment loans from the OT agreement will also become due from 2014 onwards.
On the expenditure side, preliminary estimates of bank restructuring costs, pending the
development of bank-by-bank plans based on the audits, indicate that these amount to roughly
8 percent of GDP. At the same time, options to finance the fiscal deficit are limited (Table 4).
Donor financing is expected to dry up (with program loan financing falling from around 3.3 to
0.7 percent of GDP from 2009 to 2010). Increased domestic debt financing could further crowd
out the private sector, or there may be the risk of inflationary financing.

39.     Other sizeable risks in addition to near-term fiscal financing pressures include those
relating to banking system solvency and to the fact that the economic outlook fundamentally
depends on a small number of major investment projects, in particular OT. Accordingly, changes
in the scale and timing of their progress would have large implications for macro outcomes in
individual years. On the external front, Mongolia's economic fortunes are closely tied to
continued buoyancy in commodity prices, which tend to be highly volatile, and strong growth in

3
  The revenue loss from elimination of the WPT in 2011 is estimated at around 5 percent of GDP, given projected
copper prices. However the withdrawal of the WPT will mean that mining firms will have higher taxable profits
which should lead to an increase of around 3 percent (of GDP) of corporate income tax receipts. This suggests that
the `true' cost of the withdrawal of the WPT will be around 2 percent of GDP per year.
                                                         13
China. For instance, with the monetary policy stance being tightened in China, economic growth
is likely to slow there, undermining some of the support to Mongolian exports seen over the past
year.

40.     Given these risks, there is little choice but to continue fiscal adjustment. If the recently
adopted FSL is adhered to, the structural fiscal deficit will fall to around 2 percent of GDP by
2013. This process of fiscal consolidation will firstly allow Mongolia to successfully bridge the
next few years, until the OT mine becomes operational. Second, it will provide fiscal space for
Mongolia to cope with any unexpected external shock. Finally, it will be an essential component
of putting in place a strong policy framework to manage the upcoming mining boom and use
these revenues to promote equitable, sustainable growth going forward. That said, the FSL is not
a substitute for prudent fiscal management and good governance. Instead it is crucial that
domestic spending is raised in line with absorptive capacity and that momentum on other
structural reforms is not lost. In particular, it is important to press ahead with reforms aimed at
minimizing unproductive government spending through better targeting of social transfers that
ensure that the poor are protected from future mining boom-and-busts in a fiscally affordable
manner, and through improved public investment planning. There is bi-partisan support for
targeting of social transfers, and the government has submitted a draft social welfare reform law
(SWL) to Parliament and intends to pass it during the upcoming fall session. The SWL would set
the stage for the introduction of a targeted means-tested poverty benefit.

41.      Finally, banking sector problems must be resolved in a manner that reduces potential cost
to tax payers while at the same time ensuring a healthy, well-capitalized banking system emerges
that is able to function well as the economy grows.  Real lending growth was negative until April
this year and, although it has turned positive since, remains weak. With banks reluctant to lend
while they still have large amounts of bad loans or undisclosed losses on their books, it is of
utmost importance to improve bank resolution techniques and address ongoing solvency
problems through adopting a bank restructuring strategy. Such a strategy was recently drafted by
the Bank of Mongolia, reflecting lessons from international experience, and with the support of
the World Bank. It has been recently submitted to Parliament and timely endorsement is needed
to restore the banking sector to health.

42.     In conclusion, the current macro framework is satisfactory for a budget support operation.
The authorities' IMF SBA program remains on track, with the IMF Board approving the fourth
review on March 19, 2010. The fifth and sixth reviews of the IMF were combined into one final
review, and with the relevant performance criteria having been met, was approved by the IMF
Board in early September. Going forward, a few difficult years lie ahead with respect to the
financing of the fiscal deficit until the structural increases in mining revenues materialize. To
minimize the risks, continued fiscal adjustment and strong action on banking sector restructuring
are essential. Finally, the appropriate macro and fiscal management policies need to be put in
place to enable the country to reap the greatest economic benefits from the structural increase in
mining resource flows and avoid the Dutch disease (viz. high inflation and strong currency
appreciation, coupled with high unemployment).

IV.     THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES
43.      Since the beginning of 2009, the government has taken strong actions on fiscal,
monetary, and exchange rate policies to address the crisis.4 On fiscal policy, Parliament approved
amendments to the 2009 budget in May and June, with the latter projecting a 5.8 percent of GDP
deficit, mainly by cutting expenditures. On exchange rate policy, the BoM raised the policy rate
to allow a more flexible exchange rate (through bi-weekly auctions), while avoiding
overshooting and preserving its foreign exchange reserves (see Table 6). On monetary policy, the
goal of reducing inflation was achieved--inflation for 2009 came down sharply from its 2008
level. Together with a rebound in copper prices, these policy actions successfully stabilized the
economy.

44.     With respect to the banking sector, a strengthened regulatory framework, decisive action
on the two failed banks, and the introduction of a blanket deposit guarantee (and its subsequent
improvement to clarify the types of deposits covered and exclude "related party" deposits), and a
raising of the capital adequacy requirements prevented what looked like a real possibility by the
end of 2008: a system-wide bank run. After an audit by an internationally reputable firm
(financed from a World Bank TA loan), one bank was taken into conservatorship, eventually
being put into receivership at the end of 2009, and the process of liquidation started. A second
bank was also put under receivership around the same time after its management reported its

initiated. A bridge bank was established with the help of WB and EBRD, to take over remaining
good assets and deposits.

  Previously existing government programs, such as the 2008-12 Government Action Plan, the National
Development Strategy, and even the 2008 Anti-Crisis Action Plan, have largely been overtaken by events and will
be revived when economic and fiscal conditions allow.

 45.     Under the original 2010 budget approved in November 2009, the budget deficit was
 projected at 5 percent, an improvement from the 5.4 percent outturn achieved for 2009. However,
 the improvement in public finances compared to last year and the rise in revenues in line with
 commodity prices have led to growing pressures for increased government spending. In July, the
 parliament approved government proposed amendments to the original 2010 budget which
 envisage a 4.5 percent of GDP increase in spending on top of the original 2010 budget, on the
 back of a revised projected increase in revenues of 3.1 percent of GDP. (Refer back to Table 2).
 The main driver for the increases is the execution of promises made by both coalition parties to
 distribute MNT 1.5million (around US$1,000) to each citizen in the form of cash and non-cash
 handouts and large public sector wage increases planned for October of this year. But, mindful
 that the increase in spending could spur inflation and also crowd out private sector activity, the
 government has committed to under-execute the budget by about 1 percent of GDP.
                                                 16
46.     The government's strategy going forward is defined by the twin objectives of continuing
the corrective actions necessary to successfully bridge the next few years and putting in place a
strong policy framework to manage the upcoming mining boom. This boom will carry with it the
attendant Dutch disease risks, as several large mining projects come on stream in the long run.
The key policies will need to be: (i) a flexible exchange rate; (ii) fiscal rules to isolate the budget
from mineral price fluctuations, avoid excessive real appreciation of the currency and minimize
unproductive public spending; (iii) a restructured banking sector able to serve a booming
economy without falling victim to the reckless lending practices of the past; (iv) a strong social
safety net to ensure the poor are protected from the inevitable boom-and-bust cycles and benefit
from the higher growth; and (v) mining policies which attract world-class mining companies,
safeguard the environment, maximize opportunities for Mongolian businesses and workers to
participate in the boom, and lead the fight against corruption.

47.     To avoid a repeat of the "boom-and-bust" spending pattern that Mongolia has just
experienced, Parliament adopted a Fiscal Stability Law in June. There were three fiscal rules
legislated: one adopted a structural balance similar to the Chile example, which sets a floor (and
becomes binding) on the structural deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2013; one sets a ceiling to
public debt of 40 percent of GDP; and one restrains the annual increases in public expenditures
to a sustainable level.

48.     These rules will be key in Mongolia's efforts in constraining fiscal spending to prudent
and sustainable levels. The new law will also manage the huge revenue inflows expected from
the OT mine from 2016 onward. Under the FSL, the government will set up a fiscal stability
fund, into which will flow a portion of OT revenues that will be invested overseas, helping to
reduce Dutch Disease pressures on the economy. The remaining mining sector revenues will be
invested in domestic infrastructure to meet the growing and substantial infrastructure needs of
the economy. During 2009 and 2010, the preparation of these laws by the MoF included
intensive consultations with Parliament and a study tour of key members of Parliament to Chile
(financed by the Governance Partnership Facility, see below). Technical assistance was provided
by the IMF and the Bank. This was a good example of IMF conditionality being complemented
with Bank TA.

49.     In the financial sector, the immediate objective is to ensure that banks mobilize sufficient
capital to meet the prudential requirements. The banks are currently subjected to in-depth special
assessments, undertaken by internationally reputable auditing firms, to better assess the capital
shortfalls. To help maintain confidence in the banking sector, the BoM will need to use the
findings from special assessments to enforce full compliance with existing prudential norms,
taking decisive action taken in case of systemic non-compliance. The medium-term objective is
to implement a restructuring of the banking sector, incentivized by a well-sequenced increase of
paid-in capital of commercial banks. These measures are being undertaken in partnership with
the IMF, the ADB, USAID, the IFC, and the EBRD.

 50.     The medium-term goal of the envisaged reforms with respect to social transfers is to
 better protect the poor by targeting the currently untargeted grants. During the spring session of
 Parliament, the government proposed to Parliament legislation which would consolidate several
 existing social transfer programs into one social protection program and re-introduce targeting.
 The draft law will be discussed in the Fall Session, which starts in October. In the mean time,
 work is underway on establishing an improved proxy-means test (PMT) and a national
 beneficiary database to implement the targeting principle proposed in the new legislation. To
 better track the impact of the planned new social protection program, the Bank will assist the
 government to design and implement an impact evaluation. The goal will be to gradually roll out
 a new poverty benefit based on PMT-targeting, starting mid-2010.

 51.     Indicative medium-term reforms in the mining sector have as their objective to improve
 the legal environment, sector policies, and transparency. Based on the recent experience gained
 during the negotiations of a major investment agreement, the government has developed and
 adopted a draft model investment agreement, which future negotiations can use as their starting
 point. New regulations have also been issued to improve the transparency and functioning of the
 mining cadastre. Furthermore, by 2011, the goal is to have mining projects follow responsible
 mining practices. Adherence to this regulatory framework will be monitored strictly, using
                                                 18
enhanced regulatory capacity. In order to increase employment for the Mongolian workforce in
mining, the government will substantially increase the number of Mongolians to be trained in the
relevant mining skills. Meanwhile, in the environment sector, there are clear moves underway to
improve the practice and transparency of environmental impact assessments, particularly in the
area of public consultation, and to that end a revised Law and an online database were completed
in early 2010.

52.     In conclusion, the government's plan of action in the near-term is making significant
progress, and the key policy actions of a medium-term strategy are emerging. These policy
actions are based on the strong partnership, forged during the crisis, between the government,
Parliament, and the development partners. However, as popular demands for the immediate
redistribution of mining wealth grow stronger, copper prices strengthen, and the 2012 elections
draw nearer, this partnership and commitment could wane. This underlines the urgency with
which government and Parliament need to agree and commit themselves to a longer-term agenda
for economic policy focused on achieving the goal of sustainable, shared growth.

V.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A. Link to the proposed Interim Strategy Note (ISN)

53.     Given the economic crisis, far-advanced preparations for a new Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) were deferred in early 2009 in favor of an Interim Strategy, which was approved
in March 2009, to provide a bridging framework for an 18-month period until economic
conditions stabilized. The Interim Strategy positioned the Bank to support the government in
addressing urgent crisis needs and easing the fiscal adjustment, but also to support renewed
efforts to undertake reforms that will reduce the impact of future shocks.

54.     Under the Interim Strategy, the majority of IDA resources were shifted from previously
planned investment projects to DPCs. Two single-tranche DPCs (US$40 million in FY10 and
US$29.7 million in FY11), representing more than two-thirds of the notional IDA 15 envelope of
US$90 million, constituted the key pillars of the ISN. Projects and analytical work that supported
the first DPC have been further modified to support the second DPC. In parallel to the second
DPC, a multi-sectoral TA credit was processed to support the DPC2 policy reforms and the
emerging medium-term policy agenda, and was approved at the end of June 2010.

55.     The ISN will be replaced during FY11 with a four-year CPS. Mongolia has been
classified as a middle-income country since July, 2008, and could become IBRD-creditworthy
during the CPS period. As Mongolia creates the fiscal space to comfortably finance its own
investment program, the Bank's comparative advantage will increasingly shift towards providing
policy advice. The consultations leading up to the new CPS will be focused on how to maximize
the benefits for Mongolia of the Bank's knowledge services. In this respect, a programmatic
series of DPCs, supported by TA operations, could be an important pillar for the new CPS.




                                               19
B. Consultations held in preparation for the proposed operation

56.   The policy measures supported in this proposed operation were informed by an intensive
government-led consultation process involving key stakeholders, in particular Mongolia's
powerful Parliament. The main activities included:

       Policy dialogue with Parliament. At every stage during the preparation of this operation,
       the government has urged the Bank team to assist in the consensus-building among senior
       policy makers and key members of Parliament on the key reforms. This iterative process
       resulted in strong ownership and full transparency on the contents of the proposed DPC2.
       Below, we list the highlights of this dialogue.
       Workshop with Mongolian Members of Parliament, October 31, 2009. This meeting
       was organized by the parliamentary leaders of the two political parties in order to provide
       other MPs with the key presentations and discussions of the September 2009 Chile-
       Washington D.C. study tour (see below). The workshop was attended by 35 MPs,
       roughly half the total number of MPs, and turned out to be an intense question and
       answer session, involving the government, the World Bank, and the IMF on the full range
       of economic problems facing Mongolia.
       Government of Mongolia-External Partners Technical Meeting, October 30, 2009.
       The main objective of the meeting was to bring the representatives of Government, the
       Parliament, and external partners together and discuss the progress and development of
       the government's reform programs and their prospective. The key discussants included
       the Minister of Finance, Minister of Social Welfare and Labor, Minister of Mineral
       Resources and Energy, First Deputy at the Bank of Mongolia, and the IMF Mission Chief
       for Mongolia.
       Mongolia Economic Policy Conference, October 29, 2009. The 2009 Economic Policy
       Conference--a public economic forum organized jointly by the government and the
       World Bank to bring international knowledge to bear on Mongolia's economic
       challenges--was opened by the President of Mongolia. Discussions were led by
       representatives from the World Bank, the Ministry of Finance of Chile, the Netherlands
       Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Mongolia, and the IMF. This annual conference
       provides an important avenue for the government of Mongolia and representatives of
       Mongolian society to learn from local and international experts and policymakers.
       Chile, Washington D.C., Canada and Botswana Study Tours, September 7-12, 2009,
       March 22-24, 2010 and August 1-10, 2010. These study tours, financed from an
       existing World Bank TA project, were designed to provide key Mongolian policymakers
       and legislators with "cross-country", cross-institutional, cross-regional, and cross-sector
       knowledge on how best to manage a mineral-dependent economy. These tours provided
       ample opportunities for in-depth discussions on how the Chilean model on fiscal policy
       could be applied to Mongolia. Chile was chosen because it is also a world copper
       producer but, unlike Mongolia, already had a fiscal responsibility law in place during the
       last decade. The fiscal rules embedded in this law made Chile save substantial amounts
       during the boom, allowing it to efficiently respond during the bust. Eduardo Aninat
       (former Minister of Finance of Chile and Deputy Managing Director of the IMF)
       organized the Chile leg of the tour. The Chileans provided the Mongolian delegation their

                                               20
       expertise on their own political economy and excellent fiscal framework. The IMF and
       the World Bank jointly organized the Washington D.C. leg of the tour. A second tour for
       members of Parliament was held March 22-24, but could only visit Washington D.C., due
       to the earthquake in Chile. Finally two separate groups of Parliamentarians undertook a
       study tour in early August, one to Chile, Canada and Washington DC, and the other to
       Botswana. In addition to discussing key policy reforms relating to social welfare, fiscal
       decentralization and public investment planning and management, other topics included
       investment strategies for stabilization funds and development strategies for natural
       resource based economies. These study tours increased the understanding of, and
       reinforced the commitment to, the government's policy reforms among key
       parliamentarians.

C. Collaboration with the IMF and other development partners
57.     The partnership between the IMF and the Bank in the preparation and reviews of
Mongolia's SBA has been exceptionally strong and complementary. Bank staff participated in all
IMF missions, leading up to the SBA Board approval and during subsequent reviews of the
program. Collaboration with the ADB and Japan (the other providers of the budget support
necessary to fill the financing gap under the SBA) has been equally strong, in particular in the
area of social protection. A joint team of the ADB and the World Bank assisted the government
with key reforms in its social welfare system in order to better protect the poor during the
downturn. Finally, Australia co-financed the first DPC and Korea provided grant funding for
technical assistance with respect to DPC2.

58.      IDA's catalytic platform services played a critical role in the development of the overall
support program and its coordination. They included convening two donor meetings in 2009, in
addition to the analytical work and advisory services described below. This facilitation is a
critical aspect of the effective and efficient use of the Crisis Response Window, which finances
this operation.

59.    The Mongolian government's Letters of Intent to the IMF under the SBA program
recognizes the joint assistance of the IMF, the ADB, and the World Bank in support of the
following key policy reforms:

       Strengthening the institutional framework for fiscal policy to prevent the repeat of the
       boom and bust cycles of recent years and ensure the long-term sustainability of its
       policies by adopting a Fiscal Responsibility Law (supported by IMF and World Bank
       assistance).
       Overhauling its social transfer programs, improving targeting, and raising the level of
       social support to the very poor (supported by IMF, ADB, and World Bank assistance).
       Boosting confidence in the banking system by taking decisive action on bank failures,
       enhancing bank supervision and enforcing all existing regulatory requirements for banks
       (with IMF, ADB, World Bank Group, USAID, and EBRD assistance).

D. Relationship to other Bank operations
60.     Under the World Bank Group's Interim Strategy, the existing loan portfolio is being
redirected and disbursements accelerated to address short-term crisis needs. The portfolio is
                                             21
strongly focused on improving the livelihoods of the poor, both in the rural as well as in the
urban areas.

61.     The Sustainable Livelihoods Project II and International Finance Corporation (IFC)
investments will continue to expand rural access to microcredit and other financial services, in
coordination with commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, and other external partners.
Additional finance will be provided to ensure sustainability and expand geographic coverage of
the on-going Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project, an innovative pilot project that is
introducing market-based insurance products to herders that provides coverage in the event of
catastrophic weather events. Additional finance would allow livestock insurance to be introduced
in more provinces, build the necessary institutional framework to sustain the insurance, and pre-
finance an important potential government liability that insures herders against major natural
disasters.

62.     To help vulnerable populations in Ulaanbaatar, with an emphasis on peri-urban ger5 area
residents, additional financing will also be provided for an ongoing Energy Project to support
urgent maintenance of Ulaanbaatar's antiquated electricity distribution infrastructure--a priority
also supported under the second DPC's focus on ensuring budget allocations to the maintenance
of key infrastructure.

63.    The ambitious policy reform agenda envisaged under the ISN and its DPCs will also
require considerable capacity-building, together with targeted, just-in-time technical assistance,
and stepped-up efforts at public outreach and dialogue. The ISN supports these activities as
follows:
     Current technical assistance projects (GAP, ECTAC, Mining TA) have been adjusted to
       link with the policy reform agenda supported by the second DPC, drawing on findings
       under the recently completed Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review
       (World Bank, 2009b) and other studies. In addition, a new technical assistance (TA)
       support program was developed to support the policy reforms in the banking sector,
       social protection and the fiscal framework.6 The Bank has also stepped up support to the
       government's efforts to increase budget transparency, including in implementing the
       Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).7
         The ongoing Mining TA supports key reforms in the sector. It also supports development
         of governance, financial and fiduciary arrangements for the Erdenes MGL LLC state
         holding company, consistent with OECD corporate governance principles.
         The Netherlands-Mongolia Trust Fund for Environmental Reform (NEMO) supports,
         inter alia, the development of a searchable online database of EIAs, a review of the
         environmental and social impact of the mining sector, the revisions to the Law on

  The EITI program is meant to strengthen governance by improving transparency and accountability in the
extractives sector through the publication of private companies' payments and the disclosure of government's
receipts of oil, gas and mining. Mongolia is about to complete its second reconciliation report since it joined EITI in
2006. It has been identified as one of four countries in line to be declared as "EITI compliant" following an
independent validation.

        Environmental Assessment, and an inventory and registration of mining lands needing
        rehabilitation.
        A Governance Partnership Facility (GFP) is strengthening government and stakeholder
        capacity for policy analysis and dialogue. For instance, the highly successful study tour
        by a bi-partisan parliamentary delegation to Chile and Washington D.C., and the 2009
        Economic Policy Conference, were partially financed by the GPF. The GPF grant will
        continue to support the policy reform agenda through financing independent analysis,
        public outreach on select policy issues, and introduction of demand-side tools to foster
        transparency and accountability.
        The ongoing Second Private Sector Development Credit project is supporting the special
        bank assessments under its BoM TA component.
        A new statistical capacity building project is improving the quality of key statistical
        systems needed to manage the current downturn.
        Finally, Korea has provided TA grant funds to support the preparation and
        implementation of DPC2.

64.      The IFC program of work in Mongolia aims to address the current weaknesses in the
financial markets and real sectors through investment and advisory service programs. This work
includes: (i) providing technical assistance to BoM and banks on strategies and methods of
dealing with the financial crisis, including NPL management and increasing liquidity;
(ii) collaborating with other international financial institutions to address specific capital
requirements of the banking system; (iii) developing the non-bank financial sector including
leasing; (iv) addressing liquidity needs of investment clients; (v) identifying opportunities to
invest in import substitution industries, in particular aiming at food security and quality;
(vi) improving inspection regimes and corporate governance to increase efficiency and improve
market practice; and (vii) creating opportunities for Mongolia to participate in IFC's crisis
response facilities, including bank capitalization, trade finance, and microfinance liquidity. IFC
investments in the real sector will help diversify Mongolia's economic base.

E. Performance & Key Lessons Learned
65.     Prior to the DPC that was approved in mid-2009, Mongolia's recent experience with
World Bank policy-based lending was relatively limited. Two operations (Economic Transition
Support Credit8 and the Banking and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit9) were approved in the
early/mid 1990s and the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit10 was approved in 2000. A planned
series of single-tranche programmatic Structural Adjustment Loans, envisaged in the April 2004
Country Assistance Strategy, never materialized. In June 2004, the first Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) under this series was withdrawn after negotiations and prior to Board
consideration because of concerns, shared by the IMF, which let its PRGF lapse in parallel, about
the non-transparent nature of decisions taken on rescheduling of Russian debt to Mongolia. A
Quality Assurance Group Learning Review later concluded that this was a highly appropriate

decision. The dialogue on a possible PRSC was pursued until September 2005, when it was
replaced by a TA operation (the Governance Assistance Project/GAP).

66.     A review of the progress made in the policy areas supported by the 2009 DPC, along with
an assessment of the performance of the World Bank and the Recipient, is provided in the
Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report. This review is subject to the caveat of the
limited time frame between Board approval of the operation in June 2009 and the ICR
assessment (conducted during October and November 2009). Progress on development outcomes
over this period was less strong in the policy areas of the banking sector and social protection,
especially when compared to earlier progress on outcomes in fiscal performance and the mining
sector. In terms of Recipient performance, the government and domestic policy makers, showed
a high level of commitment from the outset of the operation and were cooperative in trying to
pass all the prior actions in time, although, as the intensity of the economic crisis dissipated,
there appeared to be some weakening in commitment to moving forward reforms. This was
especially noticeable in the banking sector, although, as discussed, the authorities have recently
taken action on two problem banks.

67.   Despite the differing contexts, the key lessons learned as outlined in the ICR review are
in many respects similar to those drawn from previous operations as detailed in the 2009 DPC
program document. The design of this operation draws on, and benefits from, these lessons:

       Understanding the political economy context for the policy reforms is crucial. Perhaps
       due to the seriousness of the economic situation and the strength of the bi-partisan
       government coalition, the 2009 presidential elections played a negligible role in affecting
       the outcomes of the DPC 2009 program. However, as the copper price revived and the
       perceived threat of imminent crisis has receded, legitimate pressure for a greater
       distribution of the benefits of Mongolia's mineral wealth to rural areas and to the urban
       poor could again degenerate into profligate populism, as it had during the previous
       mining boom. In particular, the active nature of Mongolia's Parliament, combined with
       the prospect of large increases in future mineral revenues, is likely to test the
       government's commitment to move forward on medium-term policy reforms. Continuing
       commitment, support, and ownership from the senior leadership in the government and
       Parliament are therefore needed during project preparation and implementation. Thus, as
       in the 2009 DPC operation, during the preparation of DPC2, there has been continuous
       dialogue with senior policy makers of both coalition parties and sustained outreach with
       the broader range of stakeholders, for example through the annual economic policy
       conference in October 2009 and the release of monthly economic updates.
       Prior strong TA and analytical work, and the ability and resources to scale up such work
       quickly, are essential for a successful and timely outcome for policy-based lending,
       particularly in crisis-response operations. The importance of TA operations and capacity-
       building programs in preparing the ground for, and supporting the implementation of,
       adjustment operations was highlighted in the 2009 DPC operation. Indeed, the fiscal
       policy sector and the mining sectors were better able to achieve their objectives because a
       lot of sectoral work was already in place. Supporting the main policy areas with
       appropriate TA is an important element in the preparation of the current DPC2 operation.


                                               24
       It is important to gauge from the beginning of an operation the capacity of the Recipient
       or the implementing agency to implement the proposed reforms. The time needed to
       introduce fundamental changes, as well as build improved institutions, requires careful
       programming and sequencing. The capacity of the Recipient was sufficient enough to
       take strong and painful policy actions supported by the 2009 DPC when this was required.
       However, the more complicated reforms that are needed on social protection will require
       developing more capacity, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the design of simple
       implementation systems to make optimal use of the existing capacity. Similarly, as the
       weaknesses in the banking sector have turned out to be more severe than expected,
       additional TA for banking sector supervision and restructuring will be needed. Hence, a
       new World Bank technical assistance operation was prepared to accompany DPC2.
       Success of a program requires a flexible mindset of, and close coordination amongst,
       development partners, especially where individual donor resources are limited. During
       the DPC 2009 operation the general coordination among the donors was highly
       commendable. In the preparation of the DPC2 operation, the government and the
       multilateral and bilateral development partners have continued to work closely and
       jointly to coordinate their support to the policy reform agenda.

F. Analytical Underpinnings
68.     The proposed second DPC draws from the same wealth of resources that was made
available for the first DPC on fiscal policy and management (including reform and
infrastructure), social protection, the financial sector, the mining sector, governance, as well as
from several newly developed ones.

       Monthly Economic Updates. Increasing the frequency of the Economic Updates from
       quarterly to monthly in May 2009, in order to better address the domestic concerns, has
       played a major role in improving the analytical underpinnings of the policy reforms,
       while also increasing public awareness in Mongolia of the economic situation and on-
       going policy debates. The updates summarize the main economic, fiscal and financial
       developments for each month, which enables the public to follow the crisis in more depth
       and enhance their awareness of the country's macroeconomic environment. This in turn
       has led to quicker and more effective responses from the government. The updates
       continue to receive widespread attention and appreciation by the press and key policy
       makers. As the economy has recovered, the frequency of the updates has been reduced to
       quarterly publications, starting in June 2010.
       The fiscal policy and management agenda is underpinned by the 2009 World Bank Public
       Expenditure and Financial Management Review, the 2008 World Bank Governance
       Assessment Report, a series of studies on improving medium-term program budgeting
       undertaken under an existing TA project (the ECTAC project), the 2008 IMF report on
       "Budget Preparation: A Roadmap for Institutional Strengthening", and the 2007 World
       Bank report "Foundation for Sustainable Development: Rethinking the Delivery of
       Infrastructure Services in Mongolia", the 2010 Mongolia: Improving Public Investment
       Planning and Budgeting, and a draft report titled: "Challenges in Public Investment in a
       Resource Rich Country: A Political Economy Perspective." These studies highlight the
       weaknesses in the budget formulation and public investment planning processes in
       Mongolia, including the political preference for funding new investments over
                                              25
   maintaining the existing capital stock, leading to the chronic underfunding of
   maintenance; the significant discretion of Parliament to add new projects to the public
   investment plan without a formal appraisal process, including feasibility studies; and the
   institutional weaknesses and poor procedures along the length of the project cycle. All
   these studies informed the fiscal prior actions on capital budgeting and maintenance.
   Other analytical work addressed related issues in the broader agenda on improving fiscal
   expenditure performance, for example a World Bank report on "Mongolia: Towards a
   High Performing Civil Service" published in June 2009.
   A mining revenue management options study: "Copper revenues and sustainable fiscal
   policy in Mongolia" (Budina, Van Wijnbergen and Li, 2009) contributed to the analysis
   undertaken by the IMF to assist the government to design a better fiscal framework for
   the management of mining revenues.
   Reforms in social protection are buttressed by the following studies: the 2009 World
   Bank Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review: "Assessment of the Child
   Money Program and properties of its targeting methodology," (Araujo, 2006), and "The
   making of a Modern Social Assistance System in Mongolia" (Ridao-Cano, 2007). The
   policy actions will also be supported by a forthcoming poverty study, "Did Poverty
   Really Stagnate in Mongolia between 2002-03 and 2007-08?" (World Bank Policy Note,
   2010, forthcoming), as well as by a range of analyses being undertaking as part of on-
   going World Bank technical assistance to Mongolia's Ministry of Social Welfare and
   Labor.
   Financial sector reforms can draw on the 2008 World Bank-IMF Financial Sector
   Assessment Report, and more recent World Bank reviews and assessments of the banking
   sector and recent developments (undertaken in 2008 and 2009). The data for these studies
   will have been overtaken by events, but both the medium-term and long-term objectives
   of the studies that support the policy actions remain unchanged.
   In the area of governance, the DPC2 program is also informed by the governance
   challenges identified in the 2008 Governance Assessment Report associated with the
   mining taxation regime, the cadastre and licensing system, and the transparency of, and
   accountability for, mining revenues.

   The environmental policy agenda benefitted from the World Bank "Review of
   Environmental and Social Impacts in the Mining Sector" (2006), Mongolia Discussion
   Series, Environment and Social Development Department. In addition, core work within
   the 2005 IDF-financed Strengthening Environmental Management Capacity at National
   and Local Levels within MNET identified a lack of formalized public participation in
   permitting procedures and environmental impact assessments, the lack of adequate
   funding to enforce the requirements of the mining law and concession contracts,
   inadequate or incomplete bonding instruments to ensure financing of rehabilitation
   efforts, and inadequate criteria for establishing the success of reclamation as major
   constraints to the appropriate management of mineral resources. This led to the various
   NEMO-financed activities mentioned above.

VI.     THE PROPOSED LOAN: OPERATION DESCRIPTION
69.     The World Bank's proposed second DPC is a single-tranche operation of
US$29.7 million. While it is acknowledged that, because of the magnitude of the shock, the
adjustment effort will take place over the next several years, the approach selected was one of
two single-tranche operations, because of the many uncertainties and risks and the absence of a
coherent and detailed medium-term policy framework when the crisis hit. This DPC2 is designed
in line with the good practice principles for conditionality (Box 2) with the objective of building
on the achievements of the first phase of the reforms and laying the basis for a sound medium-
term policy framework.

70.    The operation is financed by IDA's Crisis Response Window and follows its guidelines.
The CRW's objective is to mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis and protect core
spending on health, education, social safety nets, infrastructure, and agriculture. All components
of DPC2 are focused on mitigating the impact of the global crisis on Mongolia, especially its
impact on the poor.

                          Box 2. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The government has taken strong policy actions over 2009 which have required bipartisan support and which
demonstrate growing government ownership of the reforms needed to address the impact of the crisis, to promote the
recovery and to put in place an improved policy framework for the medium-term. The design of this operation has
benefited from systematic dialogue with key government officials and representatives of both political parties. In
addition, a series of outreach and consultation events to discuss key policy issues, along with the release of the
regular economic updates, further helped raise awareness and ownership during program design (Section V.B).
However, risks remain, with the revival of copper prices and prospects of increased mineral revenues having the
potential to test commitment to moving forward on the medium-term reform agenda (Section VII.F).
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
Since the onset of the crisis, the government and the key development partners (viz. the IMF, the ADB, Japan and the
World Bank) have worked closely together in the design of the overall reform package. This has continued in the
preparation of this DPC2 operation. Joint work in several areas is being undertaken, and a clear division of labor,
which avoids overlapping or contradictory conditionality, has been established. A special meeting of the external
partners and the government was held in late October to coordinate the support of the development partners.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The modalities and timing of the operation are designed to provide continued support for policy reforms in the key
areas most affected by the economic downturn and those sectors such as mining which are likely to be drivers of
medium-term growth. The financing of the operation will help to ease the near-term fiscal adjustment in response to
the crisis in a period when financing options remain constrained. The short-term policy responses supported are
clearly linked with medium-term priorities (Section VI.E). However, a robust medium-term strategy still needs to be
fully fleshed out.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
Only nine prior actions have been chosen in four key sectors. These actions were focused on achieving concrete
results for managing the downturn, particularly for example to address the problems in the banking sector, and for
laying the basis for an improved policy framework going forward.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
The operation is a single-tranche DPC so there are only prior actions. The design of the operation has been informed
by the lessons learned from the 2009 DPC operation, as reviewed in the draft Implementation, Completion and
Results report. Monitoring of the evolving policy reform agenda is undertaken through ongoing dialogue with the
government and through the monthly economic updates.

                                                        27
71.     The focus areas of DPC2 remain the same as in the first DPC, as does the justification of
their choice: (i) fiscal policy and management, given the budget's strong dependence on mining
revenues; (ii) social protection, given the impact of the economic downturn on the poor; (iii) the
financial sector, which was overheating when the global crisis hit, and which experienced two
bank failures (one in 2008, and one in 2009); and (iv) the mining sector, given the sector's
importance in driving the recovery. All these focus areas are consistent with Crisis Response
Window Objectives.

72.     The partnership between the government and the development partners aims to put in
place a better medium-term policy framework going forward. The fiscal framework needs to help
Mongolia better manage the boom and bust cycles of its mining revenues, while preparing it for
the dramatic expansion of the mining sector during the next decade. Abandoning the system of
universal social transfers and replacing it with a targeted system will not only put social transfers
on a more sustainable fiscal path, but it will also avoid the pitfalls of excessive domestic
consumption as mining revenues increase, while ensuring that part of the mining wealth is
redistributed towards the poor. Similarly, addressing the current problems of the banking sector
in a decisive and transparent way can pave the way for a much stronger banking sector in the
years to come. Finally, continuing to improve mining policies sets the stage for increased,
sustainable private sector investment to underpin Mongolia's economic growth.

73.      The prior actions supported by the second DPC are the following:

         Fiscal policy and management
            The Recipient has amended the FY2010 Budget to:
            ·   improve the public investment plan by reducing by 197 (amounting to 40 billion
                Tugrik) the number of projects that: (a) do not have the necessary feasibility
                studies (technical drawings and accurate cost estimates); and (b) do not meet
                national priorities; and
            ·   account for the contingent liabilities from contractor-funded projects by
                specifying these in the Amended FY2010 budget.
            The Recipient has prioritized the level of capital expenditures for maintenance of
            basic infrastructure (including the Road Fund), as evidenced by: (i) the increase in the
            ratio of capital repairs to new investments from 6.1 percent (in the FY2009 Revised
            Budget) to 6.5 percent (in the FY2010 Budget); and (ii) the allocation of 28.2 billion
            Tugrik therefore.
         Social protection
            The National Statistical Office has approved the Proxy Means Test methodology as
            the official targeting mechanism for the provision of social welfare benefits in
            Mongolia.
            The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MoSWL) has completed a proposal
            defining the parameters of the new poverty-targeted benefit program, and has
            submitted said proposal to the Cabinet for approval.



                                                 28
       Financial sector
           The BoM has: (i) completed a special banks assessment of seven (7) selected banks;
           and (ii) commenced a similar assessment of another three (3) selected banks, with the
           assistance of internationally reputable auditors.
           BoM has adopted and submitted to the Parliament a comprehensive bank
           restructuring strategy, which includes, as a last resort tool, a stand-by bank
           recapitalization facility with proper covenants to protect the public funds.
       Mining sector
           The Recipient has revised the regulation on operations and processes of the Mining
           Cadastre.
           The Recipient has submitted the documentation required by the International EITI
           Board to assess the compliance of the Recipient's national EITI Program.
           The Recipient has placed online a searchable database of Environmental Impact
           Assessments for mining and other projects.

A. Fiscal Policy and Management
Challenges

74.     As in the first DPC, the fiscal policy reforms supported under DPC2 focus on two areas:
first, improving capital budget planning, and second, protecting the maintenance of key
infrastructure.

75.      Between 2002 and 2009, Mongolia went through a classic boom-and-bust cycle,
exposing weaknesses in the fiscal framework. During the "boom" years, the budget became
increasingly dependent on mining revenues, and the non-mining deficit, i.e., expenditures
relative to non-mining revenues, rose substantially. The windfall mining revenues were used to
massively increase (poorly planned) capital expenditures and to fund across the board wage
increases and untargeted social transfers. When the "bust" came, the budget swung into a large
deficit, which would have been impossible to finance without large expenditure cuts and donor
assistance.

76.     Going forward, the challenges are three-fold: how to insulate the budget from mineral
price fluctuations, how to efficiently manage the massive increase in revenues expected to start
in 2016, and how to improve the efficiency of the locally-invested part of the increased revenues.

77.     First, the budget needs to be made less dependent on volatile mineral prices. The
dependency on volatile mining revenues can be reduced by adopting a so-called "structural
balance" rule a la Chile. Under such a rule, the budget ignores actual, current mining revenues,
but only allows spending from revenues calculated by using long-term mineral price projections.
During the boom years, the difference between current and long-term revenues will be positive
and is saved, so that during the bust, the resulting fiscal deficit can be financed from the savings
made during the boom.



                                                29
78.     Second, budget planning and execution needs to prepare for the substantial, and
structural, increases in revenues when several large mining projects start to generate massive
revenues in 2015 and beyond. The objective would be to avoid allowing these revenues to
contribute to an overheating of the economy. This implies saving externally, while spending
locally only what can be efficiently absorbed, both publicly and privately.

79.    Third, the part that is locally invested should raise the productivity of the economy in
order to translate the mineral wealth into economic wealth for the nation. There is an extra
premium on the efficiency of such productivity-enhancing investments because of the
unavoidable appreciation of the currency which will accompany the mining boom.

80.    These are three distinct challenges, each requiring a different set of reforms. IMF-
supported policy reforms focus on the first two issues, supported by World Bank-financed
technical assistance. These efforts have resulted in the adoption of the Fiscal Stability Law in
June of 2010. The DPC2 focuses on a key element of the third challenge: improving capital
budget planning, including the protection of maintenance of key infrastructure during the fiscal
adjustment.

Key measures to be supported by DPC2

81.     Ensuring that public expenditures on investments translate into the creation of productive
capital assets is Mongolia's core development challenge. Aggregate investment, including both
public and private investment increased from 25 percent of GDP in 2000 to 35-40 percent in
2007-2008. The portion of investments funded from the budget has also grown rapidly. Financed
by the mineral resource boom, nominal public capital expenditures increased seven-fold between
2005 and 2008 from under MNT 90 billion to over MNT 620 billion, and were 11 percent of
GDP at their peak in 2007 (Figure 7). These increases are only a fraction of what is expected as
the new mines in the South Gobi go into production, with mineral revenues projected to expand
to well over 20 percent of GDP within ten years, more than twice their recent peak in 2008.
Clearly, these new revenues, if utilized effectively, offer Mongolia the rare opportunity to
achieve long-run sustainable growth and poverty reduction, but they come with the well-known
risks associated with the "resource curse", especially the disruptive political economy dynamics
that normally accompany resource extraction and management in general, and discretionary
budgetary spending in particular.

82.     These risks are high in Mongolia, given the weaknesses in the public investment planning
and management system exposed by the recent boom and bust cycle. As recognized in a recent
government audit report, investment planning is characterized by weak strategic planning, weak
links between the national and sector strategies, ad-hoc and politically-driven project selection
processes, lack of adequate screening of projects through sound economic rate of return analysis
and feasibility studies, unrealistic costing of projects that results in considerable implementation
delays, and a failure to operate and maintain assets effectively. These problems have resulted in a
low allocative and operational efficiency of investment. Numerous low priority projects are
approved, very little attention is paid to capital repair and maintenance, and there is limited
project appraisal. For example, in the roads sector, the emphasis is on building an extensive road
network connecting remote parts of the country ­ the Millennium Road linking the east with the
west being a prime example ­ that would attract insufficient traffic to justify the costs rather than
on Ulaanbaatar's roads that are in major need of rehabilitation. Similarly, in the electricity
                                                  30
sector, the Parliament has emphasized the electrification of remote soum (county) centers,
allocating MNT 83 billion to this in 2007, at the cost of maintaining and rehabilitating the
existing infrastructure. Furthermore, these upstream problems translate into time and cost
overruns during implementation.

                         Figure 7. Capital expenditures have expanded rapidly




83.      Weaknesses in the regulatory and institutional system for investment planning are at the
heart of these problems. The existing budget legal framework, specified in the Public Sector
Management and Finance Law (2003) and the General Budget Law (1992), is not well suited to
Mongolia's needs and deviates significantly from international best practice, including failing to
specify the need for a fully comprehensive budget, inadequate delineation of responsibilities and
authorities between the executive and the legislature, and a lack of attention to modalities and
requirements for public investment planning. The framework gives Parliament considerable
discretion in amending the budget, allowing it to increase appropriations without being bound by
the fiscal limits established in the Medium Term Fiscal Framework. Parliament used this
discretion during the copper boom years to significantly increase the size of the Public
Investment Plans (PIPs) submitted by the executive during the annual budget preparation, as
shown in Figure 8. In 2008, for example, the Parliament increased the PIP approved by the
cabinet from MNT 442 billion to MNT 571 billion, replacing and adding numerous projects to
the portfolio. The 2010 PIP was also significantly altered, as detailed below, with numerous
projects added and, in a departure from the past, a large portfolio of projects shifted from budget
funding to financing by construction companies on a reimbursement basis, with the contingent
liabilities not reflected in the capital budget. Parliament's preference in general has been for
smaller projects -- an average allocation per project of MNT 540 million for `building and
construction' compared to MNT 625 million in the cabinet submitted PIP for 2008.

84.     The Government is attempting to strengthen the legal framework for budgeting. The new
draft Integrated Budget Law lays out a new process of budget management, with one of the key
elements being to clarify the roles and responsibilities between government and Parliament in the
budget process, and outlines a certification process for including projects in the public
investment plan. Specifically, the draft law aims to limit parliamentary discretion by:
(a) requiring that the approved budget adhere to the aggregate limits set by the Medium Term
Fiscal Framework (with these limits in turn derived from the fiscal rules established by the Fiscal
Stability Law); (b) by requiring that all project proposals submitted by line ministries have
feasibility studies; and (c) requiring that there be a central mechanism for evaluating and
                                                 31
selecting proposed projects based on whether or not the proposed project meets a strategic need,
and is backed up by the appropriate technical and economic analysis.

85.     The first DPC approved in June 2009 focused on this key area of improved project
selection as demonstrated by a prior action for the removal of MNT 20 billion worth of projects
without feasibility studies from the 2009 PIP.11 As detailed in the ICR for the first DPC, the
March budget revision excluded 34 of these projects, valued at MNT 22.3 billion, i.e., went
beyond the prior action. In the July 2009 budget revision 3 additional such projects (totaling
MNT 6 billion) were added, leaving 5 projects valued at MNT 34 billion without feasibility
studies in the budget.

86.     The Government tried to abide by this principle of requiring all projects to have
feasibility studies for the 2010 budget--in the PIP of MNT 452 billion submitted to Parliament
only 4 projects, amounting to less than MNT 8 billion, were without feasibility studies. However,
as in the past, Parliament significantly amended the submitted PIP by adding numerous new
projects; many were without appropriate feasibility studies. In the end, the 2010 budget
contained 204 projects (valued at MNT 42 billion) without the proper feasibility studies.
Furthermore, in a negative new development, the financing of a large portfolio of projects
(mostly in the roads, construction and energy sectors) was transferred from the budget to
construction companies, with the companies to be reimbursed upon staged completion as per a
specified schedule. The important implication of this financing arrangement was that
approximately MNT 160 billion of reimbursement was anticipated in 2010, which was not
accounted for in the 2010 budget.

87.     The amended budget raised considerable concern amongst several key policy-makers.
The President vetoed the budget, and while Parliament rejected the veto, several parliamentarians
called for an audit of the public investment planning process by the Mongolia National Audit

11
 The precise requirement for documentation contained in "feasibility studies" for project proposals is specified in
Ministry of Finance Decree 48 of 2008, and consists of technical drawings, land licenses, and basic cost estimates.
                                                                 32
Office. After receiving the results of the audit, the Speaker of the Parliament requested the
Ministry of Finance to amend the budget and to remove projects that do not meet national
priorities and are without the necessary feasibilities.

88.     The DPC2 supported these efforts to rationalize the capital budget, and these efforts were
effective. The amended budget approved in July significantly improved the public investment
plan by bringing on-budget all of the projects that were to be financed by construction companies
and that were formally unfunded in 2010, and accounting for the future liabilities of such
projects. It also eliminated some projects that were considered low priority, and conducted
feasibility studies on some of the projects that were lacking them.

89.     The key structural requirement is the limitation of parliamentary discretion and the
establishment of a robust central mechanism for screening projects to enter the PIP. The Fiscal
Stability Law attempts to discipline the budgetary process with regards to the fiscal aggregates;
the draft Integrated Budget Law attempts to establish a sound procedure for selecting projects
into a multi-year public investment plan, and into the capital budget for a given year. These
regulatory reforms have to be complemented with more guidance to portfolio ministries on what
technical, economic, and financial analysis needs to accompany project submissions, as currently
this documentation is very weak even for projects that do nominally have feasibility studies.

90.     The Government has been grossly under-spending on capital maintenance and repair.
Due to years of neglect, the state of disrepair in the energy and roads sectors is approaching crisis
proportions. The electricity sector has immediate capital repair needs estimated at MNT 170-180
billion; and 60 percent of the national paved road network is in poor condition and in need of
capital repair and rehabilitation, at an estimated cost of MNT 730 billion. As against these large
needs capital repair spending increased very little in nominal terms during the boom years, as
compared to expenditures on transfers, wages and salaries, and domestic investment, and
declined as a percentage of new investments (Figure 9, from 10 percent in 2003 to 5.5 percent in
2009) and of estimated public capital stock (from 4 percent in 2003 to below 2 percent in 2008).

91.     The DPC series has attempted to focus the Government's attention on this problem by
including prior actions on increased budget allocations for capital repairs and maintenance. The
first DPC aimed to address this issue by protecting the budgetary allocation for repairs from the
overall expenditure cuts in response to the crisis. Specifically, the prior action required
maintaining the allocation of funds for capital repairs at MNT 12.4 billion in the March revision
of the 2009 budget (excluding the Road Fund). The outcome indicator, reviewed in the ICR, was
that this budgeted value was largely realized in the 2009 budget outturn--the outturn value was
MNT 11.6 billion. The DPC 2 prior action required continued prioritization of capital repairs by
increasing the ratio of capital repairs to new investments from 6.1 percent in 2009 budget to
6.5 percent in the 2010 budget with an allocation of MNT 28.2 billion (including the Road
Fund). This action has been surpassed, with the July 2010 amended budget allocating
MNT 37.8 billion to capital repairs (including the Road Fund) and increasing the ratio of capital
repairs to new investments to 7.4 percent.

92.     Part of the reason for this asymmetry between new investments and maintenance is the
failure to formally determine the recurrent cost obligations of capital investments. The Bank is
providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance and the NDIC to address this weakness
in the planning and budgeting process.

93.      DPC2 prior actions

         Prior Action: The Recipient has amended the FY2010 Budget to:

            improve the public investment plan by reducing by 197 (amounting to 40 billion
            Tugrik) the number of projects that: (a) do not have the necessary feasibility studies
            (technical drawings and accurate cost estimates); and (b) do not meet national
            priorities; and
            account for the contingent liabilities from contractor-funded projects by specifying
            these in the Amended FY2010 Budget.
            Prior Action: The Recipient has prioritized the level of capital expenditures for
            maintenance of basic infrastructure (including the Road Fund), as evidenced by:
            (i) the increase in the ratio of capital repairs to new investments from 6.1 percent (in
            the FY2009 Revised Budget) to 6.5 percent (in the FY2010 Budget); and (ii) the
            allocation of 28.2 billion Tugrik therefore.
Expected results

94.     The first prior action will provide further support for improvements in the project
selection of the PIP and address concerns arising from the proposal to move financing of certain
projects from the budget to construction companies. The second prior action supports an
increased allocation for maintenance, and also aims to lay the groundwork for establishing better
guidelines for estimating the backlog and recurrent cost needs of capital investments for the key
infrastructure sectors.

                                                       34
95.     These measures will be complemented with continuous capacity building and technical
assistance. The Bank is providing on-going support in the Governance Assistance Project (GAP)
and the Economic Capacity and Technical Assistance Project (ECTAC). The ECTAC project
funds have been reallocated to be better synchronized with the DPC2 actions, and with the
requirements imposed by the economic crisis. The new multi-sectoral TA project is also focused
on these reform areas. The Bank has been very effectively coordinating technical assistance with
the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF.

B. Social Protection
Challenges

96.     The recent economic downturn highlighted the need for the country both to: (i) better
protect the poor, and (ii) improve the fiscal sustainability of its Social Welfare system. In 2009
there were 66 welfare-related transfer programs implemented by the Mongolian Ministry of
Social Welfare and Labor (MoSWL). Budgeted expenditures for social welfare programs in 2009
were MNT 266 billion, the equivalent of 11.5 percent of the government's budget and
4.3 percent of GDP in the same year.12 This level of spending is high by regional standards and
relative to countries with comparable levels of per capita GDP.13 Most of these transfers are
oriented to families or children, or are targeted categorically to groups regarded as vulnerable,
such as the elderly and disabled. Mongolia does not currently implement any transfer programs
specifically targeted to poor households. However, the implementation of the poverty-targeted
benefit (PTB) is envisaged by the new Social Welfare Law that is expected to be considered by
the Parliament of Mongolia during the fall of 2010.

97.     A number of recent analyses have highlighted the fact that well-targeted programs can
serve to protect the poor better at lower, more sustainable budgetary costs than universal
programs. 14 Indeed, simulation analysis suggests that a new poverty-targeted benefit would
increase per capita consumption among the poor and reduce poverty in Mongolia more at
significantly lower cost than Mongolia's largest universal transfer program, the Child Money
Program (CMP). Specifically, analysis of the impacts of the CMP, using the 2007/08 household
survey, the HIES/LSMS indicates that the CMP served to reduce the poverty headcount by
4.1 percentage points compared to a situation without the CMP. A poverty-targeted benefit
could reduce the headcount by between 6.6 and 8.2 percentage points for less than two-thirds of
the fiscal cost of CMP.15 The same simulation analyses indicate that the CMP served to raise per
capita consumption among the poor by 6.7 percent, as opposed to between 14.2 and 17.8 percent
under the poverty-targeted benefit.

98.       To facilitate better protection of the poor and improved fiscal sustainability, DPC1
supported efforts to target transformation of the CMP from a universal to targeted program. The
prior action under the first DPC was for the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MoSWL) to

prepare a time-bound plan to clean up the roster of beneficiaries of the Child Money Program
(CMP), which represented a first move towards reform of Mongolia's social welfare system.
Given the short time period since the completion of the first DPC, and the technical challenges
associated with designing and implementing a comprehensive social welfare reform, the outcome
indicator for social protection under DPC1--to collect at least 75 percent of the household-level
data needed to establish a national beneficiary database, based on a proxy-means test formula--
is unlikely to be met by October 2010. Progress toward achieving this outcome indicator was
slower than expected for three main reasons. First, the capacity of the MoSWL to draw up new
social welfare reform legislation which would consolidate the plethora of existing grants and
define a new targeted benefit was insufficient to meet the tight deadlines under the initial IMF
conditionality. Second, in their commitment to respond quickly and forcefully to the crisis, the
government and the donor community underestimated the challenges associated with designing
and implementing a poverty-targeted benefit, including the development of a poverty-targeting
system. Third, developing the domestic political consensus on the manner in which the existing
grants would be phased out, and a new system would be phased in, took longer than expected.
The introduction of the PTB cannot proceed without the ratification of the Social Welfare Law
by the Parliament.

99.     However, important efforts and progress towards reform have been made which have
culminated in a plan for more comprehensive reform and restructuring of Mongolia's system of
social transfers. The plan benefited from technical support from the World Bank and Asian
Development Bank (ADB). The proposed reform consists of three main components:

     (i)   Consolidation, rationalization, and simplification of the system of social transfers;

 (ii)      Establishment of a new targeting mechanism for identifying the poor, based on a proxy
           means test (PMT); and

(iii)      Introduction of a new benefit/transfer, targeted exclusively to poor households.

100. The details of this reform proposal have been debated within the Mongolian cabinet and,
in early November, 2009, the Government agreed with the IMF and the ADB to submit the
proposal to Parliament during the Fall Session of Parliament, with the aim of passing it in the
Fall 2009 Session. Although this has been delayed now to the Fall 2010 Session, if passed into
legislation, the consolidation is expected to generate from MNT 60-80 billion in budgetary
savings per year beginning in 2011, a share of which will be used for the new poverty-targeted
benefit.16 The result will be a social welfare system that is more effective in protecting the poor
as well as more fiscally sustainable.

101. There have been a number of additional important developments related to social welfare
in Mongolia. On November 19, 2009, Parliament passed a Law for the creation of a new fund,
the Human Development Fund (HDF). The HDF, created as a result of recent electoral campaign
promises by both main political parties, has been established to distribute Mongolia's mineral
wealth to the country's citizens. According to this Law, resources from the HDF can be used for

16
  The exact level of budgetary savings per year will depend on the design of the poverty-targeted benefit, including
the size of the benefit and the eligibility threshold for the transfer. The Government of Mongolia requested World
Bank technical support in designing this benefit.
                                                        36
four types of benefits: (i) payments for pension and health insurance premiums; (ii) payments for
the purchase of housing; (iii) cash benefits; and (iv) payments for education and health services.
The Parliament subsequently approved the Budget Law for 2010, as a result of which 3 of the
66 existing welfare programs ­ the CMP, the Newlywed benefit, and the Newborn benefit ­ will
receive zero budget allocations in 2010, and are thus effectively eliminated. At the same time, a
new universal cash benefit was established that will be funded from the HDF. The value of the
budget allocation is equivalent to about 120,000 MNT per Mongolian citizen.17 The payment of
this cash benefit has been on track in 2010, with monthly payments of 10,000 MNT per citizen
per month envisaged for the rest of 2010 starting in August (70,000 MNT per citizen was
distributed in February). According to unofficial exchanges with the MoSWL, these
developments will not affect the government's overall plans to consolidate and reform the social
welfare system. The ministry still intends to transform the focus of the welfare system towards
poverty reduction, by introducing poverty targeting for some of the existing categorical benefits,
and by introducing a new poverty-targeted benefit.

102. Efforts to develop the new poverty targeting mechanism envisioned as part of the reform
(component 3, above) have already begun, with the support of the World Bank and the ADB (as
part of their Food Stamps Program). For example, a formula for the PMT developed with World
Bank and ADB assistance has been adopted formally by the National Statistical Office of
Mongolia as the official targeting formula in early 2010. Work has also already begun on field
testing of the PMT questionnaire, with piloting of the PMT data collection being rolled out
during 2010.

103. The challenges to successful implementation of the reforms are significant and include
the following:

        Developing the domestic political consensus on how best to reform the social welfare
        system has taken longer than originally expected; differences exist between the main
        political parties (coalition partners), and the reform process is facing political challenges
        once the reform law has been submitted to the Parliament; and

        The government has little experience with poverty-targeted programs, and currently lacks
        the technical and institutional capacity to carry out a comprehensive, poverty-focused
        social welfare reform without external support.

104. The DPC2 ­ along with a multi-sectoral technical assistance operation that was
developed in parallel and approved in June ­ is therefore being designed to support the
commitment to reform and to provide the policy and implementation-related support necessary to
ensure successful implementation of Mongolia's social welfare reform. These World Bank
operations are designed and implemented in close coordination with the IMF program and, with
technical assistance being provided by the ADB, will address all key areas of the social welfare
reform, as outlined below.

Key measures in the area of social protection to be supported by DPC2

17
   At the time of drafting this proposal, the World Bank did not have information as to whether this benefit will be
distributed monthly or through a single yearly payment, nor as to what the Government's plans will be for this
transfer beyond 2010. 
                                                        37
105. The DPC2 and the proposed technical assistance component for social protection of the
multi-sectoral TA project, will provide support to the further development and implementation of
the government of Mongolia's proposed social welfare reform in the following areas:
(i) consolidating the existing social transfer programs, (ii) establishing a Proxy Means Test
targeting system, and (iii) creating and implementing a poverty-targeted benefit.

     (i)   Consolidating the existing social transfer programs

106. The DPC2 will support the government in improving the efficiency and fiscal
sustainability of the country's system of social transfers through the consolidation,
rationalization, and simplification of its system of social transfers. Recent analysis of social
protection in Mongolia noted that the country's safety net programs would benefit from
consolidation of its multiplicity of programs, for reasons related to system's efficiency, fiscal
sustainability, and impact on poverty. 18

 (ii)      Establishing a Proxy Means Test targeting system

107. The DPC2 will support the piloting, rolling out, implementation, and evaluation of the
PMT targeting system. Development of the PMT formula and methodology has already been
carried out.19 Piloting of the system has started in June 2010 as part of the ADB/MoSWL Food
Stamps Program. The national roll-out of the system will start later in 2010.

(iii)      Creating and implementing a poverty-targeted benefit

108. The DPC2 will also support the design and implementation of the centerpiece of the
reformed social welfare system, the (possibly conditional) cash benefit targeted to poor
households. Specific activities to be supported by DPC2, in conjunction with the recently
approved World Bank Multi-sectoral Technical Assistance operation, include: design of the
benefit (e.g., size of the transfer, eligibility cut-off, per capita vs. per household benefit, etc.),
development of program guidelines, operational manuals, and governance/administrative
structure.

Cross cutting issues related to the Social Welfare reform to be supported by the DPC2

           Development and management of beneficiary database: This includes assistance to the
           development of a beneficiary database that would underpin the reformed social welfare
           system, as well as protocols for the management of the database, linkages between the
           beneficiary database and payment data, periodic assessments of data quality to improve
           its accuracy, linkages between the beneficiary database for the poverty-targeted benefit
           and existing beneficiary data under the Labor and Social Welfare Service Office
           (LSWSO), among other things.

           Design and implementation of a grievance and appeals mechanism for the social welfare
           system, including information and communication campaigns: This involves support to

       efforts to: (a) provide information to the beneficiaries on their rights and responsibilities,
       (b) establish formal mechanisms to review cases where targeting errors could have
       occurred, and (c) establish a transparent system of accountability for the system of social
       transfers.

       Strengthening of the institutional and governance structures within the MoSWL: This
       includes support in strengthening governance structures and institutional aspects (staffing,
       organization, etc) of MoSWL and LSWSO, to ensure that the agencies are effective in
       carrying out their mandates.

       Monitoring and evaluation:

       ·   Program monitoring: This involves support to the design and implementation of a
           periodic monitoring system for reformed social welfare system.

       ·   Impact evaluation: This includes support for an evaluation of the impacts of the
           reformed system on poverty and other human development outcomes.

       Capacity building: This involves support to a range of training and capacity building
       activities that will be important to ensuring that the government officials responsible for
       implementing the reform understand the new system and have the skills to carry out their
       responsibilities adequately.

       The National Statistical Office has approved the Proxy Means Test methodology as the
       official targeting mechanism for the provision of social welfare benefits in Mongolia.
       The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MoSWL) has completed a proposal defining
       the parameters of the new poverty-targeted benefit program, and has submitted said
       proposal to the Cabinet for approval.

Expected results

109. The expected result of the reform is to lay the foundation for a more efficient, cost-
effective social welfare system in Mongolia that better protects the poor and is more fiscally
sustainable. This will mean a more streamlined and rational system of social transfers, which
targets the poor. The reformed system will be more coherent in terms of its design and structure
and more effective in protecting the poor at a lower cost to the government budget.

110. In the medium term, success of the reformed social welfare system will depend on efforts
to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity of the government in implementing
programs, particularly the poverty-targeted benefit. A key factor in understanding the
effectiveness of the reformed system will be the development of a system for monitoring and
evaluating its impacts, including the efficacy of the new grievance, appeals, and accountability
mechanisms. All of these elements are envisioned under the reform program, as currently
designed; they are also areas of planned support under the DPC2 and associated technical
assistance operation.

C. Financial Sector
Challenges

111. Two medium-sized banks have failed since the onset of the economic downturn in the
second half of 2008. While there had been lack of action to address problems identified through
supervision, the two banks were largely brought down by what was not reported or captured by
supervisors, such as insider and connected party lending and abnormally huge off-balance-sheet
exposures. These problems are by no means confined to the two failed banks. Various reviews
and analysis have identified significant system weaknesses such as limited capacity for financial
system oversight and enforcement, poor financial accounting and reporting, inadequate risk
management, and weak corporate governance and internal controls. Non-performing loans
(NPLs), which had been below 3 percent for the banking system until mid-2008, peaked at
around 25 percent in November 2009. NPL ratios have since fallen back, but at slightly less than
20 percent by the end of the second quarter of 2010 are still extremely high. All these underlying
vulnerabilities point to the potential for more bank failures in the event that the economic
situation deteriorates.

112. The first and foremost challenge to the BoM is to assess accurately the financial
condition of individual banks, in order to better plan the supervisory action. To this end, the
BoM, with the help of technical assistance from the World Bank, commissioned three
internationally reputable auditing firms to carry out in depth diagnostics of three groups of
banks. These banks are either systemically important or have close business connections with the
systemically important banks.

113. Based on the results of diagnostic assessments and its own on-site examinations, the BoM
will prepare time-bound supervisory action plans for banks of special concern, listing the steps
needed to reach compliance with prudential norms stipulated in the recently amended Law on
Banks. The key part of the supervisory action plan would be the estimated amount of additional
capital needed for continued bank operations. In each case, agreement will be sought from bank
management and shareholders to undertake necessary corrective action. The failure to bring in
the required capital from private sources within a specified timeframe would provide grounds to
the BoM for requesting a state-led recapitalization of systemic banks on a case-by-case basis,
and for resolute supervisory action against smaller banks, resulting in their merger, takeover by
another bank, or liquidation

114. As detailed in the DPC1 ICR, past performance on outcome indicators for banking sector
reform was relatively weak, particularly as regards the actions related to bank resolution. The
reasons for the weaknesses lie predominantly in the political sensitivity surrounding bank
restructuring process, and the de facto necessity for central bank management to consult with the
senior political leadership on the proposed actions. The key challenge for the authorities going
forward is how to ensure the prompt and systematic enforcement of prudential norms for all
banks, notwithstanding the vested interests present in the sector. The newly amended Law on
Banks provides the BoM with enhanced authority and instruments to pursue this task, including a
broad range of sanctions and resolution options for non-compliant banks.

115. Based on the results of diagnostic assessments and its own on-site examinations, the BoM
will prepare time-bound supervisory action plans for banks of special concern, listing the steps

                                               40
needed to reach compliance with prudential norms stipulated in the recently amended Law on
Banks. The key part of the supervisory action plan would be the estimated amount of additional
capital needed for continued bank operations. In each case, agreement will be sought from bank
management and shareholders to undertake necessary corrective action. The failure to bring in
the required capital from private sources within a specified timeframe would provide grounds to
the BoM for requesting a state-led recapitalization of systemic banks on a case-by-case basis,
and for resolute supervisory action against smaller banks, resulting in their merger, takeover by
another bank, or liquidation.

116. To ensure broad political support for implementing the sector-wide bank restructuring
strategy, the BoM prepared the Bank Capacity Strengthening and Capital Support Program,
which has been submitted for Parliament's approval in August 2010. This document states the
objectives, guiding principles, and timing of the strategy, with particular attention given to the
mechanism by which the state may provide temporary capital support to problem banks that are
unable to reach compliance relying solely on private investment. It is important to note that,
while the Bank team fully supports the implementation of sector-wide restructuring strategy, it
believes that the effectiveness of the Program could be strengthened by incorporating a number
of lessons from international experience. Specifically, the team has recommended to the
authorities to: (i) limit the availability of state capital support to large, systemically important
banks; (ii) ensure thorough overhaul of corporate governance of banks benefiting from state
support; and (iii) make contingency plans for intervening in systemically important institutions
whose existing shareholders are not capable of mobilizing the required additional capital. As
agreed with the BoM and the MoF, the Bank team will work with the authorities on addressing
these issues with the help of the recently approved Multi-Sector TA Credit, as well as in the
context of the next round of policy-based lending.

117. In the medium run, the authorities would need to carefully replace the blanket guarantee
for bank deposits with limited coverage scheme. While the introduction of blanket guarantee in
late 2008 helped to restore public confidence in the system, its generous scope represents a
substantial contingent fiscal liability and creates moral hazard. The Government has already
started to address the problem by excluding interbank deposits from coverage and charging
banks with a fee for the insured deposits. The next challenge would be deciding on a model of
limited deposit insurance scheme appropriate for Mongolia, given the size and structure of the
country's banking system, and the financial and human resources available for creation of a new
agency. The transition should take into account the macroeconomic situation and stability of the
banking sector at the given moment, and be accompanied by a well-coordination public relations
campaign informing the public about the planned change.

Key measures to be supported by DPC2

118. DPC2 supports the completion of the special diagnostic assessments commissioned by
BoM, which would enable the latter to understand better the financial position and performance
of systemically important banks in order to undertake appropriate supervisory action. In addition,
DPC2 supports the preparation of a comprehensive bank restructuring strategy to address the
problem at individual banks as revealed by the diagnostic assessments. The strategy would set
the principles and timetable for preparation and execution of bank specific restructuring plans. It
will also reconfirm the supervisory and resolution powers already at the BoM's disposal, and

                                                41
describe the terms and conditions for potential participation by the state in bank recapitalization,
as a last resort tool.

DPC2 prior actions

       The BoM has: (i) completed a special banks assessment of seven (7) selected banks; and
       (ii) commenced a similar assessment of another three (3) selected banks, with the
       assistance of internationally reputable auditors.

       BoM has adopted and submitted to the Parliament a comprehensive bank restructuring
       strategy, which includes, as a last resort tool, a stand-by bank recapitalization facility
       with proper covenants to protect the public funds.

Expected results

119. The special diagnostic assessments would provide insights into the banks' quality of
assets, quality of earnings, interest rate and foreign exchange risk exposures, and liquidity
positions. This information will help the BoM to determine more accurately the capital position
of individual banks. Adoption and resolute implementation of a comprehensive bank
restructuring strategy will ensure compliance with prudential norms and strengthen corporate
governance in Mongolia's banks. This in turn would make the banking system more resilient to
future internal and external shocks.

D. Mining Sector
Challenges
120. Mongolia made significant progress in mining sector reform and development during
2009 with the signing of a large, world-class mining project agreement: the Oyu Tolgoi
Investment Agreement with Ivanhoe Mines and Rio Tinto. In the process leading up to the
signing of the agreement on October 6, 2009, a number of policy issues were clarified and
certain disincentives to investment were removed. Most importantly, the Windfall Profits Tax
was repealed with effect from January 2011. Its introduction, together with new requirements on
state equity participation, had caused a precipitous drop in the applications for, and granting of,
new mining and exploration licenses (Figure 10).

121. Three other positive changes to legislation were also made, liberalizing the policy
environment and making it possible for the private sector to develop certain types of
infrastructure formerly reserved for the State. These include changes to the Law on Roads to
permit private sector construction and management of certain roads, amendments to the Law on
Water to provide for private sector water resource extraction and management of water supply
infrastructure, and a change to the Income Tax Law, improving the loss-carry-forward provisions
and making them more consistent with international practice.

122. The adoption of the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement as the draft standard agreement
upon which future projects will be negotiated was a significant step, providing more clarity for
future developers of mines on strategic deposits. This adoption was a prior action under the first
DPC.

123. However, at the same time, some other measures were also introduced which would act
as disincentives to new exploration and mine development. In addition, forward movement on
important regulatory developments has been slow.

124. Immediately prior to the completion of negotiations for the Oyu Tolgoi investment
agreement, the government introduced an amendment to the VAT Law which excludes exports
of raw unprocessed mineral products from being able to claim VAT refunds for the VAT paid on
the inputs used for these mineral products. In most countries where VAT is applied, exported
products are zero rated for VAT, and this includes mineral exports. The exemption of mineral
exports for VAT refunds constitutes a significant increase in operating costs to miners and
reduces profitability. Increases in operating costs result in changes to mine development
strategies and cut-off grades which shorten mine life and ultimately reduce resource utilization,
increasing wastage of non-renewable resources. Higher operating costs also reduce the rate of
return for marginal projects preventing them from being exploited and will thus reduce the
expected number of new mine developments.

125. The mineral sector also continues to suffer from a number of other uncertainties,
including a less-than-transparent application of the law as a result of the absence of necessary

                                                         43
regulations. In particular, the management of mineral licensing has led to allegations of corrupt
practice in license allocation in the past. Licenses were processed following a series of ad-hoc
internal instructions, potentially placing companies in breach of conditions that did not exist on
the grant of their license. Hence need to formally adopt regulations which define due process and
provide certainty and accountability for both the investor as well as the government. The
Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy has prepared such regulations with technical
assistance provided by the Bank. Associated with the passing of regulations the Ministry is now
implementing a fully computerized mineral licensing management system.

126. The regulatory reform agenda also includes introducing more transparency to the
issuance of mining licenses. The new Mineral Law of 2006 provides that land which has been
under license, or any other area which contains a known mineral deposit, may be offered under a
public tender by the government. However, regulations for the tendering process have been
prepared but not yet passed. Completion of the tender regulations is essential to encourage new
exploration investment.

127. The Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement has worked to clarify certain issues surrounding
state participation in the mining sector. This is particularly so for projects which have been
discovered and explored using private sector resources. However, the next major mining project
to be negotiated is the Tavan Tolgoi coal deposit, which was discovered by state-funded
exploration during the socialist era. In that case, the Mineral Law mandates a state participation
of at least 50 percent. The OT agreement clarified arrangements for a carried interest to be
provided to the government for a 34 percent share. However, the details of the arrangements as
to how the state interest will be funded in a project such as Tavan Tolgoi are yet to be finalized.20
In preparation for the first investment agreement for a deposit discovered with state-funded
exploration, a number of further modifications will be required to the current draft standard
investment agreement. In this regard, the government is currently examining the potential of
utilizing a contract mining operating agreement similar to that used in Indonesia.

128. In the medium-term, there is also a need for a systematic review of taxation instruments
in order to design a system that is reasonably competitive to ensure ongoing investment, whilst at
the same time is responsive to the cyclical nature of commodity markets and which captures
higher levels of revenue during elevated periods of commodity prices. For instance, the Income
Tax Law has no specific division or sections dealing with mining taxation and the sector is
treated the same as any other industrial operation. This creates significant areas of ambiguity and
has resulted in frequent court challenges by mining companies to tax assessments by the General
Department of National Taxation (GDNT). The mining sector has certain unique characteristics,
e.g., depreciation arrangements, treatment of social, infrastructure, environmental, and
rehabilitation costs, which are unique to the sector. Development of a more appropriate policy
framework, followed by drafting and enactment of a division in the Income Tax Act dealing with
mining sector related issues, will likely be necessary. The Mining TA project working along
with the IMF and US Treasury Department's Office of Technical Assistance are actively


20
   The government negotiated arrangements for the OT project where the stake is funded and carried by the
developer and paid for out of future dividends. Having a 34 percent interest carried by the investor may be
acceptable to large multinational companies with large balance sheets. However, the risk of providing a carried
interest of 50 percent or more would be much harder to accommodate by the private sector.
                                                      44
engaged in providing a program of technical assistance to the GDNT to support the development
of both the legal framework and mining sector specific audit capacity.

129. Mongolia has a large informal mining sector characterized by illegal artisanal and small-
scale mining by individuals and groups, locally referred to as "ninja miners". It is estimated that
there are currently approximately 60,000 such miners extracting a range of commodities from
gold to coal and fluorspar with an annual production value estimated at US$140 million. The
sector directly or indirectly contributes to the livelihoods of an estimated 10 percent of the
population of Mongolia. The miners typically use mercury and/or cyanide for gold extraction and
occasionally use explosives under often hazardous conditions, all of which is illegal.
Formalization of the sector has been made impossible due to the absence of appropriate
legislation to regulate their activities. The inability to formalize and regulate the sector has
perpetuated environmental damage and leaves a significant sector outside the formal economy
and unable to be legitimately reached with education and training programs supporting better
mining and environmental practice. The government recently passed a regulation as a first step
towards formalization of the sector. It now needs to move forward plans for the passage of a
Small-Scale Mining Law.

130. Mongolia has continued to make significant progress in the implementation of the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Mongolia has now prepared and
disseminated three reconciliation reports for the period 2006-2008 fiscal years and is well
advanced in preparing the fourth report for 2009. The next step in Mongolia's implementation of
EITI is to complete a validation audit of its processes and actions in order for the country to be
classified as an "EITI-compliant" country by the International EITI Board. This required
completion of an independent assessment by March 10, 2010, of Mongolia's EITI-related
activities, which certifies that the process includes a truly multi-stakeholder process that includes
civil society in monitoring the transparency of payments between mining companies and the
various levels of government. The transfer of sufficient resources to the Mongolian EITI
Secretariat in order to finance an independent validation of its national EITI Program was the
second prior action in the mining sector in the first DPC. The validation process is well advanced
with Mongolia being declared as "near compliant" by the EITI Board in April 2010. Some
additional steps were required by the local secretariat in order to achieve full compliance and
were given 6 months by the Board to complete these steps. Mongolia has completed the
additional validation steps required by the EITI Board. The Board conducted a review mission
to Ulaanbaatar in mid September to confirm compliance. It is anticipated that Mongolia will be
declared fully compliant at the EITI Board Meeting to be held in Dar es Salaam on 19-20
October 2010.

131. Finally, Mongolia is increasingly recognizing the important role that civil society can
have in the sustainable management of natural resources. For example, in 2005 the Amendments
to the Environmental Protection Law gave local people the right to use and possess natural
resources in specific areas and benefit from their use but at the same time gave them the
obligation to protect them. The Ministry of Nature, Environment and Tourism (MNET) regularly
gathers civil society groups to help inform and advise them on environmental matters including
the impacts of mining. One of the key steps to be taken to improve transparency and allow for
more public participation and monitoring of mining investments (and other projects with an
environmental impact) is the publication of environmental impact assessments on the internet.

                                                 45
Key measures to be supported by DPC2

132. The government has stated its commitment to effectively, transparently, and sustainably
manage its mining sector development. In order to achieve this goal there were a number of high
priority, quick-win actions to be taken:

   (a) Adopting Cadastre (Licensing) regulations that are compatible with international good
       practice, that are either passed by the Minister and endorsed by the Ministry of Justice,
       and that clearly define due process with respect to the grant (including tendering
       procedures), management, transfer, surrender, and cancellation of mineral licenses.

   (b) Completing the EITI validation process for Mongolia to become recognized as an EITI-
       compliant country by the International EITI Board.

   (c) Making environmental impact assessments for mining projects available online as a
       means to develop transparency and meaningful participation.

133.   Other key reforms to be implemented over the medium-term include:

   (d) Reviewing the appropriate legislative framework for the application and management of
       mining taxation that addresses the specific technical aspects unique to the sector;

   (e) Further clarifying the minerals law and its application in key areas such as state equity
       participation;

   (f) Improving regulations and guidelines for management of mining operations including
       reporting obligations, occupational health and safety and environmental performance,
       mine closure and rehabilitation to address biological, physical, economic and social
       aspects of mine closure as well as the development of fiscal arrangements relating to
       closure financial surety;

   (g) Supporting legislation and regulation to formalize and regulate the small scale mining
       sector in order to transform ninja miners into legitimate, regulated and environmentally
       sound operations;

   (h) Develop a regulatory framework for the mining, processing and marketing of uranium
       from private sector managed uranium mines. Such regulations should also include the
       development of specific environmental conditions and standards for any discharges of
       water and dust from the sites and the management of occupational standards to maintain
       human health; and

   (i) Amending the outmoded Law of Environmental Impact Assessment to include measures
       for increased and meaningful public participation, and then submitting the draft amended
       Law to Parliament.




                                              46
DPC2 prior actions

       The Recipient has revised the regulation on operations and processes of the Mining
       Cadastre.

       The Recipient has submitted the documentation required by the International EITI Board
       to assess the compliance of the Recipient's national EITI Program.

       The Recipient has placed online a searchable database of Environmental Impact
       Assessments for mining and other projects.

Expected results

134. The emerging medium-term strategy needs to build on the above short-term measures
with ongoing support from a Bank-financed Mining Sector Technical Assistance Project. The
overall objective would be to work towards further developing the mining law and policy, and
ensure, through effective monitoring and prudent regulation, that responsible mining practices
are followed in both large- and small-scale mining. New mining projects in new commodity
areas and on Strategic Deposits discovered with state-funded exploration would utilize a draft
model investment agreement as the basis for negotiations with investors. A more efficient and
transparent computerized mining cadastre system would be in operation, which would be
regulated according to an approved and transparent regulatory framework. A mining tax policy
statement would be developed and, on the basis of that policy, a new and relevant division of the
Income Tax Law would be developed and adopted to improve industry compliance with modern
mining sector taxation practice and to reduce tax disputes. Capacity to collect revenue would be
enhanced with advanced auditing skills. Mongolia will continue to implement and develop EITI
and become recognized as an EITI-compliant country. With better public access to EIAs and an
amended Environmental Impact Assessment law, transparency of mining operations will
increase, while the public will be in a stronger position to influence and monitor the adherence of
mining operations with agreed environmental action plans.

E. Focus for Medium-Term Policy Dialogue
135. As emphasized in the above sub-sections, the policy measures supported in each of the
sectors of this DPC2 operation are tightly linked to the respective medium-term reform agendas.
The overarching medium-term challenge is to manage future mineral revenues in a manner
which promotes sustainable and shared economic growth, helping to reduce poverty and improve
living standards throughout the population. In the fiscal sector, medium-term policy dialogue
will include further work on improvements in public investment planning, budgeting,
monitoring, and implementation. In light of the government's financing constraints, the high
level of required infrastructure investments associated with major new mining projects, such as
OT and TT, is likely to require a substantial expansion of public-private partnerships. The
costing and budgeting of the multi-year budget implications of such PPP projects will also be an
important area for future policy dialogue, along with similar considerations for the maintenance
requirements of new capital projects. In the social protection area, the focus of the medium-term
policy dialogue is likely to be on the implementation aspects of both the roll-out of the new
poverty benefit and of the consolidation of existing social transfer programs. In addition, in order
to improve understanding of the effectiveness of the government's social welfare reform
                                                47
supported in this DPC2, it will be important to develop a system for monitoring and evaluating
its impacts, including the efficacy of the new grievance, appeals, and accountability mechanisms.

136. The agenda for medium-term policy dialogue in the financial sector is considerable. In
particular, it includes a range of measures to facilitate the resolution of problem banks, for
example reviews of various related legislative acts, such as the Banking Law, Central Bank Law,
Corporate Law, Civil Code, Law on Foreclosure and Collateral. It will also include discussion of
the development and adoption of a strategy for transition from blanket guarantees to a limited
deposit insurance guarantee system. Other areas for dialogue include measures to improve
system stability and transparency, such as the strengthening of the BoM's technical and
enforcement capacity for banking regulation and supervision and the adoption of IAS/IFRS
compatible financial accounting and reporting regimes for the financial sector. In the mining
sector, as mentioned, the overall objective for the medium-term is to further develop the mining
law and policy and to promote responsible mining practices through effective monitoring and
regulation. Policy dialogue will therefore relate to, for example, the continued implementation
and development of EITI and the ongoing development of Draft Standard Investment
Agreements which further develop the concepts of responsible mining practices consistent with
the Equator principles, and the utilization of such agreements in all future major mining
investments in strategic deposits. It will also cover monitoring of the manner in which
Environmental Impact Assessment companies and government agencies input new information
into the new database.

VII.       PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

A. Poverty and Social Impact
137. The proposed DPC2 operation is expected to help protect the poor against chronic and
transient poverty, both of which are important issues in Mongolia. Preliminary World Bank
analysis finds that poverty in Mongolia has declined substantially from 2002/3 to 2007/8;
however, a third of Mongolians are still considered poor.21 Large differences in the poverty rate
exist across regions and population groups. Certain pockets of the population such as those in
rural areas and recent migrants to the urban areas are significantly poorer than average. In
addition, Mongolia has experienced a series of adverse shocks, such as high inflation in 2008, the
global economic crisis, and the recent harsh winter conditions (dzud). Particularly due to the
crisis, a lot fewer Mongolians were lifted out of poverty in 2009, and even some non-poor
Mongolians might have consequently fallen into poverty. While the policies supported under
social protection are most directly related to addressing current poverty, reforms in the other
policy areas supported by this operation are also expected to have a positive impact on poverty
reduction in the medium term.

Fiscal policy and management

138. The impact of the prior action on improving capital budget planning and screening is
likely to have positive long-term effects on poverty reduction. Appropriate management of future
revenues, and avoiding boom-bust cycles through fiscal reforms, in combination with an
effective safety net, are important to improving the poor's welfare in the future. A more rigorous

21
     Based on the NSO's 2007/8 poverty line, the national poverty headcount in 2007/8 is 35.2 percent.
                                                          48
selection mechanism, expected to be implemented as part of a government medium-term strategy,
should, in principle, also lead to selection of projects with a positive impact on poverty reduction
and distribution.

139. The prior action that protects capital expenditures with appropriate maintenance in the
transport, education, and health sectors, is pro-poor. The absence of this prior action could
contribute to a neglect of maintenance spending. This would likely have disproportionally
affected the poor, who are likely to live in more distant areas, are typically more dependent than
the non-poor on public services, and who spend a higher share of their income on transportation.

Financial sector

140. The prior actions that focus on further stabilizing the financial sector are also likely to
have positive (or at least neutral) effects on poverty reduction in the medium to long term.
Restoring the health of bank balance sheets and confidence in the sector is key to encouraging a
renewal of sustainable lending growth, which can support investment and growth and for the
continued deepening and development of the financial sector. Financial sector stability and
development augment the beneficial effects of growth on the poor and help reduce inequality.22
A stable financial system will help restore, and facilitate expansion of, reliable, safe, and
affordable financial services (savings, micro- and SME lending, insurance, etc.) to poor
households and remote areas.

Social protection

141. The prior actions that pertain to social protection specifically aim at better protecting the
poor. Adopting a targeting mechanism, as well as introducing a new poverty-targeted benefit,
will concentrate government spending on the most poor and vulnerable, thus maximizing the
effect of social welfare spending on poverty reduction, while making the welfare system more
fiscally sustainable.

142. The operation supports the development of a cash transfer program targeted to the poor,
and this income support should help provide for basic needs of the poorest families in Mongolia.
As noted above, Bank staff simulations using the 2007/8 household survey suggest that a new
poverty-targeted benefit is expected to increase the poor's per capita consumption by between
14.2 and 17.8 percent, and reduce the poverty headcount by between 6.6 and 8.2 percentage
points.23 If many poor households do not send children to school or seek health services due to
lack of resources, the provision of income support could have a positive impact on investment in
human capital, on human development outcomes, and on longer-term poverty reduction through
improved productivity of the next generation.




22
   For example, Beck at al. (2004) found that in countries with higher financial sector depth and development the
income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grows faster than average GDP per capita and income inequality
falls at a higher rate.
23
   Simulations are based on a monthly benefit of 7000 MNT per capita and a 3000 MNT top-up per child for the
poorest 30 percent of the population, consistent with the Government's proposal.
                                                       49
Mining sector

143. The prior actions pertaining to the mining sector are likely to have direct and indirect
positive impacts on poverty reduction. Adopting responsible mining practices will have long-
term positive impacts on those employed in mining and those living near mines. Moreover,
increased investment in the mining sector will lead to higher government revenues, which, in
principle, could support higher levels of sustainable and pro-poor public expenditures.

B. Environmental Aspects
144. The proposed second DPC is likely to have significant positive effects on the
environment and natural resources. From among the four focus areas of DPC2 (fiscal policy and
management, social protection, financial sector, and the mining sector), the mining sector is most
directly confronted by the challenge of sustainable environmental management. The proposed
DPC2 will have positive environmental impacts by providing a better informational base for
increasing the support for, and role of, public participation in decision-making regarding
development projects in general, and mining projects in particular, through the publication on the
internet of the new EIA database.

145. In addition, the Mining Sector Technical Assistance Project (running parallel to the
DPC2 over the period 2009-13) contains specific project components supporting the
development of environmental regulations governing the mining sector. These regulations focus
on the management of environmental and social impacts, mine reclamation and closure
conditionality. The project will assist with the development of environmental and occupational
health and safety regulations appropriate for effective sector management. Occupational health
and safety rules specific to both open-pit and underground mining conditions will also be
formulated and made effective. The mining TA project also includes aspects dealing with
financial surety for closure costs in the event of premature closure or mining company
bankruptcy. The regulations will be consistent with World Bank environmental and social
safeguard policies and the Equator Principles. The project also supports a review of the Minerals
Law to include provisions related to community consultation, and engagement of impacted
communities in decision-making processes. The TA project will also assist with defining the
discharge and reclamation standards. Finally, the project will build capacity within government
agencies to effectively implement the new regulations.

C. Fiduciary Aspects
146. There are moderate risks with respect to public financial management. Mongolia scores
above many other developing countries on a range of governance indicators and has made
significant progress in key areas (i.e. improved public financial management, new anti-
corruption legislation, published asset and income disclosures for top officials, and endorsement
of EITI principles). However, surveys and perception-based governance indicators suggest that
corruption and governance deterioration are growing concerns. For instance, firms single out
corruption as the single most severe investment-climate obstacle.

147. The 2009 World Bank Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review (PEFMR)
indicate that Mongolia has successfully implemented the "first generation" of core public
financial management reforms. However, much work is still needed and key challenges to policy
makers, future priorities, and suggested concrete ways to address them are further detailed in the
                                               50
PEFMR. Mongolia has successfully introduced an internally consistent legal framework,
established medium-term and annual budget planning frameworks and has made considerable
progress over the past five years in improving budget execution, monitoring, and reporting with
the establishment of a functional Treasury Single Account (TSA) framework and the
implementation of an integrated financial management information system. The Government
Financial Management Information System (GFMIS), which is connected to a payment
settlement system at BoM, has been deployed across the country. There is a real-time
reconciliation of the TSA between Treasury and BoM. GFMIS executes expenditure and revenue
transactions through the TSA and incorporates all the core internal checks and balances to ensure
that there is an undeletable audit trail for all expenditures. Budgets and General Ledger
accounting transactions are recorded in the GFMIS.

148. An updated IMF safeguards assessment of the BoM, conducted with respect to the
US$229 million SBA approved in April 2009, was finalized in June 2009. Previous safeguards
assessments were completed in March 2002 and November 2003. The 2009 assessment found
that the BoM had continued to improve its safeguards framework since the 2003 assessment.
The BoM's financial reporting and audit practices generally comply with international standards.
The assessment made recommendations to: (i) strengthen certain aspects of the BoM's oversight
mechanism, (ii) remove external audit qualifications caused by lack of access to central bank's
vaults, and (iii) improve the timeliness of audit completion and publication of the bank's
financial statements. The authorities have since confirmed that the auditors were granted access
to its vaults at end-2009, and the BoM has also committed to complete the 2009 audit by end-
April 2010. In addition, the Bank will be helping BoM to strengthen some of their oversight
mechanisms as part of the US$12 million equivalent Multi-Sectoral Technical Assistance Project
that will be implemented in fiscal 2011.

D. Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation
149. The Ministry of Finance will be the main implementing agency. Existing Bank TA
projects are being restructured to improve its economic monitoring system in order to be able to
obtain more timely feedback on policy performance. In parallel to DPC2, the World Bank board
Board approved a multi-sector TA project in June which is specifically designed to support the
policy reform areas targeted in the DPC2 and has also approved a project to strengthen the
statistical capacity of the government. The project will prioritize strengthening the statistical
capacity to assess developments in the key areas relevant to the crisis.

150. A three-year US$2 million grant for Mongolia under the Bank-administered GPF was
approved in 2009. This initiative will directly focus on strengthening public accountability by
broadening engagement (e.g. parliamentarians) and encouraging more transparent policy analysis
and civil society monitoring. A major focus of the facility is to support the policy reform agenda
outlined in this document through stimulating policy debate and ensuring independent
monitoring and evaluation of the progress made.

E. Disbursement and Auditing
151. The proposed credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy credits. The untied finances will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the
development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once the credit is approved
by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the credit will be deposited by IDA, at the
                                               51
request of the Recipient, into an account at the BoM designated by the Recipient. The Recipient
will ensure that, upon the deposit of the credit into said account, an equivalent amount is credited
in the Recipient's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The
Recipient will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and
equivalent amount in local currency credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds
of the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will
require the Recipient to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to the amount
of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.
The administration of this credit will be the responsibility of the MoF.

F. Risks and Risk Mitigation
152. The DPC2 faces significant risks, but these are judged to be outweighed by the expected
benefits. There are sizeable downside risks across the various sectors of the operation, both in
terms of impact and probability of realization. These risks are interconnected. For example,
failure to implement social welfare reform or inappropriate or delayed action on banking sector
resolution could add to near-term fiscal pressures. Overlaying the situation are the fluid political
dynamics in Mongolia. As new major mining projects come on stream, there is the potential for a
prolonged boom period which unfortunately might also bring its own risks, for example,
masking policy weaknesses and resulting in tell-tale Dutch disease symptoms such as inflation
and exchange rate appreciation. A key mitigating factor is that the reform momentum from the
recent crisis experience results in improvements in the policy framework which are aimed to
address such risks, as outlined in the preceding sections. Furthermore, it is in the interests of
politicians, policy-makers, and the public, to avoid macro and political instability which could
jeopardize future mining revenues.

153. There is a general risk that the political appetite for reform diminishes as mineral prices
continue to recover and as the prospect of increased mineral revenue inflows draws closer.
Political pressures calling for a greater distribution of the benefits of Mongolia's mineral wealth
to rural areas and to the urban poor are again evident, as seen by the December 2009 approval by
Parliament of a universal cash transfer under the 2010 budget, and is testing the government's
commitment to move forward on medium-term policy reforms. The likelihood of political factors
playing a major such role may increase further in the run-up to the elections in 2012. However,
there are a number of important mitigating factors. First, the objective of signing major mining
agreements has served as a unifying force for the current governing coalition and would be
undermined by political and economic instability. This was a motivating factor in the speed and
commitment to policy adjustment in response to the crisis in 2009. Second, the ongoing
programs of IFIs in Mongolia, including outreach activities, can serve as important anchors
supporting the policy reform agenda. Finally, there are significant benefits to staying engaged on
the policy reform agenda and supporting the reform-minded elements in government and
Parliament.

154. The proper management of Mongolia's future mining revenues can provide immense
support to development outcomes in the long run, although there are near-term fiscal financing
risks. Export and government revenues flowing from the OT project are expected to lie in the
region of 50 and 30 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2020. However, avoidance of further boom-
bust cycles associated with such flows requires concerted efforts towards adoption of a counter-
cyclical and sustainable fiscal regime. Moves to implement a structural balance rule are
                                                52
supported by the Ministry of Finance and development partners, but it remains uncertain
whether, and in what form, such a rule will enter into national legislation. Adherence to the
recently adopted Fiscal Stability Law, albeit not binding until 2013, could be compromised by
populist pressures for additional expenditures on a universal cash transfer of OT prepayment
funds or on housing subsidies. The impact of going off-track on the macro policy front could be
significant, with the poor likely to be particularly affected if this leads to overheating and
inflationary pressures in the economy. An absence of fiscal consolidation, combined with
reduced levels of donor budget support in 2011 and 2012, would limit the financing options for
the deficit. Increased domestic finance could further crowd out the private sector, or there may
be the risk of inflationary financing. A sharp fiscal adjustment would lower service provision and
investment levels. The main mitigating factor in relation to such a scenario is efforts to build up
political support for sustained fiscal restraint in the period prior to the OT revenues coming on
stream.

155. On social protection, welfare reforms are not stroke of the pen policy reforms and require
lengthy consensus building. Both these political considerations and institutional/technical
capacity constraints present risks to further progress on the social welfare reform. Social
protection reform remains a sensitive political issue. Policy makers and parliamentarians from
both main political parties have voiced support for social welfare reform. However, as in other
countries, there remains the general risk highlighted above, namely political pressure to provide
universal, non-targeted benefits, illustrated by recent proposals to use loan pre-payments from
the OT deal for such transfers. These pressures could potentially hinder passage of the social
welfare reform law following its submission to Parliament. There are also lingering concerns
about the government's institutional capacity to implement the proposed reforms. These
concerns will need to be addressed (e.g., via the multi-sectoral technical assistance operation) to
ensure the effective implementation of the proposed poverty-targeted benefit.

156. In the banking sector, a key risk is the failure to deal with those banks having insufficient
capital levels in an expedient and proper manner. Political involvement in the resolution process
also raises concerns over whether future bank problems will be addressed in such a rapid and
effective manner. Delayed, and inappropriate, action on resolving failed banks could increase the
risk of asset stripping and exacerbate the potential fiscal costs of any required recapitalizations. It
could also lead to a fall in the confidence of depositors in individual banks with potentially
systemic implications, prompting wide-scale deposit flight. In addition, the cost of bank
resolution and restructuring is always more than expected, complicating the efforts to gain
political support. As a mitigating factor against this risk, the new laws and the recently submitted
banking restructuring strategy (to Parliament) allow the BoM to act swiftly against any banks
which are moving towards insolvency with clear resolution mechanisms. The private sector
solution should always be the first option, and the government recapitalization focusing on
systemic banks should be the last resort. The adoption and eventual implementation of a
comprehensive bank restructuring strategy, in line with international good practices, is another
mitigation factor.

157. The risks in relation to mining are the potential for a return to policy uncertainty and the
failure to address the significant infrastructure needs associated with future large-scale mining
projects. The recent OT deal is a positive development, but another mineral price boom could, as
previously, lead to a revival of political interference in the sector, affecting the incentives of the

                                                  53
exploration sector to invest in Mongolia. Increasing private sector profits as prices rise could
motivate politicians to adjust the tax environment, as in the case of the 2006 imposition of the
windfall tax, or the access to land. The infrastructure needs of large-scale mining projects, for
example in terms of transportation and power, are considerable. There is a risk that the
government may not have sufficient capacity or finance to meet these needs or that the
institutional and legal framework is not in place to facilitate sufficient private sector
participation. The realization of these two risks would constrain the extent to which Mongolia's
resource activities are developed relative to their potential. The potential adverse impact of such
developments on future revenue streams through lowering investment may act as a mitigating
factor itself, along with sustained technical assistance and policy support by development
partners.

The staff's debt sustainability analysis shows that Mongolia is at low risk of external debt
distress. After rising significantly over the period 2009-10, as the government has been receiving
front-loaded foreign financing to recover from a major terms of trade shock, the debt outlook is
expected to recover and improve over the medium term. Although the public DSA suggests that
in light of the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi mining agreement domestic debt will rise in the medium
term, it does not lead to a different sustainability assessment.

                                            I.       Background

1.      This joint debt sustainability analysis update incorporates the fiscal costs associated
with banking sector restructuring and the recently signed Oyu Tolgoi mining agreement. 25
It assumes that Mongolia achieves sustainable growth by maintaining prudent macroeconomic
and structural policies, including the establishment of a fiscal framework to avoid procyclical
policies. Specifically, in light of plans under the draft fiscal stability law, the phasing-out of
donor budgetary support, and a desire to not crowd out the private sector the authorities continue
with fiscal adjustment until revenues from the Oyu Tolgoi mine, net of amortization, start to hit

24
   The DSA has been produced jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in
consultation with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and the Mongolian authorities (Debt Management
Department and Aid Coordination Department of the Ministry of Finance). The fiscal year for Mongolia is
January-December.
25
   The DSAs presented in this document are based on the common standard LIC DSA framework. Under the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Mongolia is rated as a medium performer with an average
rating of 3.3 between 2006-08, and the debt sustainability analysis uses the indicative threshold indicators for
countries in this category. See "Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational
Framework and Policy Implications" (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and
IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04) and "Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an
Operational Framework, Policy Implications" (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm and

the budget (around 2016). Good macroeconomic policies will also help avoiding "the resource
curse."

2.      Compared to the previous DSA the macroeconomic outlook has improved,
supported by Mongolia's strong policy implementation under the SBA-supported program.
Market conditions have improved and monetary policy has brought down inflation and rebuilt
international reserves with comfortable margins relative to program floors. The growth profile
has been updated in line with revised production estimates for the Oyu Tolgoi mine over the
medium and long-term (Box 1).

                        Box 1. Mongolia--The Oyu Tolgoi Mining Project
Oyu Tolgoi is the world's largest undeveloped copper-gold project and is located just north of the Mongolian-
Chinese border. An investment agreement to develop the Oyu Tolgoi deposits was concluded in October 2009
between Rio Tinto International (a British-Australian mining company), Ivanhoe Mines Ltd (Canadian),
Ivanhoe Mines Mongolia Inc LLC, and the Government of Mongolia.
A key aspect of the agreement is that the government will hold a 34 percent equity share in Ivanhoe Mines
Mongolia Inc LLC, which is the license holder of the Oyu Tolgoi project. The government's participation is
financed as a domestic but US$-denominated loan of around US$870 million from Ivanhoe Mines Mongolia,
and along with advance payments of US$250 million for budget financing, becomes due for repayment from
2014 onwards. Other important terms include a stable operational and tax environment. Ivanhoe will retain a
controlling 66 percent equity share in the Oyu Tolgoi project (with Rio Tinto currently owning a 22 percent
share in Ivanhoe).
Ivanhoe-Rio Tinto is expected to spend US$758 million in 2010 to begin the full-scale construction of the mine
and similarly large amounts are expected to be spent in the next few years. As mining related imports increase,
the current account deficit is accordingly expected to worsen significantly in the near term as mining related
imports increase. However, this will be mirrored by large capital inflows in the financial account. Production is
projected to start in 2013 and is expected to produce 500,000 tons of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold per
year on average for at least 35 years, with the life of the mine estimated at around 60 years. Revenues, i.e.,
corporate income tax, royalties, VAT, and dividends, from Oyu Tolgoi are expected to enter the budget from
2013 onwards. However, only around 2013 will net revenues, i.e., after amortization of the prepayment and
equity share loans, enter the budget.

3.     Mongolia's economic prospects also received a big boost with the signing of the Oyu
Tolgoi investment agreement at the end of 2009. Growth, after bottoming out in 2009, is
projected to rebound to 7 percent this year, driven largely by capital expenditures related to the
Oyu Tolgoi mine. Even though much of the investment will be met through imports, there will
be substantial spillovers to the domestic economy. In addition, copper prices have rebounded and
are projected to be significantly higher than projected in the previous joint DSA.26 Other major
mining projects are being explored which could further improve the outlook.27

   The Tavan Tolgoi deposit, close to the border with China, if developed, would make Mongolia a major world coal
producer. However, the Tavan Tolgoi project has not been incorporated in the underlying baseline macroeconomic
framework due to the uncertainties about its size and timeframe for development. Once Tavan Tolgoi materializes, it
is projected to have an important short-term impact via increased equipment imports, FDI, and loan inflows, and a
medium to long-term beneficial impact on the current account, similar to Oyu Tolgoi.

expected to steadily decline until revenues from the Oyu Tolgoi mine enter the budget.

6.      The composition of domestic debt reflects the Oyu Tolgoi project and bank
restructuring financing.28 The Oyu Tolgoi loans have been contracted from a resident company
in US dollars. The banking restructuring bonds are domestic currency denominated and assumed
to be repaid after ten years for an amount of about MNT520 billion.29

7.     Mongolia's debt management capacity remains low, but progress has been made in
some areas. The World Bank's 2008 Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA)
found that Mongolia scored poorly on indicators relating to operational risk management and
cash flow forecasting and cash balance management. However, it noted its relatively better
performance vis-à-vis strategy development, coordination with macroeconomic policies,
28
   However, roughly one third of total domestic debt in 2009 is accounted for by short term debt issued for
budgetary financing.

   The Oyu Tolgoi investment share loan will be disbursed and repaid based on cash flow projections which are
subject to changes in commodity price assumptions.

recording and reporting, key elements considering the large upfront external borrowing in 2009
and 2010. 30 In addition, since that assessment, Mongolia has improved debt management
procedures and has prepared a medium term debt management strategy.31

8.       The baseline assumes a strong institutional framework and macroeconomic policies
to minimize Dutch disease effects (Box 2). Following the surge in mining production from the
Oyu Tolgoi mine, Mongolia will likely experience a substantial real appreciation creating
challenges to maintaining low inflation and developing the nonmineral economy. The baseline
assumes a restrained fiscal policy, supported by the adoption of a fiscal stability law.32 The fiscal
stability law will promote the needed budget discipline by constraining policymakers' discretion.
The law would put in place three complementary rules that would function as a fiscal "circuit
breaker" and would work together to ensure fiscal discipline: (i) a ceiling on the "structural"
deficit, (ii) a debt ceiling, and (iii) a ceiling on expenditure growth. Finally, it assumes that
structural fiscal reforms including pensions, civil service, and subsidy reforms will contribute to
an improved business climate and overall competitiveness of the economy.

   In 2009, the Debt Management Division of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) revised its previous debt management
strategy, developing it as a medium-term strategy for 2010-12. This medium-term framework creates the
opportunity for the government and MoF to improve future risk management.

   The fiscal stability law was submitted to parliament on January 12, 2010.

                            Box 2. Mongolia--Macroeconomic Assumptions
The baseline macroeconomic framework assumes that the economy will be underpinned by the investment in the
Oyu Tolgoi mine. The construction and exploitation of the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine are expected to
lead to significant structural changes in the economy.
       The outlook for real GDP growth is dominated by the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The scaling up of mining will
       increase mineral GDP and will have significant second round effects on other sectors through a reallocation
       of resources and changes in relative prices. After bottoming out at minus 1.6 percent, real GDP growth is
       expected to rebound to over 7 percent in 2010, boosted by Oyu Tolgoi-related capital expenditures. Once
       production from the Oyu Tolgoi mine starts in 2013, it will boost growth to over 25 percent. Real GDP
       growth is expected to average 10 percent over the medium-term (2014-2020), taking into account the
       impact on the nonmineral economy.
       The copper price projections through 2015 are based on the WEO projections as of February 19, 2010 and
       are assumed constant in real terms afterwards.
       Given the fiscal adjustment under the Fund-supported program, and a tightening of monetary policy,
       inflation is projected to converge to about 5 percent over the long-term.
       The balance of payments will go through large swings. The current account will remain in deficit of
       around 17 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2012 due to large imports of mining-related investment
       goods. As the project comes on stream, the current account will jump into a surplus.
       After a period of consolidation the overall fiscal deficit is expected to converge to a new equilibrium.
       Fiscal revenues will be boosted by the Oyu Tolgoi project and are expected to reach 30 percent of GDP in
       2016 (or 60 percent of nonmineral GDP), gradually converging to 27 percent of GDP by 2030. The fiscal
       stability law will reduce pro-cyclicality by restraining expenditure growth during periods of high mineral
       revenues and enable the authorities to save a substantial fraction of mineral revenues. As a result the overall
       balance would be in substantial surplus in 2014-2020 and would then gradually converge to balance by
       2030.
       Private external debt, portfolio investment and FDI are expected to increase in line with the
       development of mining projects, which will substantially help to sustain growth and build international
       reserves.


9.      The borrowing assumptions reflect Mongolia's move to middle-income status. As the
mining projects come on stream, Mongolia is expected to become eligible for nonconcessional
borrowing from both the IBRD and the ADB, which would be phased in starting in 2013. After
that point, the concessionality of new external borrowing--as reflected by the grant-equivalent
financing component--is projected to decline from 37 percent in 2012 to 27 percent by 2030.33
Interest rates reflect IDA blend terms and ADB terms for concessional borrowing and market
conditions for commercial loans (although present conditions on the international capital markets
for low-rated, first-time issuers may not be favorable, see Box 3).




33
     Mongolia's 2008 GNI per capita is already above the threshold to be potentially eligible for IBRD loans.

This shows that the market conditions remain very difficult for low-rated sovereigns. Indeed sovereign bond
spreads have surged again and market appetite for sovereign bonds from such countries decreased in recent
months, first due to the debt standstill by Dubai World, a state backed property venture in Dubai, and now most
recently on account of solvency fears about Greece as well as other developed economies such as Portugal and
Spain, with large fiscal deficits and rising debt ratios. This suggests that a first-time issuer in financial
difficulties may also find it quite costly to enter the market at this stage.

 Although Mongolia has no outstanding international bonds, Parliament has authorized the government to issue up to
US$1.2 billion. Fitch ratings currently assigns a notional B rating (sub-investment grade) to Mongolia's long-term external
debt with a stable outlook, which is an improvement compared to early-2009, when it had a negative outlook. Other
sovereigns with a similar rating include Ecuador, Ghana, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Ukraine and Venezuela.

                                        III.        Debt Sustainability

                                            A.        External DSA
10.     Mongolia is at low risk of debt distress. All debt indicators remain below the relevant
thresholds.34 Under the baseline, external debt indicators drop sharply in the near term, as the
economy rebounds first due to Oyu Tolgoi-related investment spending and then supported by
the production from the mine. The large loan repayments in 2013, in particular to the Fund, will
reduce the debt stock, and debt ratios will stabilize thereafter. The PV of external public debt is
forecasted to fall from 29 percent in 2010 to 13 percent of GDP at the end of the projection
period.35

11.     External public debt service remains manageable, despite the expected repayment
clustering in 2012-2014. The government has opportunistically built reserves over the past
year, over performing relative to the floors in the Fund-supported program, and is expected to
further increase its reserves. Debt service ratios rise sharply in 2013-14 as multilateral donors are
repaid, but remain low compared to thresholds, and fall back to roughly half their levels in 2013
over the medium to long term. Nevertheless, it is important that in the near term Mongolia
maintains a prudent fiscal stance, saves the advance prepayments from the Oyu Tolgoi project,
and continues to opportunistically build reserves in order to ensure adequate liquidity over this
period.

12.    Stress tests do not indicate any breach of the relevant debt thresholds. Under the
most extreme test--a one-time nominal depreciation of 30 percent relative to the baseline--the
PV of debt-GDP ratio climbs 7 percentage points to 36 percent in 2011 but then falls back over
the remainder of the projection period.

13.     The historical scenario is not applicable to Mongolia with key variables at their
historical averages throughout the projection period as the country is undergoing a major
structural shift as real GDP growth is expected to jump from 6 percent in 2012 to 28 percent in
2013.

                                               B.      Public DSA
14.     Public debt has increased substantially compared to the previous DSA due to the
domestic financing of the Oyu Tolgoi project and banking restructuring costs. The baseline
includes (i) fiscalization of banking sector restructuring costs through domestic bond issuances,
and (ii) loans to the government from the local mining company for financing the government's
investment share and a prepayment on future revenues.


34
    The Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for
Low-Income Countries defines a "low risk of debt distress" when: "All debt indicators are well below relevant
country-specific debt-burden thresholds. Stress testing and country-specific alternative scenarios do not result in
indicators significantly breaching thresholds. In case where only one indicator is above its benchmark, judgment is
needed to determine whether there is a debt sustainability problem or some other issues.
35
   The debt burden thresholds for medium policy performer are 150, 40, and 250 for the PV of debt in percent of
exports, GDP, and revenue, respectively. Under the same medium policy classification, thresholds for debt service
are 20 percent and 30 percent of exports and revenue, respectively.


                                                        66
15.    The government has contracted borrowing agreements with the domestic
counterpart of the mining conglomerate. The government will borrow US$50 million for
budget financing in 2010 after US$100 million were disbursed in 2009, and an additional
US$100 million in 2011. An estimated additional US$870 million will be borrowed to finance
the government's 34 percent investment share in the project. As both loans will be contracted
from a resident company, their impact is reflected in the public DSA.

16.    As a result, public sector domestic debt service ratios are projected to increase
sharply during 2014-17 as these loans are being repaid. The advance payment loans will be
repaid from the general budget while government's investment share borrowing will be repaid
from accrued dividends (the government will not be liable for the loan in the unlikely event that
dividends are insufficient).

17.     The authorities are developing a comprehensive bank restructuring plan, with
technical assistance provided by Bank and Fund staff. Costs associated with the restructuring
are assumed to be fiscalized through the issuance of government bonds at an estimated 8 percent
of GDP by 2010.

18.     The risks for fiscal sustainability have increased over the medium term but remain
low. 36 The government will receive dividends from its share in the Oyu Tolgoi mine and
government deposits are expected to increase, providing a comfortable cushion. For these
reasons fixing the primary balance permanently at the 2010 deficit of 3 percent of GDP cannot
be considered a realistic worst-case scenario for Mongolia. The permanent growth shock
scenario is unrealistic given Mongolia's mining prospects, both in the investment phase and the
operational phase of the Oyu Tolgoi project.

19.    The high-investment-low-growth scenario is not relevant for Mongolia. The increase
in public debt related to the Oyu Tolgoi project does not have an impact on investment and
growth. The investment and production at the Oyu Tolgoi mine and, therefore, the economy's
projected growth path do not depend on the government's participation. Once the mine starts
production, the mining volume is virtually irresponsive to price changes. The impact of lower
than projected growth is covered in the growth shock and alternative lower growth scenario.

                                        IV.      AUTHORITIES' VIEW

20.     The authorities concurred with the overall assessment. They acknowledged that the
bridging to the start of the Oyu Tolgoi mining in 2013 will be key, and that fiscal consolidation
will be needed. They recognized that high public debt makes the economy vulnerable to
commodity price changes, or financing constraints and that a debt ceiling rule could prevent
excessive borrowing against future wealth and reinforce the government's commitment to fiscal
sustainability. Finally, they agreed with the assessment of the risk posed to Mongolia's debt
outlook from contracting large amounts of commercial external debt to finance the budget.




36
     The public DSA is conservatively undertaken on a gross debt rather than on a net debt basis.

                                    V.      CONCLUSIONS

21.     The overall assessment has not changed since the last DSA and the external DSA
indicates that Mongolia remains at low risk of external debt distress. The short-term
macroeconomic outlook has improved due to strong performance under the SBA and a more
favorable global outlook than envisaged at the outset of the program. The increase in domestic
debt, albeit from a low level, does not lead to a different sustainability assessment that under the
external DSA. Consequently, Mongolia would benefit from fiscal discipline until a sustainable
flow of mineral revenues is established along with prudent non-concessional borrowing
consistent with debt sustainability, and sensible debt management.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming

                  Mongolia--Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                September 9, 2010

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fifth
and the sixth reviews of Mongolia's economic performance under a program supported
by an 18-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The Board also approved the Mongolian
authorities' request for rephasing the final disbursement. While the completion of the
final two reviews under Mongolia's SBA enables the disbursement of an amount
equivalent to SDR 30.66 million (about US$46.4 million), the Mongolian authorities do
not intend to draw this amount. Total disbursements under the arrangement remain an
equivalent to SDR 122.64 million (about US$185.4 million).

The SBA was approved on April 1, 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/110) for an amount
equivalent to SDR 153.3 million (about US$231.8 million) or 300 percent of Mongolia's
quota.Following the Executive Board's discussion on Mongolia, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:

"The Mongolian economy is undergoing a brisk recovery. International reserves are at
historic highs, the fiscal position has strengthened, and pro-poor spending has been
protected. These developments are a testament to the authorities' unwavering
commitment and policy performance under the Fund-supported program. Close
engagement with the Fund, together with technical support and outreach efforts, has
contributed to the program's success in stabilizing the economy and the financial market.
"The government has built a strong institutional foundation for fiscal policy. The recently
adopted fiscal responsibility law--a landmark in public financial management--will help
secure fiscal discipline. The nominal spending limit for 2011 enshrined in the medium-
term fiscal framework will promote macroeconomic stability and bolster fiscal policy
credibility. Strict adherence to the targets in the medium-term fiscal framework and fiscal
responsibility law will be essential.

"Spending on social transfers has steadily increased. The social transfer reform
legislation, expected to be adopted by parliament in the coming months, will introduce a
targeted poverty benefit, which will both strengthen the social safety net and enhance
budget flexibility.

"Monetary policy continues to focus on maintaining low inflation, contributing to strong,
sustainable, and equitable growth. The recent tightening of monetary policy, alongside a
nominal appreciation of the currency, has helped contain the upswing in inflation. The
flexible exchange rate regime continues to work well and foreign currency intervention is
being used appropriately to build reserves and smooth out short-term fluctuations in
currency markets.

"Significant progress has been made in reforming the banking system. The Empowering
the Banking Sector and Capital Support Program, a comprehensive bank restructuring
and recapitalizing framework, has been submitted to parliament. Its implementation will
                                            76
help ensure prudent, transparent use of public resources. The recently issued banking
regulations are an important step toward strengthening banking supervision, critical to
preventing a re-emergence of vulnerabilities," Mr. Shinohara stated.
