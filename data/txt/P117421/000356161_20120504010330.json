       Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            operation emphasized the crucial importance of understanding\n            the political economy context for policy reforms. The\n            financial crisis highlighted the need for Mongolia to\n            improve its overall policy framework in order to prevent\n            future boom-and-bust cycles, and provided a key window of\n            opportunity for engagement by the World Bank and other\n            partners. The ability and resources to scale up such work\n            quickly, are essential for a successful and timely outcome\n            in crisis- response operations, and particularly when trying\n            to lay the basis for sound medium term policy framework. It\n            is important to gauge from the beginning of an operation the\n            capacity, both technical and political, of the borrower or\n            the implementing agency to implement the reforms."}, "docdt": "2012-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
