is assessed as\n            satisfactory, sustainability is uncertain, in view that the\n            non-formal education program may be influenced by the\n            proposed government decentralization, and further hampered\n            by the absence of local governments' commitment\n            responsiveness. Key lessons re-emphasize the need for simple\n            project design criteria in the absence of strong local\n            capacity, and political instability, since project design\n            was weakened by inadequate institutional analysis, and by\n            the lack of clearly defined objectives, with measurable\n            performance, and development indicators. Government\n            assurances of sustained support at the national level,\n            throughout longstanding project implementation, may not be\n            sufficient for operations such as this one, whose focus was\n            on local activities; rather community, and beneficiary\n            involvement, with support by local authorities, should\n            remain critical to ensure sustainability. Hence,\n            implementation responsibilities need to be clearly defined\n            during project design, with adequate delegation of authority\n            to ensure a focused, and flexible process. Similarly,\n            incentives - such as salaries, and allowances - should be\n            specified, payable to staff, as well as teachers, to ensure\n            their commitment."}, "docdt": "2000-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
