The\n            IP components include: upgrading of private vocational\n            courses, including scholarships; expansion of an informal\n            apprenticeship program; training in small business\n            management skills and technical assistance to \"Kejar\n            Usaha\" (KU) income-generating groups."}, "docdt": "1991-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
