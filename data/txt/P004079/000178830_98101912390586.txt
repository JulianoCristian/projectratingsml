1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
1.01      Since the early 1960's, manufacturing has been the fastest growing
sector in the Korean economy. Over the last five years, its growth reached
nearly 20% p.a., almost twice as fast as the 11.5% growth of aggregate GNP.
The industrial sector, which accounted for 12% of GNP in 1961, reached 30% in
1977. Manufacturing contributed 43% of the increment in GNP over the
last decade rising to 52% during the past five years. Manufactured products
represented 89% of commodity exports in 1977, compared with 82% in 1965 and
60% in 1960. Industry has provided about one third of all jobs created since
1963 and as much as 47% over the period 1971-75; with approximately 2.9
million people employed, the industrial sector accounted for 21% of the total
population employed in 1977 against 11% in 1966.  One notable feature of
Korea's rapid industrialization is that it has substantially contributed to
the impLovement in the country's income distribution which is now among the
most equitable in the developing world.
1.02      Manufactured exports have been the principal engine of growth of
the Korean economy and the beneficial impact of the orientation towards
labor-intensive exports can be seen in the factor proportions and efficiency
of factor use in Korean manufacturing. The sector is typified by low capital/
output and capital/labor ratios and high rates of growth of productivity.
The unlagged incremental capital/output ratio in the manufacturing sector
was 1.3 (in 1970 prices) during 1965-76 and there has been no perceptible
increase in the ratio during the last five years despite the increased
relative importance of steel, petrochemicals, shipbuilding and machinery
industries. This reflects not only the pattern of industry with heavy
emphasis on labor intensive goods but also low construction costs and high
rates of utilization of capacity reflecting in turn good management and
organization. After falling between 1960 and 1966, the average cost of job
creation in manufacturing industry during the last decade has been stable at
about $5,000 in 1975 prices reflecting both changes in output mix and produc-
tivity improvement within existing industries. The high and sharply increas-
ing level of labor productivity has been a fundamental strength of the Korean
development process. Real wages costs still appear quite competitive inter-
nationally. Manufacturing wage rates in Korea are about one-fifth of those
in Japan, lower than in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore and higher than in
the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand. In contrast, productivity levels
compare very favorably with the latter countries and are probably not too far
behind that of Japan in the traditional industries. The explanation of this
lies in the high levels of education and skills and strict labor discipline.
The efficient use of capital and the steady improvement in labor productivity
have enabled the Korean economy to maintain a GNP growth rate of nearly 11%
p.a. during the last decade while investing only about 26% of GNP on average.
1.03      Recent Performance.  The Korean economy recovered remarkably well
in 1976 and 1977 after the recessionary period of 1974-75. The performance
of the manufacturing sector was particularly impressive with a 26% real
growth of value added in 1976,/i and 12% in 1977. Exports increased by
/1 Compared to 13% in 1975.

more than 40% in volume in 1976 and by about 32% in 1977, reaching US$10.0
billion, led by a strong demand for Korea's traditional export products such
as textile yarns, fabrics and clothing which maintained a share of about 35%
of total commodity exports. Korea's efforts at reducing the concentration of
its exports towards the US and Japan have met with considerable success in
recent years; in 1977 the combined share of the US and Japan dropped to 52%
from a level of 70% in 1974, essentially as a result of the development of
new markets in Europe and the Middle East. Commodity exports to the Middle
East, earlier negligible, amounted to more than US$ 1.04 billion in 1977. In
1977, Korea won construction contracts, mostly in the Middle east, worth
about US$3.5 billion (including the cost of materials and equipment supplied
from Korea).

Within light manufacturing industries, food processing has declined from 29%
of total manufacturing value added in 1971 to 18% in 1976, while textiles,
footwear and leather increased from 23% to 34%, due to the sustained demand
for these traditional export items. Light manufactures have only marginally
declined from 67% of total manufacturing value added in 1971 to 62% in 1976.
Conversely heavy manufactures have risen from about 31% to 35% over the same
period. Chemicals, petroleum and coal still make up the single largest
subsector within heavy manufactures but the expansion of these industries has
been slower than the overall growth of manufacturing value added and their
contribution to total manufacturing value added has consequently declined
from 18% to 13%. Basic metals and metal products have roughly maintained
their share. A substantial increase has taken place in the share of transport
from 4% to 6% and more strikingly in the share of machinery which has risen
from 5% of manufacturing value added to close to 13%. Machinery manufactur-
ing has had the highest growth rate within the manufacturing sector with an
average of 43% p.a. A more radical shift in the structure of the manufac-
turing sector will be encouraged by the Government in coming years towards
more skill-intensive subsectors such as machinery and electronics where Korea
enjoys a competitive advantage over other developing countries because of the
relative abundance of its skilled labor. This deepening of the Korean
industrial structure represents a major objective of the Fourth Five-Year
Plan (1977-1981) and is expected to result in a relative reduction in the
share of light industries in manufactured exports and output.
Geographic Distribution
1.05      In 1975, approximately 27% of the population of Korea lived in the
cities of Seoul and Pusan; the Province of North Gyeongsang where Taegu, the
third major industrial city, is located, accounted for another 14% of the
population. The following table shows that the regional distribution of
industry and industrial employment is also skewed in favor of Seoul and
Pusan.

There was little change in the geographic dispersal of industrial employment
in Korea between 1971 and 1975; Seoul and Pusan remain by far the largest
industrial centers. The Government, however, has become increasingly aware
of the need to achieve, through a wider geographic dispersal of industries, a
better distribution of employment opportunities and a reduction of the
congestion and overcrowding in Seoul and Pusan. The Government has been
promoting the development of industrial centers outside these two areas
principally through the establishment of free trade zones and industrial
estates. Major examples of this policy are the iron and steel plants in
Pohang, the petrochemical complex in Ulsan, the integrated chemical industry
in Yeosu, and the machinery center at Changwon. The Saemaeul Movement
initiated in 1971, also aims at creating industrial employment opportunities
in rural areas and at reducing the disparities of income between urban and
rural areas.
Financial Structure of Enterprises
1.06      The interest rate structure and slowdown in economic activity
during the period 1970-72 had resulted in a deterioration of the financial
position and structure of Korean enterprises. Companies had become highly
dependent on the high cost, short-term "curb-market" for their financing. To
improve their situation, a Presidential Decree of August 1972 froze all loans
from the unorganized money market and new measures were adopted which
lengthened maturities of certain loans, reduced interest rates to 16.8% p.a.
and converted loans from shareholders into equity. These measures as well as
the remarkable performance of the Korean economy in 1973 resulted in a
considerable improvement of the financial position and performance of Korean
enterprises. The aggregate debt/equity ratio of manufacturing enterprises
fell from 3.9:1 to 3.1:1 in 1972 and 2.7:1 in 1973. The average interest
rate on borrowings of manufacturing enterprises concurrently declined from
13.4% to 8.6%. Profitability improved markedly with net profits increasing
from an average of 1% of total assets in 1971 to 7.9% in 1973. With the
quadrupling of oil prices at end-1973 and sharp increases in the costs of raw
materials, enterprises were again subject to considerable financial strains.
Capacity utilization declined and costs of production increased substantially.
In an effort to sustain economic activity and employment, the Government
helped finance the buildup of manufacturing inventories. Enterprises had to
resort to increased borrowings and the aggregate debt/equity ratio increased
to 3.2 in 1974 and 3.6 in 1976. Profitability decreased with net income
declining as a percentage of total assets from 7.9% in 1973 to 5.7%, 3.9% and
4.6% respectively in 1974, 1975 and 1976. Although statistics are not yet
available for 1977, there is some evidence that with the upturn in economic
activity from the end of 1975 the financial structure and performance of
Korean enterprises have improved.
Trends in Industrial Investment
1.07      Fixed investment in the manufacturing sector amounted to approx-
imately W 714 billion in 1976 which represented an increase of about 15% in
nominal terms over 1975. Some 78% of this amount was invested in the heavy
industrial sector, principally basic metals and chemicals which received
respectively 34% and 20%. Investment in light industries amounted to W 154
billion of which 72% was in textile industries. About two-thirds of total



-5 -
manufacturing investment was financed by foreign and domestic loans with the
remainder coming from equity investments, bond issues and internally generated
funds. Over 60% of investment expenditures was for procurement of machinery
and equipment. Investment in nonmanufacturing industries /1 increased by 17%
in nominal terms. Investment in power accounted for 74% of this increase.
For 1977 provisional figures indicate a level of manufacturing investment of
about W 1,300 billion, split 85:15 between heavy and light industries.
Investment in base metals and chemicals were again the principal categories
in the heavy industry sector accounting for 55% of total manufacturing
investment while textile investment was the principal category in the light
industry sector accounting for 13% of total manufacturing investment. During
the Fourth Five-Year Plan period the growth rate of GNP is expected to
be 9.2% per annum with mining and manufacturing growing at 14.2% p.a. Total
gross fixed investment is projected at W 18,000 billion /2 for the Plan
period with manufacturing accounting for 28.3% by the end of Plan period.
Industrial Policies
1.08      Over the past ten years, industrial incentives in Korea have been
highly responsive to particular and changing circumstances, and varied with
Government policies and priorities for industrial development. These policies
aimed, with variable emphasis, at the promotion of export industries and of
foreign investment, geographic dispersal of industry, assistance to small and
medium industries and, more recently, investment in heavy industries.
1.09      A comprehensive incentive system was established during the first
half of the 1960s which generally favored exports over import substitution.
The main elements of the incentive package included unrestricted access to
and tariff exemptions on, imports of raw materials and capital goods, generous
waste allowances in determining duty-free raw material imports; direct and
indirect tax reductions; access to subsidized credit for working capital and
fixed investment; and rate subsidies on certain inputs. Key import substi-
tuting industries received protection from imports through tariffs and
quantitative import controls. Estimates of effective susbidy rates show,
however, that export activity was generally favored over import substitution.
The international competitiveness of Korean industry had substantially
improved betwen 1970 and 1973 due to several devaluations of the won, and the
Government consequently decided to reduce export incentives. Reductions in
corporate income tax were abolished and preferential interest rates increased.
In 1975, tariff exemptions on imported inputs were abolished in favor of a
system by which the tariff on imported inputs is paid at the time of impor-
tation and rebated at the time of export. Tariff exemptions on imports of
machinery and equipment by export industries were abolished in 1974;/3
payment of custom duties can, however, be stretched over a three-year period.
1.10      While key import substituting industries have been granted many of
the preferences given to exporters, production for domestic sale has generally
been subject to higher duties, taxes and interest charges but has benefited

/3 Only in the case of capital goods imported under foreign capital
financing is there still complete and automatic exemption from tariffs.

from tariffs and restrictions on imports. Over the last few years there has
been a modest decline in tariff rates,/l and an increase in reliance on
import restrictions, as a means of affording protection to domestic producers
particularly in the case of capital goods. However in 1977 the Government
relaxed some of these restrictions as part of an import liberalization
program./2 As a counterpart for the protection afforded to domestic pro-
ducers through import controls, the Government in 1976 established price
controls for major commodities./3
Prospects
1.11      Export orientation has been the dominant feature influencing the
structure and rate of expansion of the manufacturing sector. Export growth
has been accompanied by a policy of selective import-substitution which has
helped the agggregate dependence upon imported intermediate inputs and
capital goods remain at roughly the same level over the last decade. Although
import substitution has played a significant role in some sectors and over
specific time periods, its contribution to the growth of manufacturing output
has been very limited. It is estimated that over the period 1960-68 domestic
demand contributed some 60% to the growth of manufacturing, while export
expansion and import substitution contributed respectively 38% and 2%. The
emphasis given to exports of light manufactures has resulted in a rather high
degree of dependence upon imports as a source of raw materials and inter-
mediate inputs, as is reflected in the fact that the domestic value added
content of Korea's exports is only about 50%. While it is clear that Korea's
poor natural resource endowment limits the scope for backward linkages, there
is a real need for Korea to undertake a deepening of its industrial structure.
Awareness of the desirability of deepening Korea's industrial structure was
present in the formulation of both the Second and Third Five-Year Plans and
lies behind the decision to build the first integrated steel mill and petro-
chemical complex. The long-term plan covering the decade up to 1981 which
was published by the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in 1973 emphasized the
accelerated development of the heavy and chemical industries as a critical
element of Korea's future industrialization. The 1973-74 economic setbacks
have rendered a reexamination of this long-term development plan necessary
and while, in the fourth Five-Year Plan, emphasis remains on developing heavy
industry and on increasing the domestic content of exported manufactures,
some heavy capital and energy-intensive projects have been deferred or
cancelled altogether.
1.12      Along with the general objectives of further strengthening Korea's
balance of payments and maintaining a rapid growth in employment, a major goal
/1  The average tariff rate which remained roughly stable between 22%
and 24% in 1969 to 1972, rapidly declined to about 12.8% in 1975.
/2  The number of prohibited items has declined from 77 in 1968 to 66 in
1975 and to 60 in 1977 while items subject to import restrictions
increased from 398 to 597 in 1976 but were reduced again to 456 in 1977.
/3  In March 1976, the Government enacted the Price Stabilization and Fair
Trade Law.



of the Fourth Five-Year Plan's industrial policy is to achieve a structural
shift within the manufacturing sector towards more skill intensive sectors such
as machinery and electronics where Korea enjoys a competitive advantage over
other developing countries. This strategy will also help deepen the structure
of the industrial sector.
1.13      Over the five-year period of the Plan (1977-81) the GNP is expected
to grow at a rate of 9.2% p.a. fueled by a 16.5% annual growth in the volume
of manufactured exports. The manufacturing sector which now accounts for 30%
of GNP is expected to increase at 14.3% p.a., a higher rate of growth than
that of GNP, which would bring the contribution of the mining and manufac-
turing sector to 41% of GNP by 1981. It is expected that some 55% of the two
million new jobs to be created during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period will
be in the mining and manufacturing sector. As in previous years, Korea's
economic development would essentially be export-led, the ratio of commodity
exports to GNP which reached 27% in 1975 would rise to 42% by 1981. However,
compared to their real growth rate of 32% p.a. over the period of 1967-75,
exports are projected to increase at a more modest 16.8% p.a. The Plan is
based on the assumption that Korea's exports of textiles, clothing and other
light manufactures have a limited growth potential and are subject to
encroachment by other developing countries. Korea's comparative advantage
will, therefore, increasingly lie in industries which require more skilled
labor and greater industrial sophistication such as machinery, electronics
and shipbuilding. The real growth of exports of these products would be
around 30% p.a. over the 1976-81 period. The share of manufactures is
expected to rise from about 85% of total merchandise exports in 1975 to 92%
by 1981. In order to sustain the projected GNP growth rate of 9.2% p.a.,
gross fixed investment would need to rise at 7.8% p.a. In relation to GNP,
the projected investment is slightly lower than in the Third Plan period
(26.2% of GNP as against 26.9% during the 1972-76 period). The share of
manufacturing investment in total gross investment is projected to increase
by only 2% from its average share of 24.6% during the Third Five-Year Plan to
26.5% during the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The shift in Korea's export strategy
towards more skill-intensive exports is reflected in both the planned
structure of industrial output and in projected investment allocations. The
share of heavy and chemical industries is expected to rise from 43% of total
manufacturing output in 1975 to nearly 52% by 1981.   Investment in light
industries is expected to decrease from 40% of total investment outlays in
the manufacturing sector over the Third Plan period to 36% over the next five
years; conversely, investment in the heavy and chemical industries such as
basic metals and chemicals would be reduced in relative terms from approx-
imately 75% of investment outlays in heavy and chemical industries over the
Third Plan period to 61% over the Fourth Five-Year period in favor of
investment in machinery and electronics which would increase from 25% to
39%.
1.14      The Plan's estimate of total investment required for the expansion
and restructuring of Korea's industrial sector has been set at around
$10.5 billion over the 1977-81 period. There are grounds for believing,
however that Korea's investment needs for 1977-81 may have been underesti-
mated, while the domestic savings target (which calls for an increase in the
proportion of domestic savings to GNP from 16.3% in 1970 to 27.1% in 1981)



- 8 -
appears somewhat ambitious. The conjunction of these two possibilities would
lead to a continued reliance on substantial inflows of foreign capital. The
Korean Government has in recent years undertaken a major effort to mobilize
domestic resources. Toward that objective, the Government established in
1973 the National Investment Fund (NIF), which is expected to finance a
sizeable portion of the investment needs of Korea's major industries. The
NIF was conceived as an important supplement to various programs of domestic
savings mobilization, and particularly as a source of funds for long-term
investment, primarily for plant and equipment. The NIF derives its funds
from a variety of sources including the national savings associations;pension
funds; postal savings; deposits in banking institutions (20% of increases in
which must be invested in NIF bonds); savings funds; and NIF's bond sales to
the public. The Government has also embarked on a comprehensive capital
market development plan, including the restructuring of the Korean Securities
financing Corporation and the development of new financial institutions such
as merchant banks and the Korea Export Import Bank. Over the period 1977-81,
the Plan expects domestic funds to provide 63% of the aggregate investment
in manufacturing and foreign capital to provide the remainder. About three
quarters of this foreign investment is expected to be directed to the heavy
and chemical sectors.
1.15      The Bank has worked closely with the Government in the formulation
and implementation of industrial policies and is in basic agreement with the
main thrust and priorities of these policies, including those contained in
the Fourth Plan.
2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Institutional Setup
2.01      The financial sector of Korea consists of the Bank of Korea,
Deposit Money Banks and nonmonetary financial institutions.  The Bank of
Korea performs regular central banking functions, including the supervision
of commercial banks.
2.02      Deposit Money Banks include commercial banks and specialized banks.
Commercial banks receive most of their funds through deposits from the
public. They can make all kinds of loans but have traditionally concentrated
on short-term lending although term financing through roll-over of short-term
loans is common. There are 5 nationwide commercial banks, 10 banks with
localized operations and 11 branches of foreign banks which together had 693
branches/offices around the country at end-1976 (all these fall into the
category of "commercial banks"). Four of the five nationwide commercial
banks are fully controlled by the Government which, under Korean law,
automatically receives majority rights if its holding in a nationwide bank is
10% or more. The fifth bank is controlled by the semiofficial Korean Traders
Association. All commercial banks are subject to control and supervision by
the Bank of Korea while specialized banks are directly controlled by the
Ministry of Finance. The specialized banks were all established under a
Special Banking Act and are subject to only a few specific Articles of the



- 9 -
Bank of Korea Act and General Banking Act. Specialized banks are government-
controlled and/or owned. As their name implies, they were founded for
particular purposes or sectors (such as small-scale industry financing or
agricultural financing) and government funds constitute a substantial part of
their financial resources in addition to resources raised otherwise, the bulk
of which consists of deposits raised from the public, hence their categor-
ization as Deposit Money Banks. Specialized banks include the Korea Exchange
Bank, which was established in 1967 mainly to relieve the Bank of Korea of
commercial foreign exchange business, the Medium Industry Bank which extends
financial and technical assistance to small and medium-scale industries, and
which has so far received two Bank loans totalling US$85 million,/l the
Citizens National Bank (mainly for mobilizing small savings and financing
household loans and small enterprises), the Korea Housing Bank, the National
Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) and the National Fisheries
Cooperative.
2.03      Besides the above-mentioned banking institutions which, with the
BOK as supervising agency, constitute the "Monetary System," there are several
nonbanking financial institutions, namely: (a) development finance institu-
tions; (b) savings institutions; (c) life insurance companies; (d) investment
companies; and (e) Merchant Banks. The development finance institutions
comprise the Korea Development Bank (KDB) which so far has received two Bank
loans totalling US$142.5 million, Korea Development Finance Corporation
(KDFC) to which Bank Group assistance, including IFC, amounts to US$240
million to date,/2 the Land Bank and the Export-Import Bank. Savings
institutions comprise some 1,200 authorized credit unions (at end-1976) and
211 mutual savings and finance companies. Five life insurance companies
operate in Korea, in addition to the Postal Life Insurance and the Educational
Insurance Company. Investment companies include the Korea Securities Finance
Corporation which is the principal organization for securities financing in
Korea, ten short-term finance companies /3 and the Korea Investment Trust
Corporation which is specialized in the establishment of investment trust
funds. In addition, three leasing companies have been established over the
last few years as joint ventures between Korean and foreign investors. The
Merchant Banks are the latest arrivals on the Korean financial scene. Five
such banks have so far been established; the Korean Merchant Banking Corpo-
ration (KMBC); the Korea-Kuwait Banking Corporation; the Saehan Merchant
Banking Corporation; the Korea-French Banking Corporation and the Asian
Banking Corporation. As of December 31, 1977 these merchant banks had total
assets of W 56.8 billion (US$117 million) and issuance of their own commercial
papers accounted for 70% of their funds raised while discounting of commercial
papers accounted for 75% of their operations.

2.04      As of December 31, 1977, total loans outstanding to the manu-
facturing sector by all banking institutions in Korea including KDB amounted
to W 3,115 billion (US$6.4 billion equivalent). About 73% of this amount
was for operating funds, mainly supplied by commercial banks. The largest
supplier of equipment loans (i.e., term loans) is KDB which, as of the above
date had an outstanding portfolio in the manufacturing sector of W 452 bil-
lion (US$932 million), about 53% of the outstanding medium and long-term
credit by banking institutions to the manufacturing sector as of that date.
Capital Market
2.05      The Korean Stock Market was moribund for many years but showed
signs of life in 1972. Before then the yields on stocks were considered
unattractive as both savings accounts of commercial banks and the "curb
market" gave higher returns. The market was also thin because closely held
companies were reluctant to go public. With the mid-1972 economic boom and
the adoption of new financial measures by the Government (para. 1.06), the
public showed growing interest in the stock market. The curb market was
severely checked as a result of the August 1972 measures and with decreasing
interest rates served by commercial banks, yields on stocks became attractive.
In addition, the overall investment climate became more favorable after
August 1972, and the campaign for more stock listings and for companies to go
public was intensified. The result was a large increase in stock exchange
activity in the second half of 1972 and in 1973. In 1974, however, trading
activities on the exchange slowed down considerably, due to the gloomy
business outlook; new stock listings, however, continued to rise reaching
almost W 500 million at the end of 1974. The following table summarizes the
stock exchange acitivity over the last six years (figures are shown as of the
end of each period):

With the general improvement of the business climate and improved export
prospects, trading picked up again around mid-1975 and for the year as a
whole the number of stocks listed almiost doubled.
2.06      In 1976, the capital market was rather sluggish in comparison to
the previous year mainly becouse of Luie Government's tight monetary policy.
The general stock price index stood at 425.3 at end-1976, an increase of 8%



- 11 -
only during the year, compared with a 44% gain a year earlier. On the other
hand, the issuing market was very active during the year as a result of the
Government's efforts to promote the "going public" of privately-held companies.
The number of listed companies increased by 85 to 274 in the year end a total
of W 263 billion was mobilized through the capital market, a 69.5% gain over
the previous year. During the year, the number of shareholders increased
substantially. Over the years, the ownership structure has broadened, though
as at October 31, 1976, more than 68% of all shareholders still held less
than 100 shares each and accounted for only 2.05% of all shares outstanding.
The importance of the Government as a shareholder of listed companies also
decreased; while the Government (including public bodies) held about 39% of
the total number of listed stocks in 1970, its holdings had declined to 13%
by October 31, 1976. The proportion held by banking institutions also
declined from 15% to 9% during the same period.
2.07      During 1977, the capital market exhibited a highly active perfor-
mance in response to the Government's vigorous efforts to promote the going
public of privately held companies. The supply of capital through the stock
market to business firms during the year totalled W 363 billion, which
exceeded the year's target of W 320 billion. Of this, W 44 billion was
through public offering of equity shares, W 142 billion through share capital
increases of listed companies, and the remaining W 177 debentures. The
volume of transactions in the secondary stock market expanded by 119% during
1977, recording the trade volume of W 1,375 billion (1,271 million shares)
and the number of listed companies on the Korea Stock Exchange increased by
49 to 323. The stock price index rose by 32.6%, largely led by the substan-
tial gain in prices of stocks of those companies engaged in construction
services, automobile manufacturing and cement industries.
2.08      The rapid increase in the volume of operations on the Stock Exchange
had rendered certain improvements necessary. Among others the call market
has been replaced by a continuous auction market, investment trust companies
have been established, and the information system greatly improved. Several
weaknesses remain, however. One of the more important problems lies in
existing laws which stipulate that new equity issues have to be at par
irrespective of the market price of stocks. These regulations are currently
under review by the Government. In addition, gradual internationalization of
the domestic stock market is being initiated by the Government.
Interest Rates and Monetary Policy
2.09      The Government through the Monetary Board determines interest rate
ceilings on deposits and loans which apply to all banking institutions.
Although private specialized financial institutions such as KDFC or the
short-term finance companies are not legally bound, in practice, they too
have to follow government policies. The development of Korea's interest rate
structure has, between 1968 and 1973, seen a continuous reduction in both
deposit, and lending rates. The lowering of the rates coincided with the
Government's success in gradually bringing inflation down until late 1973.
With the emergence of the oil crisis and worldwide inflation, Korea' price
structure was particularly hard hit because of its high foreign trade
dependence. Wholesale prices are estimated to have increased by nearly 80%



- 12 -
between the end of 1973 and the end of 1975. While the Government selectively
increased interest rates at the end of 1974,/i a general increase of interest
rates was postponed because enterprises were already facing severe financial
strains and the Government hoped to succeed in bringing inflation under con-
trol. During the year 1976, wholesale prices are estimated to have increased
only by 12.1% on an annual basis.
2.10      On August 2, 1976, the Government made an extensive upward adjust-
ment in and revision of the interest rate structure in order to contain
excessive loan demand and to better allocate funds. Prior to this date,
Korean commercial banks had already resorted to various practices which
resulted in increased collateral requirements and higher effective lending
rates for their less creditworthy borrowers. Such practices included the
collection of interest in advance, the establishment of compensating balances
on time deposits or even the opening of installment savings accounts which
are used both as collateral and sinking funds. The August 1976 measures
acted to ratify and further rationalize this system of differentiating
between borrowers on the basis of the risks involved. It led to a system
whereby (a) the interest rates on working capital loans vary according to the
credit standing of the borrower and (b) interest rates on equipment loans
vary according to the loan maturity. The Korean financial authorities
established a list of criteria for enterprises to qualify as a prime borrower
which has helped reduce the need for subjective judgments on the credit-
worthiness of borrowers. This introduction of a prime rate system for
working capital loans and of differential rates according to loan maturities
for equipment loans constitutes an important step towards improving the
overall allocation of funds to industry.
2.11      Effective July 1, 1977, the Government replaced the previous excise
business and consumption taxes by the value added tax (VAT) system, all goods
and services being assessed at a flat rate of 10%. There was some apprehen-
sion amongst the general public that the new taxation system might result in
an increased tax burden on industrial enterprises and consequently in sharp
rises in the cost of living. While the Government did not subscribe to this
thinking it decided to introduce various anti-inflation measures to moderate
the possible adverse impact of the new tax system. These measures included:
(a) a lowering of bank lending rates by 1% on July 1 and a further 1% on
October 1; time deposit rates were also lowered by 1.8% as from October 1,
1977; (b) the Government realigned and announced the prices of 851 major
commodity items, pegged the maximum permissible price levels of major daily
necessities and froze public utility rates until further notice; (c) easing
of import restrictions as discussed in para. 1.10; and (d) measures to
restrict growth of money supply including issuance of treasury bills and
repayment of some Government borrowings from the Bank of Korea.
2.12      The rate of increase of wholesale prices in 1977 is estimated at
10.1% and the growth of domestic money supply at 41.4%. The targets set for
1977 as a whole were a 10% limit to wholesale price increases and about a 25%
limit to domestic money supply growth. The money supply in the foreign sector
more than doubled in 1977 and in the last quarter of 1977 the Government
introduced various measures to curb its growth. Foreign banks were instructed
/1 Rising rates on time deposits for over three months and over six months
from respectively 12% and 13.2% to 15%, and preferential rates for loans
from the NIF and IRF from 9% and 8% respectively to 12%.



- 13 -
in early December to freeze their won loans at their October 1977 level;
reserve requirements for foreign currency deposits have also been established
and enforced. Further measures have also been taken to curb money supply
growth in the domestic sector; however, price controls were partially eased
in two stages on August 1, 1977 and December 1, 1977.  Interest rates as of
December 31, 1977 are shown in Annex 4, T-1.
3.  THE KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
A. KDB'S ROLE IN THE ECONOMY
KDB In Perspective
3.01      One measure of KBD's importance to the Korean economy is the
scale of its operations. It is by far the largest financial institution in
Korea. Its outstanding loan portfolio of W 1,008 billion (US$2.0 billion) as
of December 31, 1977 represented 16% of the total loans (both short and long
term) of all banking institutions in Korea and about one half of all medium
and long-term loans outstanding by the banking sector to the manufacturing
sector. Its foreign guarantee portfolio of US$6.7 billion represented about
40% of the external medium and long-term debt of Korea. Its clients were
responsible for over 55% of Korean exports in 1976.   Its disbursements for
loans and investments in 1977 amounting to W 406 billion (US$837 million
equivalent) directly financed about one fifth of fixed investment in the
manufacturing sector and 8% of total fixed capital formation in Korea.
Including its guarantee operations (US$2.2 billion) it assisted in the
financing of about 38% of total fixed capital formation in Korea during 1977.
Apart from the volume of its financing, KDB makes valuable qualitative con-
tributions to the industrial sector through its high operational standards,
its efficiency as a resource allocator, its promotional activities, its
resource mobilization efforts and its considerable economic and industrial
research work. These aspects of KDB's operations are discussed in the
following paragraphs.
Relationship with Other Development Finance Institutions
3.02      Besides KDB, there are three other major institutional sources of
medium and long-term loans for the industrial sector; the Korea Development
Finance Corporation (KDFC); the Medium Industry Bank (NIB); and the Citizen's
National Bank (CNB). Each of these fulfills somewhat different functions and
aims at different sectors of the economy. MIB confines its financing to
small and medium industries, /1 while CNB is concerned with financing very
small or cottage industries./2 There is some overlap between the functions
of KDFC and KDB but while KDFC principally concentrates on foreign currency
equipment financing for the private manufacturing sector, KDB's coverage is
/1 The definition of which was revised in January 1977 to include manu-
facturing enterprises with up to 300 regular employees or total assets
of up to W 500 million (US$1 million). MIB's loan portfolio outstanding
as of June 30, 1977 was W 266 billion (US$548 million).
/2 CNB provides domestic currency term financing (up to 5 years) for enter-
prises employing up to 100 persons. Maximum loan size is W 30 million and
CNB's outstanding porfolio as of June 30, 1977 was W 293 billion
(US$604 million).



- 14 -
considerably wider in terms of type of financing (foreign or domestic; equip-
ment or working capital), sectoral coverage and financing of both private and
public projects./l   The volume of KDB's lending is also considerably larger
than that of KDFC.  In 1976 KDB's loan approvals were 3.5 times larger in
value than KDFC's. In the particular field of foreign currency financing for
the private sector, however, the importance of KDFC's role comes close to, or
indeed may exceed that of KDB./2
3.03      KDB undertakes domestic and foreign currency lending for both
equipment and working capital financing, equity investments and guarantee
operations. In 1977 its loan commitments totalled W 346 billion (US$713 mil-
lion) split 88:12 between domestic and foreign currency lending and 83:17
between equipment and working capital financing. New investments in equity
and debentures were W 73.5 billion (US$152 million); and the guarantees issued
during the year were W 1,049 billion (US$2.16 billion). Its clients fall into
three major categories: public enterprises in the energy, transportation,
social infrastructure and manufacturing sectors /3; large private enterprises
such as Dae Woo Heavy Industries whose long-term debt capital needs are so
large that only KDB, amongst the development banking institutions in Korea,
can assist them (usually, in conjunction with other lenders);/4 and thirdly,
a more typical development banking clientele consisting of medium-sized to
large private enterprises. The first two categories constitute a large
percentage of KDB's loan portfolio in value terms but a small percentage in
terms of number of enterprises./5 Although KDB's clients are generally
medium sized and large enterprises, the evidence indicates that they in turn
are closely involved with smaller firms through subcontracting arrangements,
the practice of which is widespread in Korea. KDB does not usually undertake
lending to small scale enterprises and its institutional focus and organiza-
tional structure are not geared towards small scale industry lending. It
would serve no useful purpose for KDB to undertake more of this type of
lending because of the predominance in this field of MIB and CNB, whose orga-
nizational structures and operational focus better match the needs of the
small scale sector. The existing demarcation of functions between KDB, MIB
/1 KDFC's loan portfolio outstanding as of September 30, 1977 was US$186 mil-
lion equivalent of which US$174 million or 92% was foreign currency
lending, 97% equipment financing and totally for the private sector. By
comparison KDB's loan portfolio outstanding as of the same date was
US$1.8 billion equivalent of which 89% was for domestic currency lending,
(with the balance of US$198 million or 11% representing foreign currency
lending), 87% for equipment financing and 54% for the public sector.
/2 KDB's foreign currency loan commitments in 1976 were US$70 million equiv-
alent as opposed to KDFC's foreign currency loan commitments of $68
million equivalent.
/3 Loans to public enterprises (45 companies) still constitute 53.6% of
KDB's outstanding portfolio while loans to only 8 of these public
companies constitute 47% of KDB's portfolio.
/4 Loans to 6 private companies constitute a further 13% of KDB's portfolio.
/5 Loans to a further 512 private companies constitute the remaining 33.3%
of KDB's portfolio. Thus 9% of KDB's borrowers (public and private)
comprise two-thirds of its portfolio while 91% (all private companies)
only comprises one-third of the portfolio.



- 15 -
and CNB is appropriate, because it allows these three institutions to provide
specialized assistance covering the full spectrum of Korean industries
(large, medium and small).
KDB's Role in the Goverment's Development Strategy
3.04      Within the framework of the Government's development strategy, KDB
plays an important role both by acting as an instrument of the Government for
the execution of its industrial policies and by providing valuable inputs
into the Government's decision making process.
3.05      KDB as an Executing Arm of the Government.  In terms of its Act,
KDB provides financing, in conformity with Government policies, to major
industrial projects. KDB's support of Government policies is reflected in
its annual Operational Program which KDB formulates on the basis of its own
demand forecast and specific project proposals by various Government mini-
stries. This Operational Program also contains the sources from which KDB
would draw funds including the National Investment Fund (NIF). KDB
is on the one hand a conduit for chanelling Government funds to specific
priority projects of national importance, such as Korea Electric Company
(KECO), Korea National Railroad or Pohang Integrated Iron and Steel Company,
and on the other hand it functions as an efficient allocator of resources
raised by the NIF or by itself independently. In 1977, for instance, KDB
received from the Government W 46.2 million in loans and capital subscriptions,
representing 5.3% of the Government's capital expenditures for the year. It
also received W 99.7 million from the NIF, representing about 45% of the
total NIF's funds mobilized in 1977 (see para. 1.14). The above two sources
together constituted 46% of new resources raised by KDB in 1977. In the
allocation of these resources, and of the funds it raised on its own, KDB
emphasizes Government priorities by supporting export oriented projects and
projects in priority sectors. The order of priority in allocation of funds
in its 1978 Operational Program is (a) Government projects for which funds
have been earmarked; (b) equipment financing in the machinery, shipbuilding
and electronics equipment industries; (c) equipment financing in priority
industries as defined in Article 18.1 of the KDB Act - electricity, coal,
iron and steel, and overseas air and marine transportation; (d) equipment
financing in heavy chemicals, petrochemicals, base metals and cement; and (e)
equipment financing in other industries and sectors and working capital
financing in all sectors.
3.06      KDB's Input into Government Industrial Policies.  KDB has contributed
to the formulation of Government policies in the industrial and financial sectors
by (i) giving its opinions on policy issues when called upon by the Government,
(ii) assisting in Government-sponsored studies and programs, and (iii) the
participation of members of its management in various Government committees.
KDB has carried out numerous studies, often including specific recommendations,
which have subsequently been used as a basis for discussion within the
Government or been incorporated in various policy measures. Studies that
were undertaken during 1975 included a survey of major export industries with
recommendations for specific action; forecast of supply structure and compu-
tation of investment requirements by type of industry; specific recommenda-
tions for increasing resource mobilization for the NIF: a study on industrial
estates; and sector studies of the shipbuilding and iron and steel industries.
KDB was also involved in drafting the Korean Industrial Leasing Law. Further,



- 16 -
its studies concerning the establishment of a merchant banking system are
reflected in the Merchant Banking Law enacted in December 1975. Studies
undertaken in 1976 included investigation of future investment requirements
of the machinery industry and a financing plan for both this industry and the
shipbuilding industry; proposed revisions to the Commercial Code; a financial
sector study; a survey of low income workers; proposed changes to taxation
laws; an international capital market study; contributions to a Government
white paper on public enterprise policies; and a survey of projects which are
expected to induce foreign capital during the Fourth Five Year Plan period.
3.07      Industrial Rationalization Study.  In 1977 a major study on
industrial rationalization in Korea, involving 30 professional staff, was
started by KDB. The purpose of this study is to recommend industrial policies
designed to sustain a high level of economic growth as Korea moves towards an
increasingly open economy with a low or negligible level of protectionism.
Measures for the strengthening of the international competitiveness of
domestic enterprises and for enhancing industrial efficiency and productivity
are being studied in the light of both world and domestic economic conditions
and prospects. The study covers 27 industrial sectors and involves extensive
cross country comparisons. It is expected to be completed towards the end of
1978.
3.08      For the preparation of the country's Five-Year Plans, including the
present planning exercise, KDB has provided valuable assistance by conducting
surveys to build up basic targets, including sector demand/supply forecasts
and investment targets. KDB is well qualified to render this service to the
Government, since it has a competent, trained staff, performs regular finan-
cial and production surveys and, through its day-to-day operations, is in
close contact with the business community.  Particularly for this latter
reason, the participation of KDB's Governor and other members of its manage-
ment in many Government committees provides the Government with an additional
valuable perspective in its decision-making process.  Committees on which KDB
is represented include the Economic Cabinet Meeting, the Foreign Capital
Inducement Deliberation Committee, the Advisory Committee for Economic
Planning, and the NIF Management Council.
3.09      Apart from the specific contributions stated above, KDB's economic
research is well recognized in Korea and many of its studies and surveys are
published and receive wide circulation. For instance, KDB publishes an
exhaustive annual survey of the financial condition of enterprises, a Monthly
Economic Review, a half yearly survey on Equipment Investments and Programs,
a Monthly Research Report and Weekly Economic Reports which present studies
on topical domestic and international business issues.
Economic Impact of KDB's Lending
3.10      Scale of Output and Value-added of KDB Projects.  In 1975 KDB
financed 512 projects with a total project cost of Won 323 billion (US$666
million) generating incremental annual sales of W 551 billion (US$1.14 bil-
lion) and incremental annual value added of W 107 billion (US$ 221 million).
In 1976 it financed 587 projects with total project cost W 434 billion
(US$895 million) generating incremental annual output of W 787 billion



- 17 -
(US$1.62 billion) and incremental annual value added of W 138 billion
(US$285 million). In the first six months of 1977 it financed 332 projects
with a total project cost of W 355 billion (US$732 million), generating
incremental annual sales of W 732 billion (US$1.5 billion) and incremental
value added of W 70 billion (US$144 million).
3.11      Employment Creation.  KDB's clients employed as of December 31,
1977 a total of about 713,000 people of which its manufacturing clients
employ some 539,000 workers (18% of total manufacturing employment). Projects
approved for KDB's financing in 1975 were expected to create 38,000 new jobs;
projects in 1976, 68,000 new jobs; and projects in 1977, 71,000 new jobs.
According to data provided by KDB, the average cost per job created has been
about $18,000 in 1975-1977; this compares with an average cost per job of
US$5,000 in 1975 prices for the industrial sector as a whole and reflects
KDB's role as the principal financier of large industrial projects in Korea
and the emphasis it is currently placing on financing projects in priority
sectors such as shipbuilding, basic metals and machinery which are generally
capital intensive. Because KDB is the principal financier of large industrial
projects in Korea including those in relatively capital-intensive sectors
such as shipbuilding and machinery, employment creation is not as essential
an objective in KDB's lending as it is in the case of the MIB and CNB which
both concentrate on smaller enterprises. KDB, however, routinely analyzes
the employment impact of the projects it finances, as a part of an overall
evaluation of the projects' economic merits.
3.12      Export Orientation.  Exports by KDB's borrowers accounted for over
55% of all Korean exports in 1976 and totalled US$4.3 billion. Projects
financed in 1975 were expected to generate additional exports of W 278 bil-
lion (US$573 million); those in 1976, additional exports of W 300 billion
(US$619 million); and those financed in the first half of 1977, additional
exports of W 120 billion (US$247 million). Exports were expected to account
for about 50% of the incremental sales generated by KDB-financed projects
in 1975 and about 40% of KDB-financed projects in 1976.
3.13       Sectoral Distribution.  The sectoral distribution of KDB's loans is
shown in Annex 4,T-9 and discussed in para. 3.48. Particularly noteworthy in
the context of illustrating KDB's role of supporting and implementing Govern-
ment industrial and economic policy, is the share of commitments to the
capital goods industry in KDB's annual commitments, which has risen from 22%
in 1975 to 28.5% in 1976 and to 38.6% in the first 9 months of 1977. In 1975
KDB made 30 loans for the machinery sector representing 3.5% of total commit-
ments in value terms, while in the first 9 months of 1977 it made 99 loans to
that sector representing 8.3% of its total commitments.
3.14       Economic Rate of Return Analysis.  Annex 4, T-2 gives a summary
of economic indicators of a sample of 47 industrial projects financed by
KDB under IBRD loans No. 1095-KO and 1338-KO and under its third and fourth
ADB loans. The sample only includes projects financed under these loans for
which economic rates of return were calculated and therefore mainly includes
projects which received foreign currency loans from KDB in excess of
US$750,000 (see paragraph 3.37). All projects in the sample had ERRs in
excess of 15% while 21 had ERRs in excess of 30%. For those projects for
which the ERR is not available, the existence of a reasonable financial



- 18 -
rate of return would in most cases suggest economic viability as well, in
view of the high degree of export orientation and the low level of protec-
tion of Korean industries.
Influence on Project Design and Technical Assistance
3.15      KDB's influence on project formulation is to a certain extent
limited since project sponsors often approach KDB after basic decisions
concerning products, technologies or location have been taken and are not, or
only with difficulty, reversible. Nevertheless, KDB's appraisal staff has
made sustained efforts to improve the design of projects under consideration,
and often its proposals for change have been accepted by project sponsors.
In various instances, KDB's suggestions have resulted in changes in scale of
operations, composition of products to be produced or location of the
plant site. With respect to plant location KDB has been particularly con-
cerned to induce companies to locate in industrial estates. KDB's thorough
market analyses have led some sponsors to change their marketing strategies
and in a few cases have led to the postponement or cancellation of projects.
KDB's technical staff carefully examines technical capabilities of sponsors,
particularly if new technologies are to be introduced and has urged project
sponsors to enter into technical collaboration agreements with foreign
companies, when appropriate. A list of new technologies introduced into
Korea in 1976 and 1977 through KDB-financed projects is shown in Annex 4,
T-3. The type of equipment to be procured is normally checked with respect
to local availability and KDB's suggestions have often led to savings in
foreign exchange and/or project cost. The financial structure of prospective
client companies is always carefully scrutinized, leading in many instances
to increased capital contributions by the sponsors, thus contributing to
resource mobilization at the project level. In addition KDB provides con-
sulting services to those clients confronted with managerial difficulties,
often in the form of deputation of its own staff. Assistance provided in
1975, 1976 and 1977 is outlined in Annex 4, T-4. KDB's Technical Services
Department performs, for the Foreign Capital Inducement Deliberation
Committee, engineering surveys on all proposed projects requesting foreign
loan guarantees.
Promotional Activities
3.16      In addition to the promotional activities pursued through its
lending and guarantee program such as promotion of the machinery industry and
through its inputs to Government policy making, KDB has also made significant
contributions to the development of the Korean financial system through the
establishment of specialized financial institutions. These include a leasing
company, a merchant bank, an overseas investment bank and promotion of
public ownership of shares through the vehicle of its equity investments.
3.17      Korea Industrial Leasing Company. Limited.  KILC  was established
by KDB as a wholly owned subsidiary in December 1972 and commenced opera-
tions in March 1973. Its objective is to lease industrial machinery, prin-
cipally to smaller firms which cannot afford outright purchase. As of
October 31, 1977 KILC's authorized capital was W 3 billion of which
W 1.5 billion was paid in. KILC's operations include writing long-term



- 19 -
financial leases, sale and leaseback arrangements, subleases with participa-
tion of foreign leasing corporations and guarantee issuance on international
leasing contracts. As of October 31, 1977, KILC had written 176 lease con-
tracts amounting to W 33.7 billion (US$69 million) and had made four guaran-
tees amounting to US$3.9 million. Of the amount of leases written, 73% was
for industrial equipment and 22% for transportation equipment. A component
of US$7.5 million was made available to KILC under the previous Bank loan
to KDB (No. 1338-KO) for financing enterprises with total assets of up
to W 600 million or projects with an estimated cost of up to US$15,000 equiv-
alent per new job created. Utilization of this component has been satisfac-
tory and as of March 31, 1978, US$3.3 million had been disbursed and
US$6.4 million committed.
3.18      Saehan Merchant Banking Corporation (SMBC).  KDB was instrumental
in establishing SMBC, which started business in November 1977. SMBC is a
joint venture between various Korean and international shareholders with the
Korean shareholders owning 55% of the equity. KDB is the largest shareholder
with 35% of the equity, followed by Hill Samuel & Co. of London with 20.5%;
the remaining shares are distributed between another 8 shareholders. Its
authorized capital is W 6 billion (US$12.4 million) of which W 4 billion is
paid in. The objectives of SMBC include inter alia: arranging foreign
capital loans and equity capital investments and borrowing and relending
foreign capital; discounting, selling and purchasing, accepting and guaran-
teeing of notes issued by business enterprises; underwriting; leasing; stock
market issuing activities; trust business; foreign exchange business; and
provision of financial advice to enterprises. In short, SMBC is expected to
perform the dual function of mobilizing foreign commercial resources and
developing the stock and corporate bond markets in Korea.
3.19      Korea Associated Securities Inc. (KASI).  KDB has also promoted the
establishment of KASI, an investment bank, which opened in New York in
October 1977. It is registered under the corporate law of the state of New
York.  KDB holds 50% of the paid-up equity of US$3 million; the remainder is
almost equally distributed between another six Korean banks. The principal
purposes of KASI are to raise foreign capital for Korean institutions and
enterprises, to attract US and other foreign investments in Korea and to
establish a presence for and enhance the credit standing of the Korean
financial community in the international capital market.
3.20      Promotion of Wider Share Ownership.  KDB makes equity investments
on its own account for two principal purposes: (a) to aid companies whose
equity requirements are too large to be met by the capital market at this
stage of its development; and (b) to assist companies in temporary financial
difficulties but whose prospects appear good. In the latter case KDB usually
puts a director on the Board of the company and provides extensive managerial
assistance to the company. In both cases, KDB seeks to divest itself of
ownership of the shares as soon as possible and to sell these shares either
to the public or to new shareholders in order to help widen the ownership of
the enterprise concerned.
Resource Mobilization
3.21      KDB's resource position is analyzed in paragraphs 3.76 to 3.85.
As of December 31, 1977, KDB had total resources of W 1,397 billion, of



- 20 -
which 84% were long-term domestic resources, 5% domestic short-term resources
and 11% foreign exchange funds. Equity remains the single largest source of
funds (26.1%), followed by borro;-ings from the NIF (21%).
3.22      As a wholly Government-owned development bank, KDB has to depend to
a large extent on funds provided by the Government and the NIF, particularly
since it is the Government's basic policy to use, on the one hand, the NIF as
a vehicle for mobilizing domestic savings (paragraph 1.14) and, on the other
hand, KDB and other development finance institutions for allocating the
resources so mobilized by the NiF. For the country as a whole, domestic
saving has been satisfactory, having increased substantially from 7.5% of GNP
in 1965 to 16.3% in 1970 and 18.0% in 1975. (As stated in paragraph 1.14, it
is the Government's objective to raise this savings rate to 27.1% of GNP by
1981.)   Savings mobilized through the NIF accounted for 8.5% of total
domestic savings in 1975. Notwithstanding the fact that KDB's primary
function is to allocate resources, KDB has in recent years made commendable
efforts to mobilize private resources in order to supplement those made
available to it by the Government and the NIF. On the domestic currency
side, it has issued bonds (generally with two or three-year maturity) aggre-
gating about W 170 billion and accounting on an outstanding basis for about
5% of its total resources. The present situation of the domestic capital
market does not allow KDB to issue bonds with longer maturities (say, up
to five or seven years) in any significant amount, whereas KDB's own loans
generally have maturities exceeding eight years.  Hence, KDB's continuing
need for long-term domestic currency funds from the Government and the NIF is
obvious. Even if KDB were able to issue long-term bonds, these would most
likely compete with NIF's own bonds and therefore might not augment the
volume of overall savings mobilized. KDB's domestic resource mobilization
efforts should be seen as a mere supplement to those of Korea as a whole, and
in particular, to NIF's.
3.23      On the foreign currency side, KDB has in recent years raised
US$419 million from commercial sources (of which US$294 million in 1976/77),
to supplement the amount of US$335 million it has obtained from official
sources (IBRD, ADB, USAID, et. al.). This effort at mobilizing foreign
private resources is satisfactory. Foreign commercial borrowings generally
have short maturities (of between 2 and 7 years) whereas KDB lends to invest-
ment projects requiring long-term finance (of up to 12 years). Furthermore,
the total amount of foreign commercial resources which KDB is able to obtain
has been, and is expected to remain, limited by the country's overall capac-
ity to borrow from the international capital market; and the Government
itself controls tightly the amount of foreign commercial funds which KDB is
allowed to raise in a given year just as the Government controls the overall
inflow of such funds into Korea. In view of the foregoing, KDB will continue
to require funds from official sources such as IBRD in addition to its
foreign commercial borrowings. KDB's plans for foreign commercial borrowings
for 1978-81 are discussed in paragraph 3.91.
Development Strategy
3.24      KDB has formulated a statement of Development Strategy (Annex 2)
for the period 1978/79, highlighting its specific short-run developmental



- 21 -
objectives which include, inter alia, the following: (a) intensified assis-
tance to such priority sectors as the machinery and basic metal industries;
(b) further enhancing its resource allocation impact by focusing on such
economic factors as export orientation, employment creation, forward and
backward linkages and geographic dispersal, in taking investment decisions;
(c) increasing technical assistance by providing consultancy services to
clients; and (d) intensified efforts to mobilize private resources from both
the domestic and foreign capital markets.
B. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Functions, Legal Framework, Organization and Staff
3.25      Broad Functions and Legal Framework.  KDB was established in 1954
with the main objective of providing and administering funds, in conformity
with Government policies, for the financing of industrial projects to expe-
dite post-war rehabilitation and economic development. The types of financ-
ing operations undertaken by KDB and the sectors covered by it are described
in the preceding paragraphs under "KDB's Role in the Economy." In accordance
with the KDB Act, annual profits must be transferred to and losses offset
against reserves or, if reserves are insufficient, any deficit will be
compensated by the Government. The Act was last amended /1 in December 1977,
inter alia, to increase KDB's authorized capital, to expand its field of
operations and to widen the range of eligible enterprises for working capital
financing.
3.26      Ownership.  Under the amended Act, KDB's authorized capital, totally
subscribed by the Government, will be W 600 billion.
3.27      Organization, Management and Staff Organization.  In accordance
with the KDB Act, the Minister of Finance supervises broadly the conduct of
KDB's business. This ministerial authority notwithstanding, the Board
(para. 3.30) comprising the Governor, Deputy Governor and Executive Directors,
decides all important matters relating to KDB's operation. KDB's Head Office
has 21 departments which have been grouped according to broad functions, each
group reporting to one of the seven Executive Directors (the organization is
shown in Annex 4, Chart No. 1). The Auditor and the Secretariat report to
the Governor and Deputy Governor directly. Domestic loan processing (Loan
Departments I and II) and foreign currency loan appraisal (Foreign Loan
Department) do not include financial analysis, market and other project
related studies, and accounting and management guidance as these activities
are within the scope of the Business Analysis Department. Both the Share-
holding and the Investment and Securities Departments deal with investments;
the former, however, concentrates on KDB's subsidiaries and companies in
which KDB holds more than 50% of the share capital. The Shareholding Depart-
ment also becomes involved in budgeting for these companies, in training
their officers, in management guidance and temporary secondment of KDB
personnel to assist them.  The Business Control Department is responsible for
general planning and control, preparation of KDB's yearly Operational Program,
borrowing and repayment of domestic funds, allocation of funds within KDB,
/1 In process.



- 22 -
and matters relating to overdue loans. The Technical Services Department is
responsible for technical feasibility studies carried out in conjunction with
project appraisal, review of clients' investment proposals, surveying of
construction progress and provision of general technical advisory services.
KDB's follow-up work is not entrusted to a separate department but is under-
taken by the loan appraisal officers. The Foreign Capital Department is
responsible for raising foreign currency funds from both official and commer-
cial sources.
3.28      KDB has nine domestic branch offices outside Seoul; one in each
of the major cities of the eight mainland provinces plus an office in Ulsan.
The Head Office is responsible for all projects in the Seoul area, large
Government projects, and foreign currency financing. The branch offices have
the authority to approve working capital loans up to certain limits /1 but
otherwise, after appraisal of projects, they forward them to the Head Office
for further analysis and approval; the branch offices are also responsible
for the follow-up work on projects located in their respective territories.
3.29      KDB is represented abroad by Offices in London, New York, Tokyo,
Kuwait and recently in Singapore and Hong Kong. The principal functions of
these offices are foreign resource mobilization and liaison with foreign
equipment suppliers and banks.
3.30      Management.  The list of members of the Board of Executive
Directors is shown in Annex 1. KDB is managed by a full-time Board com-
posed of the Governor, Deputy Governor and seven Executive Directors. The
Governor is appointed by the President of the Republic upon the recommenda-
tion of the Minister of Finance, while the Deputy Governor and the Executive
Directors are appointed by the Minister of Finance upon recommendation of the
Governor. The term of office for all Board members is three years and
renewable. Governor Woun Gie Kim, who has been in office since August 1972,
continues to provide KDB with strong and capable leadership. Mr. Choon Taik
Chung was appointed Deputy Governor in May 1976 after a career in the
Ministry of Finance and after having served as the Economic Minister in the
Korean Embassy in Washington. All seven Executive Directors have been
promoted from within KDB and are well experienced and competent. KDB's
senior management is of a very high standard. KDB also has considerable
depth at the middle management level (Directors, Department Managers and
Deputies).
3.31      Staff.  A breakdown of KDB's professional staff by departments is
shown in Annex 4, T-5. Over the past few years there has not been any
significant change in the size of KDB's total staff which currrently numbers
1,767 (including branch and representative office staff) of whom 573 are
classified by KDB as professionals. About 20% (17% for professionals) of
KDB's total staff work in the branch offices and overseas representative
offices.
/1 W 30 million to W 110 million depending on the branch.



- 23 -
3.32      The competitiveness of KDB's salaries has been significantly
eroded in the last few years, specifically in comparison with the private
sector. Consequently turnover of professional staff has increased and has
become a matter of concern, though voluntary resignations, after reaching a
peak of about 17% (of male professional staff) in 1976, subsided in 1977 to
about 9-10%. An analysis of the resignation figures between 1975 and
September 1977 indicated that 75% had a working career with KDB of more than
10 years, about 46% between 15-25 years and almost none with less than 5
years. The foregoing indicates that KDB has apparently lost some of its most
experienced officers. By the same token, all those who resigned had served
KDB for a significant and reasonable period by any standard. KDB cannot do
much to retain these middle level officers because of the greater career
opportunities available to them in private industry and the financial sector.
The demand for personnel of the caliber of KDB's staff is very high as a
result of the growth of the Korean economy. KDB's management is well aware of
the problem but can do little to correct it, because the salary structure of
Government-owned banking institutions including KDB is uniform and is deter-
mined by the Government. In effect, KDB's management takes the correct view
that the substantial number of KDB's trained officers who had left KDB to
occupy positions, often prominent, in the private sector, represented yet
another contribution by KDB to the Korean economy. Officers who left have
been replaced by suitable officers promoted from within KDB's staff which has
considerable depth. A salary increase of 12% towards the end of 1977 and
another increase (between 25-30%) expected in 1978 are steps in the right
direction, though they will not make KDB's salary scale fully competitive,
as the private sector envisages even higher increments. In these circumstances,
an annual staff turnover of 5-10% may become a normal feature, with which KDB
should be able to cope without any substantial loss in its operational capacity
and standards. More intensive recruitment to select suitable candidates and
intensified training and other measures to increase the productivity of
existing staff are under way and should ensure the continuing adequacy of
both the quality and the size of KDB's staff. KDB continues to be able to
attract new recruits of a high calibre from the ranks of college graduates.
3.33      KDB provides systematic in-house and external training for all
staff from clerks to Executive Directors. The training courses last from two
days up to four weeks and cover subjects such as: loan operations, banking,
business, accounting, economics, and language courses. Additionally a number
of officers were sent to various financial institutions abroad for further
training. KDB intends to further intensify its staff training partly as a
palliative to the high staff turnover discussed in the preceding paragraph.
Operational Policies
3.34      KDB's operations are governed by the KDB Act and Enforcement
Decree, KDB's By-laws, Operating Manuals and Policy Statement (Annex 3). The
latest amendment of the KDB Act in December 1977 envisages an expansion of
KDB's field of operations and a broadening in the range of eligible enter-
prises for working capital financing, apart from an increase in the authorized



- 24 -
capital by W 300 billion to W 600 billion. The amendment authorizes KDB to
provide working capital loans to those enterprises for which KDB has issued
guarantees. It also authorizes KDB to provide the Government, banking
institutions or other entities with various consultancy services such as
economic and technical feasibility studies, planning, research, appraisal,
guidance and other advice.
3.35      KDB's Policy Statement includes the usual financial prudence guide-
lines and limits. Paragraph 6(b) stipulates that KDB should not normally
make equity investments in excess of either 15% of its own equity or 50% of
the paid-in capital of the client companies. Excluding the Readjustment
Corporation, the Saehan Merchant Banking Corporation and the Korea Industrial
Leasing Co., which can be considered as KDB's subsidiaries, KDB has so far
exceeded this limit in seven cases for which its financing amounted to
W 122 billion (Sept. 1977). Five /1 of these seven cases are subject to the
special control of the Shareholding Administration Committee /2, and governed
by the KDB Shareholding Act promulgated in 1969. These arrangements appear
satisfactory and there should not be any cause for concern about KDB's
exceeding the above-mentioned prudence limits. KDB intends to divest itself
of such holdings as soon as the financial performance of the companies
concerned and capital market conditions permit. As of May 1, 1978 KDB was
engaged in arranging the sale of its shares in three of the above companies.
3.36      In addition, paragraph 6 (c) of the Policy Statement provides that
KDB shall not normally extend financial assistance to any single enterprise
in excess of either: (a) 25% of KDB's total unimpaired paid-in capital,
surplus and free reserves; or (b) 65% of the total assets of the enterprise.
In 23 cases accounting for W 2,964 billion, KDB has exceeded these limits and
two companies /3 account for 62% of such exceptions. About 84% of the total
financial assistance extended to these 23 enterprises is in the form of
guarantees and 92% of this amount is covered by the Guarantee Release
Agreement (para. 3.60), under which the financial risk is assumed by the
Government instead of by KDB. Given the nature of KDB's operations, excep-
tions to paragraph 6 (c) are unavoidable. Consequently, following consulta-
tions with the Bank and ADB, KDB is in the process of revising the paragraph
in order to confine its application to those cases for which KDB assumes the
financial risk and to exclude those for which the financial risk is effec-
tively assumed by the Government.
/1 Two companies, which account for 85% of the above mentioned total are
designated "Government-controlled companies" and are thus not subject
to the KDB Shareholding Act.

dation of the Minister of Finance.

- 25 -
Project Appraisal and Follow-Up
3.37      Project Appraisal.  KDB's appraisal standards and procedures remain
fully satisfactory. Neither the domestic loan processing officers nor their
counterparts in the Foreign Loan Department appraise projects fully on their
own. They draw on the Business Analysis Department for market and other
project related studies and analyses, and on the Technical Services Deparment
for technical feasibility studies (para. 3.27). This subdivision of labor is
satisfactory. Projects within the jurisdiction of the branch offices are
normally appraised by their personnel and forwarded to the Head Office for
review and approval. KDB undertakes reasonably thorough economic analysis,
including computation of the ERR,/l for all projects seeking foreign exchange
financing exceeding US$750,000 irrespective of the source of financing. To
enable its staff to undertake economic analysis for domestic projects (envis-
aged for projects exceeding W 2 billion [US$4 million] and for which KDB
takes the financial risk), further staff training is needed and is being
carried out. To that end, it was suggested that KDB transfer some officers
with experience in ERR analysis from its Foreign Loan Department to the
Domestic Loan Departments.
3.38      Environmental Considerations.  KDB's Technical Services Department
is responsible for monitoring all project appraisals to check conformity with
Korea's anti-pollution laws. On the basis of subproject appraisal reports
reviewed by Bank staff, it is considered that environmental considerations
are given due weight and consideration by KDB. Two new laws were enacted on
December 31, 1977; the Environment Conservation Act and the Maritime Contami-
nation Act. These laws are verv broad in scope and cover most forms of
pollution including air, water,soil and noise pollution , as well as general
environmental and conservation considerations. The laws will come into force
on July 1, 1978. KDB is currently reviewing these laws and intends to
monitor all projects under consideration after July 1 for conformity with
these laws.
3.39      Follow-Up.  Follow-up work on projects is not entrusted to a
separate department but is undertaken by the loan appraisal officers,
either at headquarters or at the branch office level, or jointly. KDB's
project supervision procedures are systematic and thorough. Compliance by
clients in fulfilling quarterly reporting requirements is satisfactory.
Annual audited financial statements are required for all foreign currency
loans and domestic currency loans exceeding W 100 million. For problem
projects, KDB frequently deputizes its own staff to serve in a managerial
capacity in a client company or appoints one or more directors on the Board
of the client company. Such practice has proved effective. On-the-spot
inspections are made selectively including field audits of the companies'
books. Overdue or insufficiently collateralized loans are transferred to the
Special Loans Department working together with the Business Control Department.
If foreclosure is envisaged, loans are transferred to the Readjustment
Corporation (para. 3.70).
/1 KDB's methods of calculation of ERRs are in line with the guidelines
suggested by the Bank for DFC projects as are the methods used by KDFC
and MIB. KDB does not shadow price either labor or foreign exchange in
the calculations of ERRs.



- 26 -
Procurement and Disbursement
3.40      KDB revised its procurement procedures in early 1978 to include
three methods of procurement; these are international competitive bidding,
limited competitive bidding, and negotiated contracts. Previously, KDB had
only used international competitive bidding and negotiated contracts.
Criteria for application and a summary of the revised procurement methods are
as follows: (a) International competitive bidding. This is the general
rule for procurement and is to be applied in every case except where methods
c and b, as described below apply. Invitations to bid will be advertised for
at least 45 days. These invitations are duly notified to relevant foreign
embassies in Seoul; (b) Limited competitive bidding. In cases where the
estimated procurement amount is less than one million US dollars, interna-
tional competitive bidding will be replaced by limited competitive bidding.
This requires bids to be sought from suppliers from at least three countries;
and (c) Negotiated contract. This covers those special cases where a
contract has for technological reasons to be negotiated with one particular
supplier. This occurs for example in such cases as an expansion project
where new equipment has to be compatible with existing equipment; where
equipment of a unique specification is required; or where patent rights are
held on a piece of equipment by a specific manufacturer. These arrangements
are considered satisfactory. In 1977, under the previous arrangements, about
64% (by amount) of the procured goods were exempt from competitive bidding as
against 46% in 1976. This increase, according to KDB, does not reflect a
relaxation in its approach to competitive bidding, to competitive bidding,
but is attributable to technical considerations such as required interchange-
ability of machinery in the case of expansion projects, adherence to the
technology of a particular supplier, etc.
3.41      Disbursements are closely supervised and based on the progress of
the project. Given this policy, regular progress reports are prepared by
the Technical Services Department to assure that withdrawals are made for
agreed purposes only and are in line with the project plan. At the end of
the construction period, a final report is issued by the Department.
Data Collection and Processing
3.42      Since KDB is a large and complex institution, with 9 branch offices
and 6 overseas representative offices, its data originate from many managerial
units. Interoffice reporting requirements appear to be fragmented and to
lack consistency. KDB needs an integrated data collection and management



- 27 -
information system. KDB's management is fully aware of the problem and
is seeking remedial action. This, however, first requires a time-consuming
in-depth analysis which will be undertaken in 1978 by KDB's own staff.
There appears to be no need for the employment of outside consultants.
C. Operations
Scope of Operations
3.43      KDB's scope of operations, as defined in the Act, is very broad and
allows it to undertake virtually every kind of transaction necessary to
fulfill its developmental role, including working capital financing, issuance
of bonds, borrowing of foreign capital, and transactions in foreign exchange.
Some of these operations (e.g. working capital finance, demand deposits,
dealings in foreign exchange), however, are restricted to those enterprises
which have already obtained KDB's financing. The Act provides further that
long-term loans from Government Special Funds shall be extended and adminis-
tered exclusively by KDB (Art. 19). The volume of KDB's operations cannot
exceed that envisaged in the annual Operational Program, which sets out
quantitative targets for both KDB's financing and for raising the necessary
fund (see paragraph 3.05). The Operational Program may be amended during the
year, as needed, with the approval of the Finance Minister, in order to
adjust these targets with KDB's actual and/or prospective performance. KDB's
Operating Manuals, which are subject to approval by the Finance Minister, set
out procedures, inter alia, on methods of operation, collection, underwriting,
and issuing bonds. KDB's operations are carried out within this methodically
planned and tightly regulated framework, which allows extensive interaction
between the Government and KDB.
3.44      In the past, the volume of KDB's operations has often been con-
strained by the availability of domestic funds from the Government and its
special funds, and from official foreign resources. Recently, however, KDB
has been able to expand its resources through intensified efforts at issuing
bonds in domestic and foreign currency, and in raising foreign commercial
resources (see para. 3.76 onwards).
Volume of Operations
3.45      KDB's financing operations fall into three broad categories:
(a) capital loans in foreign and domestic currency and working capital loans
in domestic currency; (b) investments in equity shares, corporate and munici-
pal bonds and debentures; and (c) guarantees, mostly in foreign currencies.
KDB's loan, investment and guarantee operations for the past five years are
shown in Annex 4, T-6, T-10 and T-12 and are summarized below:

3.46      The volume of KDB's lending operations in 1977 was W 346.2 billion
(US$714 million), an increase of 51% over the 1976 level which itself was 13%
greater than the 1975 level. Domestic currency lending has increased by 57%
since 1975 while foreign currency lending has increased by 97%. Foreign
currency lending constituted 12% of KDB's lending in 1977 as opposed to 10.4%
in 1975. The composition of KDB's domestic currency lending in 1977 was 81%
term capital loans and 19% working capital loans as opposed to 79% term loans
and 21% working capital loans in 1975. Loan disbursements have kept pace
with loan approvals and amounted to W 343.5 billion as of December 31, 1977.
Loans oustanding (3,157 by number) as of that date amounted to W 1,008 bil-
lion (US$2.08 billion).
Characteristics of Lending Operations
3.47      A summary of KDB's loan commitments for the years 1975 through 1977
and an analysis of outstanding loans as of September 30, 1977 is shown in
Annex 4, T-6, T-7, T-8 and T-9. Foreign currency loans outstanding have
risen to 11.3% of KDB's portfolio from 8.5% at end-1975. The share of the
private sector in annual loan commitments increased from 42.2% in 1975 to
70.9% in value terms, and to 92.7% by number of companies in 1977. The share
of the private sector in KDB's outstanding portfolio as of September 30,
1977 is now 46.4% as compared with 37.7% at the end of 1975. About 18.7% of
KDB's borrowers to date have been engaged in new projects, accounting for
about 13.8% of KDB's total loans (by number). Loans over W 800 million
(US$1.6 million) accounted for 57.9% of total commitments in 1977, down from
66% in 1975.



- 29 -
3.48      The geographic distribution of loans seems to have reverted to a
normal pattern with Seoul and Busan, the predominant industrial areas,
absorbing 42.5% of all loans after a temporary peak of 50.6% /1 in 1976
compared with 42% in 1975. The manufacturing sector accounted for 67.2% of
loan commitments in 1977 compared with only 48% as recently as in 1975.
Mining and transportation still account for about 43% of KDB's total out-
standing portfolio. The share of the capital goods industry has increased
from 22% in 1975 to 38.6% in 1977 with the machinery industry accounting for
8.3% as against 3.5% in 1975. The foregoing indicates that the sectoral
pattern of KDB's lending has reflected closely and promptly the recent shifts
in Government industrial policies.
3.49      The average duration of capital (term) loans has increased from 7.4
to 8 years, weighted by the number of loans, and from 8.8 to 9.7 years
weighted by amounts, for the years 1976 and 1977 (Sept.) respectively. The
majority of KDB's working capital loans as of September 30, 1977 have maturi-
ties exceeding 2 years, namely, 65.9% by number and 58.5% by amount. However,
KDB has lately made working capital loans with shorter maturities with almost
46% of these loans made in 1977 having a duration of up to one year only.
3.50      Loans Made at Government's Behest.  As the principal financier of
both the private and the public sector, KDB also extends financial assis-
tance to some companies in the public sector, at the behest of the Government,
rather than on its own initiative, and without an independent appraisal.
The Government agreed in connection with the second Bank loan (No. 1338-KO)
to relieve KDB of the financial risk pertaining to the four companies shown
below:
Amount outstanding

2.  Korea National Railways                    83,029
3.  Korea Coal Corporation                     11,499

Investment Operations
3.51      A summary of KDB's investment operations from 1974 through 1977
is shown in Annex 4, T-10. Total investments in 1977 were W 73.5 billion and
KDB's investment portfolio stood at W 240.6 billion (US$496 million) as of
December 31, 1977. Equity investments in 42 companies accounted for 91% of
the total investment portfolio as of September 30, 1977, the remainder
consisting of bonds and debentures.
3.52      Equity Investments.  KDB's equity portfolio increased in 1977 from
W 160.2 billion to W 217.4 billion almost exclusively as a result of share
subscriptions in cash (W 61.0 billion) while loan conversions contributed
only W 2.0 billion. The Government did not transfer any shares to KDB in
1976 and 1977, in line with an understanding reached between the Government,
KDB and the Bank at negotiations for the previous Bank Loan. Almost all
additional investments during this period were made at par value or below
par and only in a few exceptional cases exceeding par value but within book
value. KDB's restrictive policy towards loan conversion is reflected in
the fact that there were only two such cases /1 during the 1976-77 (Jan.-
Sept.) period. The amount involved accounted for 5.6% of total equity
investments in 1976 and a negligible 1.7% in 1977. Recent market quotations
and market value estimates indicated that current market prices exceed the
original purchase prices of shares held by KDB by a considerable margin. /2
3.53      Annex 4, T-l1 presents an analysis of KDB's equity investments for
the period 1975-1977 (Jan. - Sept.) and for the portfolio outstanding as of
September 30, 1977. KDB has invested 87% (by amount) of its total outstand-
ing portfolio (42 companies) in 24 companies in the public sector. Invest-
ments in the capital and intermediate goods industries account for about 38%
and 28% of the portfolio respectively while the nonmanufacturing industry
accounted for 32%. Since 1977 KDB carries one investment in foreign currency
(Korea Associated Securities Inc., New York) (para. 3.19).
3.54      Ownership and Shareholding Administration Fund.  The financial pru-
dence limits in its Policy Statement require KDB normally not to invest more
than 50% in the share capital of any single enterprise. In 9 out of the 42
companies KDB has exceeded the limit; however, 3 of these are KDB's subsid-
iaries. /3 Of the remaining six cases, five are controlled by the Shareholding
Administration Fund (SAF) while the remaining company, accounting for 68% of
/1  Only a portion of total loans oustanding of two companies was converted
into equity: namely W 2.2 out of 5.0 billion to Korea Airlines
(1976) and W 0.9 out of 2.5 billion to Dong Lip Ind. Dev. Co. in 1977.
/2 e.g. Quotation for Korea Airlines shares on September 30, 1977: W 15,167
(purchase price: 2,200).
/3 These companies are: Korea Industrial Leasing Co., Readjustment
Corporation and Saehan Merchant Banking Co. The ownership pattern of
the latter has changed in the meantime, with KDB holding 35% of the
share capital only.



- 31 -
total exceptions, is governed by a special law./l About 15% of KDB's hold-
ings in these companies result from share transfers by the Government. The
KDB Shareholding Act /2 governs all so-called "KDB-invested enterprises,"
i.e., companies in which KDB holds more than 50% of the share capital.  The
Act, inter alia, provides for the Shareholding Administration Committee (SAC)
(see para. 3.35), which controls the "KDB-invested companies," and for the
SAF, an autonomous fund with separate accounting. Proceeds from the sale of
shares, dividends, loan collections, and interest on loans and operational
profits arising from "KDB-invested enterprises" accrue to the SAF, and are
used to make capital and operating loans to both KDB-invested and other
enterprises./3   As of June 30, 1977, total working capital loans outstanding
amounted to W 7.9 billion and total outstanding capital loans to W 1.1 bil-
lion. So far the KDB Shareholding Act has proved effective by providing for
a close control over the companies concerned in particular through the SAC.
3.55      Sales of Investments - During 1977 (Jan. - Sept.) KDB sold part
of its shareholdings in several listed companies and realized a profit of
W 4.8 billion (W 4.9 billion in 1976). Total capital gains represent 138%
of the original cost (40% in 1976). All sales in 1977 were either to
private individuals or companies on a cash basis in contrast to 1976, when
92% was made on installment basis. Capital gains on investments sold
accounted for 44% of total income from KDB's investment portfolio (49% in
1976). Average return /4 of KDB's equity portfolio was 6.0% in 1977 as
against 5.9% in 1976 and 3.8% in 1975.
3.56      Bonds and Debentures - In 1977 KDB invested W 10.5 billion in the
purchase of bonds and debentures, while W 4.8 billion were sold or redeemed.
Consequently, KDB's portfolio increased by 35% from W 17.5 billion in 1976
to W 23.2 billion. Municipal bonds, subscribed by KDB at the behest of the
Government,/5 accounted for 72% (W 15.2 billion) of the portfolio as of
September 30, 1977. Interest income from bonds and debentures was 8.3% in
1977 as compared with 8.6% in each of the previous two years.
Guarantee Operations
3.57      A summary of KDB's guarantee operations for the years 1974 through
1977, and an analysis of KDB's portfolio of guarantees as of September 1977
are shown in Annex 4, T-12 and T-13. The overwhelming bulk (98%) of KDB's
guarantees is in foreign exchange. KDB's guarantee portfolio stood at
/1 The "Government-invested" company - Korea General Chemical Co. (see
para. 3.35).
/2 Promulgated in 1969.
/3 Since 1976 only operational loans were extended.
/4 Including dividend income and capital gains realized.
/5 Usual terms: 7.5% interest and 20 years maturity including 5 years
of grace.



- 32 -
W 3,278.8 billion (US$6.7 billion) as of December 31, 1977, about 3.3 times
its outstanding loan portfolio and an increase of 120% over the outstanding
guarantee portfolio as of December 31, 1975. With the Korea Exchange Bank,
KDB is the major source for foreign currency guarantees. KDB's guarantee
portfolio as of September 30, 1977 is estimated to represent almost 41% of
Korea's total external medium- and long-term debt. KDB's guarantee portfolio
is virtually free of arrears (para. 3.73) and constitutes a major source of
income though the average fee does normally not exceed 0.5% p.a.
3.58      Analysis of Guarantee Operations.  The share of domestic currency
guarantees has decreased to 2.1% in 1977 from 9.5% in 1975. The share of the
private sector in KDB's outstanding portfolio, as of September 30, 1977
increased from 40% in 1975 to 51.1% in 1977 (66% by number of companies).
Correspondingly, the value of commitments to the public sector decreased by
around 66% in 1977 compared with 1976. In the light of this development
KDB's guarantee business is expected to grow less vigorously than in the past
even though guarantee commitments to the public sector are prone to consider-
able fluctuations. An increasing portion of guarantees, amounting to almost
40% in 1977 against 16.5% in 1975, was issued to new projects. During 1977
the average size of guarantees issued for private sector enterprises has
increased substantially from W 1.6 billion in 1976 to W 4.3 billion.
3.59      Ten out of a total of 129 companies accounted for almost 74% of KDB's
total guarantee portfolio outstanding as of September 30, 1977 of which the
largest two /1 alone accounted for 47%. Guarantees exceeding W 2 billion
(US$4.1 million) represented 92.5% of KDB's guarantee portfolio, a slight
reduction over 1976 (95%).   The weighted average duration of guarantees has
also come down slightly from 9.8 years in 1976 to 9.5 years.  The manufactur-
ing sector absorbed only 48% of total guarantees issued in 1977, as against
82% the year before, on account of sizeable guarantee commitments to Korea
Electric Co. (nonmanufacturing) in 1977 (47% of total). Article 25 of the
KDB Act sets a ceiling on KDB's guarantee operations, /2 at 10 times its
paid-in capital and reserves. As of September 30, 1977 the total of KDB's
outstanding guarantees was close to that ceiling (see para. 3.66).
3.60      Guarantee Release Agreement (GRA).  In conjunction with the first
Bank loan, the Government agreed to assume the financial risk for all foreign
guarantees issued or to be issued for those enterprises controlled by the
Government and for priority enterprises as defined in the KDB Act. As of
September 30, 1977, about 86% (W 2.7 trillion) of KDB's total outstanding
guarantee portfolio was covered under the GRA.
Utilization of Bank Loan No. 1338-KO
3.61      As of March 31, 1978, KDB and KILC have committed US$45.3 million
and US$6.3 million respectively of the loan proceeds (US$82.5 million) for
37 subprojects (10 A-projects and 17 B-projects) and 34 subprojects
/1 Korea Electric Co. and Pohang Integrated Iron and Steel Company.
/2 The ceiling includes also the outstanding balance of industrial finance
debentures and bonds and debentures guaranteed by KDB.



- 33 -
respectively. As of the same date, US$14.9 million and US$3.3 million have
been disbursed on KDB's and KILC's portions of the loan. KDB's subloans
ranged in size from US$377,000 to US$5 million with an average of about
US$1.9 million, while KILC's average lease amount was US$165,000, ranging
from about US$25,000 to US$0.5 million. As of September 30, 1977, the
machinery, metal and chemical industries accounted for 34% and 19% each of
KDB's total approvals under the Bank loan. KDB contributed about US$42
million or about 25% to the financing of its clients' total project costs of
about US$168 million, with foreign currency requirements accounting for about
41%. All but two of these projects were for capacity expansion. The 24
projects financed by KDB under the loan are expected to generate 7,100 jobs,
at an average cost per job of about US$24,000. /1 The internal financial
rates of return on these projects range from 15% to 30% with an average of
22%, the ERRs from 21% to 46% with an average of 30%.
D. Financial Position, Performance and Resources
Financial Position
3.62      Assets.  Summarized balance sheets for the years 1974 through
1977, are shown in Annex 4, T-15. During this period, total assets have
steadily grown by an annual average of about 30% to W 1,420 billion (US$2.9
billion) as at December 31, 1977. KDB's loan and investment portfolios
account for around 71% and 17% respectively of total assets (excluding
guarantees).
3.63      Liabilities and Equity.  Of total assets as of December 31, 1977,
25.7% were financed by equity, 60.2% by long-term liabilities /2, and 14.1% by
current liabilities. Borrowings in domestic currency (W 651.7 billion)
accounted for 68% of total long-term liabilities, /3 of which 10.0% has been
raised through the issue of IFDs (8.2% in 1976). The proportion of foreign
currency borrowings (W 274.0 billion) has steadily increased from 17.3% of
total long-term resources as of December 31, 1974, to about 29% in 1977.
This development is mainly attributable to KDB's successful efforts to raise
additional foreign commercial funds to complement its resources available
from international institutions. Time deposits have become a negligible
resource item accounting for 2% of total long-term resources. Current
liabilities /4 increased significantly in 1977 by W 89 billion after a slight
decrease in 1976 compared with 1975; the principal reasons for the increase
in 1977 were a 70% increase in the level of short-term deposits and an 84%
increase in the current portion of long-term debt.
/1  The discrepancy between the average cost per job of projects financed
under the Bank loan (US$24,000) and the US$18,000 for KDB's projects as a
whole, is attributable to the fact that KDB's foreign currency lending
generally goes to larger, more capital-intensive projects, than in the
case of domestic currency financing.
/2 Excluding current portions.
/3 Including current portions.
74T Including current portions of term debts accounting for about 51% of
current liabilities.



- 34 -
3.64      During negotiations for the second Bank loan, KDB undertook to cause
its auditors to carry out an account-by-account review of its portfolio in
order to establish the appropriate amount of provisions for doubtful loans.
Until then, KDB did not show provisions as a separate item on its balance
sheets. For the first time and as a result of the analysis, KDB has made
provisions totalling W 12.8 billion in its balance sheet as of December 31,
1976. Of the total, W 10.1 billion was transferred from legal reserves
and the remaining W 2.7 billion was charged against current income.
3.65      Liquidity Position.  KDB's current ratio dropped perceptibility
from 2.0 in 1976 to 1.3 in 1977. However, the 1977 accounts are unaudited
and are based on a cash rather than on accrual basis; current assets are
accordingly understated and KDB expects that the December 31, 1977 current
ratio will be about 1.7. This decline compared to 1976 is principally due to
the decreases in short-term deposits and the current portion of long-term
debts discussed in para 3.63. The ratio and KDB's liquidity remains fully
satisfactory. Over the past two years, KDB has also been successful in
matching maturities of assets and liabilities with the result that the debt
cover ratio has improved from 1.3 in 1975 to 1.6 in 1977.
3.66      Debt/Equity Ratio.  The KDB Act limits KDB's outstanding guarantees
and IFDs to ten times its equity (para. 3.59); as of September 30, 1977 the
ratio stood at 9.4:1. KDB's long-term debt/equity ratio, as defined in the
Bank's loan documents stood at 3.7:1 as of December 31, 1977, well within
the agreed limit of 5:1. /1 This ratio would have been ever lower if the
Government's capital subscription had been W 25 billion as planned instead of
W 5 billion during 1977. The Government subscribed the remaining W 20 billion
on January 1, 1978.
Financial Performance
3.67      Summarized income statements and cash flow statements for the
period from 1974 through September 1977 and indicators of financial perfor-
mance are shown in Annex 4, T-14, T-16 and T-17. KDB's profitability over
the period 1974-76 should be considered as modest, averaging 1.8% of total
assets and 5.5% of net worth, but has shown a steady improvement. Based on
the unaudited income statements 1977 KDB's profitability has increased
further to about 2.4% of total assets and 8.3% of net worth. These ratios,
however, are somewhat understated since they are not based on accrued
income. Some factors which have contributed to this improvement are:
(a) increased income from investments (dividends as well as capital gains);
and (b) substantially higher income from guarantee operations. Administrative
expenses, on the other hand rose slightly from 1.0% of total assets in 1975,
and 0.8% in 1976 to 1.1% of total assets in 1977; administrative expenses
remain fully under control and are low compared to comparable institutions.
During 1977, KDB's spread /2 remained constant at about 1.1% compared with
1.2% in 1976.
/1 Debt as defined excludes guarantees covered under the Guarantee Release
Agreement.
/2 Defined as income on loan portfolio as percentage of average loan port-
folio minus cost of term debt as percentage of average term debt.



- 35 -
3.68      KDB's income would have been higher in 1976 but for a provision of
W 3.0 billion for foreign exchange losses on Industrial Rationalization Fund
(IRF) loans. Under the IRF agreement, KDB has received funds (e.g., from
USAID) through the Government, or borrowed directly from OECF and Export-Import
Bank of Japan. These funds are denominated in foreign exchange but on-lent
by KDB in won. To be protected against the exchange risk, KDB had to make
the above-mentioned special provision which (until 1975) was limited to 1.5%
of the average outstanding borrowings under the IRF, with any losses due to
exchange rate fluctuations in excess of this reserve to be compensated by the
Government. Since the interest rates borrowers have to pay were raised in
September 1975 from 8% to 12%, and to 13% and 14% in August 1976, KDB's
spread on borrowings from the IRF increased proportionately while borrowing
rates remained unchanged. To limit KDB's net spread on IRF borrowings to
its original level of around 3% the Government decided that KDB should
assume a greater share of the potential exchange risk and the provision was
raised to 6.5% of outstanding borrowings from the IRF. Total provisions
increased accordingly from W 767 million (1975) to W 3,307 million in 1977.
Actual foreign exchange losses in excess of these provisions would still be
assumed by the Government.
Portfolio Quality and Provisions
3.69      Loan Portfolio.  A summary of KDB's loan and guarantee portfolio
in arrears for the years 1974 through September 30, 1977 is given in
Annex 4, T-18 and T-19. As of the latter date, about 88% (493) of KDB's 563
borrowers were operating profitably, 6.4% had their projects still under
construction or in the pre-operating phase, 4.4% (25) were operating at a
loss without being in serious technical or financial difficulties and only
9 clients, or 1.6% by number, were facing serious problems. As of the same
date, 51 clients had arrears of principal and interest, amounting to 2.1 bil-
lion or 0.2% of KDB's total loans outstanding; only a few of them, however,
were in default for more than three months. During 1977 the number of
clients in arrears increased from 33 to 51 and the amount of principal and
interest in arrears from 0.1% (1976) to 0.2% of the total portfolio outstand-
ing. The total portfolio affected by arrears increased from W 6.6 billion or
0.9% as of December 31, 1976, to W 45.5 billion or 5.2% as of September 30,
1977. However, about 66% of KDB's arrears or 90% of the affected portfolio
fall into the less-than-three-months category. Working capital loans
accounted for 50% of the portfolio affected by arrears. In fact, provisional
figures as of December 31, 1977 indicate that the percentage of the portfolio
affected by arrears at year end 1977 has fallen back to only 1.4%. Debt
collection has been highly satisfactory, averaging around 97% over the past
three years (see Annex 4, T-20). KDB's loan portfolio remains very sound,
reflecting the quality of KDB's appraisal and supervision work as well as the
continuing strong performance of the Korean economy. Furthermore, for those
loans made by KDB to public sector enterprises at the Government's behest
(para 3.50), representing about 40% of KDB's outstanding portfolio, the
Government rather than KDB assumed the financial risk.

3.70      The Readjustment Corporation (RAC).  The RAC was established by
KDB in 1962 as a wholly owned subsidiary, with the objective of realizing
KDB's and other banking institutions' claims through foreclosure or disposal
of property. As of December 31, 1976, KDB's claims against the RAC totalled
W 10.3 billion, of which around W 1 billion was not yet settled (September
1977). During 1976, KDB transferred to the RAC loans amounting to W 0.4 bil-
lion while the RAC collected some W 2.2 billion on KDB's behalf; no significant
transfers have taken place during the first nine months of 1977. KDB's total
claims include W 1.6 billion for doubtful accounts, as identified by its
auditors on an account-by-account analysis, which are fully covered by
provisions.
3.71      Reschedulings.  KDB's rescheduling of loans during the past four
years is given in the following table (W billion):
1974      1975       1976        1977
(Jan.-Sept.)
Principal Amount Rescheduled         19.7       45.7       48.7        35.5
(Of which due at time of
rescheduling)                     (17.4)   (29.1)       (30.9)      (28.1)
Projects requiring loan rescheduling are normally reappraised first to deter-
mine whether they are still viable. During 1977 (January-September), KDB
rescheduled several loans to 19 borrowers (W 35.5 billion), representing
about 4% of the outstanding portfolio in comparison with 1976, when 6.6% of
the portfolio (W 48.7 billion) had been rescheduled. The public sector
accounted for W 20.5 billion or 58% of total reschedulings. Loans to one
company,/l amounting to W 15.6 billion (44% of the total), had to be
rescheduled for budgetary reasons./2  Most of KDB's reschedulings are for
working capital loans (rescheduled for the first time).  They appear by and
large justified, and moderate in relation to the size of the portfolio.
3.72      Provision for Doubtful Accounts.  As of September 30, 1977, KDB's
total loans affected by arrears, transferred to the RAC and rescheduled
represented about 9% (W 81 billion) of the outstanding loan portfolio for
which provisions of W 12.8 billion have been made (para. 3.64).  This level of
provisions is more than adequate in the light of the good quality of the
portfolio.
/1 Pohang Iron and Steel Company Ltd.
/2 No allocation was made in the Government budget, against an original
intention to provide for the required amount in the budget; this is
not expected to re-occur in 1978.



- 37 -
3.73      Guarantee Portfolio.  As of September 30, 1977, IKDB had issued
guarantees to 129 companies, totalling W 3,153.7 billion (US$6.5 billion), of
which W 2,296.2 billion (73%) was covered under the GRA. Two companies alone
accounted for 47.3% of the total. Of the 129 companies, 98 (76%) operated
profitably, 19 (15%) were not yet fully operational, and 8 were facing some
operational/financial problems. Seven clients were in arrears, amounting to
W 1.6 billion (W 1.58 billion of principal and W 32 million of overdue fees)
or 0.1% of KDB's total guarantee portfolio outstanding; the portfolio affected
by arrears accounted for 1.5%o (W 45.7 billion) of the total guarantee portfolio.
In all cases but one (W 200 million), clients were in arrears for less than
three months. Two guarantees (outstanding W 4.1 billion) with arrears
amounting to W 268 million were covered under the GRA; the Government
has been notified. During 1977, one guarantee in arrears (W 143 million) was
transferred to the RAC. As with its loan portfolio, KDB's portfolio of
guarantees remains very sound.
3.74      Equity Portfolio.  As of September 30, 1977 KDB had invested
W 211.9 billion in 42 companies, of which 20 were operating profitably, 8
with marginal profits, 6 were not fully operational, 3 were problem projects
but with good prospects for improvement, and 5 were problem projects requiring
close supervision. Listed stocks accounted for around 20% of KDB's equity
portfolio as of December 31, 1977. According to KDB's estimates, its total
equity portfolio of W 160.2 billion as of December 31, 1976 represented a
market value of some W 201.1 billion. In the light of the increased dividend
yield of 3.4% (2.5% in 1976), and the high capital gains realized (138% of
cost) KDB's equity portfolio can be considered very sound. The average
return on equity investments (dividends and capital gains) has increased from
3.8% in 1975 to 6.8% in 1977.
Audit
3.75      KDB's accounts are audited, in accordance with Korean practice, by
an internal auditor appointed by the shareholders who is at the same time a
non-voting member of KDB's Board. In addition, KDB has its accounts audited
by external auditors. Both in 1975 and 1976, San Kyong & Company, KDB's
auditors, (a firm acceptable to the Bank), have issued unqualified reports.
Resources
3.76      KDB's resource position as of December 31, 1977 is shown in
Annex 4, T-21; terms and conditions of long-term borrowings as of the same
date are summarized in Annex 4, T-22. KDB's resources totalled W 1,397.5 bil-
lion (US$2.88 billion), including W 1,174 billion (or 84%) for domestic
currency long-term financing, W 153.0 billion (11%) for foreign currency
lending; and W 70.5 billion (5%) for short-term financing. Of the total
domestic currency resources, W 160.1 billion was raised in foreign currency
but on-lent by KDB in domestic currency with maintenance-of-value clause.
The adequacy of KDB's resource mobilization efforts is discussed in paras 3.21
to 3.23.



- 38 -
3.77      As of December 31, 1977, KDB had W 47.7 billion (4.1% of total
domestic currency funds) resources available for commitments in domestic
currency, and W 13.8 billion (19% of total funds) for commitments in foreign
currency. Of total short-term funds around 72% had been committed and 27%
(W 18.8 billion) was available for additional commitment. On the face of it,
KDB's resource position seems tight. KDB,:however, is not expected to
face any serious resource constraints in the near future because of the
availability to it of: (a) the increase in its capital of W 20 billion on
Janaury 1, 1978 (para 3.66) and the additional Government and NIF funds
earmarked for KDB in 1978 Operational Program (W 284 billion); and (b) pros-
pective overseas borrowings, including the proposed Bank loan, a new loan
from ADB (US$50 million), and a fully subscribed DM-bond issue (US$48 million
equivalent) in the German market (concluded in December 1977).
3.78      Domestic Currency Resources.  KDB's equity continues to be its
largest single source of domestic funds, accounting for 26.1% of total
resources (30% as of December 31, 1976). During 1977, the Government contri-
buted W 5 billion (W 71.7 billion in 1976) in cash to KDB's capital, while
the other W 20 billion expected under the 1977 Operational Program was
not paid in until January 1, 1978. To allow for additional capital contri-
butions in the future, the KDB Act was recently amended (para. 3.34) to
increase KDB's authorized capital from W 300 to 600 billion.
3.79      NIF.  Borrowings from the National Investment Fund (NIF), amounting
to W 298.3 billion or around 21% of total resources, constitute KDB's second
largest domestic source of funds. Interest charges of between 13% and
14%, depending on the duration of loans, give KDB a 1.5% spread. The
NIF, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, /1 derives
its funds from direct Government contributions, sale of NIF-bonds to National
Savings Associations, Welfare Pension Fund System, Postal Insurance and Trust
Companies and others, and from repayment of loans. Though KDB receives
its allocations on an annual basis, disbursements are based on individual
projects.
3.80      With W 202.2 billion  or 14.5% of total resources (14.5% in 1976),
borrowings from the Government have been another major source of funds. The
interest charged to KDB ranges from 2-15% with a weighted average of 6.1%.
The funds derive from two major sources: (a) USAID counterpart funds, /2
bearing very low interest rates; and (b) the Economic Development Fund, with
relatively high interest rates. Allocations for the latter are made on the
basis of specific projects.
3.81      Loans from the Tourism Development Funds have increased from
negligible W 325 million in 1976 to W 4,760 million.
/1  Policy decisions are made by the NIF Management Council; the fund is
managed, however, by BOK.
/2  Duration 10-35 years with 5 years grace period; no new loans have
however been made by the Government to KDB during the past few years.



- 39 -
3.82      Industrial Rationalization Fund (IRF)./l  This fund was created in
1972 to provide financial assstance on preferential rates (8P7) to priority
industries. Its resources consist of W 55.1 billion of borr-7ngs from the
Government and outstanding IFDs of W 3.7 billion. Govornment funds lent to
IRF consist of USAID counterpart funds, and the Japanwe OECF and Ex-Im Bank
funds which have dollar/yen maintenance of value clauses and entail an
exchange risk for KDB of up to 6.5%, /2 for which KDB has made provisions.
3.83      Time deposits and revolving funds contributed only 0.9% to KDB's
total resources. The latter originate from subloan collection exceeding
KDB's own repayment obligations of USAID and KfW loans with fixed repayment
schedules. KDB avoids foreign exchange losses from this operation by speed-
ing up the on-lending of these funds and/or by converting them temporarily
into foreign currency.
3.84      Industrial Finance Debentures (IFDs).  KDB issues two to three year
industrial finance debentures, both to augment its resources and to stimulate
capital market development. Issuance of IFDs by KDB requires the approval of
the National Assembly, as repayment of IFDs is guaranteed by Government. KDB
intends to rely increasingly on IFDs with gradually longer maturities, to the
extent that market conditions permit. During 1977 total domestic currency
IFDs outstanding have increased by W 57.3 billion to W 95.3 billion./3 IFDs
are presently issued at nominal interest rates of 12% and 13% depending on
duration. Their effective cost to KDB, however, is higher as interest is
payable one year in advance. Given a maximum interest rate of presently 16%
chargeable by KDB, (for instance, for working capital loans) the use of these
resources is unlikely to be profitable, even though KDB is compensated /4 by
the Government for losses relating to Government designated projects.
3.85      Foreign Currency Resources.  As of December 31, 1977, KDB's total
foreign currency resources amounted to W 313.1 billion (US$645 million),
not including the fully subscribed DM 100 million (approximately US$48 mil-
lion bond issue /5 of December 1977. KDB was particularly active in raising
/1 Administered by KDB.
/2 Losses in excess of 6.5% are assumed by the Government (see para. 3.68).
/3 Including W 3.7 billion IFDs issued on the account of the IRF.
/4 In 1976 KDB obtained compensations of W 185 million on claims of
W 198 million.
/5 The bond issue, at par (7.25% interest, 7 years' duration) has been
arranged by Deutsche Bank as the Manager of the Consortium.



- 40 -
funds from the foreign capital market in 1976, for a total of W 84.7 billion
(US$171.5 million) from: (a) a 5-year Eurodollar loan of US$80 million, of
which about US$39 million had been drawn as of September 30, 1977; (b) a
7-year loan of Y 25 billion (US$17 million) from a Japanese banking consor-
tium; and (c) issuance of foreign currency IFDs of three to five year maturi-
ties for US$25 million in Abu Dhabi, and for US$24.5 and US$25 million,
respectively in the Eurodollar and Asiandollar market. Some of KDB's foreign
commercial funds, namely, W 160.6 billion or almost 51% of KDB's total
foreign currency resources, have been relent in domestic currency with a
maintenance of value clause. To minimize the exchange risk on undisbursed
funds, KDB keeps temporarily compensating balances in foreign currency. As
of January 1, 1978, the Government has instructed KDB not to onlend foreign
commercial funds in domestic currency because of the effect of this action in
increasing the money supply. During 1977 (Jan.-Sept.) KDB suffered a small
foreign exchange loss of W 1.1 million (US$2,270). In addition to its
commercial borrowings, KDB obtained in 1976 its second Bank loan (US$82.5
million) and a DM 20 million loan from KfW of Germany. In 1977 KDB raised
US$71.7 million in foreign IFDS.
E. Prospects and Resource Requirements
Business Projections
3.86      As discussed in para. 1.13, the outlook for the Korean economy in
general and the manufacturing sector in particular is bright. GNP is expected
to grow at an annual rate of 9.2% fueled by a 16.5% annual growth in the
volume of manufactured exports between 1977 and 1981. The manufacturing
sector as a whole is expected to grow at about 14% per annum in the period.
In order to sustain the projected GNP growth rate of 9.2% p.a., gross fixed
investment will need to rise at 7.8% p.a. between 1977 and 1981.
3.87      KDB has projected its future level of operations by examining both
the total level of funds, domestic and foreign, that it believes it could
obtain and the share of gross fixed capital formation in Korea that it
believes it could finance. KDB has calculated a time series formula for the
total level of resources available to it in each year since 1971 and used
this to forecast future fund availability in the light of the 1978 Operational
Program (see paras. 3.05 and 3.43) and the prospects for the economy. On the
basis of making approvals each year at a level equal to its forecast fund
availability, KDB's share of gross fixed capital formation would increase
from 11-12% in 1977 to about 15% in 1981. This level is thought by KDB to be
attainable and therefore the fund availability method has been used by KDB in
projecting its future level of total operations.
3.88      The average level of annual investment approvals including the
underwriting of municipal and corporate debentures was 15.5% of total busi-
ness volume in the last five years. However, as it is KDB's policy to
gradually phase out investments in excess of the ceiling under the Policy



- 41 -
Statement (see para. 3.35), annual investment approvals are only forecast at
10% of total operations. Thus loan approvals are forecast at 90% of total
projected operations. Working capital loan approvals have averaged 12.2% of
total fund supply over the past five years but are projected to average 15%
in the next five years because of the projected high demand for these funds.
Capital (i.e. equipment) loans are therefore forecast at 75% of total opera-
tions and the share of foreign currency loans to total capital loans is
expected to rise by 1% per year from 12% in 1978 to 16% in 1982. The 1978
projections are based on the 1978 Operational Program.
3.89      A summary of projected operations is shown in Annex 4, T-23.  Total
commitments are expected to increase from W 453 billion (US$934 million) in
1978 to W 778 billion (US$1.6 billion) in 1982 - an average annual increase
of 14.75%. Foreign loan commitments are expected to increase from W 48 bil-
lion (US$99 million) in 1978 to W 93 billion (US$192 million) in 1982 - an
average annual increase of 18%. Domestic currency commitments are expected
to rise from W 405 billion (US$835 million) in 1978 to W 685 billion
(US$1.41 billion) in 1982 - an average annual increase of 14%. The breakdown
of projected domestic currency commitments in 1978 is 85% equipment loans, 6%
working capital loans and 9% equity investments while the breakdown in 1982
is expected to be 71% equipment loans, 17% working capital loans and 12%
equity investments. The level of operations projected by KDB appears to be
realistic and attainable. As in the past, the actual level of KDB's opera-
tions will continue to be determined by resource availability rather than
restricted by a lack of demand for capital. KDB's five-year projections
should be regarded as a highly tentative long-range planning exercise,
undertaken partly in order to comply with the requirements of KDB's institu-
tional lenders (e.g. ADB and IBRD). KDB's actual planning consists of its
annual Operational Programs (para 3.05) which, in spite of its relatively
short time frame (one year), represents an effective tool for KDB and the
Government to plan ahead reasonably firmly for both KDB's financing and its
resources.
Resource Requirements
3.90      To meet its forecast commitments KDB plans to borrow a total of
W 2,673 billion (US$5.5 billion) between 1978 and 1982. Domestic currency
borrowings are projected at W 2,035 billion (US$4.2 billion or 76% of total
borrowings) and foreign currency borrowings at W 638 billion (US$1.3 billion
or 24% of total borrowings). KDB's annual projected borrowing program is
shown in the table below:

Total borrowings          456,550  429,412  522,633  621,929  652,291
3.91      Borrowings from both the Government and the NIF are expected to
increase by 18% per year, reflecting the increasing demand for investment
during the Fourth Plan period, and will total W 617 billion (US$1.27 billion)
and W 1,068 billion (US$2.2 billion) respectively. In addition KDB plans to
raise W 400 billion (US$825 million) through the issuance of domestic IFDs;
this represents 20% of KDB's projected domestic borrowings in the period
1978-82. KDB's plans for domestic resource mobilization efforts are satis-
factory. Furthermore an amount of US$615 million or 46% of KDB's foreign
exchange borrowings are expected to be raised from commercial sources as
opposed US$715 million or 54% from official sources; this level of private
foreign resource mobilization is also considered satisfactory. The actual
amount of foreign commercial borrowings that KDB would be able to raise will,
of course, depend on Korea's continued creditworthiness and the situation of
the international capital markets. More specifically, it will depend on the
Government's decision regarding the appropriate amount of foreign commercial
funds which KDB is allowed to raise in any given year, within the framework
of the overall inflow of such funds into Korea for the year. Besides borrowings,
KDB's resources are expected to be supplemented by an increase in its capital
of W 236 billion (US$486 million) between 1977 and 1982 and by retained
earnings of W 294 billion (US$606 million).
3.92      In late April 1978, KDB was involved in arranging a foreign commercial
syndicated loan of US$300-US$500 million, at terms and conditions still to be
determined. The proceeds of the loan are to be allocated to KDB, the Korea
Exchange Bank and some Korean commercial banks and it is yet unclear how much
of this loan KDB will receive. $100 million is the present best estimate. KDB



- 43 -
has also already raised in 1978 a foreign bond issue of US$43 million (equi-
valent) in Japan and has received a US$100 million loan from the Korean
Government's official foreign exchange reserves. Together with its planned
borrowings from all official sources, the net effect of the above described
arrangements will be an increase of about $93 million in KDB's foreign
borrowings in 1978 over the planned borrowing program shown in para 3.90. /1
KDB believes that it will be able to increase its foreign lending in 1978/79
accordingly and the current strong demand for import financing suggests that
KDB's plan is feasible. /2
3.93      As mentioned in para 3.85, KDB is now no longer permitted to onlend
foreign commercial borrowings in domestic currency. To maintain its level of
domestic lending operations at the planned level shown in Annex 4, T-23, KDB
currently plans to raise an additional W 80 billion in domestic IFDs between
1978-82 over and above the amount shown in the table in para 3.90. At present,
however, it does not plan to cut down its foreign commercial borrowings by an
equivalent amount but to increase its foreign lending by a further W 80 bil-
lion. /2
Guarantee Operations
3.94      KDB has forecast the level of its guarantee operations by project-
ing the inflow of annual foreign commercial loans to Korea and assuming that
it will guarantee about 60% of these loans. On this basis, new guarantee
issuance will be about US$1.1 billion per annum between 1978 and 1982. A
guarantee fee of 0.5% per annum has been assumed.
Financial Forecasts
3.95      KDB's projected balance sheets, income statements and cash flow
statements for the years 1977-82 are shown in Annex 4, T-24, T-25 and T-26.
Net income is expected to increase from W 49 billion in 1978 (2.5% of average
total assets) to W 75 billion in 1982 (2.3% of average total assets).
Financial expenses are expected to be about 6.4% of average total assets
while gross income is expected to decline slightly from 10.2% of total assets
in 1978 to 10.1% in 1982, with the result that the gross spread is expected
to decline slightly from 3.8% in 1978 to 3.7% in 1982. Administrative
expenses are expected to rise slightly from 0.9% in 1978 to 1.1% of average
/1 An increase of US$43 million in foreign commercial borrowing and an
increase of US$50 million in official borrowings due to borrowings from
Korea's official reserves of US$100 million rather than $50 million as
planned.
/2 KDB's recent borrowing arrangements and adjustments to its lending
program discussed in paras 3.92 and 3.93 are not reflected in the
projections shown in Annex 4, T-23, T-24, T-25 and T-26, and discussed
elsewhere in this section. At this stage they are only tentative and are
subject to review and change (para 3.89).



- 44 -
total assets in 1982, principally as a result of higher staff salaries and
personnel expenses, which are forecast to increase at 30% per annum. KDB's
debt service coverage is expected to remain satisfactory at around 1.5 times
in each year. KDB's profitability will remain adequate on the basis of these
forecasts after having shown an improvement over the past three full years
(1974-76) when net income averaged about 1.8% of average total assets.
3.96      Total assets are forecast to increase from W 1,770 billion in
1978 (US$3.65 billion) to W 3,520 billion (US$7.63 billion) in 1982 - an
average annual growth rate of 18.5%. The current ratio is expected to be
around 1.5 throughout the period, which is satisfactory. KDB's long-term
debt/ equity ratio is expected in 1978 to be 4.0:1 and to decline to 3.53:1
in 1982 and to remain throughout the projection period within the agreed
limit /1 of 5.0:1 contained in the loan agreements for two preceding Bank
loans.
4. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Recommendations and Justification
4.01      KDB's performance continues to be highly satisfactory from both
the developmental and institutional points of view. By the multiplicity of
its activities and the magnitude of its operations, KDB exerts a decisive
impact on the Korean economy. It has been instrumental in the development of
major industries in Korea. Apart from effectively performing the usual
functions of a development finance institution, it also acts as the executing
arm of the Government in the formulation, implementation and financing of
major investment projects deemed of national importance. It undertakes
considerable research work and contributes valuable inputs into Government
policies in the financial and industrial sectors. To supplement its own
development banking activities and help improve the Korean financial system,
it has taken the initiative in establishing specialized subsidiaries to
operate in the machinery leasing business and merchant banking. It has
mobilized substantial and increasing amounts of private resources, partic-
ularly from the foreign capital market, to supplement its official resources.
Finally, with its high operational standards, particularly in project
appraisal and follow-up, KDB is an efficient intermediary for allocating
funds (including the Bank's) to Korea's key industrial sector.
4.02      A Bank loan of $110 million is recommended, which is estimated to
finance slightly less than one half of KDB's foreign currency commitments
over a two-year period from July 1, 1978. As indicated in para. 3.14, the
economic rates of return on a large sample of KDB-financed projects range
from 15 to 50%. As noted in para. 3.12, projects financed by KDB during
1975/76 are estimated to export as much as 50% of their incremental output.
Subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan - the overwhelming bulk of
which would be in the manufacturing private sector - are expected to yield
/1   Debt as defined under this limit excludes guarantees covered by the
Guarantee Release Agreement.



- 45 -
similar economic benefits. These subprojects are expected to create appro-
ximately 14,000 new jobs at a cost per job of about U$28,000, and to have a
beneficial impact on smaller enterprises through the widespread practice of
subcontracting. The Bank's association with KDB, although of relatively
recent date, has already proved to be a productive and mutually beneficial
one. Through KDB as an intermediary, Bank resources (totaling US$112 million
on a commitment basis) have been efficiently allocated to 95 projects (including
34 leasing projects financed through KILC) which are economically as well as
financially viable, in the manufacturing, mining, infrastructure and transport
sectors of the Korean economy. This association has enabled the Bank,
notwithstanding the relatively low proportion of its financing in relation to
KDB's overall resources, to exert its influence in encouraging KDB to improve
its operational standards as well as to enhance its developmental impact. It
is expected that over the period of commitment of the proposed loan, KDB will
achieve further progress from both the institutional and developmental points
of view.
Main Features of Loan
4.03      Financing of KILC.  Under the previous Bank Loan 1338-KO, a compo-
nent of US$7.5 million /1 (out of a total loan amount of US$82.5 million) was
earmarked specifically for financing small- and medium-sized leasing projects
by KILC, a wholly-owned KDB subsidiary (referred to in para. 3.17). The Bank
decided to finance leasing projects through KILC under the previous loan to KDB
because KILC's leasing business, aimed primarily at medium-sized and small
enterprises whose limited capital base and borrowing capacity did not allow
them to make outright purchases, served a useful function within the Korean
industrial financing system. KDB has requested the authority to utilize up to
US$10 million (out of US$110 million) under the proposed loan for further
financing of leasing projects through KILC. It is recommended that the Bank
accede to this request. It is further recommended, for the sake of administra-
tive simplicity, that instead of creating a separate component for financing
KILC as with the previous Bank loan, KDB be authorized to onlend this US$10 mil-
lion amount to KILC in the form of a subproject loan. (This subproject, ex-
ceeding the proposed free limit referred to in paragraph 4.05 will require
the Bank's review prior to approval.) In view of the Bank's satisfactory
/1 As of April 28, 1978, about US$6.4 million had been committed for 33
leasing projects.



- 46 -
experience with KILC's operations to date, the administrative safeguards
which were built into the component under the previous loan no longer appear
necessary. However, the project eligibility criteria (namely, a ceiling of W
600 million on total assets of leasing enterprises; and a limit of US$15,000
on the cost per job for leasing projects), whicB applied to the component
under the previous loan, will continue to apply to leasing projects to be
financed by KILC under the proposed loan. This understanding was confirmed
at negotiations.
4.04      Financing of Foreign Exchange Component of Domestic Equipment.
Apart from direct imports, it is recommended that KDB be authorized to use
the proceeds of the proposed loan for financing the foreign exchange compo-
nent of domestically manufactured capital goods estimated at 60%. This
authority should further enhance KDB's current efforts (para. 3.48) to inten-
sify its assistance to the rapidly expanding Korean machinery industry.
4.05      Free Limit.  In view of the satisfactory and improving standards
of KDB's project appraisal work (para. 3.37), it is recommended that the
free limit, set at US$1.5 million under the last preceding Bank loan, be
raised to US$2.5 million under the proposed loan. It is estimated that under
this new free limit, projects accounting for 15% of-the total number of
subloans and 40% of the total loan amount would still require Bank review
prior to approval.
4.06      Ceiling on Subloans and Sectoral Diversification.  To ensure that
the proceeds of the loan would be spread over a relatively large number of
projects, a ceiling of US$7.5 million /1 would be set on the size of indi-
vidual subloans, (as against US$5 million under the previous loan). Further,
to ensure satisfactory sectoral diversification in the use of the Bank
loan, not more than 25% of the total loan amount would be used by KDB to
finance any single industrial activity or subsector.
4.07      Debt/Equity Limit.  It is recommended that the contractual limit
on KDB's long-term debt, set at 5 times its net worth under the first and
second Bank loan agreements, be maintained. According to KDB's projections
(para. 3.96), this limit is sufficient to accommodate KDB's proposed addi-
tional borrowings over the next several years.
4.08      Relending Rate.  KDB intends to onlend the proceeds of the proposed
loan at a rate which would give it a spread of 2 percentage points. Such a
spread is in line with the practice of Korean government-owned financial
institutions in relending foreign exchange resources borrowed from interna-
tional sources (IBRD, ADB, et al), and, in KDB's case, is more than adequate
to cover the cost incurred in the processing of foreign currency lending.
The onlending rate to the subborrowers of about 9.5% (assuming a Bank lend-
ing rate of 7.5%) would represent a positive real rate of interest provided
the Government manages to maintain inflation within 7% per annum as projected
in the Fourth Plan. Should the Government fail to achieve this objective and
inflation in Korea exceed present projections, adjustments in the won/dollar
/1 With the exception of KDB's onlending to KILC referred to in para. 4.03.



- 47 -
rate could be expected to take place which, considering that subborrowers
bear the exchange risk, would maintain the real interest rate at a positive
level. Over the period 1960-76, when inflation ran at an average of 15%
p.a., the depreciation of the won vis-a-vis the dollar averaged 7% p.a. It
should also be noted that under the Bank's practice of disbursing its loans
to DFCs, the greater part of these disbursements in recent years was in
hard currencies (e.g. Swiss Francs, Deutsche Marks and Japanese Yens) which
have been appreciating against the dollar, adding to the effective cost of
Bank funds to subborrowers. This pattern of the Bank's disbursements is
expected to continue. In view of the foregoing, the proposed relending rate
of 9.5% appears adequate.
4.09      Amortization Schedule.  As is usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule reflecting substan-
tially the aggregate of the repayment schedules of individual subloans made
by KDB. The loan is expected to be fully repaid within 17 years including a
grace period of three years. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in
Annex 4, T-28.
Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
4.10      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
matters:
(a) the maintenance of the long-term debt/equity limit at 5:1
(para. 4.07);
(b) a percentage of 60 representing the foreign exchange component of
domestically produced capital goods (para. 4.04);
(c) a free limit of US$2.5 million on subprojects (para. 4.05); and
(d) a ceiling of US$7.5 million in individual subloans and a limit of
25% of the loan amount (or US$27.5 million) on the financing by
KDB of any given industrial activity or subsector (para. 4.06).
4.11      In addition, the following matters were reviewed, and under-
standings reached with KDB (recorded in agreed minutes):
(a) the objectives outlined by KDB in its statement of Development
Strategy for 1978/79 (para. 3.24);
(b) the onlending of up to US$10 million of the loan proceeds by KDB
to KILC in the form of a subproject loan for financing leasing
projects meeting specific eligibility criteria (para. 4.03);



- 48 -
(c) KDB's procurement procedures and practices; and
(d) KDB to set up a Project Monitoring System for a representative sample
of about 50 projects financed under the two preceding Bank loans,
with the objective of evaluating progress at critical stages of
project implementation and of analysing actual project costs/benefits
in comparison with appraisal estimates.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
Outline of Develoment Strategy for 1978/79
KDB will endeavor to enhance both its qualitative and quantitative
contribution to the Korean economy. During the five-year period 1978-82, KDB
plans to provide financing to industry for a total amount of W 2,756 billion
(US$5.68 billion) in domestic currency and US$700 million in foreign currency.
KDB aims to increase its share of gross fixed capital formation in Korea from
10% on average during the Third Plan period to 13.5% on average during the
Fourth Plan period (1977-81). In parallel with the expansion of its financ-
ing, KDB will in the two-year period 1978/79 further accelerate its develop-
ment activities particularly in the specific areas outlined below.
I. Project Promotion and Resource Allocation
(a)  KDB will give priority financing to skill intensive, export-
oriented industrial sectors such as machinery, electronics and
basic metals.
(b)  KDB will increase its emphasis on financing private sector projects.
(c)  KDB will increase the share of foreign currency lending in its
annual disbursements from 12.1% on average during the Third Plan
period to 16.1% during the Fourth Plan period.
(d)  KDB plans to expand its consultancy role to clients and prospective
clients in the areas of project formulation, project design, choice
of technology, engineering and project analysis.
(e)  KDB will also continue to expand its contribution to the finan-
cial and industrial sectors through further development of its
subsidiary companies - KILC, SMBC and KASI.
(f)  Additionally, KDB will endeavor to enhance its resource allocation
efficiency by:
(i) evaluating the forward and backward linkages of all capital
and technology intensive projects;
(ii)  taking into account Korea's areas of international competitive
advantage when evaluating export-oriented and import substitu-
tion projects; and
(iii)  scrutinizing carefully the employment impact of all industrial
projects with particular regard to regional distribution of
employment and to income distribution effects.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
II. Resource Mobilization
In line with its objective of intensifying its efforts at raising
private resources, KDB plans to: (a) issue domestic bonds (IFDs) for a total
amount of W 165 billion; and (b) borrow from the foreign commercial markets a
total amount of US$260 million during the two-year period 1978-79.
III. Research and Inputs into Government Policy Formation
(a)  KDB plans to complete its study on Industrial Rationalization
(para. 3.07) in late 1978 or early 1979.
(b) KDB will seek an amendment of the KDB Act to enable it to conduct
research and consultancy work, on a commissioned basis, for both
private and public corporations.
IV. Organization.
To deal with the problem of staff attrition (para. 3.32), KDB will
seek, as a matter of high priority, to further increase the
productivity of its existing staff.

Policy Statement /1
Economic Role of KDB
1.        The KDB shall assist in the economic development of Korea in confor-
mity with its purposes as stated in the Korea Development Bank Act (KDB Act)
enacted December 30, 1953, as amended, its By-Laws enacted February 16,
1954, as amended, and the other regulations governing its operations.
Operations
2.        The KDB will carry out its operations in accordance with sound
management and banking principles and practices. It shall endeavour to
specialize in extending capital funds to such industries as are designated
by the Government's economic plans or decrees as priority industries as well
as other major basic industries which form the substructure of the economy.
KDB may also make equity investments, provide working capital loans and
render managerial and technical assistance to its Borrowers when the need
arises. KDB will also extend guarantees on behalf of client enterprises.
KDB, however, will not compete with other financial institutions in lending
and administering industrial funds to assist major industries.
Project Selection
3.        It will finance enterprises which are soundly managed and which
appear, on careful economic, financial and engineering investigation to be
viable. Following sound banking practices, the projects will be analyzed
taking the following factors into consideration before making a commitment
of financial assistance: (a) national economic benefits; (b) technical
feasibility; (c) financial soundness and profitability; (d) marketability;
and (e) quality of management.
Criteria for Selection of Borrowers
4.        In its operations, preference will be given to the following major
industries:
(a) Generation, transmission and supply of electricity;
/1 Approved as a condition of effectiveness of Loan No. 1095-KO by KDB's
Board of Executive Directors on April 4, 1975.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
(b) Coal-mining;
(c) Ship-building;
(d) Iron and steel manufacturing;
(e) Electronics;
(f) Export industries, designated by the Government to produce export
commodities;
(g) Import-substitution industries and industries producing raw
materials necessary for export and import-substitution;
(h) Indigenous industries and labor intensive industries; and
(i) Such other industries as may be designated by the Government's
economic plans or decrees as priority industries.
Qualifications for Eligible Borrowers
5.        Eligible borrowers for KDB financing must meet the following qualifi-
cations:
(a) Borrowers must be financially sound;
(b) Borrowers must possess management and technical capacity for
implementing the projects being financed;
(c) Borrowers should not have defaulted on any of their outstanding
obligations to KDB.
Maximum Investment and Assistance
6.   (a)  KDB shall not subscribe to and/or underwrite stocks (including
investment certificates) if the paid-up amount of the stocks so
held by KDB will exceed KDB's own paid-up capital;
(b) KDB shall not normally make equity investments in any single
enterprise in excess of either:
(i) fifteen percent (15%) of the total unimpaired paid-up capital,
surplus, and free reserves of KDB; or
(ii) fifty percent (50%) of the paid-up capital of the enterprise.
(c) KDB shall not normally extend financial assistance to any single
enterprise which exceeds either of the following ceilings:



ANNEX 3
Page 3
(i) twenty-five percent (25%) of KDB's total unimpaired
paid-up capital, surplus and free reserves;
(ii) sixty-five percent (65%) of the total assets of the
enterprise.
Foreign Exchange Risk
7.        As a general policy, KDB shall cover itself adequately against
foreign exchange risks in the conduct of its operations. However, in using
"revolving funds" generated in the case of some foreign borrowings, KDB may
assume the exchange risk temporarily. Also in using some funds provided
under the Industrial Rationalization Fund Scheme, KDB may be exposed to the
exchange risk. To cover the risk in the latter case, KDB will make provision
amounting to 1.5% of such funds outstanding from time to time. Exchange
losses exceeding the provision made by KDB, will be reimbursed by the Govern-
ment.
Security Arrangements
8.   (a)  In accordance with normal business practices, KDB will obtain
adequate security for its loans and guarantees. In extending a
loan to an enterprise, KDB shall require such enterprise to provide
security the value of which shall be not less than 125% of the
amount of the loan. In the case of guarantees covered by a Govern-
ment counter-guarantee the value of security shall be not less than
the amount guaranteed, and in all other cases of guarantees, shall
be not less than 120% of the principal amount covered under such
guarantees.
(b) KDB may waive any of the foregoing requirements in cases where
the credit or the guarantee is extended in favor of those enterprises
enumerated in para. 2, Article 10 of the Operationg Manuals of KDB
as of the date of this Policy Statement, provided, however, that in
such cases KDB will endeavor to secure a guarantee or counter-guarantee
from the Government or from a suitable bank or banks to cover the
credit or guarantee granted.
Technical Assistance
9.        KDB will endeavor to provide its subborrowers with the necessary
technical services including assistance for upgrading production efficiency
and solving complicated technical difficulties. It will observe the operation
of its subborrowers and will, whenever necessary, promptly make available to
them constructive and remedial advice on the operation of the project. When
considered necessary, KDB will also dispatch its own staff to the project
companies.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Management and Organization
10.       To build and strengthen its own management and staff as well as to
assist clients in the formulation and execution of their projects, KDB will
maintain an effective organization and an adequate staff, including financial
and economic analysis, engineering, accountancy, marketing and legal services.
Share-Holding Fund
11.       KDB shall administer the Share-holding Administration Fund (the
Fund) pursuant to the provisions of the KDB Share-holding Act (Act No. 2128,
enacted 4 August 1969) as a separate and distinct account in KDB's official
books, the Fund will be treated as segregated from the other transactions and
resources of KDB in accordance with the provisions of said Act.
Financial Policies
12.       KDB shall conduct its operations according to the provisions of the
KDB Act.  It shall endeavor to match the maturity of its liabilities with
those of its assets. It will continually review the charges it levies for
the financial assistance it provides to ensure that it receives an adequate
"spread" to cover all its expenses including provisions for doubtful loans
and investments, and to enable it to build reserves as required legally and
as considered necessary by the management.

respective loan accounts are shown under "Credit Control Account" - a current liability item. The out-
standing balances under Credit Control Accounts as of the end of 1972 through 1977 were as follows:

La  The 1977 income statement is unaudited and is based on a cash rather than
accrual basis. It is therefore not fully comparable with the income
statements for 1974-76 and understates the income position in 1977.
Lb  In terms of the provisions of the KDB Act, the entire net income of KDB is
transferred to "Legal Reserves." The Government of Korea which is the sole
shareholder of KDB does not receive any dividend.
