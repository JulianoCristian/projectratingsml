The general principles for the framework\n            include : minimizing resettlement and land acquisition where\n            possible; compensating, relocating, and rehabilitating\n            project affected persons (PAPs); compensating all PAPs for\n            their losses and/or income rehabilitation without regard to\n            their legal rights; setting compensation at full replacement\n            cost for houses and other structures, agricultural land of\n            equal productive capacity, replacement of residential land\n            at least of equal size, full compensation for crops, trees,\n            and other similar agricultural products at market value;\n            providing transportation assistance and home\n            reestablishment, a dislocation allowance, along with\n            providing residential land and replacement cost of homes;\n            replacing land-for-land as the preferred option, or\n            substituting cash ; minimizing the resettlement transition\n            period; maintaining or improving the previous level of\n            community services and access to resources; and arranging\n            effective and timely internal and external monitoring of the\n            implementation of resettlement measures."}, "docdt": "2005-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
