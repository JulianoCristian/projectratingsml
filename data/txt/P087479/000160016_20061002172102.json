It is foreseen however, that the\n            construction of schools and facilities, will pose adverse\n            environmental effects, thus this environmental assessment\n            presents mitigation measures as follows. Minimum design\n            standards will be ensured, to include latrines, boarding\n            accommodations, and school fencing and other security\n            measures. Construction contractors shall comply with\n            standards, as per precautionary clauses included in the\n            technical specifications. Integrated water resources\n            management should be promoted, to include as well rainwater\n            harvesting. Capacity building should particularly target the\n            needs of communities to mainstream their specific needs, in\n            particular, those of underperforming students, orphans, and\n            vulnerable children, or those affected by HIV/AIDS, and\n            vulnerable groups. Likewise, capacity building shall focus\n            on: obtaining land titles as needed; community mobilization;\n            fundraising; liaisons with nongovernmental organizations and\n            the private sector. Public awareness and sensitization\n            campaigns should be promoted to inform communities,\n            particularly in arid and semi-arid lands highlighting\n            pastoral issues and needs. Participatory approaches should\n            be built-in to involve stakeholders, as part of the\n            field-based monitoring process to be implemented. Adequate\n            water supply should be installed to provide hygienic\n            standards in schools. Water quality should be regularly\n            monitored, and water purification programmes should be\n            initiated as required."}, "docdt": "2005-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
