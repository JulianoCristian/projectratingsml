"Ratings for the Livestock Disease\n            Control Project in Brazil are as follows: overall outcome of\n            the project is satisfactory, performance of the Bank was\n            rated satisfactory, and performance of the Borrower was also\n            rated satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the\n            project are: 1) livestock and plant disease control programs\n            should be linked to a government strategy which specifies\n            the policy position for the agricultural sector including\n            the livestock and plant subsectors, and its links to export\n            growth, and shows concrete evidence of being carried out; 2)\n            state level producer associations and municipalities have\n            tremendous potential to participate with government in\n            animal and plant disease control/eradication programs but\n            this needs simpler, more practical mechanisms which avoid\n            legal and operational difficulties; 3) Project\n            organizational structure and lines of responsibility must be\n            simple, clear and rational, heeding political realities and\n            the incentives system affecting the performance of public\n            and other agencies. Project coordinating units should stress\n            decentralized operations, simplified processes and lean\n            staffing; and 4) a project operating manual, with\n            comprehensive rules and norms for project operation, and\n            flexible enough to permit project modification, can be an\n            important factor in spreading the idea and initiating the\n            practice of decentralization."}, "docdt": "1998-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
