INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOI1iENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK FOR A
THIRD DEVELOPEMENT CORPORATION PROJECT WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in various currencies equivalent to $25 million to the Philippine National Bank
(PNB) for relending to the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
(PDCP).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        PDCP was established in February L963 with the Bank Group's
assistance.   The proposed loan, if approved, would be the Bank's third for
PDCP; the first loan (331-PH) of $15 million was made in February 1963 and
the second (467-PH) of $25 million in September 1966.   As in the case of the
first two loans, the proposed loan would be made to PNB, a Government owned
institution, with the guarantee of the Government, and PNB would relend the
proceeds of the loan to PDCP;   under existing law the Government is unable to
guarantee a Bank loan directly to a private corporation.
3.        In December 1968, with the agreement of the Government and PNB,
PDCP asked the Bank to consider making a third loan in an amount of $25 million
to replenish its foreign exchange resources.   A Bank mission appraised PDCP's
operations in March 1969.
4.        In M@ay the Government informed the Bank that in connection with the
proposed loan it would require an explicit understanding between PDCP and
the Government that the proceeds of the loan would be used in conformity with
the Government's economic development policies, programs, and priorities.
As this is consistent with its corporate policies and objectives, PDCP was
quite ready to conform.   We have reviewed the proposed agreement between the
Government, PNB and PDCP, in which this understanding is expressed, and have
found it acceptable (the text appears as Annex 5 to the attached appraisal
report).
5.        Negotiations were held in Washington from Hay 23 to 29, 1969.  The
Government was represented by His Excellency Ernesto V. Lagdameo, Ambassador
to the United States, and Mr. Cesar Virata, Chairman of the Board of Invest-
ments;  PNB by Hr. Arturo R. Cruz, Vice President; and PDCP by Mr. Roberto T.
Villanueva, Chairman and President, Hir. Vicente R. Jayme, Executive Vice
President and Hv1r. R. M. Jalandoni, Attorney.

6.         The proposed loan would be the twelfth in the Philippines and it
would increase the total amount lent to $183.2 million, net of cancellations.

May 31, 1969:

7.        Although project implementation in the public sector has improved,
a number of difficulties still remain with Bank-financed projects as explained
in my Report and Recommendation (No. P-697), dated Niay 15, 1969, in connection
with the Second Rural Credit Project.    The Bank will continue to press the
Government and the Borrowers (NWSA and NPC) to take the necessary actions.
8.        A loan of $35 million for the Upper Pampanga River Irrigation Pro-
ject has been appraised and is expected to be ready for the Executive Direc-
tors' consideration in the next few months.    A Grain Storage Project
requiring a loan of about $15 million is also being appraised and may be ready
for the Executive Directors' consideration later in the year.
9.        IFC's loans and investments in the Philippines consist of an equity
investment of P800,000 (equivalent to $205,000) in PDCP, which has since been
sold to other investors; and an equity investment of $4 million equivalent and
a loan of $8 million in the 1M1anila Electric Company, of which IFC now holds
$3.6 million and $9.3 million, respectively, for its own account.    IFC is
appraising two projects for loan and share investments - Philippine Long Dis-
tance Telephone Company ($4.5 million) and iIariwvasa Aianufacturing, Inc., a
ceramic tile plant ($1,150,000) - and expects to submit these projects to
the Executive Directors for consideration in July or August.

PART HII - THE PROJECT
11.        A report entitled "Reappraisal of Private Development of the
Philippines" (No. DB-51a), dated June 10, 1969 is attached.
12.        At the time PDCP was established in February 1963, IFC made an
equity investment in PDCP of P800,000 (about $205,000) which has since been
sold to other investors at a profit and PDCP obtained a peso loan of P27.5
million (about $7.1 million) from USAID, in addition to the first Bank loan
for PDCP of $15 million.    PDCP's other borrowings consist of two foreign
exchange loans - a second Bank loan of $25 million and an Asian Development
Bank (ADB) loan of $5 million.
13.        By the end of Hay 1969, PDCP had had access to total resources
amounting to over $61.3 million equivalent.    These consisted of share capital,
reserves and retained earnings which totalled about $9.7 million equivalent,
and the four loans totalling $52.1 million from the Bank, USAID and ADB.
14.        In its five and a half years of operations to the end of 1968,
PDCP had made 158 loans totalling $51 million equivalent for 99 projects for
modernization and expansion of existing enterprises and for new ventures. Of
these, 85 loans totalling $36.6 million were in foreign exchange.
15.        PDCP's share investments and underwritings have been modest.   But
there are prospects that PDCP will have increased opportunities to expand
these activities in the future.
16.        At the end of June 1969, PDCP is expected to have uncommitted
foreign exchange resources of about $4 million. On the basis of proposals
in various stages of investigation, PDCP estimates that during the two years
from July 1969 it will be able to commit for loans and other investments a
total of about $36 million equivalent, of which about $29 million will be in
foreign exchange.   PDCP will therefore need new foreign exchange resources of
about $25 million for the two-year period to mid-1971.    PDCP expects to raise
additional peso resources through portfolio sales and peso borrowing.



17.        PDCP has now completed nearly six years of operations.   It has
continued to be a well-organized and smoothly functioning development finance
company.  Its management is able and experienced,- its staff is competent,
and the quality of its project appraisal is good.
18.        PDCP's financial performance is good.    Net profit after taxes has
increased steadily and amounted to P4.9 million at the end of 1968, represent-
ing about IV, of net worth.    Net profit is expected to rise to P7.6 million
by the end of 1971 or about 16% of net worth.    An annual cash dividend of
10% has been paid for the last four years, while adequate allocations have
been made to reserves.   At the end of 1968, reserves and retained earnings
totalled P11.3 million, representing about 5, of its share capital and 11%
of its portfolio.   PDCP's P10 shares were traded at between P14.75 and P15.75
in 1968.   PDCP's financial position is satisfactory;   its investment portfolio
is sound;  and its prospects are good.    PDCP should be able to meet debt
service payments on the proposed loan and other borrowings, as well as to main-
tain satisfactory dividend payments and adequate allocations to reserves.
19.        PDCP is the largest private industrial finance company in the
Philippines.   Its impact on the economy has so far been modest3   PDCP
estimates that its financial assistance accounted for only 4% of total private
industrial investment in 1968.    However, this figure underestimates PDCP's
irnportance, given the care with which it selects projects.   Pioreover, its
significance should increase in future, if it can comm,and adequate resources.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIiENTS AND AUTHORITY
20.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and PNB, the draft
Guarantee Agreement beuween the Republic of the Philippines and the Bank,
the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and PDCP, the Report of the
Comnittee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
21.        The draft loan documents contain provisions norraally used for
development finance company projects and follow the same pattern of the
documents used for the previous two loans made by the Bank to PNB for
relending to PDCP.    The Subsidiary Loan Agreement to be entered into by
PNB and PDCP containing the terms and conditions of such relending has
been approved by the Bank and cannot be amended without the agreement of
the Bank.
22.        In addition, the debt limitation covenants in the previous two pro-
ject agreements are amended to conform with the new debt limitation covenant
set forth in the draft Project Agreement (Sections 2.09, 3.01 and 3.02).

PART V - THE ECONC4Y
23.        An Economic Report on IrThe Current Economic Situation and Pros-
pects of the Philippines" (No. 138a, dated May 24., 1968) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on June 3, 1968 (R68-90).   Plore recent developments
were described in my Report and Recommendation (No. P-697), dated May 15, 1969,
in connection with the Second Rural Credit Project.
24.       As emphasized during presentation of the above menticned project,
we are satisfied that the Government has made significant progress in dealing
with the major long-term problems confronting the economy.    This applies
particularly to progress in increasing public savings in order to strengthen
the economy's infrastructure.   Despite the progress made in augmenting
Government revenues, these are still considerably below the requirements of
the economy.   The Government is fully aware of this and has placed addi-
tional tax bills before Congress.   This being an election year, Congressional
reaction to these is uncertain.   We will continue to support and encourage
the Government's efforts to raise additional revenues.
25.       There has also been a considerable improvement in the policy
framework to facilitate the channeling of private sector resources into
areas and activities which are most conducive to economic growth.    Of
particular significance for the proposed loan, which will be used by the
private sector, is the enactment in 1967 of the Investment Incentives
Act and the setting up in 1968 of the Board of Investments (BOI) to im-
plement that Act.   The BOI is required to select those industrial activi-
ties which have high economic priority but which are unlikely to go forward
at the required pace without the tax incentives provided by the Act.    The
BOI is also charged with the responsibility of determining within each
industrial field the specif'ic projects that will qualify for these incen-
tives.   While the provision of incentives to industry is not a new develop-
ment in the Philippines the detailed and systematic analysis of the BOI is
relatively novel.   It is particularly encouraging that the BOI is determined
to avoid the problems created in the 1950's by the indiscriminate estab-
lishment of industries with heavy protection.   By the end of April 1969,
the BOI had approved 107 projects entailing a total investment of more
than $300 million, of which about $180 million is in foreign exchange.
26.       Despite a short term debt problem brought about by current
balance of payment difficulties, the longer term external indebtedness of
the Philippines is relatively low and the Philippines should be able to
service an increasing inflow of long term capital for the financing of
economically productive investments, including the proposed loan.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE V4ITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
