wi+.th a lonn oe $ 5f million .minr- -y Ai an Dlopmen  Bar.k (AMNB +0 pntp in
March 1969, will meet the foreign exchange requirements of PDCP until mid-1971.
2.        PDCP was established in 1963 to assist private industrial investment

paid-in share capital from P25 million to P27.5 million by the declaration of
a 10% stock dividend, subject to approval by the Securities Exchange Commi3sion
and US Agency for International Development (AID). The Bank has consented to
the increase.
3.        The Bank has made PDCP two loans totalling $4() million.  In
addition, PDCP has received the loan mentioned above of $5 million from
Asian Development Bank. AID made PDCP a peso loan of P27.5 million, subordina-
ted in a liquidation to PDCP's original paid-in share capital of P25 million
and other debt, as part of PDCP's initial financing.
4.        PDCP is well managed and well organized.   Its staff is competent.
PDCP follows good business practices. Its appraisal standards are generally
satisfactory, and its follow-up activities have improvedl. In 1968, PDCP's
ratio of net earnings to average total assets was 3.6%, and to paid-in share
capital, 19.5,%. It has paid a 10% cash dividend each year since 1965.
Reserves and retained earnings reached 45% of its paid-in share capital and
11% of portfolio in 1968. Serious arrears in PDCP's portfolio are small.
No debts or investments have so far been written off.
5.        Thc'uh considerablv smaller than the Government-owned Develonment
Bank of the P'hilippines, PDCP is the largest, in resources, of the four
private investment banks and develonpment cornorations in the Philippines=   Rv
the end of 1968, PDCP's total approvals of loans, guarantees and investments
amounted to S$58.8 million equivalent.  WAhile its prnportionate contribution
to total investment in the private sector is still small, that proportion
has been ercwing and is likely tn nontinue to don so
6.        Prosnpects for PDrP for the next two years appear favorable.  The
average annuZl growth rate of its total assets is projected to be about 24%,
and fhht. of JIon n "mi+i-mpent+ (noti 4-     --4ludin  grtsa,4t 1>ff.  It-

income is forecast to increase by about 15% in each of the two years through
1971.
7.        PD(-P continues to be cr-editiworthy for a furt;her Bank loan.  It will
need an additional $25 million in foreign exchange to meet its projected loan
comUmitments to mi.-d-1971.  In view of its improved appraisal standards, PDLP 's
"free limit" under the proposed Bank loan should be increased to $500,000

8.        Trlf p-rposed loan snould be on the terms usual for Bank loans to
development i'inance companies. In view of PDCP's sound financial position,
it9s orrowirjg limit should be increased from 3:1 to 4.5:1 under the definitic.n
of debt to equity ratio now applied to development finance companies, to enable
PDCGP to inculr additional debt to finance its projected grcfth.  PDCP' hlas been
tuged tco corgsider raising additional slare capital.

1.         This report examines the suitability of Private Development Corpration
of the Philippines (PDCP) as the beneficiary of a third Bank loan.     -te first
Bank loan of IJS$15 million was made in February 1963, as part of PDCP's iniLtial
financing.  A second loan, of $25 million was made in September 1966.     ThiS
report concludes that PDCP needs a third Bank loan to help meet its estimated
requirements of foreign exchange during the next two years, and that it is a
suitable insti-tution for the Bank to lend to. This conclusion, and the report,
are based on a continuing close relationship between the Bank Group and PDCP
since inception of the company, and on the findings of a Bank mission that
visited the Plilippines in March 1969.
2.        When PDCP was established in 1963, IFC subscribed for 80,000 shares a&
par, at a total cost of P800,000 ($205,217 equivalent).    IFC also entered into
a standby agreement in the amount of Fl6,200,000 ($4,1534,86), under which it
did not have -to take up any shares. IFC sold its entire holding of 80,000
shares at a p:. ofit in 1967.
II. ENVIRONMENT AND ROLE
3.        A review of the economy of the Philippines is given in the economlic
report dated lWav 2hL 1968, "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
Philippines" AS-138a.
General Economic Setting
4.         The Philippines has considerable potential for economic growth by
virtue of a literate and technicallv canable population, a relatively favorable
resource endowment and the special relationship that it enjoys with the United
States.  This entails lrarg  inviishle rpncipts fmrm war darrame and veterans
payments, and in recent years considerable U.S. military expenditures in the
Philippines, t1rade preferences intil 1974, although on a dclinng scale 2nd
participation in the U.S. 5ugar quot,.
5.        Another striking feature of the Philippine economy is the dynamism
of the priva;ate sector.    The main Impetus for this sectorP whiich accuMnts frr
more than 80% of gross domestic capital formation, is provided by a relatively
large group of skilled entrepren.eurs.   They i  turn can daw on a literate
labour force, adaptable and quick to learn.
6.        The Philippines has been able to translate these various advantages

- 2-
production drive which in 1968 has made the Philippines self-sufficient in this
important crop for the first time, and the increasing emphasis placed on
previously neglected infrastructure investments.
7.        The development of industry has played an important role in the
Philippines. Industrialization prior to independence in 1946 was mainly based
on industries exporting agricultural and forestry products.   In the late 1940's
a new phase began, characterized by the rapid expansion of industries producing
for the domestic market previously imported consumer goods.   This development
was encouraged primarily by import controls which restricted foreign competition,
and by an over-valued exchange rate which provided imported inputs at subsidized
prices.  As a consequence of the dynamic response of Philippine entrepreneurs to
a nrotected and fast-growing domestic market. the contribution of manufacturing
to net domestic product increased from about 9% in 1946 to nearly 20% in 1963.
DTriing this 1period TT=9' cpnital and know-how also made an important contrlibutiori.
The volume of direct U.S. investments in the Philippines at the end of 1966 was
estimM-ted to be abouit $580 million.
8.       WiThile controls encouraged the production of consumer goods with a
high dependence on imported inputs, negligible duties on intermediate and capital
goods, together with the small size of the domestic market, discouraged domestic
production in this area.  The production of consumer goods still predominates
and represents about two-thirds of total value added in m mlf cturinq. Mohre
than half still entails the processing of agricultural products. However, since
the devaluation of the peso I; the early 1960's, the accom-panying removal of
exchange controls and the subsequent liberalization of imports, value added in
inte rediate and capital goods has grown. at a much faster rate than in consumer
goods, leading to an increase in the share of producer goods in total manufac-
baring output frO Im 2%L in 1963 to 28A in 1967.
9         LLDuring the past three years, the Government has sought further to
encourage investment in intermediate (and therefore larger-scale and more
sophisiLcated) industries, and has shifted from rts earlier policy of encoura-
ging import-substituting activity to one of promoting export-oriented manufac-
ture and the greater utilization of domestic raw materials. MIf' .11T'Vti hn5
not grown dramatically but it has grown, and such favorable factors as availa-
bility of cheap domestic raw materials, relatively low labor costs and the fact
that the maniiufacturing sector appears to have adjusted to the opening up of the
economy suggest that manufacturing will continue to grow.   The present adm.inis-
tration's four-year development program sets a realistic goal of 25/ as industry':
(manufacturing and mining) projected share of the 197C national income. The
1963-1967 average was 20.1%.
10.       As long as the economy of the Philippines remains open, imports are
allowed freely and exchange controls are not imposed, it is likely that the
production costs of successful enterprises establishedi in the country will be
internationally competitive.



- 3 -
11.       The extent and nature of the growth of industry will depend to a large
extent on the effectiveness of the Board of Investments (BOI), an official body
created under the Investment Incentives Act of 1967. The purpose of this Act is
to spur industrial development by channelling new investments into priority
areas.  To this end, the law provides special tax incentives to registered
enterprises engaged in areas of economic activity which are classified either
as pioneer or preferred. Investments can still take place in the areas which as
not considered of high priority but of course they do not enjoy the special tax
incentives.
12.       The function of BOI is to (define annually the economic activities which
are considered desirable, to determine the additional capacity required in these
fields in order to meet domestic requirements and/or to take advantage of export
possibilities, and to approve investrnent proposals intended to create the requiree.
capacity. The BOI, which started to function in 1968, has assembled an able
staff and within a relatively short time has gained the confidence and respect sf
the business community. By the end of April 1969, the BOI had approved 107
projects entailing an estimate of total investment of more than $300 million
equivalent, of which about $l80 million would be required in foreign exchange.
The sponsors of a number of these projects have already approached PDCP fon
financing; and, in view of the continuing balance of payments difficuTties. the
sponsors of an increasing number of projects approved by the BOI can be ex?ected
to approach ?.OCP for foreign exchanva financing.
Financing for Industrial Development
13.       The Develpnnmnt Bank of t+he Philippines (DBP), a rove-roment-otn.ed bank,
is the most important source of medium- and long-term capital for industrial
development in the country. DBP's total resources amoij0nted to over P2 billion
at the end of 1968, and its outstanding industrial loans exceeded P1 billion.

also provides short-terin industrial loans. Insurance institutions also provide
some term finance for industry.  The most important of the insurance institu-
ti.ons are the Government Service Insurance System and the Social Security Syst-"i.
with outstanding loans of about Pl.5 billion as of June 30, 1968.  Over 70, W`

Role of PDCP
16.       PDCP already has the largest resources of the four private institutions
Providing equity and term finance to industry.   It is the only private corpora-
tion with direct aocess to long-term foreign exchange resources made availabie
by international institutions. PDCP estimates that its financial assistance
accounted for about 1.5% of total private fixed investment in 1966, 2.7% in
1967 and 4% in 1968.   Given the care with which it selects investments, PDCP's
role is more important than the physical figure suggests.   Ho-erver, even ii

ITIJ  DESCRIPTION OF PDCP
Establishment and Share Capital
17.       PDCP was incorporated in February 1963 with a paid-in share capital of
P25 millior.. At its lMrh 1969 Generl1 Meeting PDhCP resolved to increase its
..~~ ns...   j.j_ t                          U7~* 
authorized capital to P35 million, and paid-in share capital to P27.5 million
by the issue of a 10% stock dividend.   The proposed increases are subject to
the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission Eand, in terms of a :Loan
agreement, t-he UnTited States Agency for T+vermatioynal Development (ATD).  he
Bank has already consented to the increases.
18.       Th3 larger shareholders, as of February 28, 1969, are listed in Annex- .
T-tre are t-wo classes of shares   t   shares, Jwthic may b   . .oy-b
Filipino individuals or corporations in which two-thirds of the share capital
is owned by Filipino nationals; arnd '"  shares, which may be hld by any person
or entity. As of the same date, 71% of the paid-in share capital was owned by
Filipino individuals and corporations.
Purposes and Powers
19.       The objectives of PDCP are to assIst In the cr-eation, expansion and
modernization of private productive enterprises in the Philippines, to encouragc.
private capital participation from local and foreign sources, to faciltate
private acquisition of ownership of investments, shares and securities and to
help develop technical, financial, managerial and administrative hImowledgEl in
the country.  PDCP may extend long- and medium-term loans, invest in equity
capital, underwrite and sponsor equity and debt security issues, guaranteE loa,-
and obligations and provide managerial and technical assistance to its borrowr s
Organizationri Nanagement and Staff
20.       Board of Directors.   PDCP's Board has 11 members:  8 are directors
elected by Class "A" shareholders an.d 3 are directors elected by Class "B'
shareholders, RP has the right to nominate for election one of the eigbi.
directors representing Class "A" shareholders as long as any part of the flU?I'



loans channeled through PTB is outstanding. The Board usually meets monthly.
PDCP's Board is listed in Annex 2. Its members embody a broad range of
financial, industrial and other interests and experience.
21.       Executive Comnittee.  The Executive Committee consists of five
directors including the President and at least one director representing Class
"B" shares. An Executive Committee meeting is held only when there is no
quorum at a regular Board meeting to transact the business stated in the agenda.
Any three directors of whom one is a Class "B" director constitute a quorLan for
an Executive Committee meeting. Decision is by simple majority.
22.       Management. Mr. Roberto T. Villanueva has been Chairman of PDCI"s
Board and Pre!sident of PDCP since 1966.  He is an influential and enterprising
business leader, able, and well known to the Bank staff.   His is the deciding
voice on policy matters and the laraer issues.   Mr. Vicente Re javne. 2nnpointed
Executive Vice-President in 1965, is in charge of day-to-day management. He ip
capable and energetiG; and his stature in the business con?mmnity is growirg.
Mr. Luis V. ',ison, promoted in March 1969 to be Senior Vice-President and
Treasurer; has been with PDCP for only about tio.1Oars but has demonstrated
considerable ability.  The Accounting, Legal, Finance and Project Administration
Depart-ments are Lnder his direct sperison. PDGP is -ell led and well managed.
23.       Lj,,anization and Staff. PLP is orgar,izedA i four        An de3t-
ments:  Project Development and Economics, Project Evaluation, Project Adminis-
trati.on, and. F;na.  and four service departiment-s   dmi A inst-rat-ion and
Personnel, Accounting, Legal, and Business Information.   The staff numbers 73.
Including mar;ageent, l 2 are professional.  The professional staff is relative'.
young, about one-half being 30 years and under.   The ten members of the executive
(or senior) staff had experience in a variet,y of professions and businessEts
before joining PDCP. Several of them have attended the Bank's Economic Develor-
ment Institute and other training programs.
2L.       .I general, PDCP: s professional staff is competent.  It is efficiently
organized, with clearly defined and well understood areas of authority and
responsibili.y, closely controlled by the management. The organization chiart
is shown in knnex 3.
25.       PDCP has the problem of a steady drain of staff, particulrrly of
younger mren after they have gained a year or two of expgerience with PDCP, to
other institutions.  In 1968, resignations of professional staff nunbered 8, the
highest in any one year. Besides causing PDCP inconvenience and expense, the
drain throws an additional burden on the heads of departments and the other
experienced staff.  Tne management seeks to combat the drain by ensuring t;hat
PDCP's rates of remuneration are competitive and by providing good workingr
conditions, but considers nevertheless that the loss of younger men to otlher
institutions is inevitable and will continue.
26.       If PDCP is to be able adequately to handle the increasing volume of
business likely to be available, the Project EvaluatiorL Department needs to he
strengthened.. The Vice President in charge of that department is able ar.d



- 6 -
experienced, but the department as a whole is understaffed even for the recent
volume of operations.   PDCP's management agrees that th,e department is under-
staffed and is seeking to strengthen it by additional recruitment.
Procedures
27.       Appraisal of Investment Proposals.   Except for agricultural and live-
stock projects, referred to below, projects are appraised by the Project
Evaluation Department, assisted in some areas by the Project Administration
and the Finance Departments. The Project Evaluation Department is headed by
a Vice President assisted by two project officers supervising the work of four
teams, each of twvo men. Each appraisal is made by a group that includes
specialists in financial analysis, marketing and engineering.   (PDCP's staff
presently includes 3 chemical engineers, 5 mechanical engineers and 2 civil
engineers.  All three Vice Presidents are engineers by profession).   After
appraisal, the draft report is critically examined by a five-member Staff Invest-
ment Comnmittee headed by the Exe.mitive Vice President.  The finel report, ,'iLh
the Executive Vice Presidentts recommendations, is then presented to the
directors sit ting either as the Boa l or as the Eyecutive Committee. PDCI'
follows the same appraisal procedures whether the commitment in view is an
equi ty inve; mert, a loan or a guaran.tee.
28.       AgIcultural and li-vestock apmraisals are made by the Project Develop-
ment and Economics Department.   PDCP is interested in increasing its investment.
in large-scaLe comnmercially operated agricult-ural and livest ok nrojects: but
in order to do so it will need to strengthen its appraisal staff specializing i.i
that field.  The d-ific'ty ofP firdin   sui++.z rertr T1 restrict PDnGP' 
capacity in the meantime.   In relation to one project, it has supplemented its
o,rn resources by tJe of           V.s 'ta .
29        Th3 quality of P'L' P' s app raisal work is good in. Most respectst  The
coverage of the financial, engineering, marketing and management aspects of a
project is usually corrprehensive ardl so-und.  The appraisal reports are generaP.s
clear and well organized, and reflect the considerable degree of care that PDCf
exerciLses ir, assessdJng luvestw-ment proposals.  TiI' reports A.Adlcat  "
gives some but not sufficient thought to the economic aspects of the projects
it finances, TWvlhen approp-iate rPDC1 aW-dys tres tlo e-,tirtu the efct    of
execution of the project on the Philippines balance of payments, on employment,
and on government revenues. rLCP-s appralsal reports do not indicate, however.
that it gives thought to the international competitiveness of production ccsts.
Th'is omiLssion has been pointed out to FDCP. However, as noted in paragraph 10,
the production costs of successful industries established in the Philippines ar,'
likely to be internationally competitive.
30.       PFDCP's management and staff is not compiacent and iS couistantly
seeking to improve the standards of PDCP's work. It has been receptive to the
Bank;s comments and suggestions on appraisal reports examined by the Ban'k. T1h,
quality of FDCP's appraisal work is still improving, and as the experience o'
the relatively young staff incroasD>, it sh3lld imp.Lve sti.li furtier.

- I -
31.        Follow-up.  PDCP's follow-up work is done by the Project Akcinistration
DepartMentv wuder the I-mmediate supervision of an Assistant VIce-President.   The
Bank has been critical of PDCP's follow-up work in the past, considering it less
thlan adequate. About a year ago PDCP began to bring about an 1iirrovt1l2lCft LI
this area by reorganizing and strengthening the Project Administration Departricnt;,
and introducing new procedures.   It now obtains periodicall y financial, opera-
tional and status reports from clients, the frequency varying with the nature
and status oi- the project, prepares project supervision reports, anci submits
them to the Executive Vice-President with recommendations for action when
appropriate. PDCP has also instituted a schedule of regular site visits. As
such visits bad not been regular in the past, PDCP is presently working off a
backlog which it hopes to have cleared by mid-1969.
32.       In the past twelve months there has been a marked improvement in
PDCP's follow-up work.   The system that has been instituted is adequate, but
the Bank shouild continue to keep under review the quality of the work actuLally
done.
Resources
33.       PIDCP's long-term resources consist of its paid-in share capital,
reserves and retained earnings, a subordinated AID loarn, two Bank loans and
a loan from Asian Development Bank (ADB).
3lW.      Reserves and Retained Earnings.    As of Decemb,er 31, 1968, PDCP's equity
amounted to ??36.3 million ($9.3 million equivalent).
35.        SDubordinated AID Loan.  The AID loan of P27.' million, made and paid
in in 1963, is for 30 years including 15 years grace, and carries an interest
rate of one-half of 1% per annum.    In the event of liquidationv, any part of the
loan outstanding and not due for pavment will be subordlinated to PDCP's origiri-2
paid-in share capital of P25 million and to other debts. The AID loan is
maintained as a separate fund and muay be used only for goods and services of
Philippine origin.   Individual loans from this fund exceeding P1 million
(equivalent to US$256,000) require AID's prior approval.

Policies
38.       PDCW"s Board adopted a statement of General Business Policies on
March 10, 1964 and, each time with the consent of the Bank, amended It on
July 15, 1966 and January 16, 1968. The statement 3s amended appears in Arnex 4.
PDCP seeks to assist in the development of private produ.ctive enterprises by
providing medium- and long-term loans and equity capital; to develop a wider
market for corporate securities; and to encourage a wider distribution oI o-wner-
ship of private enterprises. Privately-controlled industry is defined to exclude
enterprises in which the Government holds one-third or more of the voting stock.
PDCP will not; seek to control, or participate in the management of, enterprises
that it finances.  The statement also envisages, as an objective, diversification
of PDCP's portfolio, sets normal limits to exposure in any one enterprise and
prescribes that a prudent reserves and dividends policy shall be followed.
39.       In May 1969 the Govervment informed the Bank, in connection with the
prvosed loan for PDCP. that it would. reouire an explicit understanding between
PDCP and the (overnment that the proceeds of the loan would be used in conf:orrr- 1,,
with the Gove:-mMent'S economic develonment policies. programs, and priorities.
As this is conasistent with its corporate policies and objectives, PDCP agreed to
it*  T'n¶e Bank fonrLnd the text of the proposed agreement acceptable.  It is givexi
in Annex 5.
40.       PDt:P's current statement of' General Business Plolicies is adequate and
a-mrpri a te.
Loar* _01-yera4-- ons
41.       Joja.[s. PDC*Ps   loan appLrovals have been as follows:
,163,/6t  12!2;  19Q67  1968    Total

There is an inevitable time lag between approval and comrmitrent of loans, but
commitments have shown a similar rising trend over the period. Commitments
amounted to almost P25 million in 1966, rose to P38.0 million in 1967 and to
P45.8 million in 1968. It is evident that PDCP's business has been gathering
momentum. Slummary of PDCP's loan operations is given in Annex 6.



- 9 -
42.       Size of Loans.  The average size of PDCP's total loans from inception
has been P2.1 million, almost exactly the average loan made during 1968.  About
75% in volume, and 30%5 in number, have exceeded P2 million.  Loans above P1
miilion and below Fe million account for 13/% in amount and 20% in number; and
loans below P1 million to 12% in amount and 50% in number.
43.       Interest Rate.  PDCP currently charges a uniform rate of interest of
l1% per annua on both peso and foreign currency loans.  In addition, it cinarges
a commitment fee of 1.5% on undisbursed amounts.  The legal ceiling on interest
rates under P'hilippine law is 12% on loans secured on real estate, and 14,' on
others. DBP normally charges from 9% to 12%, depending on the size and type of
loans. Commercial banks charge from 10% to 12%. The Board reviews PDCP";5
lending rates and other charges on loans at fairly frequent intervals.
44.       MLaturity. Loan maturities range from 3h to 15 years, the average
maturity being slightly less than 8 years. About 50% cf the loans by amount
are for maturities of 9 to 11 years, and about 35% for 5 to 8 years. PDC1' sets
the maturities of its loans with due regard to the nature of the project financed,
the condition of the borrower and PDCP's own interests. Maturities are tending
to lengthen.. This appears to be due to the industrial trend in the Philippines,
noted in paragraph 9, towards rather more sophisticated industries, with longer
gestation periods.
45.       Security. PDCP requires a first mortgage on assets acquired with the
proceeds of its loan, plus additional mortgages on other assets as needed.  The
Project Appraisal Department assesses the value of the collateral before IDCP
makes a commuitment.  In general. the appraisal value of the collateral is not
less than 100lC  of the amount outstanding under any loan.  Sometimes PDCP requires
personal guarantees in addition to mortgages, usually when the borrower ie a
family-controlled enterprise.
46.       Exchange Risk.  PDCP requires its borrowers to accept the exchange
risk on foreign currency loans.
L7.       Diversity.  A corrparative statement of loans approvre by PrUp is
shown in Annex 7. PDCP has lent mainly to the manufacturing sector, which
accounted for h7d. of total loan approvals as of the end of 1968.  among. the
manufacturing industries, Cement, Ceramics and Stone Pnrducts accounted for 13'
of the total; Food 12%; Chemicals 8%; and Wood and -Tod Ptoducts 6%i.  Outs4 -A
the manufacturing sector, Electricity claimed 22% of the total; Transportation
16*  r Mining 5%; and Agriculture 3%.  PDCPDs Board has decided to limit loans
to the electricity industry to a maximum of 35% of the 'total loan portfolio.
48.       Geographic Distribution.  The geographic distribution of projects to
Thi-ch PDC.P hs ler.t  m fects Uhe generrl pattern of irdustr-,al development and
trends in the country. As of December 31, 1968, on the basis of approvals, about
2W'>°f of total loans were to prJec-ts in   me 4- Mroli  , Xanila area, 21%, n
southn  o        Ln re te p    st w      e 
'Southern Tagalogs 15% in Central Luzon and 13% in south westemn Mindanao.

49.       New and EKisting Industries.   About three-quarters of FDCP's lending
by amount, 71 out of a total of 99 loans, has been to existing enterprises for
modernization and expansion. The balance of one-quarter has gone to support
new ventures. PDCP?s management is aware of criticism that PDCP has not been
as venturesome in seeking new entrepreneurs as a company set up to finance
development might be expected to be. A substantial proportion of its loans has
been made to well-established companies, some of which would have been able
to raise the required capital elsewhere. PDCP, in consultation with the BOI,
is seeking opportunities to expand its support of new enterprises.
5D.       PDCP has sought, through its Project Development and Economics
Department, to develop projects for -the production of goods needed by the
Philippine economy and to find sponsors and technical partners for such projects.
Not all such efforts by PDCP have borne fruit, but at least one sizeable project,
for the establishment of a plant to manufacture sodium tripolyphosphate. has
been brought into being as a specific investment proposal.   PDCP's Board has
approved a loan to and investment in the project and has invited IFC to consiuer
joint financing. IFC is considering the proposal.
Share Investments and Underwriting
51.       A summary of PDCPts share `nvestments and underwriting activities is
given in Annex 8.  As of Dece-ber 31 1968. pnr.p:s tot-n  share itnvestrnents
amounted only to P570,000, in three companies. PDCP's management has noted the
Bank's criticisms of its inactivity in equity investment and d,nioit 1968    rPn.q
Board approved share investments in four companies amotunting to P3.5 million,
not vet disbmlrsed. Of the P3.5 mql 4on, however, only mo7,000 relates to invest-
ment in common shares; the balance relates to cumulative, redeemable, preferre(d
shares, some of which incllue rightcs of conversion. t^ o coron stoc. Of the
balance, P1.5 million is for preferred shares to be issued by an electricity
company alre1adytr one of T'D. ^i4 en4., .ta -     er In.8 -, ..lon i s A.o
preferred shares to be issued by the company proposing to undertake the manu-
facture ...wLU of rodiim +   .   mentioned in paragraph 50.  PDCP's progress
in increasing its investments in true equity therefore continues to be slow.
That -slowness is  e at least in par   to the cormmon rel uctance of fa - I- or
closely-controlled companies to admit outsiders to a share in ownership.    Ageiri5
PT,fPt oolabomti on '+h' th1- BaO  shmUA Iprvide more opportunities for PDWP tc
expand its equity portfolio.
52.       Underwriting.  There were few underwriting operations in the Philippile
capitanl markt I.IL 191 anud d968. ar,u durLllg thse yerars PPs oLLy bsac
operation was a commitment amounting to P1.8 million, in 1968. Prior to 1967
P5  had 1~~L a"JJ.. L'aJw A jWo e y issues ar,d Uee debt Ls,rfeInts.  .1 o f.
them had been sold at a profit by the end of 1968, but PDCP initially encoun-
tered difficZulties in, disposing of stock acquired through underwriting.  The
caution engendered by the earlier experience may have contributed to PDCPts
later inactivity in -underwriting.
Utuher Operatioc-11s
53.       Guarantees. In 1966, PDCP began to undertake guarantee operitions.
By the end of' 1968, it had given 1U guarantees to foreign suppliers, amotnLing



to $7.3 million, Of those guarantees, seven totalling $4.3 million were approved
duiring 1968. FDCP normally charges a fee of 1go per annum on the amount
guaranteed, together with a single acceptance fee of one-half of 1%. As mentioned
in paragraph 27, PDCP appraises a project in respect of which it is considering
a guarantee in the same manner as it appraise one for which a loan or equity
operation is being considered. The amendment to PDCP's General Business Policies
statement made in Jamnary 1968 was for the purpose of making explicit the in-
clusion of guarantees in its normal maximum exposure in a single enterprise.
PDCP is seeking to increase its guarantee business.
54.       Short-Term Placements. PDCP's mannagement of temporarily surplus funds
is rf'afil and shrewd.  Day-to-day operations in the short-term market are
conducted by the Finance Department, under the direct supervision uf the Senior
Vice Preside-.t avnA Taas,oer.  PYP seeks to maximize its earnnmgs while main-
taining full security and adequate liquidity.  At the end of December 1968, PDXP' 
shOrt-tem placements amounted to P'D   "n1I   .   wtha cUrnt average vield at the$
rate of about 114 per annum.
55.       Spidication.  Both to increase its income and to stretch out its
relativ'Ly scarce peso resour-ces,  'ACP  3as 'been   '  4n the past two years
to put together syndicates to finance specific projects., It has so far
succeeded irl relation to three projects, in each of which it led the synIdi-cate
formed. One such project involved arranging a long-term foreign currency 'Loan
equivalent to P15.5 million to finance completion of part of the main highLay
system around metropolitan ManLLa. PDCP should contimue its efforts to expand
the syndication of loans to Filipino enterprises.
5b.       Conversion Options and Stock Purchase Warrants.  roP holds cov7ersion
options in six companies to the face value of P3.3 milllon, stock purchase,
warrants in seven companies for P2.0 million, and convertible debentures in
one company for P3.9 million. Only one option has so far been exercised: to
acquire equity shares to the value of P121,000 in 1966, which were subsequently-
sold at a profit. PDCP reports that the grant of options is generally unpopu_.ar
.n the Philippines, and the company intends to seek to include them in financial
mians only when its clients can be persuaded without too mach difficulty.
u.ality of Portfolio
57.       PDCP's portfolio, the overwhelming majority of which is represented
by loans, is reasonably well diversified both in the noture and loc2tion of the
projects financed. PDCP's repayment experience with its clients has been
generally good. As of March 15, 1969., arrears of principal and interest amounte
to P1.6 million, or about 1.5% of the outstanding portfolio. As of the same
date, only two loans presented serious problems. One of them has since been
refinanced from other sources. and the arrears due to PDCP have been paid. Thrr-
remains one problem loan of P2.6 million, on which arrears amounted on March ~
1969 to P1.2 million.  PDCP is closely watching the proJect, and PDCP's manage-
ment believes that a solution will be found which does not involve PDCP in
w-riting off El part or the whole of the outstanding loan. To be safe, it wou!ld
be wise to regard the debt as doubtful.



- 12 -
58.       PDCP's portfolio is generally sound.    Having in view the debt service
record of PDCP's clients and the conservative basis on which PDCP has taken
collateral for its loans, PDCP's reserves and provisions, amounting at
December 31, 1968, to 12.2% of outstanding portfolio, are adequate.

62.       PLCPFs financial performance is satisfactory.   Gross inicoae Lncreased
steadily from P7.9 million in 1965 to P14.3 million in 1968.   The average anruni
growth rate of gross income in the :past two years was 23/i.  The decline in the
ratio shown. above of profit before tax and provisions to average total assets
is due to the gradual fall in the proportion of PDCP's resources represented b-Y
equity and the low-cost AID loan.   The ratio of administrative expenses to total
assets declined from 1.5% in 1967 to 1.3% in 1968.
63.       Share Value.   PDCP shares are quoted on the Manila and Makati Stockc
Exchanges. Dealings in "B" shares are infrequent. Dealings in "A" shares arm
far more nwaerous. The market price in 1967 varied from a low of P12.85 to a
high of P15.20, and in 1968 from P14.75 to P15.75. Over the period of ti¢o yez.rs,
the number of "Al shares -traded was about half a million. Book value at
the end of 1L967 and 1968 was P13.57 and P14.52 respectively.
V. PROSPECTS
ohl.      PDPnfls prospets are closely related to the growth of the Philippine
economy and to the Central Bank's monetary policies.   As noted in paragraph 6,
Fhe Pni'lppines has achievedr an anvnual average arowth rate of almost 6% durirp,
the 1960's. The industrial sector (manufacturing and mining) is expected to
contribute about 29% of GNMP by 1971, c-n m-paired wi th about 221 in 1968.  Given
the Government' s recently increased emphasis on industrial development in thP
vtrLvate sector and the activirtins of the BOI nlndpr tihe Tnvestmnnt Incentives h,t.
the target of 25% appears realistic.   The prospective continuance of tight
money con'diJiLoU   , nhb; +±ng Uh-e al±Ity of pro±act nonsors to horrow peso Au±r3z
for the purchase of foreign exchange, is likely to sustain and increase the
.L,lardU Lor KLitPd  fo-eign ean,ge A.nsA.



65.       Forecasts of PDCP's loan and investment approvals, commitments and
disbursements in the five years from 1969 through 1973 appear in Annex 11.   The
estimates for 1969 and 1970 are based largely on proposals approved by PDCP in
the first three months of 1969 and on those other proposals before PDCP in
various stages of investigation. As of March 15, 1969, there were 67 such
proposals inrolving $39 million in foreign exchange and, P50 million in peso
currency. The proposals under consideration involve various degrees of probabi-
lity of approval, from high to low, and this has been t.aken into account in the
preparation of the forecasts. Estimates for the forecast period from 1971.
onwards rely mainly on the total estimated demand of the private industrial
sector for loans and equity investments PDCP's estimated share on the basi.s of
the historical growth rate, and the constraining factor of staff capacity to
process proposals. From 1966 through 1968, the average annual growth rate of
loan conmitraents was 36%. Fram 1969 through 1971 the forecasts envisage an
average annual growth rate of 135. Eauity investments are projected to g]row
from P570,00() in 1968 to P3.1 million in 1969, P8.3 million in 1970 and P13.7
million in 1971.  The estimates are reasonable and, barring unforeseen devrelop-
ments, PDCP should be able to achieve them.

- 15 -
Foreign exchange commitments during the period March 31 to June 30 are estimated,
on the basis of loan proposals alreaidy presented to PDCP:s Board and the Bane
or approaching the point of presentation, at $5.6 million, which will leave
available to PDCP as of June 30, 1969 approximately $4 nillion.  Foreigin exchange
comnitments from July 1, 1969 to June 30, 1971 are estimated at just over $29
million. PDCP will therefore need foreign exchange resources of the order of
$25 million to meet estimated conitmnents in the two-year period from July 1,
1969.
68.       PDCP has been seeking other sources of foreign exchange in addition to
the Bank, and approached Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW). As noted above, PDCP obtained a loan of $5 million from
ADB in March 1969, and ADB is unlikely to make another loan to PDCP during, the
period endingr June 30, 1971. PDCP hopes to obtain from KfW a foreign exchange
loan equivalent to $5 million, but its prospects of obtaining such a loan are it
present unclear.
69.       In the light of the foregoing, PDCP is looking to the Bank as its
main sounrce of foreign exchange for the next two years, and on the basis of
present projections the proposed loan should be fully committed by mid-1971.
70.       ASssuming that the second Bank loan to PDCP is fully committed by
June 30, 199', the p+nroportn of Bank funds in PDCP's total resources as of thn-t
date should be about 67.5%. This proportion is estimated to increase to abou'.
72%. by mid-1971 if tha proposed third loan is made and committed in accordance
with the forecasts.  On a disbursement basis, however, the proportion of Bank
fuds in PDCP's total resources will be significantly lower; around 60%. While
this percentage is not unreasonable, in view of PDCP' sound financial positia3n,
PDCP was encouraged during the negotiati n.  to seek more actively than in the
past finance from other sources.
Peso Resources and Requirements
71.       Peso resources of about P20 million were available for commitment at
-;he end of lI]arX^ch 1969, PDCP expects to comn.it about P32 million in the pericd
kpril 1, 1969 to June 1971, and contemplates raising additional resources hy
ortfo1Io sales of P4 m I ion and, peo borrowings of about P8 million during
that period.  In addition, PDCP proposes to syndicate loans and to seek parti;.-
pation in its ovii- loans by other financial institutions.  Raising sdequate peso
resources iEs likely to be one of PDCP's more difficult problems for some years.
Projected IrLcome and Profitability
72.       Projected income statements for the five years ending December 31,
1973 are given in Annex 12. Net incom e will grow from P5.7    llion in 1I 6'  n
P6.5 million in 1970 and to P7.6 million in 1971.  The ratio of net incomze JO
sverage net iworth should be about 15% in   -19769-a-1fl   and    16% it n 1971
With a 10% cash dividend on share capital increased by 10% as referred to Lni
puragreph 1.7 above, the payout ratio will be less than 50%J in 1969, 1970 an
1971.



- 16 -
Debt Service Coverage
73.       Projected cash flow is shown in Annex 13. On the basis of those
projections, total debt service cover would be 1.78 in 1969, 1.70 in 1970,,
and more than 1.6 through 1973. Even after repayment cf the AID loan begins i.n
1978, PDCP Should be able to maintain debt service cover of more than 1.2
thrcaghout the expected life of the proposed Bank loan.
Projected Balance Sheets
74.       Projected balance sheets for the forecast period are presented i.n
Annex 14. I'Tlroughout the period, the current ratio is never less than 1.7:1.
Share investmients are expected to increase from P3.1 million in 1969 to P1.3.7
million in 1971.   Stockholders' equity will increase from P39.5 million in
1969 to P48.1 million in 1971. The average annual growth rate of total assecs
in the three years through 1971 will be about 24%.
Debt/Equity Ratio
75.       On the basis of year-end figures, the ratio of PDCP's total debt
to equitv will be LL.5:1 in 1969, 5.3:1 in 1970 and 6 2:1 in 1971. Under file
definition of debt/equity ratio in t;he Bank's Loan Agreements as currently
av:lied to develonment finance comnanies, the ratio wilTl be 3.0:1 in 1969,
3.6:1 in 197C0 and 4.4:1 in 1971, assuming the maturity of the proposed loan
to be 17 vParse The present borrowing limit ulnder th.e definition for the
second Bank l.oan is three times the borrowing base; PDC:P requested that the
borrowing limit be increased from 3:' to 5:1.
76        In vievs of PDCP's record of good manragement, the generally satis-
factory and improving standard of project appraisal, the improvement in PDCP' 3
supervision of projects, its sound portfolio and "ts cri.4orthiness     'he
Bank would be justified in agreeing to raise the present borrowing limit from
'1:1 to 4.5:1. Be^au--se of the change Jn diefUinition, UL1he prUJosedu  ratio ofL
4.5:1 under the Bank's current defin.ition of the equity base would give about
*'ne same borro-ring por as a ratio or 3. 1   drU     LU.LL L theU.L used when
the second Bank loan was made.
Increase in Capital
77.       In view of the continued increase in the volume of PDCP's operations,
Lhe likelihood of its goi,g ito larger size investments and the desirabi1iiy
of broadening the ou-nership of its shares, PDCP was urged during negotiations
'to raise additional share capital during the next two years.  In six years of'
life, PDCP has so far increased its share capital only by the stock dividend .,
'LO  referred to in paragraph 17 above.  The pressure of the restriction on i t ;
debt/equity ratio will in due course force PDCP to expand its share capital; in
3ny case, the Bank proposes to keep this issue fresh in iu?CP's consideration.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOIENDATIONS
Conclusions
78.       Although PDCP's contribution to total investment in the private sector
is still modest, PDCP has been playing an increasingly important role in
providing long-term foreign exchange resources to private enterprise in the
country and in providing financing to ecmomically sound investments.   PDCP's
management ard staff are competent and the company's investment standards have
been steadily improving. PDCP' s financial assistance has been mainly concentrated
on the modernrization and expansion of well-established businesses. Investment
in equity is still insignificant. PDCP's collaboration with the BOI should
provide opportunities for PDCP to assist a wider range of clients and to explore
more actively opportunities for equity investment.
79.       PLICP's financial position and its past performance, particularly in
1968 and in 1969 to date, are satisfactory.   PDCP's business operations are
well conducte d and its prospects are good.  Operations are expected to corntinue
to be profitable, and the cash flow to be sufficient to cover debt service.
PDCP is creditworthy for a third Bank loan.  In the two-rear period from July l1
1969 to June 30, 1971 it will need additional foreign exchange resources of the
order of $25 million.
Recommendati ons
80.       It is reonmmiended that the Bank make a loan f'or PDCP of $25
million to cover PDCP's estimated requirements of foreign exchange resourceE'
duringr the t.wor yars: beginningr Julyl 1969, on the termsm usuawll for loans ton
