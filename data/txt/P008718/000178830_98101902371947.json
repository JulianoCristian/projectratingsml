Caracal Titu\n            Irrigation Project will be to increase and stabilize crop\n            production and to raise productivity. This will be\n            accomplished through construction of irrigation and drainage\n            systems and related facilities. The project works will\n            include construction and improvement of irrigation\n            facilities and surface drainage systems, soil erosion\n            control, sandy area reclamation, construction of four flood\n            retention dams and valley training. Equipment for operation\n            and maintenance and farm machinery will also be provided\n            under the project. Benefits from crop production in the\n            project areas will increase from a fluctuating annual\n            average of about $342 million to a relatively stable annual\n            average of about $693 million. Yield increases in various\n            crops in the newly irrigated areas will range from about 100\n            percent for wheat to about 175 percent for maize and alfalfa\n            and the cropping intensity will increase by about 17\n            percent. The project will more than double labor\n            productivity. The economy at large will be the main\n            beneficiary of the project. However, it will also somewhat\n            increase the income of the 73,700 active members of of CAPs\n            and the 4,300 employees of the IASs in the project area, and\n            is expected to create about 6,200 new jobs."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
