Lessons learned suggest that\n            for successful rural finance, four key elements play a\n            significant role: legally based property ownership;\n            functional legal systems; functional financial institutions;\n            and, a system of effective farm advisory and business\n            development support. To this end, prerequisites, such as the\n            development of a property registration system, land markets,\n            collateral registration, and mortgages, should be\n            synchronized for the development of physical assets, and\n            financial markets. However, in the provision of financial\n            subsidies to the rural sector - through innovative hybrid\n            grant-loans - such loans should be restricted to first-time\n            borrowers only, with the understanding that the subsidy is a\n            one-time catalyst, and not a recurring government handout.\n            Additionally, tying the grant to a bank loan, conditions\n            sub-borrowers to the discipline of loan payments, allowing\n            the establishment of a credit history. Similarly, grant-loan\n            credit lines for small loans, can effectively promote the\n            establishment of new businesses in rural areas, thereby\n            diversifying the rural economic base."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
