In order to reduce poverty and\n            unemployment, and to support the development of rural\n            economy and expansion of alternative income earning\n            opportunities, the World Bank and the Government of Latvia\n            launched the rural development project late 1998. Under the\n            agriculture development project only commercial credits were\n            issued, while the goal of the second project is to give\n            assistance also to those who need special support to access\n            commercial credits for the first time. Alongside with the\n            credit line, financing under the rural development project\n            was assigned also to drafting the rural development policy\n            and has been used in building a national integrated\n            computerized land register. In 1997 54 percent of all\n            economically active in the countryside were engaged in\n            farming, but in 2000 - only 37 percent. Greater efficiency\n            of economic activities in the rural areas shall be ensured\n            through new forms of employment, and the question is what\n            financial resources should support the attainment of it."}, "docdt": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
