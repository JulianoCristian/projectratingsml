to key reforms and\n            infrastructure in an important sector.  The specific\n            objectives of the project are to:  (a) open up the petroleum\n            sector to private sector participation and create an\n            appropriate framework for a competitive environment; (b)\n            support the basic infrastructure investments required to\n            increase operational efficiency and to attract private\n            operators and investors; and (c) develop institutional\n            capacity for the efficient regulation of the sector.  The\n            project includes the following components:  (a)\n            liberalization and support to privatization of the petroleum\n            sector; (b) rehabilitation and support to privatization of\n            the existing petroleum refinery at Toamasina; (c) basic\n            improvement in the petroleum storage and transport\n            infrastructure; (d) construction of a new petroleum\n            loading/unloading facility at the port of Toamasina; and (e)\n            a program to promote the use of liquified petroleum gas\n            (LPG) by residential households."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
