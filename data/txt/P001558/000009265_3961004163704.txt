MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIHE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR A PETROLEUM SECTOR REFOORM PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development Credit to the Republic of Madagascar for SDR 36.7 million, the equivalent
of US$51.9 million, to help Jinance a Petroleum Sector Reform Project. The Credit would be
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, including 10 yuars of grace. SDR 23.6
million, the equivalent of US$33.3 million, from the proceeds of the Credit will be onlent to the
Malagasy Petroleum Corapany (SOLIIM), at an 8 percent interest rate, with 20 years maurity,
including a 5- year grace period. SDR 10.5 million, the equivalent of US$14.9 million, will be
made available to SOfIMA on a grant basis.
2.    Background. Madagascar consumes about 300,000 tons of pets leum products per year,
which represents only 27 kgs per capita, approximately one-fifth of sub-Saharan Africa's per
capita consumption level. Petroleum products account for nearly 80 percent of commercial
energy consumption and are crucial for the functioning and development of the modem sector
of the economy. The country is entirely dependent on petroleum imports which represent about
20 percent of total merchandise imports. A petroleum refinery, located at Toamasina, was built
in 1966 and has a theoretical capacity of 750,000 tons per year. With the addition of
visbreaking, vacuum distillation and hydro-treating units in 1982, this refinery had one of the best
processing configurations of the East Africa region. However, essential maintenance and
replacement of worn parts and equipment have been neglected for lack of foreign exchange
and management has been deficient, resulting in an unsatisfactory operation. A World Bank
study (Madagascar - Petroleum Sector Report - Report N* 7986-MAG - July 13, 1989) concluded
that the operation of the refinery could be economically justified with the elimination of leaks of
hydrocarbon and steam, the recommissioning of the visbreaker that was damaged by a fire,
improved management and adequate feedstock of crude oil. These results have been confirmed
by several specialized consulting firms engaged to study in detail the rehabilitation of the existing
facilities. 'The rehabilitation and support to the privatization of the refinery are a key component
of the proposed project.
3.    Until 1989, the procurement of crude oil and petroleum products have not been based on
prices and technical suitability criteria, but on bilateral arrangements that the country had
negotiated and payment terms offered by suppliers. As a consequence, prices actually paid for
imports had sometimes been as much as US$8 per barrel higher than international market levels
and the refinery produced excessive amounts of fuel-oil that was sold in international markets at
a discount. On the other hand, domestic prices were set by the Government and adjustments
made at rather long and irregular intervals. Between 1980 and April 1992, there were only seven
price adjustments, the last in September 1990. The difference between selling prices and total
costs (import costs plus domestic costs) were not sufficient to enable the petroleum company to
pay the required taxes. As a result, actual petroleum taxes paid were the result of negotiations
between the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Energy and SOLIMA. This practice eliminated
all incentives to reduce operating costs within SOLIMA and blocked aU possibilities of
participation of private operators in petroleum activities. In April 1992, in the context of the
preparation of the proposed project, prices of liquified petroleum gas (LPG), jet-fuel and fuel-oil
were liberalized, a fornmla for maximum prices for gasoline, diesel and kerosene based on the
import parity concept was established and a new taxation system was introduced. Since then,
petroleum prices have been adjusted monthly without Government interference. Petroleum taxes
have now been made transparent and have a direct impact on consumer prices; they have been



- 2-
adjusted yearly to increase fiscal revenues. As a resut of the reforms, petroleum prices now
reflect opporunity costs and revenu  fom peroleum taxes increased from about US$5 mMilion
in 1990 and 1991 to US$19.3 million in 1992 and are expectedo reach US$31.6 million in
1993.
4.    SOLIMA, the national peoleum corporation, was established in 1976 when the
Govenment took over the assets of the itraiona companies that owned the refinery and the
transporttio and dibuton system. 8 i under the jurisdiction of the Mnistry of Energy and
Mines (ME. Until receny, SOLMA had the legal monopoly for thte import and refing of
crude oil and for the Import, distribon and marketg of refinel petroleum products. In early
1993, a legiation elimnat  the lgal monoptiy of the State over the import, transport and
distribionof all peoleum producs, allowed private operors to immediately open and operat
serice statins and established a taition period, up to December 31, 1995, durig whicb
private ditibutors are requed to purchase rfined products from the existing refinery at the
import party price. Some intnatonal oil companes have already strted the process of opening
service stations.
S.     eeilve .  The specific objecies of the project are to (i) open up the
petroleum sector to private sector pardcipatbon and create an appropriate framework for a
co ve eironm; ()                the basic ifrastrc re invesmnts required to increase
operat       efficiency and o attractp    opeaors and investors; and (ill) develop instittional
capacity for the efficient regaton of the sector. Ike proposed project wil have a direct impact
on economic growth. The impvemen   in  e operaonal and commercW efficiency of the
petroleum sector wiUl save scarce foei  exchange and reduce the cost of supplying petroleum
products to all economic actives.  lhe project will also contribute to imprving the
6.        e     _      . Ihe pojet Includes the following components: (a) libralizaion
and support to pivaization of the petroleum sector (US$6.7 mffion); (b) reablitation and
support to privatzato of the exsting poleum  refiney at Toamaina (US$7.9 million); (c)
basic improvement in the petroleum srage and transport infraructure (US$14.3 million); (d)
cstruction of a new petoleum loading faciliq at the port of Toamasina (US$16.5 million); (e)
program to promote the use of LPG by resdentil households (US$7.1 million) and (f) project
prpaon and management (JS$2.8 millon). Mem lHbazation process andthe establishment
of a competitve environment received a big push by the legal eliinaton of the monopoly of the
State over the petroleum sector and the reorms in petroleum pricing and taxaon, as mentioned
In paras. 3 and 4 above. In the conte  of the Implemenation of the proposed project, the
libeaization process wil be coned though (i) the restrcturing, coora     and the
opening up of SOLIMAs capital to prvate sector padrcipation; QI) the establi   of clear and
transparent rules for the operaton of a system of open access by all operators to cerain key
infrastructure facilities; and (i) the orgnizain  of a naional regulatory authority to set
stadards and protect competition in the petrleum sector. The rehablitation and privazation
of the refinery will be undertak  In two phases: Phase I will comprise the re issloning of
the visbreaker complex and cetain minimum improvement in the overall efflciency and
reliabWii of operato; Phase II inludes the addiion of thermual craking of vacm  gas oil.
MIs second phase wll be iniiatod only aftr the refinery has been opened to private sector
partiipatn and wil be fnded by private investors for an amount esimated at USS 23.9

7.                       1 Weet lmplenhtlon. The Directorate of Energy of the Ministry of Energy and
Mines will be responsible for implementing all the components related to liberalization and
privatization of the petroleum sector. SOLIMA will be responsible for the supervision of works
for all infrastructure components and experts will be employed for this purpose within the
existing organization before credit effectiveness. SOLIMA will hire an experienced engineering
consultant to assist it in the management of the project. Qualified internatonal contractors will
be hired for the rehabilitation works at the refinery and for the construction of the new petroleum
loading/unloading facility at Toamasina. Preliminary bidding documents for these activities, as
well as terms of references to request proposals for the private management of the refinery during
the transijon period, the restructuring of SOLIMA, the establishment of rules for the operation
of the open access system for key petroleum facilities and the organization of the national
regulatory authority, have already been prepared.
8.                    IIeW   Stainabiity. The introduction of a competitive environment in the petroleum
sector and the involvement of private operators will have a lasting positive impact on efficiency
and financial discipline in the setcor. The rehabilitation and privatization of the petroleum
refinery, together with the liberalization of the imports of refined petroleum products, will ensure
the least cost supply of petroleum products and save scarce foreign exchange. The new pricing
and taxation system based on opportunity costs and import parity concepts has demonstrated its
advantages to the Government and users, and is already broadly accepted. The new petroleum
loading/unloading facilities at Toamasina will contribute to safety and environmental protection
and wiU further increase efficiency in supply. The promotion of the use of butane gas (LPG) by
households and small-scale induitry wil reduce fuelwood and charcoal consumption and alleviate
the problems of deforestation.
9.    Lessons fm Preious IDA Involvement. The project incorporates most of the lessons
learned from ongoing petroleum sector projects worldwide and particularly in Latin America.
Among others, the following aspects figure prominently in the design of the project: (i) creation
of an open and competitive market for petroleum products; (ii) establishment of an appropriate
legal and regulatory framework that is transparent and largely free from interference from the
Government or vested interest groups; (ii) deregulation of the market through the free sale by
private companies of petroleum products and the gradual but ultimately complete liberaization
of prices; (iv) reduction of SOLIMA's share in the petroleum market, through private sector
participation in all downstream activities; (v) providing third party access to some key
infastructre facilities at reasonable rates; (vi) ensuring public safety and enviromnent
protection from hydrocarbon related activities; and (vii) adoption of a non distorting taxation
system that generates adequate revenues for the Government.
10. Rationale for IDA Involvement. The Bank's objective in Madagascar is to promote
sustnable growth through an increased role for the private sector and greater reliance on market
forces. To this end, this project incorporates a key sector of the economy into the structural
adjustment program and thereby conforms with the Ban's country assistance strategy as
presented to the Board on June 9, 1992. The reforms of petroleum pricing and taxation
supported by the project are a continuation of the actions to eliminate price controls and
encourage competition and efficiency throughout the economy. The participation of the private
sectr in the petroleum products market will also help to increase overal economic efficiency.
The measures designed to improve the operations and management of SOLIMA and to restructure
and privatize the company, are complementary to the activities on public entise reform also
initiated under previous adjustment operations. The investment component of the project fits well
in the Bank's strategy to rehabilitate and develop physical infrastructure supportive of economic
growth. The rehabilitation of the refinery and of the storage and loading infrastructure will
reduce costs in the supply of petroleum products, improve the reliability of energy supply for
domestic and industrial users and help remove an important bottleneck for economic growth.

11. A ed Actions. The Government has already implemented a new petroleum pricing and
taxation policy. The system of setting official prices by decree has been eliminated and prices
have been adjusted directly by the operators every month since July 1992 on the basis of
fluctuations of intnational prices and exchange rates. 'Me Government has also eliminated the
monopoly of SOLIMA on the petroleum sector and allowed the private sector to operate service
stations. The procurement of crude oil and of refined products has been done through
international competitive bidding procedures in 1992 and 1993, with substantial savings in foreign
exchange for the country. The Governmmnt has also submitted a Statement of Petroleum Sector
Reform Policy. During negotiations, agreement has been reached on the following matters: (1)
submission before March 30, 1994, of a study on the establishment and operation of a system of
open access by all operators to key infrastructure petroleum facilities; (ii) establishment of tlse
refinery company as a separate joint-stock company, wholly-owned by SOLIMA, under statutes
satisfactory to IDA; (iii) upon completion of the rehabilitation workls for the refinery, transfer the
facilities and all assets and liabilities relating thereto, to the newly created subsidiary; (iv)
submission before June 30, 1994, of a proposal for the restructuring of SOLIMA; and (v)
submission before June 30, 1994, of a study for the establishment and operations of a Petroleum
Regulato.y Authority. SOLIMA and the refinery company that will be established as a separate
entity will: (a) maintain a debt service ooverage ratio of at least 1.0 in FY95 and of 1.5 starting
in FY96 and every year thereafter; and (b) obtain the approval of IDA before making capital
investments larger than US$2.0 million.
12.   Conditions of Credit effectiveness include: Ci) the appointment of a Project coordinator
within the Ministry of Energy and Mines, (ii) the employment of experts within SOLIMA and
of an eng        consultant; (iii) the execution of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement
between the Govemment and SOLIMA; Civ) the finalization of bidding documents for the
rhabilitation of the refinery; and (v) the adoption of standard bidding documents for the
procurement of crude oil. Disbursement of funds: (i) for the rehabilitation of the refinery will
be made only after the team of experts that will manage the refinery has been hired; Ii) for
works related to the basic improvements in petroleum storage and distrtbution, after the
Government has established the open access system and the petroleum regulatory authority and
has taken all steps required to allow refined petroleum product prices to reflect regional
differences in transport and storage costs; and (ii) for the new petroleum loading/unloading
facility at Toamasina, after the Government has reached agreement with IDA on the
implementation of a satisfactory environmental mitigation plan, a convention for the modalities
of execution of the works and of the use of the facility has been signed by SOLIMA and the Port
of Toamasina (SEPT), the refinery has been established as a SOLIMA subsidiary, the
restrucuring plan for the rest of SOLIMA has been adopted, all steps required to allow the
participation of prvate sector capital in SOLLMs refinery have been taken and the import of
refined products have been liberalized.
13.      vronment  Aspect. The rehabilitation of the refinery will eliminate all leaks of
hydrocarbons, that at the present time produce risk of fires and pollute the environment, and
improve the waste water treamt system to acceptable enviromental standards. Increases in
safety and security and reduction in oil spillages are expected from the new loadinghunloading
facilities at Toamasina. Disbursements for the petroleum loading/unloading facility will be
subject to agreement on an envirment mitigation plan. Finally, the program to encourage the
use of LPG will foster some reduction in the consumption of woodfuels and help in the fight
against deforestation.
14.    PMg.M Qbjcdv Catnm1m. The project is an investment project which makes a
contribution tO public sector management, private sector development and environmental
objectives.

of the State over the petroleum sector. There s broad conensus i1 the country about the need
te improve competitio in the petrolum sector nd te  is almost no risk that the Government
will backtrack from implemnting the addional mees required. The main risk regardg the
project is the inherent busines risk  lating to commodity prices. An increase in oil prces could

between supply and demand of refined products, a derease in demand would tanate in an
overspply t  would cause pdces to fall and efining margins to narrow, with a negative impact
on the viabiity of the estment to rhabilit  the refinery. The impl on of Phase I of
the refinery rehabiitaton program makes the project more robust to support wide fluctuations
in relative pices. Another risk rel  to the avai    of the private sector funds to complete
Phase U of the rebablitaion program for th refinery. his risk is substnty reduced wit the
compledon of Phase I, which will bave converd the refinery into a profitable entity, able to

NOT QN RJC   M wRS SIGNIAI DISBURSEMIMT L&G
1. Most Madagascar projects have suffered from slow disbursements due pardy to generic
problems, including (a) lack of countetpart funds; (b) difficulties for project managers to access
MDA funds deposited In special accouts opened by the Cental Bank and operated by signatories
in the Treasury; and (c) cumbersome public procurement procedures due to repeated reviews by
central agencies. The situation worsened in July 1991 with the onset of political turmoil. Large
scale demonstrations and strikes paralyzed public administration and severely disrupted economic
activity. The country is now In a process of political transition (elections underway, with a new
government expected to be in place by summer-1993), which is still slowing project
implementation. These generic problems have affected all projects, in addition to project-specific
delays. The following projects have the most significant disbursement lags:
Inigatom Rehabilitatton Wrolect l(Cr, 189-MAG2. Start-up delays due to lack of adequate
technical assistance and the severity of the above generic problems were among the main cause
for slow disburs   . Implementation has now picked up, with a number of contracts under
execution. 'Te credit is expected to be closed by the end of 1993.
Accountur and ManagImet Tmaininttroect (Cr. lfil-MA   . Even thoughtheprojecthas
atained most of its goals, disbursements are low due to larger than anticipated co-financing from
grans by Canada and France. A supervision mission recently In the field agreed on possible uses
for some of the remaining funds. An amount of about US$2 miUlion will be cancelled.
ForestM engnit (Crh Mla          . Implemention of this project has been delayed by a
wide variety of problems (organizational, personal, countpart funds, marketing). A mid-term
review in March 1992 made recommendations to redirect and streamline the project and agreed
on an action plan. A supervision mission In July 1993 will review progress.
Seventh HIghway Project (Cr. 1905-MAG). This project was mostly affected by the generic
problems of cumbersome procurement procedures and lack of counterpart funds. Many contracts
have now been signed and disbursements are expected to increase significanidy during 1993.
JImenite Mining Enalneing Project (Cr. 1928-MA. This project has suffered from delays
in finalizing agreements on legal and technical aspects of the investment and shareholder
agreements, as well as on environmental clearance by the Government, during the period of
political transition. Ihe credit will be closed on June 30, 1993.
Publkc Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr. 1941-MAG. The economic reform program was
negatively affected by the political turmoil which started in mid-1991; delays in meeting the
conditions for third tranche release are the main factor preventing full disbursement. Steps must
be taken to implement public enterprise reform, to agree on a public expenditure program, and
to reinstate a viable macroeconomic framework Including rigorous public finance management
and a return to a liberalized system for foreign exchange allocation. The Bank agreed to the

Government's request to extend the closing date to September 30, 1993 to allow more time to
meet the third tranche conditions.
Eoonomic Management and Social Action Prolect (Cr. 1967-MAG). Implementation of IDA-
financed components was slow, pardy due to complexity of project design. Components financed
by gas from  Switzerland and UNDP were disbursing more rapidly. Following the
establishment of a new coordination unit (private sector), the disbursement rate picked up and the
project was redesigned in October 1992 to streamline its activities.
Natonal Adcultural lSes,arch Project L. 2042-M1AG). The project experienced an eight-
month start-up delay In meetng credit effectveness conditions. Project execution was disrupted
in 1991 due to the political turmoil in the country and continues to be affected by institutional
disputes. A January 1993 supervision mission agreed on several immediate actions. A mission
is planned for September 1993 to restructure the project.
2.    Some recent breakthroughs have been made which should go some way towards
addressing the generic problems involving procurement and access to special accounts. These
breakthroughs followed the Country Implementation Review (CIR) in Antananarivo in December
1990 and a follow-up CIR in March 1992. Government agreed to: (a) issue new regulations for
procurement and use standard bidding documents which comply with Bank guidelines; and (b)
publish a decree allowing project managers to have direct access to specW accounts to be opened
in commercial banks to ensure that fumds for project implementation are available as and when
needed. Standard Bank bidding documents are already being used, and arrangements are being
fnalized to make the new special accounts operational for all projects. In addition, attention is
being given to the availability of counterpart fimds for Bank projects within the context of public
expenditure/ investment reviews, and to identifying areas where shifting priorities or resource
constraints may necessitate restructuring. Another CIR wil be planned soon after a new
government, resulting from the forthcoming elections, is in place. In FY93, up to end May
1993, disbursement on investment operations accelerated to US$36.3 million, i.e. about 40% over
the total amount disbursed in FY92.
