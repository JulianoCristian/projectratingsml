"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated unsatisfactory.\n            Project outcome is rated unsatisfactory. Sustainability of\n            most of the project activities is rated highly unlikely, for\n            lack of adequate budgetary resources to continue project\n            activities. The three institutions of upper-secondary\n            education are one exception. The likelihood that they will\n            continue to function is highly likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were judged to be unsatisfactory\n            overall. Lessons learned included the following: While it is\n            recognized that the country experienced severe budgetary\n            difficulties during the life of this project, nevertheless,\n            projects in high priority sectors like education should be\n            fully funded, and the funds released promptly, particularly\n            when the Borrower has repeatedly indicated that\n            donor-assisted projects are to receive highest priority for\n            counterpart funding. If Papua New Guinea is unable or\n            unwilling to provide funds as agreed, then the Bank should\n            consider terminating its involvement in the project. Also,\n            what would be viewed as corruption or nepotism in some\n            Western societies is viewed as just or moral in traditional\n            Papua New Guinean society, with some justification. The\n            lesson learned is that the Bank should proceed to assist\n            another project in the education sector in PNG only if firm\n            arrangmeents have been made for the core functions of\n            project coordination, accounting, and procurement to be\n            provided by staff who have clear terms of reference and who\n            can easily be replaced if they do not perform adequately."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
