ADJUSTMENT LOAN (FESAL)", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "4588", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project is rated as satisfactory,\n            sustainability as likely, institutional development impact\n            as modest, Bank performance as satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance as satisfactory. The critical lessons drawn from\n            this project include: 1) A serious macroeconomic\n            stabilization program for the overall economy, which is\n            successfully implemented and adhered to by the Government,\n            is essential for the success of financial sector reforms. 2)\n            A high degree of political ownership and consensus behind\n            the reform program are necessary preconditions for the\n            successful adoption and implementation of financial sector\n            reforms. 3) Good preparatory work needs to be conducted and\n            consensus developed amongst all stakeholders. The\n            intellectual groundwork laid by the Bank through the Banking\n            Sector Review, Export Finance Intermediation Loan, and the\n            risk management workshop allowed it to react quickly and to\n            take on a leadership role in the resolution of the banking\n            crisis. 4) There is sometimes a risk of overestimating\n            institutional capacity; programs need to be designed with a\n            sharp focus on institutional issues."}, "docdt": "2002-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
