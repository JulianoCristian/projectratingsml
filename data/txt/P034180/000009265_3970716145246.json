The\n            project seeks to: (1) improve child cognitive and\n            psycho-social development; (2) improve child health and\n            nutrition; (3) increase school enrollment at the appropriate\n            age; and (4) reduce dropout and repetition rates in lower\n            primary school.  An important collaborative objective is to\n            improve the human capital potential specifically of poor and\n            otherwise disadvantaged pre-schoolers.  The project consists\n            of two core components: (1) improving ECD worker training,\n            performance, and supervision; and (2) community capacity\n            building, mobilization, and parenting education.  Three\n            pilot interventions will test options to develop\n            cost-effective, replicable models for: (1) improving the\n            financing of ECD services in poor communities by way of\n            community grants; (2) raising nutrition and health standards\n            of pre-schoolers, including those in the particularly\n            vulnerable first three years of life; and (3) smoothing the\n            transition from pre-school to primary school."}, "docdt": "1997-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
