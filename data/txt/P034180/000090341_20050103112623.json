The\n            lessons learned indicate that the project managed to do NGO\n            contracting; but there were stark differences in perception\n            as to whether it was / should be a contractual or a\n            partnership arrangement (e.g., the NGOs saw themselves less\n            as a contractor and more as a partner, but the Government\n            saw the NGOs as contractors). Fund-flow arrangements need to\n            be simple; this is a systemic issue in Kenya and should be\n            resolved at the highest levels. This project appears to have\n            suffered from sub-optimal institutional arrangements.\n            Capacity building needs to be based on a detailed capacity\n            analysis, focusing not only on training, but more\n            comprehensively on systems, equipment, organizational\n            structures and organizational culture. It is not limited to\n            the Ministry level or the Government, but needs to be\n            applied to sub-national levels, to the NGOs and to the local\n            communities as well. Capital investments in hardware\n            components, especially civil works, should be only financed\n            if clearly justified based on need, and should not be\n            without appropriate linkages to the software components, or\n            adequate resources for maintenance, supplies and other\n            recurrent costs."}, "docdt": "2004-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
