Furthermore, IDA was not\n            vigilant regarding conformity to the Bank's procurement\n            guidelines. The Implementation of the project would have\n            been improved by hiring a resident independent part-time\n            exploration advisor, who could have supervised the\n            consultant's selection, technical work, and invoicing,\n            by closer IDA supervision. Which could have avoided the\n            inadequate implementation of several components of the\n            projects, and unduly high costs for the Borrower. If and\n            when the World Bank resumes lending to Liberia, it will be\n            urgent to assist in privatizing the Liberian Petroleum\n            Refining Company (L.P.R.C), and improving the management of\n            the petroleum products supply and storage, in order to stop\n            the Government's financial deficiency."}, "docdt": "1989-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
