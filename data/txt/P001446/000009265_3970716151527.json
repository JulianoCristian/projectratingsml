In addition, the project will continue\n            with the:  (i) institutional strengthening initiated under\n            the first project and assist in the formulation of rational\n            policies in the petroleum sector.  The project further\n            consists of; (ii) offshore exploration promotion which\n            includes acquisition of new seismic data and a review of\n            existing information; (iii) onshore exploration which\n            involves a gravity survey and geochemical analysis and;\n            finally (iv) petroleum procurement and storage."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
