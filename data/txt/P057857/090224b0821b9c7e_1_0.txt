                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project contributed to reduce the gap in graduation rates at the secondary level between the national level and targeted areas. It has been reduced from 16 percentage points in
                         2008 to 4 percentage points in 2012. It has also contributed to reduce the administrative cost per beneficiary of equity programs from 10.855 Colones to 6.629 Colones. With respect
                         to decreasing the gap in exam scores between national and targeted areas, the results were not achieved as expected; however, 2013 exam scores need to be considered at the
                         final evaluation since they are not currently available. Under Component 1, 75 schools have been built and furnished. With respect to Component 2, three key studies were completed
                         with the objective to improve: the management of equity programs, the management of administrative schools councils and the organizational model of the equity programs unit.

                         Concerning Component 3, some activities with inter-cultural education have been carried out. The Project could not complete before the closing date some activities related to rural
                         and intercultural education programs and related training and ICT equipment provision.
