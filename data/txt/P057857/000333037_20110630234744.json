The major\n            changes to the project and rationale are: revisions to\n            project components to align project activities to current\n            Government strategic priorities, including the elimination\n            of some activities which overlapped with other activities\n            and to more logically regroup similar activities; changes to\n            the results framework in order to reflect the changes to the\n            components, and introduce indicators that better reflect\n            project objectives and outputs, modifications in the\n            components, and are measurable through Ministry of Public\n            Education (MEP) databases and include baselines; and an 18\n            month extension of the closing date in order to help ensure\n            sufficient time for revised targets to be met."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
