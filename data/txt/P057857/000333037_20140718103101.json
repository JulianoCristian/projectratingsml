Rica were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: when\n            a risk cannot be mitigated, the activity should be either\n            dropped or substantially modified. Experiences or good\n            practices from other countries can be transferred, provided\n            two conditions are fulfilled: (i) there is Government\n            ownership; and (ii) a careful institutional analysis\n            demonstrates that the conditions for this transfer are\n            favorable. It is extremely risky to carry out a project with\n            a participatory approach in a complex institutional context,\n            particularly when the project design does not define\n            decision-making power regarding school investment and\n            contents of the subprojects to be financed. In rural areas,\n            it is possible to propose a pedagogical model and teaching\n            conditions for secondary education which provide the same\n            opportunities to children from low income families and\n            promote equity. The participatory approach is appropriate to\n            adapt the curriculum to the indigenous culture and\n            infrastructure to the needs and local customs. 76. The\n            environmental safeguards could be used as a tool and\n            framework to implement and monitor a National indigenous\n            policy. Construction processes through community\n            participation or managed by a competitively-selected third\n            party can be effective and cost-efficient."}, "docdt": "2014-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
