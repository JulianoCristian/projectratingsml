The\n            closing date of the project will be extended for 12 months\n            from December 31, 2012 until December 31, 2013. The\n            extension is necessary in order to allow the project to\n            finance the construction of 34 schools, and the full\n            furnishing and equipping of all schools. The extension will\n            also allow continued financing of some key technical\n            assistance activities related to institutional and\n            curricular reform. All these activities are crucial to\n            achieve the project development objective. This will be the\n            second closing date extension."}, "docdt": "2012-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
