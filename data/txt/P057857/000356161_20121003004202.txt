                                  Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for Costa Rica Equity and Efficiency of Education Project, Loan
   7284-CR, P057857, will be extended for 12 months from December 31, 2012 until
   December 31, 2013.

2. Implementation has continued improving over the last 6 months. Under Component
   1, 47 primary schools and 11 secondary schools have been built. With respect to
   Component 2, three key consultancies were completed with the objective to improve:
   the management of equity programs, the management of administrative school
   councils and the organizational model of the equity programs unit in the Ministry of
   Public Education. Concerning Component 3, several activities related to inter-cultural
   education have been carried out.

3. The extension is necessary in order to allow the Project to finance the construction of
   34 schools, and the full furnishing and equipping of all schools. The extension would
   also allow continued financing of some key technical assistance activities related to
   institutional and curricular reform. All these activities are crucial to achieve the
   Project Development Objective.

4. This would be the second closing date extension. The first extended the Project’s
   closing date for 18 months, from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012.
