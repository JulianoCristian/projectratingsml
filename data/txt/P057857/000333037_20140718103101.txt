                   quality secondary education (Liceos rurales) where this opportunity did not exist

1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

1.      In 2003, the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) launched a Plan called
"Relanzamiento de la Educación Costarricense" (Revamping Costa Rican
Education) with the goals to: (i) close the rural-urban education attainment gaps which
continue even at the primary education level; (ii) increase and sustain the participation of
students from low-income families in the education sector; and (iii) improve secondary
and technical education. To ensure equity, regions with low education outcomes as well
as students and families from the lowest income quintiles were especially targeted, most
of which were rural. Given the low secondary education indicators (gross coverage of
65.6% in 2002 with a completion rate of only 30%), the Government proposed to
continue investing strongly at this level nationwide. These goals were consistent with the
objectives of the CAS dated April 27, 2004. While noting important improvements in the
social sectors, the CAS supported social development sustainability and, more
specifically, closing the gaps that remained across regions and social groups with regards
to learning quality, coverage and graduation rates in education.

       Despite undeniable progress, particularly to universalize primary education
completion, Costa Rica faced several issues. First, a quality gap measured by low
graduation rates at the primary level still subsisted between urban and rural areas and,
more specifically, in the indigenous territories. At the secondary level, the gap was much
worse (62.7% passed the final secondary exam or “Bachillerato” at national level,
compared to 56% in rural area and only 14.1% in indigenous territories) due to a problem
of access with a lack of facilities, combined with an issue of low quality and inadequate
modalities of education (telesecundaria). 1 In addition, the equity programs including
scholarships, transportation, and food needed to be better targeted to induce a greater
education demand among the poorest families.

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

2.    The objectives of the Project are to: (a) reduce education quality gaps in the
Borrower’s primary and secondary education system in rural areas; and (b) improve the


1
  Telesecundaria was conceived as a low cost secondary education modality through distance education via
TV for students in rural areas. The main limitation of this alternative method was the narrow coverage,
proposed to serve only the 8th and 9th grades, when four years of education (10th and 11th grade) were
necessary to prepare for the bachillerato. In addition, the 2006 assessment done by the MEP showed that
“telesecundaria” schools: (i) lack of supervision from the MEP; (ii) had non-functional and deteriorated
facilities, some with no electricity or connection for the TV set; (iii) received limited support of books and
didactic materials; and (iv) had less than three teachers per school, most of whom lacked the right skills and
profile for secondary education.

equity and efficiency in the allocation, administration and use of the Borrower’s
education sector resources. 2

3.       Key indicators for rating Project outcomes were:

      a) Reduce internal education efficiency gaps in primary education in the targeted
         macro-regions of the Project (composed of municipalities with low education
         indicators and indigenous and afro-descendent populations). The reduction of the
         educational regional gaps was measured by the following education efficiency
         indicators: (i) average percentage of overage students and (ii) dropout rates.
      b) Improved efficiency of non-traditional secondary education rural modalities
         (“telesecundaria”) and increased access in targeted rural areas.
      c) Increase equity of demand-based education programs and increase access of
         beneficiaries (including indigenous and afro-descendent populations) from the
         lowest income quintiles (quintile 1 and 2) in the targeted macro-regions.
      d) Improved cooperation among rural schools measured by the conformation of at
         least 60 Rural School Collaborative Networks and improved shared utilization of
         key education quality inputs within the Collaborative Network, mainly: (i)
         infrastructure; (ii) information and technology centers; and (iii) allocation of
         specialized teachers (second language, culture and values, physical education,
         etc.)

Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

4.       The PDO remained unchanged. The restructuring was done under the constraint
that the PDO could not be changed since it would have implied Congressional approval,
along with the risk that the delay for approval would be too long and that the Project
would have to be closed. However, the 2011 restructuring made substantial changes to
the Project: (i) the four original PDO indicators were revised and replaced with 3 new
PDO indicators; and (ii) the targeted areas were defined as the 9 rural administrative
territories (which span 10 indigenous territories out of 24 total in Costa Rica). This
restructuring was carried out: (i) to better reflect the PDO and allow for the measurement
of outcomes through the MEP database; and (ii) to identify the areas of Project activity to
facilitate its implementation.

     a) Reducing Quality Gaps: Reduce education quality gaps in targeted areas
        (percentage of students that pass “bachillerato” exams).
     b) Improving Equity: Reduce gaps in the secondary graduation rate in targeted areas
        (graduation rate measured as the ratio between 11th grade enrollment and 7th
        grade enrollment).




2
    The PDOs are from the loan agreement.



                                             2
     c) Improving Efficiency: Reduce administrative costs per beneficiary of MEP’s
        Equity Programs (scholarships, transportation, and food).

1.3     Main Beneficiaries

5.       The Project was originally intended to serve in the Municipalities,
communities and schools with the lowest education indicators which include the
following direct beneficiaries in rural, indigenous/afro-descendent and low income
communities: (i) 25,000 students from preschool to grade 6 in dispersed rural
communities (mostly in multigrade schools); (ii) 6,000 students grade 7 to 11 (mostly in
“telesecundaria” schools) in dispersed rural communities; (iii) 200,000 students in
primary education schools; and (iv) 1,000 students in secondary schools. And the other
beneficiaries included the technical units of the MEP, the Regional and District Offices,
institutions implementing education demand–side programs and community-based school
councils.

6.     When the 2011 restructuring redefined the areas of project activity, the
beneficiaries changed to: (i) students in primary education schools and secondary
schools in 9 rural Administrative circuits, all of whom directly benefited from activities
under Component 1 and measured as per PDOs indictor 2; (ii) the beneficiaries of the
equity programs (as per shown in intermediate indicator 6, Component 2); (ii) the
teachers assigned to rural areas; and (iii) the staff of the MEP’s technical units at central
and regional level.

1.4     Original Components (as approved)

7.      The Project consisted of three components:

Component 1: The Quality and Equity of Rural Education Component aimed at financing
the implementation of Annual Operational Subprojects (POA Subprojects) to improve
rural education attainment (Rural Education Quality and Equity Subprojects) and
institutional development (Institutional Development Subprojects). To orient the
preparation of the POA Subprojects, a menu of strategies and expected results to increase
the level, quality and equity of basic (up to 9th grade) rural education have been included
in a Policy Activity Schedule, PAS.

Component 2: Equity of Education Services. This component aimed at increasing the
capacity of the MEP to reduce equity gaps by supporting activities to identify, reach and
monitor the delivery of pertinent supply and demand education services to regions with
low education indicators and students from low income households by (i) raising the
capacity of various MEP units managing the MEP’s demand-based equity programs:
scholarships, vouchers, transportation and school meals; and (ii) developing and
implementing an integrated information system that can track the diverse education
outcomes across municipalities, communities and schools (Sistema de Información de
Desarrollo Educativo SIDE).




                                             3
Component 3: Improved Institutional Efficiency. This component aimed at improving
the institutional capacity of the MEP through inter-departmental integration strategies and
working alliances across central, regional and school organizations. The component was
expected: (i) to strengthen the capacity of the MEP’s staff (both of pedagogical and
administration units) to conduct participatory sector diagnosis, plan strategically, and
implement, monitor and evaluate education programs; (ii) to improve the efficiency of
education services provided in the rural sector, by the integration and strengthening of the
MEP units leading such services; and (iii) to increase capacity of the Project
Coordination Unit for coordination, fiduciary, monitoring and evaluation activities of
externally financed projects , which in turn should support the Technical Units of the
MEP.

1.5        Revised Components

8.      When it was clear that the Project with its original design could not progress
and needed to be adapted to the Government’s policy, the Bank initiated the
restructuring of the Project in 2009. However, the Bank came to an agreement with the
Government to proceed with the formal restructuring on 06/29/2011 for the following
reasons: (i) to finalize the operation manual, the environmental framework and the
indigenous people plan; (ii) to evaluate at mid-term some activities, such as the
information systems; and (iii) to proceed first with the institutional changes to resolve the
conflict between PROMECE and the MEP.

9.       To better align the activities with Government’s priorities and policy
changes 3 , to clarify and simplify the content of each component, to focus the
Component 1 infrastructure in targeted areas and to regroup more logically similar
activities, the revised project consisted of three components:

Component 1: Improving access to quality education through: (i) the renovation of
existing classrooms and the construction of new classrooms, including the provision of
furniture and equipment such as computers and software: (ii) School building facilities,
such as construction and provision of furniture, and equipment for kitchens, teachers
lounges, student dormitories, and restrooms in schools belonging to rural School
Networks; (iii) the construction of common school network facilities, such as technology
centers and cultural, arts and physical education facilities, including the provision of
equipment as well as energy and connectivity facilities; and (iv) the provision of furniture
and equipment for the Regional Indigenous Education Directorate of Sula.

Component 2: Improving MEP’s Institutional Efficiency through: (i) the development
and implementation of an education sector information system at the school level; (ii) the
support for MEP’s Implementing Technical Units that manage the Equity Programs and
the Transfers Program to improve planning and monitoring of such Programs; (iii) the



3
    The policy changes are described in par 27 and 28.



                                                         4
support of implementation of MEP’s institutional reform; and (iv) the management of the
implementation of the Project.

Component 3: Strengthening the quality of primary and secondary education through: (i)
the development and implementation of a training program in intercultural education for
MEP staff at the central and regional level; (ii) a rural education quality improvement
program adapted to the local and cultural context, including the development of a strategy
to transform Telesecundarias to Liceos Rurales, the development of rural teaching
methods that use ICTs, the provision of computer equipment and professional
development programs for teachers assigned to rural areas; (iii) improvements in MEP
staff and teacher capacity to analyze student learning assessments.

1.6    Other significant changes

10.      An amendment to the Loan agreement was approved on August 23, 2007 to:
(i) introduce the May 2004 Procurement and Consultant Guidelines; (ii) include a new
procurement method (Community Participation); and (iii) change the disbursement
percentage of category 5 from 90% to 100%.

11.     A second amendment to the Loan agreement was approved on September 3,
2008 to increase the authorized allocation to US$3 million and the disbursement
percentages to 100% in categories 1), 2) and 3). Permit taxes will be also be considered
as eligible expenditures.

12.     The June 29, 2011 restructuring: (i) reorganized project activities; (ii)
redefined the targeted areas of project activities, discontinuing the four initial macro
regions and focusing the construction on 10 indigenous territories; (ii) aligned the
outcome indicators with the PDO and adjusted the monitoring indicators to the changes
in project activities; (iii) reallocated the Loan proceeds among different categories; (iv)
reflected changes in the disbursement percentages in all categories to 100 percent; (v)
clarified the responsibilities between PROMECE, the MEP’s Office and MEP’s
Technical Units; and (vi) extended the Project closing dates to December 31, 2012.

13.     The September 25, 2012 restructuring extended the Project for 12 months
(from December 31, 2012 until December 31, 2013). The extension was necessary to
finance: (i) the construction of 34 schools and the full furnishing and equipping of all
schools; and (ii) some key technical assistance activities related to institutional and
curricular reform.

2.         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Strengths

14.     The Project built on strong analytical work regarding: (i) social sector
financing (Costa Rica: Social Spending and the Poor 2003); (ii) education, productive
technology and competitiveness, with a focus on secondary education (Closing the Gap
in Education and Technology); and (iii) economic analysis of the education sector
(Diagnóstico Económico de la Educación en Costa Rica). This analytical work
disaggregated data by region/poverty, included ethnic variable for schools, and needs
adapted to the different school situations. This approach raised the Government’s
attention about uneven education performance across regions and income quintiles and
was particularly appropriate to address equity gaps and improve efficiency.

15.     The Project was targeted to serve rural, indigenous/afro-descendants and low
income and socially disadvantaged communities that had the lowest education
indicators in terms of years of schooling and literacy rates. It engaged the borrower’s
attention and commitment: (i) to address equity issues and close education gaps; (ii) to
increase local participation and promote the role of civil society organizations; and (iii) to
pioneer innovative approaches to improving educational efficiency.

16.      Lessons from projects in Central 4 and South America dealing with education
for rural dispersed communities were reflected in the Project design. In particular,
those related to: (i) community participation and decentralization of school resources to
school councils; (ii) well-managed multi-grade classrooms to improve student
achievement; (iii) a flexible curriculum, tailored to individual needs of students; (iv)
improved school organization, planning and management of resources; and (v)
institutionalizing community participation within the legal and financial framework of
public education system management.

17.    The IDB and the World Bank formed a strategic alliance to coordinate efforts,
wherein they determined that the Bank’s support for rural education would complement
IDB’s support to secondary education nationwide.

18.    The high counterpart funding of 40% indicated the strong commitment of the
Costa Rican Government to the Project objectives.

Weaknesses

19.   The Project was too complex and lacked the clarity to be fully understood by
those who had to implement it. First, because of the change in Government


4
    In particular, the flagship project EDUCO in Salvador.



                                                       6
administrations, the MEP team who implemented the Project was different from the team
who prepared it. Second, Component 1 of the Project included a Policy and Activity
Schedule (PAS), which proposed a comprehensive and potentially effective menu of
areas, objectives and results for the preparation of POA sub-projects. However, choices
of activities and investments were vaguely defined and left to the discretion of local
communities. Third, there was overlap in some activities among components causing
confusion around the responsibility for implementation. Finally, the Project’s results
framework had an unnecessary high level of details which added to the overall confusion.

20.    The scope of the Project was too large in attempting to achieve three
objectives: closing the education quality gap of the indigenous group and lower income
students in rural areas, increasing efficiency of the education system and the efficiency in
the equity of resource allocation in rural education. The Project was too ambitious in its
expectation that it could change the organization and institutional culture of the MEP. For
instance: strengthening the capacity of the DIEE (Direction of Infrastructure) to provide
necessary technical assistance to the school councils to build school infrastructure.

21.     Despite the wealth of information available, the selection of the targeted
areas and schools to be financed by the Project was not accomplished during the
Project’s preparation. Moreover, there was no clarity on the selection process. It was
not clear if the 20-24 municipalities with the lowest education indicators would be
selected within the targeted Macro-Regions (Norte, Atlántico, Puntarenas and
Guanacaste) for the Project’s investment. To carry out the targeting, the MEP was
supposed to develop the IRE (Índice de Rezago Educativo) which combined: (i) socio-
economic indicators; (ii) provision of quality inputs by the MEP (teachers, technology
centers and infrastructure); and (iii) participation of equity demands programs to correlate
the allocation of education inputs and socio-economic gaps. The IRE should have been
provided by the general information system SIDE (Sistema de Information del Desarrollo
Educativo) to be developed within the Project, but was considered inconsistent with the
sequencing of the investment. The institutional set-up and the complex decision-making
process in Costa Rica are largely the root cause of the aforementioned issues.

22.     The Project Implementation Arrangements and the responsibilities were
insufficiently defined. The reliance upon coordinating mechanisms–Comité Superior
Consultivo and Comité de Unidades Ejecutoras—neither guaranteed an efficient
decision-making process nor secured the integration of the technical units, including
common objectives and implementation strategies. Due to the insufficient definition of
implementation arrangements and the complexity of the Project, the design of an
Operations Manual was still not completed in 2008. The Project investments definition
(about 60% of the Project) relied almost entirely on the participation of local
communities and empowered the regional technical units of the MEP. This deliberate
choice of the preparation team was based on good practices in other countries; however,
the feasibility of this bottom up/demand-side approach was insufficiently analyzed in the
Costa Rican Institutional context.




                                             7
23.     The critical risks were not properly identified, the assessment
underestimated the risks and the measures that could mitigate these risks were
inaccurate. First, the assessment completely ignored the broad country risk due to the
political crisis that emerged in 2004 (prior to Board approval) and the limited power of
the executive branch of Government versus the legislature, along with the length of
constitutional review for the ratification of external loans. 5 In programming the Board
presentation, the Bank failed to plan according to the cycle for project approval and
project budgets. Second, it underestimated the risks related to the low capacity of the
MEP to efficiently execute the Project and, more specifically, the accountability of the
technical units of MEP regarding their respective components. Overall, PROMECE could
have had a clearer and narrower role as fiduciary management unit, along with the
possibility to support the institutionalization of Project management within MEP, given
responsibility to the technical units (“Unidades Ejecutoras”). Third, the assessment
underestimated the risk linked to the participatory process wherein the POA (Annual
Operational Subprojects) was prepared based on the various inputs provided by local
communities. There was no evidence that the procedures were clear and the processes
and capacity where in place in the MEP to guarantee a participatory process.

2.2     Implementation

Factors outside the control of the Government and the implementing agency

24.     There was a 21-month delay in project effectiveness. Despite the government’s
full commitment to the Project objectives, it was in the last year of its tenure and,
therefore, had little influence in Congress to secure ratification. General elections were
held on February 5, 2006 and the new Government which took office on May 8, 2006 had
to re-enter the ratification of the loan in the Congressional agenda in June 2006, after
which they received legislative approval and completed the legal formalities. The Project
was declared effective on December 21, 2006. Given the late approval during the
calendar year 2006, the 2007 Budget Law did not include the Project’s proposed
investments; therefore, the Project required an “extraordinary” budget approval by the
National Assembly. At the time, the Congressional agenda was polarized by CAFTA
(Central American Free Trade Agreement) negotiations and the Law modifying the
budget was not approved until August 2007. As a result, the first loan disbursement took
place in March 2008.

25.     The decision of Contraloría General de la República (CGR) regarding the
Project's largest procurement contract (US$3.7 million) contradicted the Bank's
rules and significantly affected Project completion. The bidding process for the
procurement contract (to purchase computer equipment for teachers and students in the
targeted area) involved several activities across the components and, therefore, impeded
the full execution and disbursement of loan proceeds. Following a complaint to


5
 The Government's collapse occurred during project preparation. Considering the risk, the Bank could
have delayed completing project preparation and Board approval until new elections had been held.




                                                 8
the CGR, the procurement process failed and the contract was not awarded due to a
difference in Bank procedures and country procurement rules, with the CGR favoring
country rule—a decision that the Bank found unacceptable. The Bank, with the support
of the Ministry of Finance, stated that an additional extension of the Project was possible
if the case was resolved. After PROMECE cancelled and published the failed process,
CGR allowed for an appeal from the affected firm, as a result the Bank did not proceed
with the extension.

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control

26.     In April 2009, the High Education Council (CSE the “Consejo Superior de
Educación”) decided to transform “telesecundaria” to “Liceos rurales” and
approved a new curriculum from grade 7 to 11. This was a fundamental step to
promote equity as this policy aimed to provide access to secondary school to all students
in rural areas and prepare for their Bachillerato. This policy consisted in: (i)
implementing the new curriculum (of 4 years instead of the 2 included in telesecundaria),
with a minimum of 5 qualified professors in the main disciplines by Liceo (instead of 1 to
3 unqualified in telelesecundaria); (ii) rehabilitating and building school infrastructure;
(iii) appointing a Director and an administrative staff member in each institution; (iv)
adapting program contents to the context and providing specific books and pedagogical
materials; (v) increasing the number of scholarships available; (vi) increasing enrollment
in each institution; (vii) providing a wage premium of 50% to attract teachers in rural
areas; and (viii) providing energy, connectivity and computer equipment.

27.     In 2007, MEP initiated an institutional reform (Decree 34075) and
implemented a large scale reorganization of its internal structure (Decree 35513 of
September 25, 2009) to eliminate duplication of functions and inefficiencies. This
decree established the guidelines for the decentralization in the Regional Directorates and
their respective responsibility in implementing an education policy that recognizes
cultural and ethnic diversity. That effort did not substantially increase the accountability
of the technical units of the MEP to implement the Project’s technical components.
However, there exist two notable exceptions: (i) the equity programs (except
scholarships) were grouped under a new directorate of equity programs; and (ii) a
Department for Intercultural Education (DEI) was established within the Directorate for
Curriculum Development. At the time, DIEE was still under development and
overwhelmed by the national investment program it managed. Therefore, the Government
decided in 2010 that the infrastructure of component 1 would be managed by
PROMECE 6. The PROMECE structure was revised in August 2010 and approved by the
Ministry of Planning (Ministerial Decision 433). The restructuring of MEP was
complemented in 2011 through the organization of the financial and budget department
(decree 36451) and in 2014 by the organization of the central department (decree 38170).


6
  PROMECE (Programa de Mejoramiento de la Calidad de Educación) was a Project Implementation Unit
created in 1992 to manage all the exterior funded projects and in particular the one co-financed by IDB and
the Bank.



                                                     9
28.     The implementation of the Project was severely hampered by internal
struggles between PROMECE and MEP regarding the management of the Project.
Since 1992, PROMECE was in charge of executing all externally-funded education
projects, both technically and fiduciary, to the point that it became a parallel structure that
could challenge the power and decision-making role of the MEP. The original design of
the Project changed this balance by reducing the role of PROMECE to a PCU in charge
of the administrative, fiduciary and monitoring activities within the organizational
structure of the MEP, while the technical and planning leadership remained under the
purvey of MEP’s technical units (“Unidades Ejecutoras”). However, the responsibilities
and the decision-making process were not defined until the 2011 restructuring. There
was a lack of clear understanding of the competencies of PROMECE with respect to the
implementing units and Office of the Minister, wherein PROMECE had an excessive
presence in the management of the Project and insufficient coordination with the
executing units of MEP. The 2011 restructuring confirmed that the role of the
PROMECE was restricted to the fiduciary and the monitoring aspects of the Project and
the infrastructure and equipment activities under component 1 of the Project. In October
2009, the PROMECE Director was dismissed on the base of an issue raised- not related
to the Project - by the MEP´s Internal Audit, which took place in 2006, and he was
replaced in December 2009. There was three successive PROMECE Directors in 2010.
But the former Director brought his case to Court and then after different appeals to the
Constitutional Court he was temporarily reinstated as PROMECE Director in September
2011 through the close of the project. While at the end the Court failed against the
Director, the project was already in its final stages.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design:

29.    In the initial Project, the Results Framework needed a better alignment of
outcome indicators with the Project Development Objectives and a set of monitoring
indicators that could be more easily measurable through the Ministry of Public
Education’s Database. Many indicators which resulted from analytical work required
an important overhaul of the MEP information systems to be useable for the Project. The
SIDE (Sistema de Desarollo Educativo) which was supposed to link the database of the
MEP to other databases, such as SIPO 7, and provide the indicators related to equity was a
Project output and was not rendered operational to provide regular annual data for the
monitoring.

30.     At the 2011 restructuring, the team changed the results framework to better
reflect Project objectives and outputs, ensure measurability through MEP databases
and to adjust values to the new definition of targeted areas, wherein: i) the four
original PDO indicators were dropped and replaced by three (see para 5 above); and ii)


7
 SIPO is a database developed by IMAS (Instituto Mixto de Asistencia Social) to monitor and target social
programs.



                                                   10
all 11 original intermediate indicators were dropped or revised and replaced by 15.
Because the targeted areas were well identified, the design of the results framework was
much clearer and the monitoring of outputs was substantially improved. However, since
the PDOs were not modified, some shortcomings remained: (i) an indicator should have
been added to measure the reduction of the gap in primary education; (ii) PDO 3, by
measuring the reduction of administrative cost it captures the essence of Component 2 of
the restructured Project, but fails to measure the efficiency of transfers and equity
programs in reaching the low-income students and facilitating their access to education as
initially intended in the original Project; (iii) the baseline and target values of PDO 1
were those of rural areas instead of targeted areas; (iv) the baseline values for PDO 2
were not accurate; and (v) for indicator 10, the target should have been a percentage
instead of an absolute value.

Implementation:

31.     After the restructuring, the monitoring of Project activities and outcomes
indicators improved dramatically. However, the results framework was not updated
regularly and the supervision missions constantly struggled to provide sufficient reporting
of Project implementation in the targeted areas. On the positive side, the workshops
organized with representatives of the indigenous communities were carried out on a
regular basis and allowed the team to measure the communities’ level of satisfaction and
collect their recommendations. Also, the indigenous plan was updated every year;
however, there was no systematic assessment of the impact of the Project, particularly of
the impact on quality as a result of the pedagogical changes in the classroom.

Utilization:

32.     The results framework was limited to the activities of the Project and the data for
the indicators were provided with delays.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental:

33.     The Project triggered OP/BP 4.01 (Environment). The team prepared an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) in December 2003, which
included an environmental assessment template and environmental guidelines for
contractors. The environmental assessment template included screening criteria to
identify, evaluate and mitigate potential environmental or social impacts from school
construction and rehabilitation. The template was updated in July 2009 to incorporate
SETENA environmental guidelines and requirements for Environment Viability License
applications. PROMECE prepared environmental impact files for each Project site. The
Operations Manual also included specific requirements that define license or permit
solicitation processes related to the regional National Areas Protected System (Sistema
Nacional de Areas de Conservación, SINAC) to ensure that trees cut down for
construction do not impact protected areas and forests. In addition, environmental



                                            11
supervisors were hired for each cluster of school subprojects to ensure that construction
complied with the requirements outlined in the Operations Manual.

34.      The updated Operations Manual included screening criteria that ensures
that all lands designated for school construction or refurbishment are free of
outstanding legal issues and would not imply physical or economic displacement
impacts, per OP/BP 4.12. Given the vast majority of schools have been constructed
within the Indigenous Collective’s 12 Territories, land usage rights are transferred from
the Indigenous Development Association (Asociaciones de Desarrollo Indigenas, ADIs),
or legal representative of the Territory, to the Education or Administrative Council. A
usage rights agreement was signed as one of the primary steps for Project eligibility. The
assessment done by the Bank in 2011 revealed that: (i) of the 81 schools to be constructed
or refurbished, 74 were located on the same site as an already establishes and operational
education center; and (ii) for the 7 new properties, 4 had no current use, 2 sites were yet
to be determined and 1 site required the Project to await the expiration of an agreement
for agricultural use. All the outstanding land issues were resolved except one and, as a
result, one school (the school of Vesta in the territory Cabeca Tayni) was not built.

Indigenous:

35.      The Project triggered OP/BP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples) as the direct
beneficiaries of this Project are overwhelmingly Indigenous, wherein 80 of the 81
school construction/refurbishment projects were located in Indigenous Territories,
Component 2 supported the strengthening of the Indigenous Education System, and
Component 3 supported the development of Intercultural Education. As part of
Project Preparation in 2003, a Social Assessment and an Indigenous Peoples Planning
Framework (IPPF) were prepared based on extensive consultations with Indigenous and
rural education stakeholders. The Project’s implementation included all of the
recommendations. As part of the restructuring, the IPPF was updated and validated after
three workshops held on October 29 and 30 and November 9, 2012 to consult a select
group of Indigenous leaders that represent Costa Rica’s different ethnicities and
territories. Whereas the original Project included activities designed to take place in the
Department of Limon— which is home to the majority of the Afro-Costa Rican
population—these activities have been subsequently removed from the Project due to the
provision of alternative financing for construction in this area. As a result, the updated
IPPF only addressed issues related to Indigenous Peoples and not the Afro-Costa Rican
population.

36.    The IPPF itself served as the MEP’s Indigenous Peoples Plan, fully
incorporating during implementation: (a) the principles and processes of free, prior
and informed consultation with ADIs, which are the legal Indigenous representatives,
relevant stakeholders (Indigenous parents and teachers) and traditional leaders; (b)
documentation of broad support in each beneficiary community; and (c) socio-cultural
adaptations in the implementation of consultation processes, work within Indigenous
communities, and in the design of schools, legal reforms and processes to develop the
subcomponent on intercultural education.



                                            12
37.     Finally, the MEP issued the Decree 35513 on August 2012, which reorganized
the regional school administration, thereby recognizing the 24 indigenous territories
and creating the Regional Directorate of Sula to represent 7 territories of Limon
and 6 administrative circuits. In addition, 9 indigenous circuits were created and
integrated with the Regional Directorate of Turrialba, Grande de Térraba and Coto. The
Government also saw the Project as a key tool in helping Costa Rica to comply with its
international obligation under International Labor Organization (ILO) 169, which calls
for education systems to respect Indigenous cultures and participation in curriculum
development, teaching and management.

38.     The Project successfully established the indigenous and intercultural policy
by: (i) fully renewing and developing the education system in in the majority of Costa
Rica’s indigenous territory and providing new opportunities for youth and their families;
and (ii) establishing the DRE of Sula specific to indigenous territories and permanent
participatory and consultative processes with the communities; (iii) including the
Department for Intercultural Education (DEI of 6 staff) in the MEP organization to put in
place a full-scale intercultural education policy, including the development of didactic
materials adapted to the cultural context, the organization of a series of trainings for
teachers and regional advisors, the definition of infrastructure needs and design of
schools through participatory methods that respect indigenous cultures.

39.     Financial Management Performance throughout the project life was, in
general, moderately satisfactory. In September 2012, significant delays in the
submission of the IFRs and Audit Reports were noted. This issue was fixed in April 2013
and IFRs were delivered to the Bank in general with either minor or moderate delays
throughout the life of the project. . During the last supervision to the project before its
closure, some poor contract monitoring practices and ineligible expenditures were
detected. The Bank performed a follow-up visit to the project during the grace period to
support PROMECE in the closing processes, including ensuring that the reimbursement
of the ineligible expenditures, the final cancellation of funds and the delivery of the final
audit report were done on time.,. With the exception of the first and the last audit reports
for the project, which were delivered timely, all other audits were delivered with
important delays.

40.     Procurement arrangements were appropriate. Three processes were used for
construction: (i) community participation (the community built the school with the
support of one engineer) for 18% of the cases; (ii) work subcontracted/delegated to firms
which manage the entire process for 28% of the cases; and (iii) construction companies
for 54% of the cases. These processes were recognized as very successful by the
communities and authorities. Nevertheless, several procurement problems occurred. First,
the procurement of 12 consultants to develop 30 participative diagnostics (for a cost of
US$ 360,000) in 2009 was cancelled and investigated by the MEP Internal Audit Unit
and by the “Contraloría General de la República” (CGR) MEP specifically requested
two ex-post procurement reviews (the first in May 2009 and the second in November
2010). Both Bank reviews found the same misprocesses and mistakes, but the Bank
finally considered there were not enough infringements to declare misprocurement.



                                             13
Second, the procurement of computers (US$ 3.7 million) to equip the schools failed
following a complaint to the CGR. The contract was not awarded due to a difference in
Bank procedures and country procurement rules, with the CGR favoring country rules
that the Bank found unacceptable. The Bank objected to the evaluation report,
consequently PROMECE requested cancellation of the process on November 1, 2013.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.    There is no specific operation or next phase programmed. Nevertheless, the
experience gained in the targeted areas to develop quality and intercultural education will
be used in the other indigenous territories. The ownership and improved autonomy of the
indigenous communities through the Project and Decree 35513, which regulates
indigenous and intercultural education, strongly indicate that the policy in favor of
education in rural areas and for the indigenous population will be continued.

3.     Assessment of outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance: Pre – 2011 restructuring – Substantial/Post restructuring -Substantial

Relevance of objectives: Substantial

42.     The Project objectives are embedded in the National Development Plan 2010-
2014. It “guarantees the right for all to quality education, which is vital to economic
dynamism, social cohesion and collective identity. This right will be consolidated using
equity instruments for moving towards universal coverage in preschool, primary and
secondary. This requires adequately funded and efficiently integrate equity programs and
uses them to offset the effect of the various economic, ethnic, cultural, gender inequalities
and other limiting access to equal opportunities in education.” This strongly indicates that
the Government will continue to pursue the objective of increasing the graduation rate in
secondary education as well as reducing the quality gaps in rural areas through
investments and equity programs. The Project’s objectives are consistent with the
Cluster 2 of the Country Partnership Strategy 2012-2015 (CPS) to improve efficiency and
equity in social sectors. The CPS specifies that: (i) the Government will continue efforts
to increase the number of secondary graduates with a special focus on the poor. (ii) The
Government is strongly committed to education with the passage of legislation to
increase the budget allocation to the sector for 6% to 8%.

Relevance of design: Substantial

43.     The Project design is highly relevant with the objective of reducing the
quality gaps in rural area and moving forward to guarantee the right for all to
quality education. Three main components can be considered best practices to achieve
the objectives: : (i) to invest in “Liceos rurales,” which have proven to be the most
efficient way to promote graduation at secondary education level; (ii) to adapt the



                                             14
curriculum and teaching in primary and secondary education to cultural and local needs;
and (iii) to expand and improve the targeting and efficiency of equity programs to ensure
that low income students and students at risk can access all education levels (preschool,
primary and secondary).

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Reduction of the education quality gaps in primary education in rural areas.

Pre-restructuring rating: Negligible              Post-restructuring rating: Substantial

44.    Previously, there was no assessment of learning outcome through a
standardized exam to measure quality in primary education in Costa Rica. Therefore,
the Project the graduation rate in primary education used as a proxy for quality. 8 Primary
education is universal in Costa Rica and almost all students complete 6th grade and
graduate. The graduation gap in rural areas improved at a higher pace than the national
level and it is remarkable to note that the graduation rate in rural areas is now better than
at national level. The existence of pockets of poverty at the periphery of major cities,
overcrowded class rooms and youth delinquency may explain the quality issue in urban
areas and this consistent trend. In the targeted areas the graduation rate improved from
87.9% to 89.1%; nevertheless, with about 5 percentage points the graduation gap with the
rest of the country remains significant, mostly because those areas still concentrate the
highest levels of poor, illiterate and marginalized indigenous population.

45.    The relative closing of the gap in rural area in primary education is
considered largely a result of the expansion of the equity and transfers programs
and the improvement of their respective targeting of low-income students (details
are in table 4 and 5 and the corresponding paragraphs). Therefore, the Project
contributed to foster access, participation and achievement of low-income students to
primary education through the improvement of the efficiency and targeting of
scholarships, transportation and food programs.

46.   In the targeted areas, the Project contributed to the improvement of quality
and graduation rates in primary education by improving the learning conditions

through: (i) the construction or rehabilitation of 63 primary schools; and (ii) the
provision of furniture and equipment for the schools to be fully functional. The schools
did not receive their computers but this was not detrimental to their functionality. In the
DRE of Sula, the Project financed the training of: (i) 129 primary education teachers for
teaching the new Spanish curriculum; and (ii) 23 primary education teachers and 3
advisors in intercultural teaching practices.

Reduction of the education quality gaps in secondary education within rural areas

Pre-restructuring rating: Negligible                 Post-restructuring rating: Substantial

47.     At secondary education level the quality gap in rural areas measured by the
percentage of students passing the “bachillerato” exam was slightly reduced from
9.7 percentage points to 9.5. The passing rate improved significantly in rural and urban
areas. In urban areas, the passing rate nearly reached the target of 70%. Yet with 60.3%,
the graduation rate in rural areas remained well below the 70% target, which was too
ambitious. The improvement is considerable in the indigenous territories and, specifically,
in the areas targeted by the Project due to a lack of school facilities offering the full
secondary education curriculum to prepare the “bachillerato” in 2006.

48.      The Project was instrumental to implement the MEP policy that transformed
Telesecundarias to Liceos rurales (as described in par.26). In 2006, there were 139
telesecundarias in rural areas providing a low-quality secondary education which failed
to provide the full curriculum to allow students to complete their “bachillerato.” In 2014,
they were replaced by 109 Liceos rurales (of which 25 were located in indigenous
territories) 9 providing the opportunity to students in rural areas to complete four years of
secondary education and to prepare for the bachillerato exam. Enrollment in Liceos
rurales tripled from 3,113 students in 2009 to 9,501 in 2013.

    In 2014 only 32 Telesecundaria remain.



                                                       16
49.     The Project contributed to the improvement of graduation rates at secondary
education level through: (i) the construction of 14 Liceos rurales (their enrollment is
growing fast and enrollments already exceed 120 students in 8 of them); and (ii) the
provision of furniture and equipment for all these schools to be fully functional. The
school infrastructure in the targeted areas was built to support a transformation process of
the educational model through collaborative networks that respect the autonomy and
cultural identity of the indigenous communities. The initial MEP infrastructure program
was fully achieved with the exception of: (i) three schools (Vesta, Sharabata, and
Jonkruhora) that were not built because of land and accessibility issues; and (ii) the
school computer laboratories were not equipped with computers because the procurement
failed, which was fortunately not detrimental to the schools’ operations.

50.     The Project contributed to the development of School Networks to promote
equity of access and quality of education in the targeted indigenous territories. The
14 Liceos rurales were put at the head of Networks of 66 primary schools. The Networks
were organized: (i) to foster a sense a community and cultural identity among teachers,
students and parents; (ii) to provide continuity in the educational process to increase
access to secondary education; (iii) to organize training and workshops; and (iv) to
establish common facilities (e.g. cultural and Art Centers or meeting rooms) for the
benefit of the entire network. The policy was fully implemented in 9 school networks,
including 41 schools from the DRE (Regional Directorate) of Sula, whose main activities
included the following: (i) organizing participative diagnostics in the 9 Liceos rurales to
identify main issues and make recommendations; (ii) developing a relevant pedagogic
model for the liceos rurales and multi-grade schools; (iii) building plans (“planes de
vida”) including objectives and indicators at short, medium and long-term; and (iv)
organizing about 30 workshops for teachers and advisors to develop the organizational
structure of the network and to install the intercultural pedagogic model and the
curriculum adapted to the indigenous context.

51.     The Project contributed to the quality of secondary education through the
financing of professional development programs for teachers and advisors. At
national level: (i) 1,697 teachers out of 12,854 were trained for the Liceos rurales; (ii) 76
national advisors and 375 regional advisors were trained and certified in a 60-hours
training about “Adapted teaching practices in an intercultural vision” to support teachers;
and (iii) 350 teachers were trained in the use of information technology for teaching. In
the DRE of Sula, the Project financed the training of: (i) 28 secondary level teachers in
the use of information technology to teach English; and (iii) 79 secondary level teachers
in intercultural teaching practices.

52.     To improve the quality of teaching in an intercultural context, the DEI
designed and carried out a vast program to collect, through a participative
approach, the traditions, customs and languages of indigenous cultures in Costa
Rica in order to adapt curriculum contents and elaborate didactic materials. Based
on this information and with the financing of the Project, DEI produced documents for
teachers, pedagogic advisors and supervisors that were disseminated through training and
workshops. The documents that were largely disseminated include: (i) strategy and



                                             17
methodology for the implementation of intercultural education and curriculum
(distributed to 105 teachers and advisors); (ii) three training modules of intercultural
education (distributed to 5,153 teachers, supervisors and advisors); (iii) video
documentary of the Battle of Sardinal and Trinidad 1856-57 (distributed to all 27 DRE to
be used for teacher training); and (iv) 4 pedagogic materials related to literature, tradition,
history and cultural events distributed to 200 teachers of the DRE of Turralbia. Some
pedagogic materials were produced for the direct use of the students, in particular four
manuals to teach English in an indigenous context that were produced, distributed and
used by 5,630 III cycle students. The full list of documents is in Annex 9.

Improve equity in the allocation of education sector resources.

Pre restructuring rating: Negligible Post restructuring rating: Modest

53.     Equity of access to education in Costa Rica, measured by the ratio between
11th grade enrollment and 7th grade enrollment, improved substantially. The ratio
increased from 34 % to 43.6% at national and surpassed the target set by the project. The
enrollment gap in targeted area was reduced from 13.4% to 9.2%. Equity measured by
the distribution of 13 to 17 year-old students (age group corresponding to secondary
education) by income quintile, showed the same improvement, particularly for students
from low income families (7.4 percentage points for Q1 students and 12.1 p.p. for Q2
students and 10.5 p.p for Q3 students). This last result is consistent with the fact that
there was a higher proportion of students from low income families in rural areas and
even more in the targeted areas.

54.     These outcomes were achieved through Government policy, which increased
investment in education considerably (between 2006 and 2011 the budget was multiplied
by 2.4 and the budget of education as a percentage of GDP went from 5.2% to 7.1%) and
translated into more school facilities, more teachers (teaching staff increase from 77,446
in 2007 to 88,548) and more resources for the equity and transfer programs.

55.   Equity in the allocation of educational resources improved though the
combination of: (i) a high concentration of scholarship distribution to 6-12 year-old


                                                    18
students toward the lowest income families 10(75% to quintiles I and II in 2010 and 76%
in 2013); (ii) a significant increase of the number of beneficiaries of scholarships (the
number more than doubled from 68,000 in 2006 to 164,311), transportation (70,075 to
102,623) and food (from 582,708 to 623,129): and (iii) an increase in FONABE
amounts of the different categories of scholarships (agreement N 153-13 of May 7 2013).
It is worth notice that the unit amount of scholarships received by indigenous students at
primary and secondary education levels is 50% higher than for other students.

56.    The Project contributed to the improvement of equity in the allocation of
resources of the equity and transfer programs through the development of a
targeting model, improvement in the allocation procedure and upgrade in the
management system. This was possible through the financing of studies in a five-step
process: (i) an analysis of the factors that have an impact on dropout and repetition rates
and the definition of an education vulnerability indicator for targeting a transfer program
that combines household ownership, access to technology, mother’s education level,
distance to school, minority group status, social risk, health conditions in the district,
school level in the district; (ii) the development of a model for calculating the cost of
equity programs, according to various efficiency and transparency criteria for adapting
them to regional and cultural patterns and for determining the budget needs according to
enrollment (the model was implemented by the MEP since 2010 for transport and since
2013 for food programs 11 ); (iii) the development of an integrated model combining
poverty index and education vulnerability for the scholarships (this model was used since
2012 by FONABE); (iv) the improvement of all the processes and procedures to manage
the equity programs, with an emphasis on delegating decision-making power to the


10
   The distribution of scholarships by income level is a proxy which measures only one dimension of the
equity issue. The Government “Equity Programs” were better targeted through three set of criteria: (i)
poverty level; (ii) education vulnerability (which include isolation and distance to the school); (iii)
individual specific situations (pregnant teen student, student at risk, indigenous student, handicapped
student). It does not fully reflect the improvement of the “fair”targeting of those programs to the ones who
need the most.

  The FONABE, (Fondo Nacional de Becas) Fund to finance the scholarships, is not directly administered
by the MEP.

Regional Directorate; (v) the development and implementation on July 2013 of a fully
computerized financial and accounting system (TCTE) that complements the SIGAF
(from the Ministry of Finance) to manage, allocate and control the equity and transfers
programs. The differences observed between 2010 and 2013 in the allocation of
scholarships by income level as results of the implementation of the new model seem
modest. However, more time and more detail analysis will be necessary to measure the
full impact of a more pertinent targeting on students who need the most. Finally, the
Project financed the training of 42 staff of the DRE in 2012 and 38 in 2013 to improve
the supervision and assessment of equity and transfer programs.

Improve efficiency in the administration and use of education sector resources. The
outcome is substantial.

Pre restructuring rating: Negligible                   Post restructuring rating: Substantial

57.    The administrative cost per beneficiary of managing the equity and transfer
programs was reduced 30% from 2006 to 2013 (from 10,855 to 7,013 CR colones).
While the number of scholarship beneficiaries at a national level increased by 240%, the
beneficiaries of transportation inputs increased by 46% and the beneficiaries of food
programs increased by 15%, the number of MEP administrative staff to manage these
programs remained about the same. The transfer of funds to school councils for
transportation and food increased from 31.611 million CR colones in 2006 to 81.076
million CR colones in 2013 and the transfers of funds to scholarship beneficiaries from
6.861 million CR colones to 28.320 million CR colones. The equity and transfer
programs represented 35.72% of the total 2013 education budget.

58.    The Project contributed to the improvement of the efficiency in the
administration and use of the equity and transfer programs through: (i) the
improvement of the allocation procedures and the enhancement of the management
information system (see par.56), which expedited and computerized system processes (to
leverage staff time and capacity); and (ii) the reorganization of the MEP and

3.3     Efficiency

Rating: Modest

59. The cost-benefit analysis performed for the restructuring (2011) provided a sound
basis to estimate the economic results of the operation. Based on the same assumptions
used in 2007, an updated of the economic analysis was carried out for the ICR using
actual data for the different variables (Annex 3). In terms of the cost benefit analysis, the
Project would yield a present value of net benefits, after investments, of US$15.1 million
and produce an internal rate of return (IRR) of 29%, compared with 51% at appraisal. In
terms of cost-effectiveness, the unit costs of school infrastructure were reasonable, taking
into account the high specificity of the indigenous territories, in terms of remote
locations, use of local materials and community involvement: cost by square meter of
school construction was an average of US$350 for wood and US$490 for cement
(“prefabricado”), in line with national benchmarking. From a fiscal point of view, the
additional recurrent maintenance costs as a result of Project investments in infrastructure
would represent approximately less than 1% of the Education Ministry Expenditures.
However, main outcomes will be highly dependent on maintaining recurrent allocations
for equity and transfer programs.
3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

60.     The Overall Outcomes uses a split rating to comply with ICR guidelines.
Relevance ratings are “substantial” for both pre- and post-2011 restructuring periods.
Design rating is “modest” before restructuring and “substantial” after restructuring. There
is no evidence of progress against original PDO indicators, therefore the efficacy rating is
“negligible” before restructuring; and “substantial” after restructuring. Finally, the
efficiency rating is “modest” for both periods. The combination of these partial ratings is
“unsatisfactory” for the pre-restructuring period and “satisfactory” for the post
restructuring period. In turn, the overall ratings for the two periods are weighted by the
disbursement percentages prior to and following the 2011 restructuring, yielding an
overall weighted rating of 4.1, equivalent to “moderately satisfactory.”

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

61.    The Project focused entirely on the indigenous population that is positioned
at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum and located in remote areas. The
project was relevant not only from educational perspective by providing new
opportunities at secondary level but also by helping disadvantaged students with food,
transportation and scholarships.


(b) Institutional change/ Strengthening

62. The main achievement of the Project was to establish the intercultural and indigenous
policy within the organization of the MEP and the education policy of Costa Rica.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

63.     The risk that the education quality gaps in Costa Rica’s primary and
secondary education levels would increase remains moderate: (i) with the significant
effort realized in rural areas to improve school facilities, to establish the liceos rurales


                                                  22
and to train qualified teachers and advisors the graduation rates in secondary education
should progressively reach the rates observed at national level like they did in primary
education; (ii) in the targeted areas and more broadly in the indigenous territories, the
trend should also be positive, the facilities built are sufficient to accommodate a strong
increase in demand at the secondary education level, the curriculum was adapted to
specific needs, the teachers trained in intercultural education practices and the
decentralized administration of Sula remains committed to the implementation of this
policy in indigenous territories. However, the dissemination of the books and
intercultural documents (produced by DEI) in 2014 and 2015 are subject to the
availability of a budget.

64.     With regard to the improvement of equity and efficiency in the allocation of
resources, the implementation of the model combining the poverty index and
education vulnerability, along with the corresponding established procedures will
ensure that the equity and transfer programs continue to target low income families.
However, the processes to monitor and control the use of the funds still need to be
improved. A proposal of a new regulatory framework has been submitted for consultation
at the end of 2013 and should be approved in 2014. Also, a consulting firm should be
contracted to produce the training materials to strengthen the School Councils. Despite
the expected change in administration during May 2014, MEP is likely to continue this
policy in rural areas and extend the policy initiated by the Project to the rest of the
indigenous territories.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

65.      The Project built on strong analytical work and included lessons learned
from several projects in Central and Latin America. It engaged the Borrower’s
attention related to the most socially disadvantaged communities and proposed innovative
approaches to increase local participation and to promote the role of civil society in
education. However, the Project had significant shortcomings: (i) it was too complex and
insufficiently clear to be implemented; (ii) its scope was too large and was insufficiently
targeted for the resources available; (iii) it invested in an education model
“Telesecundaria” that was inappropriate to improve quality and equity; (iv) the
implementation arrangement and responsibilities were insufficiently defined, given the
complex institutional situation; (v) the Results Framework required better alignment with
the PDOs and a set of monitoring indicators that would be more easily measured; and (vi)
the critical risks were not properly identified.




                                            23
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

66.     During the long period pending the ratification of the project, Bank’s team
maintained involvement in project support activities providing advice and technical
assistance to the PCU on fiduciary matters and to the MEP to ensure expeditious
implementation upon the Project’s ratification.

67.      The Bank ensured strong supervision despite the difficult conditions faced in
Project implementation. The Bank maintained a close relationship with the Ministry of
Finance to solve difficult issues. The presence in the field of an
infrastructure/procurement specialist greatly helped. The Bank provided candid and
realistic assessment of the Project’s situation in implementation status report (ISRs). The
Bank’s role was highly regarded by MEP authorities for its commitment to the objectives
of Costa Rica’s education policy as well as for its support and the useful solutions it
provided.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     Since the quality at entry is “moderately unsatisfactory” and the supervision
“satisfactory,” the outcome rating applies. Therefore, the overall Bank performance is
“moderately satisfactory.”

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

69.     The Government fully supported the Plan "Relanzamiento de la Educación
Costarricense" providing the resources to the education sector necessary to reduce
the rural-urban education gap. The Government provided counterpart funding,
corresponding to 40% of the total Project Cost. The Government fully supported MEP
policy to develop an intercultural education policy in indigenous territories. The Ministry
of Finance closely monitored the Project and worked proactively to solve controversial
issues with the Contraloría.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

70.    Overall, the MEP and PROMECE were able to carry most activities of the
Project to their full completion with the exception of three (the improvement of the



                                            24
capacity to analyze student learning assessment, the development of an information
system at school level and the piloting of the use of ICTs in rural education). Overall,
almost 20% of the funds of the Project were left undisbursed due to the problem with
Contraloría, but this was outside control of the implementing agency. However, MEP
and PROMECE were never able to reconcile their institutional issues. Moreover, despite
the strong leadership and commitment of the Minister, some technical units of the MEP
were not fully committed with the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

71. Since the Government performance is “satisfactory” and the implementing agency
“moderately unsatisfactory” the outcome rating applies.

6.     Lessons Learned

General application

72.     The risk analysis should be taken seriously. When a risk cannot be mitigated,
the activity should be either dropped or substantially modified. Experiences or good
practices from other countries can be transferred, provided two conditions are fulfilled:
(i) there is Government ownership; and (ii) a careful institutional analysis demonstrates
that the conditions for this transfer are favorable. It is extremely risky to carry out a
project with a participatory approach in a complex institutional context, particularly when
the project design does not define decision-making power regarding school investment
and contents of the subprojects to be financed. An in-depth restructuring that simplifies
the project, clarifying the components and targeting the investments, can be appropriate
to re-focus the project, improve the policy dialogue with the Government and mobilize
the staff around common goals.

Project specifics lessons learned

73.     In rural areas, it is possible to propose a pedagogical model and teaching
conditions for secondary education which provide the same opportunities to
children from low income families and promote equity. The participatory approach is
appropriate to adapt the curriculum to the indigenous culture and infrastructure to the
needs and local customs. 76. The environmental safeguards could be used as a tool and
framework to implement and monitor a National indigenous policy. Construction
processes through community participation or managed by a competitively-selected third
party can be effective and cost-efficient.

1.     The objectives of the Project are to: (a) reduce education quality gaps in the
Borrower’s primary and secondary education system in rural areas; and (b) improve the
equity and efficiency in the allocation, administration and use of the Borrower’s
education sector resources.

Component 1: Efficient and Equitable Access to Rural Education

Classrooms:

2.      The Project financed in the targeted areas : (i) the construction of 14 new Liceos
rurales; (ii) the construction or rehabilitation of 63 primary schools; and (iii) the
provision of furniture and equipment for all the schools. This corresponds to 236
classrooms of which 72% are new and 28% rehabilitated. (see table below) The initial
objectives were fully met at the exception of three schools (Vesta, Sharabata, and
Jonkruhora), which were not built because of land and accessibility issue.

School building facilities:

3.      The school infrastructure in the targeted areas was conceived as a process of
transformation to implement an educational model through collaborative networks in full
respect of the autonomy and cultural identity of the indigenous communities. Depending
on the condition of accessibility, three processes were used for the construction: (i)
community participation (the community build the school with the support of one
engineer) for 18% of the cases; (ii) work subcontracted/delegated to firms which manage
the entire process for 28% of the cases; and (iii) construction companies for 54% of the
cases. All the schools were fully furnished with furniture and equipment for class rooms,
teachers lounge, student dormitories, cafeteria, restrooms and kitchens. At the exception
of the computers that could not be procured. Some schools received solar panels to
provide electricity.

Common school network facilities:

4.       The 15 new Liceos rurales were put at the head of Networks of 66 primary
schools. The objectives were: (i) to foster a sense a community and cultural identity
among teachers, students and parents; (ii) to provide continuity in the educational process
to increase access to secondary education; (iii) to organize training and workshops; and
(iv) to put in common some facilities for the benefit of the entire network.

Regional Indigenous Education Directorate:

5.     The Regional Indigenous Education Directorate of Sula was constructed and
furnished. All DRE staff was trained.

Component 2: Improving MEP’s Institutional Efficiency

a. The development and implementation of an information system at school level

6.      The Project did not finance any activity to develop and implement a new
information system at school level. The two activities initially planned, consisting in
developing the software for an information system at school level and installing the
computer equipment and software necessary for information systems in the targeted
schools, were not completed. First, the technical specifications for the development of the
software were not finalized. The effort lacked coordination and failed to make the
specifications compatible with the existing information system PIAD 13, that was in the
development process, with various systems being used in the MEP departments
(essentially for the equity programs and for the financial management). Second, the
procurement process for computer equipment (contract of US$ 3.7 million) failed.
Following a complaint to the Contraloría General de la República (CGR), the contract
was not awarded due to a difference in Bank’s procedures and country procurement rules,
with the CGR favoring country rules that the Bank found unacceptable. Instead, the
DGEC (Directorate for the Management and Evaluation of the Quality) continued to
develop the PIAD with the MEP resources. Software was developed for all levels of the
education system and made available to all the schools. However, the computerized
student record system is used only in about 25% of the education system (it is estimated
that 70,000 teachers use it in about t 1000 schools out of 4,600); and only 38 secondary
schools use the PIAD system on line as a pilot. The main statistical data on the education
system are still not available to the users and to public on line. DGEC presented to MEP
in 2013 a US$1 million budget to develop the information system and make it universal
but this budget was rejected.

b. Improving the design and strengthening the management of MEP’s
Implementing Technical Units that administer the Equity and Transfers Programs.

7.      The following activities contributed to the improvement of the efficiency and
targeting of equity and transfers programs: (i) an analysis of the factors that have an
impact on dropout and repetition rates and the definition of a vulnerability indicators to
be used for targeting transfers program 14; (ii) the development of a model for calculating
the cost of the equity programs according to various efficiency and transparency criteria
for contextualizing them according to regions and cultural patterns and for determining
the budget needs according to enrollment (the model is implemented by the MEP since



13
  The PIAD (Programa de Informatización para el Alto Desempeño) was developed by the MEP since
1998 initially to register students.

14
  The vulnerability indicator combines 8 indicators: household ownership, access to technology, mother
education level, distance to school, belonging to a minority group, social risk, health condition in the
district, school level in the district.

2010 for transport and since 2013 for canteens) 15; (iii) the development of an integrated
model combining poverty index and education vulnerability for the scholarships (this
model is used since 2012 by FONABE) (iii) the update of all the processes and procedure
to manage the equity programs with an emphasis on decentralizing to Regional
Directorate; (iv) the development and implementation on July 2013 of a fully
computerized financial and accounting system TCTE complementing the SIGAF (from
the Ministry of Finance) to manage, allocate and control the equity and transfers
programs; (v) the training of 42 staff of the DRE in 2012 and 38 in 2013 to improve the
supervision and assessment of equity and transfers programs; and (vi) the consolidation
of all the equity programs and restructuring of all the services in charge of their
management under the responsibility of one Directorate (DPE) 16 . However, the
organization of the School Councils, the efficiency of the management of the funds
delegated to them and the processes to monitor and control the use of the funds still need
to be improved. A proposal of a new regulatory framework has been submitted for
consultation at the end of 2013 and should be approved in 2014 and a consulting firm
should be contracted to produce the training materials to strengthen the School Councils.

8.     The administrative costs per beneficiary of managing the equity and transfers
programs have been reduced by 30% from 2006 to 2013. While the number of
beneficiaries of scholarships at national level increased by 240%, the beneficiaries of
transportation by 46% and the beneficiaries of food programs by 15%. The transfers of
funds to the school councils for transportation and food increased from 31.611 million
CR colones in 2006 to 81.076 million CR colones in 2013 and the transfers of funds to
beneficiaries of scholarships from 6.861 million CR colones to 28.320 million CR
colones (the equity and transfers programs represent 35.72% of the total education
budget).

c. Strengthening and implementation of MEP’s institutional reform program at the
central and regional level.

9.      The Decree 34075 (November 5, 2007) that reorganized the MEP was
complemented by the Decree 35513 (September 25, 2009), which established the
guidelines for the decentralization in the Regional Directorates and their responsibility in
implementing an education policy which recognized cultural and ethnic diversity. With
regard to decentralization, the MEP implemented a communication plan in three steps: (i)
in 2011 and 2012 a diagnostic was carried out in six DRE (Alajuela, Grande del Terraba,
Peninsular, San Jose Central, San Jose Oeste y Sula) through surveys and workshops to
identify issues related to services to users; (ii) in 2012 the design of the communication
strategy; and (iii) the implementation in six Regional Directorates DRE (Heredia,
Cartago, Aguirre, Guapiles, Cañas, Santa Cruz, and San Jose Norte). This
implementation included: (i) a diagnostic of the DRE; (ii) the design and production of
communication materials for the DRE; (iii) the organization of three one day workshops
for a total of 320 participants dedicated to services to the client, executive protocol and
communication in a situation of crisis; and (iv) a one day training for 312 staff of the
DRE on communication strategy. This policy will be pursued in 7 regions in 2014 (with
MEP resources).

10.      With regard to intercultural education the Project gave the opportunity to the
newly established Department for Intercultural Education (DEI of 6 staff) to put in place
a full scale intercultural education policy including: (i) elaboration of contextualized
didactic materials to be used in workshops and trainings; (ii) organization of a series of
trainings for teachers and regional advisors to adapt curriculum contents and teaching
methods to the needs of indigenous community17; (iii) definition of infrastructure needs
and design of secondary schools through a participative methods to respect the
indigenous culture in the targeted areas; and the (iv) design, organization and
construction of the DRE of Sula entirely dedicated to education in the indigenous
territories.

11.     The subcomponent to improve the supervision process (definition of supervisors’
skills, normative, in service training of supervisors, supervision strategy) was not
implemented. Because the bidding process launched in 2011 was delayed and not
completed. However the Operation Manual for supervision was realized with MEP
resources. This activity will be completed internally by the MEP in 2014 with its own
resources.

12.     The MEP wanted to improve the organization to manage conflicts at various
levels of the education system. This activity was not realized because the bidding process
was not successful.

Component 3: Quality of Education

a. The development and implementation of a training program in intercultural
education for MEP staff at the central and regional level.

13.     In 2011, a unit “Departamento de Educación Intercultural” DEI of 6 staff was
established in the MEP (Decree N° 36451-MEP) to be in charge of the program
promoting intercultural education. (DEI substituted to the Department of Indigenous
Education). The DEI elaborated: (i) the program to develop intercultural education; (ii)
the content of all the training sessions; (iii) the documents and publications. This
program was not fully implemented and a small number of teachers mostly from the DRE
of Sula received a certified training. (see table below). All the advisers were trained to
support the implementation of the intercultural policy in indigenous territories.

through a participatory process.

b. A rural education quality improvement program adapted to the local and
cultural context

     (i) Improved model for rural secondary education

14.      The Project was instrumental to implement the MEP strategy to transform
Telesecundarias to Liceos rurales, a key policy to promote access and equity in the
remote rural areas with dispersed population. In 2006, there were 139 Telesecundarias
providing a low quality secondary education which failed to provide the full curriculum
allowing the students to get the “bachillerato” level 18 . On April 2009, the Higher
Education Council (CSE) approved the new curriculum of the Liceos rurales (April
2009) from grade 7th to 11th. The transformation consisted in: (i) implementing the new
curriculum with a minimum of 5 professors by Liceos; (ii) rehabilitating and building
schools infrastructure; (iii) appointing in each institution a Director and an administrative
staff; (iv) adapting the program contents to the context and providing specific books and
pedagogic materials; (v) increasing the number of scholarships available; (vi) increasing
enrollment in each institutions; (vii) a wage premium of 50% to attract teachers; and
(viii) providing energy, connectivity and computer equipment. To date: (i) there are 109
liceos rurales (of which 25 in indigenous territory) and only 32 Telesecundarias remain;
and (ii) enrollment in Liceos rurales tripled from 3,113 students in 2009 to 9,501 in 2013.

15.    The development of rural teaching methods that use ICT and the provision of
computer equipment and software for the purpose of putting into use these rural teaching
methods in all schools belonging to the Schools Networks under component 1 was not
implemented: (i) the contract with “Fundación Omar Dengo” ($400,000) to develop
teaching methods was not signed because the equipment were not purchased and there
was no agreement on some conditions; and (ii) the bidding process for computer
equipment and software was not finalized because of the legal issue with the
“Contraloría General de la República.” Provisions have been made in the 2014
education budget to complete this activity.

     (ii) Professional development programs for teachers assigned to rural areas

16.    Design and implementation of a teacher development program in the Regional
Direction of Sula. In the Regional Direction of Sula was elaborated, experimented and
implemented a comprehensive program to train all the administrative staff and teachers of


18
  The 2006 assessment by the MEP shows that “telesecundaria” schools: (i) provide only 8 and 9th grades
curriculum; (ii) lack of supervision from the MEP; (iii) have non functional and deteriorated facilities some
with no electricity and connectivity for the TV set; (iv) receive few support of books and didactic materials;
and (v) have less than three teachers per school, most of them without the right skills and profile for
secondary education.

the region in intercultural education in four topics (language, territory, world view or
cosmovisión, use of ICTs): (i) 175 teachers in primary and secondary education
organized around 6 networks in 3 three days workshops; (ii) 35 preschool teachers; and
(iii) 400 administrative staff of the region; (iii) 1697 teachers out of 12,854 (13.2%)
secondary education teachers were trained in intercultural education and the modality
“Liceos rurales.” In the targeted areas, 35 secondary education teachers were trained out
of a total of 545 (24.7%).

17.     Starting from scratch, the DEI initiated a vast program to collect, through a
participatory approach, the traditions, customs and languages of indigenous cultures in
order to renew curriculum contents and elaborate didactic materials. As a first phase,
most of the documents produced are for the use of teachers, pedagogic advisors and
supervisors and has been disseminated through training and workshops. The most
relevant are (i) strategy and methodology for the implementation of intercultural
education and curriculum (distributed to 105 teachers and advisors); (ii) three training
modules of intercultural education (distributed to 5,153 teachers, supervisors and
advisors); (iii) video documentary of the Battle of Sardinal and Trinidad 1856-57
(distributed to all 27 DRE to be used for teacher training); and (iv) 4 pedagogical
materials related to literature, tradition, history and cultural events distributed to 200
teachers of the DRE of Turralbia. Few pedagogical materials were produced for the
direct use of students. The most relevant are the 4 English language-learning manuals
tailored to an indigenous context, which were distributed and used by 5,630 III cycle
students. The target of the Project was met, but the main limitations for a larger
dissemination were time, capacity and budget resources. Five additional documents were
produced by DEI, but their dissemination in 2014 or 2015 is subject to budget
availability. The full list of documents is presented in the following tables.

c. Improvements in MEP staff and teacher capacity to analyze student learning
Assessments

18.     Very little has been done to improve the capacity of MEP staff and teacher to
analyze student learning assessment. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 seven trainings in the DRE
of Sula were organized in which participated a total of 399 teachers and 24 MEP staff in
the following topics: (i) regulation for repetition and drop out; (ii) integral process of
learning assessment; and (iii) assessment in first grade. But the new standard
methodology to analyze student learning assessment was not developed.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. The cost-benefit analysis performed for the restructuring (2011) provided a sound
basis to estimate the economic results of the operation. Based on the same assumptions
used in 2007, an economic analysis was carried out for the ICR using actual data for the
different variables. The updated economic analysis (EA) analyzes the following aspects:
(a) the Project’s overall economic evaluation including cost-benefit analysis; and (b)
fiscal impact of the Project. Since is this EA is based on actual data sensitivity analysis is
not presented.

2.       Project Interventions and Direct and Indirect Beneficiaries: The Education
Equity and Efficiency Project aimed to close the growing gap between rural and urban
education outcomes by financing the preparation of POA Activities in regions with low
education indicators, mostly rural, which include: (i) rural education access, (ii) teacher
staff development, (iii) pertinent pedagogical and academic modalities for rural contexts,
(iv) targeting and monitoring of impact of demand-based equity Projects, and (v) capacity
building of institutional actors involved delivering rural education services. Also, the
Project supports targeting of education demand subsidies and finances capacity building
strategies for institutions delivering rural education services. These interventions are
expected to have quantifiable benefits that guarantee a positive internal return on Project
investments.

                      Project Interventions Yielding Direct Quantifiable Benefits
                 Interventions                                  Quantifiable Benefits
     •   POA Activities                              • Reduced Repetition
     •   Equity Programs                             • Reduced Dropouts
     •   Improved Capacity and Efficiency of         • Increased Primary Education Completion

                                                         grade graduates

3.     Assumptions for Economic Analysis of Equity and Education Project. The
following parameters are considered relevant in estimating the economic benefits of the
Project: (i) the length of the Project horizon (2007-2013), (ii) the time of impact of the
Project in the students population, (iii) the size of the target population, (iv) the actual
patterns of repetition and dropout rates in rural population, (v) the average number of
years completed in rural areas; (vi) the existing patterns of errors of inclusion in the
education demand subsidies; and (vii) the existing cost structure in the Education sector.
Given the medium-to-long-term effect of the changes, the estimates presented in terms of
reduced repetition and dropout rates and improved targeting of the education demand
subsidies are conservative. Moreover, the analysis of the Project uses the following: (i) a
discount rate of 10%; (ii) enrolled students are based in actual data during 2005-2013
period.




                                                 38
Cost-Benefit Analysis

4.      Summary of Costs and Benefits. The criteria used to evaluate the economic
efficiency of the Project include Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal Rate of Return
(IRR). The preliminary estimations took in consideration two sources of direct benefits.
The first one is associated with the savings to the educative system from the reduction of
repetition rates in rural areas. The second source of direct benefits considers the
reduction in dropout rates that implies necessarily an amount of monetary resources
saved to the system. Unitary costs per student in primary education for rural areas were
estimated around US$616 and for the case of a student in secondary education the unitary
costs are estimated around US$1,003. Two new sources of direct benefits will include:
(i) savings generated by reducing the error of inclusion of education demand subsidies
(scholarship, bonuses, transportation and meals); and (ii) increased future earnings of 6th
grade graduates as opposed to non-graduates in rural areas.

5       The direct investment costs are distributed over an actual 7 year period (2007-
2013) and we made the assumption that the government will cover an additional recurrent
cost to keep the continuing of the benefits achieved after the final year of the Project.
This recurrent cost was assumed to be similar to the government investment realized
during the life of the Project. The direct costs ere US$55.1 million investment costs
associated with the Project. These costs would be incurred over the period 2005-2014.
Given the expected disbursement profile, the present value of the is US$31.9 million
when discounted with a ten percent discount rate.

6.      The ratio benefits/costs, considering the full cost of the Project, would yield
nearly US$1.4 of benefits for each dollar invested. The Project would yield a present
value of net benefits, after investments, of US$15.1 million over ten years and produce an
internal rate of return (IRR) of 29%.

Fiscal Impact of the Project

10.     The first step in the analysis for the Project sustainability was to establish the base
level expenditures prior to the implementation of the Project. After this evaluation,
calculations were made on the additional costs that result from this Project.

11. From a fiscal point of view, the total costs of the Project, including investment and
recurrent costs represent approximately less than 1% of the MEP expenditures, which
indicates that the implementation of the Project was highly viable though dependent on
maintaining recurrent allocations for equity programs and infrastructure maintenance.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
1. Introduction

1. The objectives of the Equity and Efficiency of Education Project, executed by the
Ministry of Public Education (MPE), are to: (i) reduce rural education quality gaps in the
Costa Rican education system; and (ii) improve equity and efficiency in the allocation,
administration, and use of the borrower’s education sector resources.

2. Despite design limitations and organizational problems, the Project outcome was
acceptable, as evidenced by improvement in systems that have a direct impact on equity,
with benefits being focused on the indigenous population but with national coverage and
by the significant improvement in the education model and conditions related to
education materials for priority indigenous communities, along with the positioning and
recognition of an indigenous education agenda, a situation that represents a qualitative
leap forward relative to the situation that existed prior to the Project.

2. Project Objectives, Design, and Implementation Processes

2.1. Project Objectives

3. The objectives set forth in the Project are based on very sound commitments of the
Costa Rican State.

   -   The education policy entitled “Quality Schools as the Central Element of the
       Costa Rican Education System” [El Centro Educativo de Calidad como Eje de la
       Educación Costarricense], ratified on June 30, 2008, which sets forth the
       importance of the intercultural education approach in the Costa Rican education
       system.
   -   The MEP’s institutional reform process, implemented by means of Executive
       Decree No. 34075-MEP of November 5, 2007, establishing a new administrative
       organization of the central offices. This reorganization (which was continued
       through subsequent partial reforms) strengthens the intercultural education
       strategy and converts the Department of Indigenous Education into the
       Department of Intercultural Education.
   -   During the Laura Chinchilla Administration (2010), the Superior Council for
       Education Consejo Superior de Educación (CSE) identified four major national
       education objectives: (i) promoting education initiatives that increase equitable
       access to high quality and relevant education and training opportunities; (ii)
       strengthening the overall development of students through a solid and well-
       rounded curriculum; (iii) strengthening the mechanisms used to link education
       and training opportunities with the needs of national and local economies; and (iv)
       guaranteeing transparency and strengthening education sector administration
       through greater administrative efficiency and the optimal use of resources.
   -   Under the “Jorge Manuel Dengo Obregón” National Development Plan (2006-
       2010), the MEP identified ten strategic work guidelines to improve the Costa



                                           45
       Rican education system and thus to contribute to the development of the country.
       Three of these areas are directly linked to policies involving access to education
       by the population groups most impacted by social inequality and the efficiency
       with which these policies are executed. They involve (i) guaranteeing the right to
       education through measures to promote equity that facilitate progress toward the
       achievement of universal coverage at the preschool, primary and secondary
       levels; (ii) ensuring that schools and the administrative divisions of the MEP have
       appropriate, adequate, and well-adapted infrastructure and equipment for the
       proper functioning of the education system and promotion of the overall
       development of students; and (iii) ensuring that, in their administrative dealings
       with the MEP, the treatment extended to students, educators, officials, and the
       education community in general is timely, appropriate, flexible, efficient, and
       considerate.
   -   In 2009, the MEP introduced an institutional reform program through Executive
       Decree No. 35513-MEP, aimed at enhancing the organizational structure of the
       MEP, the administrative management capacities of regional departments, the
       school supervision model, and promotion of intercultural education, all of which
       are fully consistent with the scope of the Project.
   -   The “María Teresa Obregón Zamora” National Development Plan (2011-2014) is
       aimed at achieving shared and inclusive development, undertaking activities to
       meet the needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged population groups
       (which include communities with low social development levels, with this
       phenomenon being most marked in indigenous territories), taking advantage of
       the institutional structure and existing resources, and expanding and diversifying
       the social support services available, that is, enhancing efficiency in the allocation
       and use of resources.

2.2. Project Design and Implementation Processes

4. There were significant weaknesses in the original design owing to the scope of the
goals and the complexity of the design.

   -   The objectives were not very realistic given the intervention timeframe and
       investment amounts. Consequently, there was no correlation between the actual
       changes expected (improvement in education in all rural areas of the country) and
       the interventions to take place (activities over a five-year period and with an
       investment of US$30 million, covering institutional reforms, curricula, and
       physical structures). Even under a scenario of full achievement, only some of the
       areas could have been impacted, with the effects being weaker at the overall level.
   -   Outputs, goals, and activities that were not defined or well calibrated, with unclear
       levels of authority (in terms of cause and effect) that raised questions regarding,
       inter alia, the rationale for and soundness of resource estimates and the
       identification of specific needs and demands, as well as the criteria related to
       viability and assessment.
   -   The foregoing explains the limitation in the results framework, which was
       reformulated following the mid-term evaluation. At that time, a number of


                                            46
       framework elements were adjusted although some, for reasons related to
       restructuring viability as well as the lack of a sound information and monitoring
       system to provide alerts on inconsistencies, remained unchanged.
   -   Design disconnected from the institutional situation. Under the Project, the work
       program and results framework designed did not, from the outset, take into
       account, the levels of interdependence required for execution. The disconnect
       began with the issue of the coordinating unit (PROMECE) which, by its mere
       existence, served to weaken the institutional framework, given that it was
       considered a unit, although structurally and functionally, it was at the same level
       as the MEP and had important legal capacity that provided it with a minimum
       level of deconcentration, although in reality this status was used by the unit and
       considered by administration and the World Bank as a status approximating
       decentralization.

5. This issue was partially addressed with the 2010 restructuring:

- The alignment between activities and the Government’s strategic priorities was
strengthened by addressing regional development disparities using a territorial
development approach that transcends geography so as to adopt a comprehensive vision,
with specific emphasis on the ethnic dimension.

- The educational model applied in rural areas was redefined with a shift from distance-
learning secondary schools (Telesecundarias), seen as a partial solution and as a way of
perpetuating inequity, inasmuch as it does not allow for completion of the specialized
education (ciclo diversificado) cycle, nor does it guarantee a well-rounded education or at
a minimum, an education comparable to the national average, to a liceos rurales (rural
high school) model, approved by the Superior Council for Education in 2009. This entails
the introduction of a broader pedagogical approach, focusing on three areas: (i) teaching
of core subjects; (ii) civic and intercultural education; and (iii) developing socio-
productive projects. In the indigenous territories, the liceos rurales model incorporates
local culture and links primary and secondary education by establishing a functional
linkage between the networks of the two, using a collaborative teaching model and
information and communication technologies.

- The administration was reorganized to align functions and positions with the
established standards, the institutional obligations of the PCU, and best practices in
project management, and to identify a general process that links the series of related
procedures (or specific processes) with the proper project implementation.

3. Project Results in Relation to Agreed Objectives

3.1. Project Development Objectives (PDOs)

6. On balance, the results obtained at project closing are satisfactory since the goals set
for the three project development objectives were met, although there were a number of




                                            47
weaknesses in the results and monitoring framework, as was noted and is reiterated in
this section.

   PDO1. Reduce quality gaps in project beneficiary areas

7. This objective is analyzed on the basis of the academic achievement of the student
population receiving secondary education. Specifically, it examines the successful
completion of this cycle by passing the national examinations to obtain a bachillerato
(high school diploma). This involves taking a national standardized test that assesses a
body of basic knowledge. Successful students obtain the bachillerato credential (along
with a grade point average earned in the last two years of education).

8. It is important to note that this indicator has not been monitored consistently, partly
because of shifting priority areas, which was not adequately reflected in the results
framework or in the monitoring system. For the current assessment, the historical series
was revised for the priority areas.

9. The national figures and those of the target area (school districts with direct project
intervention) for 2006 stood at 62.7 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively, with a
difference of 48.6 percent between the two. A positive trend can be noted, with a
significant reduction in the gap beginning in 2008, which averaged roughly 27 percent
(see diagram 1), compared to a stable trend at the national level. In 2013, the percentage
of students who passed the exam at the national level stood at 69.8 percent, while in the
priority area this figure was 40.5 percent, with a 29.3 percent gap between the two.

10. In other words, the indicator improved in both areas, with this improvement being
much greater in the priority area, thus reflecting a significant narrowing of the gap.

        PDO 2. Improve Equity

11. At the national level, the goal of the education system as a whole is to provide
universal secondary education, with the successful movement of students through the
system. The biggest challenge is in the rural areas and, even more so, in the indigenous
territories where there have been longstanding problems in terms of access and
opportunities for social, cultural, economic, and political participation by the population.
Recognizing the difficulties associated with the retention of students in the formal
education system, PDO 2 was defined as follows: Reduce the gaps in the secondary
graduation rate in the project beneficiary areas. In other words, improve the ratio
between the total number of students who enroll in secondary education and those who
complete the cycle, measured by a comparison between enrollment at the eleventh and
seventh grades nationally and in the Project beneficiary zones.

12. At the national level, the starting secondary graduation rate was 34 percent of
students. In the beneficiary areas, this indicator stood at 20.6 percent. There was a
significant gap, corresponding to low expectations of completion of the cycle. During the
intervention period, there were improvements in both areas—a rate of 43.6 percent was
registered at the national level and in the areas covered by the Project, this figure stood at
34.4 percent (see Diagram 2). The narrowing of the gap was greater than expected (a
narrowing to 12.5 percent was expected; this gap narrowed to 9.2 percent).

13. Under the Project, a reduction in per capita administrative costs was achieved in the
case of the beneficiaries of the MEP’s equity programs, which include scholarships,
transportation, and school meals programs.

14. This objective yielded positive results, given that the indicator improved—falling
from a base value of C 10,855 in 2009 to C 8,005 in 2013 (see Diagram 3). A general
improvement in the trend started in 2011, which is in part explained (as will be discussed
later) by the institutional improvements in the management of equity programs, which
benefitted the entire population, particularly the most vulnerable sectors.

15. This entails more efficient use of resources, so that they can be channeled toward the
effective provision of subsidies for student scholarships, transportation, and school meals
programs, thus reducing the amount provided to the organization for the provision of
these services. Expectations were exceeded in this area during the period and the trend
was very positive.

16. It should be also noted that there were problems in terms of the suitability of this
indicator relative to intervention results. In addition, there were a number of deficiencies
in determining attribution of the effect. This indicator already reflects a national trend;
however, it does not reflect the efficiency of equity programs in the priority areas.

17. Similarly, it should be borne in mind that equity programs entail a direct relationship
between the beneficiary and the central level of the MEP, without associated
administrative costs at the regional or local management levels and does not take into
account the work of school councils (Juntas de Educación y Administrativas), which is
unpaid. Consequently, no assessment is being done of whether there was in fact
improvement in the process that was targeted in the first place.

3.2. Intermediate Results

3.2.1. Component 1: Efficient and equitable access to rural education

18. The main achievements were as follows:

- The positioning and activation of the 15 school networks based on the recognition of the
relationship dynamics among the communities, primary schools, and secondary schools,
and taking into account the primary goal of improving the level of secondary education.
The school networks in Boca Cohen, Vesta, Katsi, Sepecue, Coroma, Palmeras, Roca
Quemada, Alto Quetzal (or Fila Carbón II), Térraba, La Casona, San Rafael de Cabagra,
Yeri, San Rafael Bajo Los Indios, Abrojo Guaymí – Montezuma, and Yimba Kaj were
provided with infrastructure and the basic operating resources.

- Construction or improvement of a total of 78 schools, among them 15 secondary
schools accounting for 18 percent of the work, with the remaining 82 percent of work
being done on primary schools. This entails a much greater level of achievement than
projected, not taking into account the inability to complete construction of three schools
(Vesta, Sharabata, and Jonkruhora) owing to access problems, which were compounded
by weather-related conditions. All told, investments were made in the construction or
improvement of 236 classrooms, 72 percent of which were new and 28 percent,
rehabilitated. The work was done using a community participation model in 19 percent
of the cases, a management firm in 28 percent of the cases, and a construction company
in 53 percent of the cases. All schools were furnished (with community contributions in
26 cases).

- Construction and furnishing of the Sulá Regional Education Directorate (DRE) and of
the six administrative districts in Suretka, Amubri, Sepecue, San Gabriel, Gavilán, and
Namaldí.

- Furnishing of schools via the Ethics, Aesthetics, and Citizenship (Ética, Estética y
Ciudadanía) program, by providing sporting and musical equipment to the 15 secondary
schools covered by the Project.

19. Implementation of this component was satisfactory. All the objectives were met or
exceeded, with the exception of the visual arts and computer equipment. The physical
layout of the spaces for instruction/learning directly benefitted a group of close to 5,000
students (71 percent at the primary level and 29 percent at the secondary level). In
addition, the activities under this component led to other benefits, such as (i) the
elimination of the gap in infrastructure access and quality among the indigenous
communities; (ii) responsible environmental and health management that takes
indigenous culture into account; (iii) designs that were done taking into account
community specificities and expectations; (iv) positive contributions to the community
economies on a micro level as well as job creation; (v) strengthening of collaborative
networks and social capital; and (vi) encouraging and legitimizing social participation
and project ownership.

3.2.2. Component 2: Improving MEP’s Institutional Efficiency

- Information system

20. During the first phase of project execution (2009), several steps were taken to
implement the Business Objects IT system, a series of organizational tools to improve
management through training, organization, and the dissemination of information related
to the operating environment, which strengthens decision making using as a basis up-to-
date and reliable information. The process was not continued as it was determined that
the system was unsuited to the institutional features and needs of the MEP.

21. At the same time, a process was started to design and identify the Education
Development Information System (Sistema de Información de Desarrollo Educativo
SIDE), establishing the High Performance Education Information System (Programa de
Informatización para el Alto Desempeño (PIAD) 19 as the basis for information. The
model made SIDE the umbrella system and proposed viewing the PIAD as a locally-
developed data input system (from schools). However, activities related to the
procurement of computer equipment and technical advice for implementing the PIAD at
priority area schools did not take place.

22. In light of this situation, the MEP has continued the process, with the assistance of the
Quality Management and Evaluation Directorate (Dirección de Gestión y Evaluación de
la Calidad DGEC), the entity responsible for coordinating the implementation and
institutionalization of the PIAD. In 2013, more than 1,600 schools (primary and
secondary) had adopted the PIAD, a figure that represents 32 percent of the total.

23. In conclusion, the Project’s limitation in the area of the development and
implementation of an information system is clear and, with a mere 15.47 percent of
primary schools and liceos rurales receiving IT equipment, the result is unsatisfactory.




19
   The PIAD was designed in 1998 as a registration platform and information system to support teaching
and administrative activities and to benefit the education situation (lower dropout rates and reduce the
effects of poverty) by automating processes and providing inputs for decision making and improved
management, using computer tools and updated and reliable information. The model entails recording data
on students and family of origin, participation in equity programs, performance indicators (success rates,
absenteeism, discipline, etc.), programming of courses and schedules, school output tables, and information
on staff (training and education levels, constraints) among other variables that impact both the education
system and results.

-   Support for the Units Executing Equity and Transfer Programs

24. The Project financed a series of consulting services designed specifically to
strengthen the processes and capacity of the aforementioned units and contribute to the
improvement of equity programs. It also aimed to promote a review and redefinition
process for the management framework of the school councils.

    •   Consulting services provided by Sanigest Solutions: in 2009, Sanigest Solutions
        obtained key information on the factors influencing student dropout and
        absenteeism and on the impact of equity programs in reducing these rates, by
        linking these indicators to the execution of activities and the resulting changes.
        The education vulnerability index (EVI) was designed to help anticipate the main
        factors associated with the probability of dropping out of school or academic
        failure at the primary and secondary levels. The EVI was used to design the
        integrated scholarship evaluation model [modelo integrado de calificación de
        becas MICB], which the National Scholarship Fund (FONABE) began using in
        2012 for the processing of new applications. This method is based on the
        integrated poverty measurement model (MIB), which facilitates the combination
        of several models, such as the Poverty Activity and the education vulnerability
        index.
    •   Consulting services provided by Comercio y Desarrollo S.A.: in 2009, this firm
        designed a model for calculating subsidies for the equity programs, addressing
        such areas as efficiency, rationale, comprehensiveness, transparency, specificities
        and contextualization, in accordance with cultural regions and norms, ongoing
        updating and linkages with financial systems, and regulation and oversight,
        providing added value in terms of legitimacy and sustainability. Implementation
        of the transportation cost model began in 2010, while the cost model for the
        student meal program was introduced in 2013.
    •   Consulting services on organizational analysis, updating and implementation of
        work processes: Pricewaterhouse Coopers (2011) contributed specifically to the
        development of the DPE’s target operating model, documenting processes and
        procedures and producing the manual of job positions and recommendations for
        ongoing improvement.
    •   Consulting services on management support: in 2012, Rocío López, a private
        consultant, created a needs map for automating school financial management for
        the Equity Programs in the short, medium, and long term, and prepared the terms
        of reference for the design of the system for the financial, accounting, and budget
        transactions of the School Councils.
    •   Consulting services provided by Proyectica S.A. (2012) y TCTE and Proyectica
        S.A. (2013): these consulting services produced an IT system that automated the
        allocation of resources for the meal program (PANEA) and the Student
        Transportation Program. This model needs to be completely overhauled in order
        to ensure the organization, efficiency, transparency, and oversight of the
        management of transfers, through the operation of these online processes, and
        careful and close coordination between the DPE and the Financial Directorate.



                                            53
-   Support for Community-Based School Councils

25. The Project provided for a process to strengthen the community-based school
councils. However the contract with the consulting firm was canceled. Owing to the
needs and opportunities identified (in the context of alignment with the institutional
reform of the MEP), a draft regulation was prepared and submitted for public
consultation in late 2013. This draft regulation resulted in a new General Regulation for
community school councils and is pending approval in 2014. It aims, among other things,
to clearly outline areas of responsibility, regulate the use of public funds, promote
accountability, and streamline processes.

26. Generally speaking, the strengthening of the Equity Programs Directorate was evident
during the Project execution process, as ratified by Executive Decree No. 38170 of
February 13, 2014 on the organization for the central offices of the Ministry of Public
Education, which repealed Executive Decree No. 36451-MEP of 2011 on the
administrative organization for the central offices of the Ministry of Public Education,
with a view to providing a coherent and coordinated regulatory framework based on
internal and context-driven changes. This paved the way for not only a programmatic
integration of the equity programs into a single directorate, but also for clearly defined
functions for the integrated management of the programs that had been disjointed and
uncoordinated in the past.

27. With respect to the strengthening of the equity programs, significant achievements
were made in the areas of institutional development, enhanced efficiency, and direct
impact on users:
    - Training was provided to eighty persons from the MEP’s Technical Units that
       manage the Equity and Transfers Programs, with a view to improving monitoring
       and evaluation of these programs. The target number of 600 persons, which was
       supposed to include representatives from the school councils, was not met, owing
       to the prior implementation of the regulatory reform process for the councils.
    - The trend regarding the number of beneficiaries of the MEP’s Equity and
       Transfers Programs is extremely positive: (i) the number of scholarships awarded
       increased from 68,453 to 164,311 (exceeding the target of 100,299); (ii) the
       number of persons receiving transport subsidies increased from 70,075 to 102,423,
       exceeding the target (93,424); and (iii) the number of meal program beneficiaries
       increased from 582,708 to 673,129, exceeding the target (656,000).
    - With respect to the amount of fund transfers through Equity and Transfer
       Programs: (i) the amount of the transfers to school councils (meals and
       transportation) increased from C 31,611 million to C 81,076 million, a partial
       achievement (89 percent) of the target set; and (ii) the value of the transfers to
       beneficiaries (scholarships) increased from C 861 million to C 28,320 million,
       achieving 73 percent of the set target. The cost models and improvements in the
       process demonstrated a more efficient use of resources, in a manner that ensured
       an effective increase in the number of beneficiaries, a streamlined costing and
       allocation system and, overall, a greater number of students receiving benefits




                                           54
       from the equity programs, which does not require a proportional increase in
       allocated funds.

Support with institutional reform

28. The MEP has been pushing for significant adjustments to the structure and processes
aimed at adapting the institution to serve the public interest, in accordance with
management criteria based on the principles of quality, efficiency, and equity. Executive
Decree No. 34075-MEP of November 5, 2007 established a new administrative
organization for the central offices of the Ministry of Public Education, which, among
other things, provides for the conversion of the Indigenous Education Department into
the current Intercultural Education Department composed of the Indigenous Education
Unit and the Contextualization and Cultural Relevance Unit. The process is later finalized
with the enactment of Executive Decree No. 35513-MEP of September 25, 2009, which
established the guidelines for the decentralization of regional directorates and their
responsibility in promoting intercultural education as a tool for contextualizing the
education policy, along with the strengthening and recognition of our society as
multicultural and multiethnic.

29. Among the various areas for action covered by the Project is the strengthening of the
operating management capacity of the Sulá DRE, through the preparation of assessments
and execution of development plans in the networks. It was also necessary to strengthen
the capacity of all of the country’s regional directorates in order to hone the skills needed
to perform the assigned functions, and thus generate the impact expected of active
education entities in the regions.          In this connection, a pilot organizational
communication and corporate governance plan was implemented. The range of topics
covered by the workshops organized to design communication strategies and support the
training plan included media management and information protection, voice management,
assertive communication and emotional intelligence, and customer service. A total of 312
persons from the regional offices of Aguirre, Cañas, Cartago, Guápiles, Heredia, Santa
Cruz, and San José Norte attended these workshops.

30. Under the MEP’s institutional reform program, a total of 632 public employees from
the regional directorates received training in communication and management and
customer service capacity building, in light of the empowerment strategy designed for
these directorates. This figure fell far short of the target of 5,170 public employees. Six
studies and several workshops were conducted, thus helping exceed the target (4).
Significant gains, which must be consolidated, were made in the management of the
school councils, and there was a repositioning and strengthening of the regional
education directorates, unpaid administrative counterparts with varying important roles,
in the education system in order to ensure the institutional efficiency of the MEP. The
Project’s contribution to the reform exercise was geared in principle toward equity
programs. However, in practice there was some degree of disorganization in the
processes and a number of execution discrepancies, attributable in large measure to the
fact that the design was not based on an adequate assessment of needs, resources, and
priorities, or on a comprehensive and dynamic vision of the processes.

3.2.3. Component 3: Quality of education

- Intercultural education training program for MEP staff at the central and regional
levels

31. The implementation of the Intercultural Course on Intercultural Education designed to
build the capacity of MEP staff (advisers) at the central and regional levels was
spearheaded by the Department of Indigenous Education (DEI). Several activities under
the Continuing Education Program in the DREs also received financial support from the
Project. In that connection, workshops and meetings for regional advisers (a total of 219
advisers trained) were conducted in the DREs located in Los Santos, Turrialba, Heredia,
San José Oeste, San Cruz, Nicoya, Liberia, Canas, and Sarapiquí. All told, 451 national
and regional advisers (63.4 percent) were trained during the period 2012-2013, which is
lower than the target set (100 percent).

- Rural education quality improvement program adapted to the local and cultural
context

32. Steady progress was made in the effort to convert distance education secondary
schools into liceos rurales. In 2006, there were 132 distance education secondary schools
and by 2013, this number had fallen to 32. As of March 2014, there are only 28 distance
secondary schools. The number of liceos rurales is increasing, jumping from 63 in 2010
to 109 in 2013. In indigenous territories, the conversion process is almost complete, as
only one distance education secondary school (Telesecundaria Villa Hermosa) remains in
the Grande del Térraba DRE. The number of liceos rurales in these territories increased
from 17 in 2010 to 25 in 2013. In 2013, new reforms for the system were approved,
thereby strengthening objectives, curricula, learning assessments, and socioproductive
projects, with a view to providing more opportunities to male and female students.

33. A new organizational structure of school networks and nuclear schools in school
districts in the Sulá DRE paved the way for the design of an education model that is
appropriate for liceos rurales and multigrade schools and uses ICTs, and includes the
core subjects and themes of history, language, the cultural knowledge and values of the
Bribris and Cabécares peoples, and generates development plans for each network. The
Keneblok Ñita/ Shkablö Ñara school network, Siwa Bla/Shkablö Kichá nuclear schools
and the Siwa Ka network’s development plan all took shape. Consequently, in the Sulá
DRE, implementation of the strategy is in the nascent stages in nine liceos rurales and 41
primary schools, that is, nine networks are being consolidated.

   -   This process involved the execution of the following activities between 2012 and
       2013: (i) introduction of participatory assessments in the nine liceos rurales in the
       Sulá DRE and theirs respective networks (Katsi, Yorkín, Namaldí, Boca Cohen,
       Coroma, China Kicha. Palmera, Usekla, and Alto Cohen); (ii) development of the
       draft education model relevant for the liceos rurales and multigrade schools; (iii)
       preparation of the development plans for the nine networks; and (iv)
       implementation of workshops for awareness building, training, and practical work
       for the development of an organizational structure and the operation of the


                                            56
         networks and nuclear schools, the use of digital technologies, and the
         implementation of education models (more than 16 teacher training workshops
         were conducted).
     -   In addition, 4,555 out of a total of 14,835 teachers received training in
         intercultural relations, accounting for 31 percent of the total provided for, thus
         demonstrating that while steady progress has been made, a large number of
         teachers still require training.

34. In terms of its overall scope, the liceo rural model has increased access to education
in dispersed rural areas and proved to be an attractive model for young people in these
communities. A steady increase in enrollment over the past five years attests to this fact:
total enrollment increased from 3,113 students in 2009 to 9,501 students in 2013. 20

35. The activity pertaining to the development of teaching methods using ICTs and the
provision of IT equipment and software to support this activity was not executed.
Therefore, outside the scope of the Project, the Technological Resources Directorate
conducted training activities in the use of ICTs for 350 teachers from the liceos rurales
and multigrade schools covered by the Project.

36. The MEP launched a consultative and participatory work process with a view to
identifying the ideal qualifications of teachers and their training and education needs. In
late 2013, the findings of the assessments were used to draft an Indigenous Education
Policy paper that included the teacher profile. The Indigenous Manual of Job Positions
was subsequently prepared and published in accordance with Resolution DG-151-2013 of
September 26, 2013. This profile was recognized as the basis by which contracts, training
plans and professional skills upgrading, as well as other institutional programs, which
strengthen the framework approach through sustained professional practice, are being and
will continue to be executed.

37. Institutional efforts are being coupled with teacher training plans at state universities.
A project entitled “Academic program for training teachers in cycles III and IV who work
in indigenous communities” was executed and involved the UNA, UCR, UNED, and the
MEP. The project runs from 2014 to 2017 and seeks to achieve the following (i) in the
short term, meet the main needs of teachers; and (ii) in the long term, design and
implement a university training process that leads to a university degree.

38. The final activity for improving rural education involved support from the Project to
generate materials for teachers and students, which support processes for awareness
building and training in intercultural education. More than 12 educational materials—

course modules, videos, history compendium, encyclopedias, textbooks, educational
strategy documents—with an intercultural perspective, were published and disseminated,
exceeding the target set (9).

- Improvements in the capacity to assess student learning

39. The Project provided for the hiring of a consulting firm to compile the information on
school performance in the project areas and design a teacher training strategy that abides
by the principles of intercultural education, thus transcending traditional models. The
activity was not executed, although during the project period several training activities
were conducted by IDP, using MEP resources, to at least partially meet needs in this area.
A total of 399 teachers and 26 administrative staff from the MEP received training in
2011, 2012, and 2013, at various workshops that covered such topics as (i) policies
governing promotion and repetition; (ii) technical delivery of the documents for the 200
[sic] National Assessment Plan; and (iii) learning assessment – a comprehensive process.

4.       Sustainability of the project components

40. In terms of the project’s scope, based on an increased integration of processes related
to the institutional agenda, it was established that all of the activities provided for have
basic sustainability requirements, contingent on the allocation of financial and human
resources to the MEP:

     -   The education policy and the programs generated give continuity and even
         strengthen commitments regarding rural education, and, specifically with
         indigenous communities, in a framework that was completely overhauled during
         the project period. This policy also provides better prospects for coordination with
         academic training and professional development bodies, which are gradually
         being integrated into the new approaches.
     -   Administrative organization, including reforms of existing and established
         procedures and manuals, is more consistent with an approach based on equity,
         interculturality, and inclusiveness as key factors for improving equity and
         efficiency in education.
     -   The strategy for intercultural education and the strategy for the development of
         liceos rurales include consolidated institutional bases, clearly defined roles and
         objectives, and a basic resource package. However, these efforts require sustained
         investments to maintain the necessary momentum, and, especially, make further
         progress possible. The risk lies in the possibility that, faced with a slowdown
         caused by a shift in priorities, the education agenda for rural areas and indigenous
         territories will lose momentum, and the units and programmatic activities will be
         retained, albeit under a basic and anemic operating system.
     -   The reorganization and strengthening of the Regional Education Directorates is a
         consolidated process that is underway, and will require subsequent follow-up that
         involves broad-based ownership and legitimacy. The outlook is favorable, given
         that the sustained provision of resources for operational and strategic management
         is the most important factor.



                                             58
-   The general suite of equity programs has been organized and streamlined, and has
    in particular improved their impact through costing and resource distribution
    mechanisms that are in line with other public administration systems, thus
    strengthening their legitimacy and increasing the possibility of their applicability
    in the future.
-   Investment in infrastructure is, without a doubt, the most complex component in
    terms of sustainability—given that, although a specific directorate is in place at
    the institutional level, this directorate is facing constraints with respect to
    financial and human resources and approaches—for ensuring the continuity of
    infrastructure projects as a part of a vision of educational development.
-   The size of the project portfolio being managed by the MEP, based on the demand
    for maintenance and new works, has historically exceeded institutional capacity,
    and this trend is unlikely to be reversed in the future. Particular attention and a
    commitment will be needed to ensure that investments made are adequately
    maintained and, despite the fact that an expansion of the Project-financed model
    is deemed unlikely, that the material base is sustained in accordance with the
    principles that governed the investment in the beneficiary communities.
-   The foregoing is contingent on continuity in the strategy to build the management
    capacities of the community school councils, which would boost institutional
    capacity, and include these councils among the key actors in the processes. The
    new Council Regulations, which are in the process of being approved and are
    underpinned by a consultative and participatory design process, are an important
    success factor that could boost sustainability expectations.
