                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation has improved over the last 6 months: Component 1 (school infrastructure in rural indigenous areas) is well underway now. Contracts worth about $10 million to build
                         58 new schools (47 primary and 11 secondary) have begun, including more than 20 schools already completed. With respect to Component 2, three key consultancies are in
                         progress with the objective of improving the management of equity programs, the management of administrative school councils and the organizational model of the equity programs
                         unit. It is expected that Component 3 is beginning implementation this year. However, progress towards the PDO and IP are still rated moderately unsatisfactory until a further
                         implementation and track record of progress toward the revised project indicators are consolidated.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project restructuring (third amendment) was completed by June 29, 2001. The major changes to the Project and rationale are: (i) revisions to Project components to align Project

                         activities to current Government strategic priorities, including the elimination of some activities which overlapped with other activities and to more logically regroup similar activities; (ii)
                         changes to the Results Framework in order to reflect the proposed changes to the components, and introduce indicators that better reflect Project objectives and outputs,
                         modifications in the components, and are measurable through Ministry of Public Education (MEP) databases and include baselines; (iii) changes to the Project Coordination Unit
                         (PCU) -- the Education Quality Improvement Program (Programa de Mejoramiento de la Calidad de la Educacion) (PROMECE) -- to align it with broader changes in MEP and to
                         improve Project management and coordination; (iv) updated environmental assessment template and guidelines, inclusion of the screening criteria within the Operational Manual to
                         ensure that resettlement impacts per OP/BP 4.12 are screened out for all subprojects, and updating of the Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) to document the Project#s
                         approach and work with Indigenous Peoples. The Project in itself comprises the elements of an Indigenous Peoples Plan; (v) changes to the categories of expenditures that are
                         financed out of loan proceeds so that the categories are aligned with the revised Project components, and changes to the percent of expenditures that are financed out of loan
                         proceeds; (vi) an 18 month extension of the closing date in order to help ensure sufficient time for revised targets to be met.
