Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The final implementation support mission prior to project closing in October 2014 confirmed that all remaining works and project activities under the
 Second Additional Financing were due to be fully completed with suitable quality and the project would, therefore, close as planned on October 31,
 2014. The the overall quality of works was determined to be high. Some minor problems were observed and remedies were agreed upon with ARIS and
 the construction supervision firm. The technical team concluded that overall that structural safety and soundness was met by all 18 structures financed
 under the Second Additional Financing. The Bank team and ARIS discussed plans to continue conducting inspections during the
 defects and liability period, which lasts for one year from the time each facility was commissioned. It was agreed that ARIS
 engineers and the owner would perform detailed inspections at approximately six and 11 months from the date of commissioning.
 During these inspections, any defects will be noted and the responsible party (i.e., contractor or owner/community) will be
 indicated. The mission had detailed discussions on the development and execution of an operations and maintenance (O&M)
 strategy for the implemented facilities. As a result, the Bank engineer, ARIS technical team, and the construction supervision
 firm’s manager developed a preliminary draft O&M strategy, which includes a detailed outline of routine and periodic
 maintenance needs as well as a timetable for implementing the activities. As per Bank procedures, an Implementation
 Completion and Results Report will be completed in collaboration with the counterpart within six months of the project closing
 for all activities that have taken place under the Second Village Investment Project.
